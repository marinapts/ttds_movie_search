00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:34,176
Resynck: Xenzai[NEF]

2
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:44,184
My name is Dalton Russell.

3
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:46,944
Pay strict attention to what I say

4
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:50,863
because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

5
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:53,952
I've told you my name. That's the "who."

6
00:00:55,414 --> 00:00:59,198
The "where" could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

7
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,990
DALTON: But there's a vast difference

8
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:04,787
between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.

9
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:07,918
The "what" is easy.

10
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:13,421
Recently I planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

11
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,098
That's also the "when."

12
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:20,855
As for the "why,"
beyond the obvious financial motivation,

13
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,397
it's exceedingly simple.

14
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:25,985
Because I can.

15
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,692
Which leaves us only with the "how."

16
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:32,991
And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

17
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:35,744
lies the rub.

18
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:55,141
So, your mother tells me about

19
00:04:56,694 --> 00:05:00,857
a certain young lady who's helping you
with the Triborough Bridge project?

20
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,983
- Okay?
- All right, okay.

21
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:05,066
He's crazy.

22
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:12,281
- Now? On 51st? 50...
- CHAIM: Yeah, that's where he is right now.

23
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:16,421
He's on 40, he... No, he's still on 47th Street,
but it's a much smaller space.

24
00:05:16,505 --> 00:05:18,249
HAMMOND: What do I have to...

25
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:23,508
Yeah, we'll get lobster.
L'll put it on Mr Ansinori's card.

26
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:27,545
Whatever. It's a meeting
with one of his clients or something.

27
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:32,388
Because it's been like over a year now.
Yeah.

28
00:05:35,357 --> 00:05:37,682
I want to snap this guy's neck,
I swear to God.

29
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:42,149
NANCY: So what?

30
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:46,983
So what? They're flowers.
They could've been to his grandmother.

31
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:49,948
They could've been to me.
It's my birthday, so...

32
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:54,325
Okay, so maybe it's a client's.

33
00:05:55,794 --> 00:05:56,873
(NANCY CHUCKLES)

34
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:59,163
Okay. This is funny.

35
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:03,254
I got this guy in front of me
that thinks I don't see him looking at me.

36
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:06,593
Fantastic. God damn it.

37
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,257
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

38
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:10,923
Can you lower your voice
just a little bit, please?

39
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:13,935
You're getting a little loud on your phone.
Please.

40
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,265
Yeah. Fine.

41
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:17,098
I don't want you
disturbing the other customers.

42
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,435
- Sorry.
- All right?

43
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:20,434
- Yeah, you got it.
- Thank you.

44
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:24,152
It was a security guy.

45
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:27,442
I didn't know I was in a library.
It's a fucking bank.

46
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:29,111
Manhattan Trust.

47
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:36,115
...from Yale.
And this fucking rich prick I work for.

48
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:41,750
Thank you.

49
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:55,725
Excuse me. Sir?

50
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,135
DALTON: Easy.

51
00:06:57,605 --> 00:07:00,689
Everybody get down on the fucking floor!
Now!

52
00:07:00,775 --> 00:07:02,269
(ALL SCREAMING)

53
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:04,313
STEVE-O: Get down on the ground!

54
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:08,235
DALTON: You have four seconds!
Anyone still standing gets shot!

55
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:11,741
One! Two! Three!

56
00:07:11,827 --> 00:07:15,492
STEVE-O: Back away from that counter!
Get your hand away from that button!

57
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:18,657
Put your hands on the floor! Now!

58
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:20,578
Oh... What the... What is this?

59
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,995
- Todd, what are we gonna do?
- What the fuck do you want me to do?

60
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:25,164
- STEVE-O: Keep your head down, fat man!
- All right!

61
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:27,713
DALTON: Get your fucking face on the floor!

62
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:33,347
You get the same treatment
as everyone else, Rabbi.

63
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:34,887
Get down.

64
00:07:36,018 --> 00:07:37,097
(CHAIM GRUNTS)

65
00:07:39,313 --> 00:07:42,267
Now, my friends and I are making

66
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:45,062
a very large withdrawal from this bank.

67
00:07:45,486 --> 00:07:49,732
Anybody gets in our way
gets a bullet in the brain.

68
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:54,322
Lie down, old man!
Put your fucking hands down!

69
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:57,862
- DALTON: Get your face on the floor.
- MAN: All right, I'm down! I'm down!

70
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:03,919
Hey, Officer,
there's smoke coming out of there.

71
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:20,181
Possible 10-30. Manhattan Trust.
20 Exchange Place.

72
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,061
I have got hostages.

73
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,099
You fucking cops come near this door,
I start killing people.

74
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:28,316
I not fucking kidding, man.

75
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,319
Central. Give me an 85.

76
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:38,154
Back up, sir! Back up! You!

77
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:39,621
- MAN: Shit!
- Back up! Back up!

78
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:41,248
Stay around the corner!

79
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:43,290
Central, give me an 85.

80
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:45,618
Perp with a gun. Possible hostages.

81
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:48,997
I repeat, possible hostages.
20 Exchange. Manhattan Trust.

82
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,750
Baby, I'm fighting for my life over here.

83
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:53,796
Keith, every time we have this conversation,
it's the same thing.

84
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:55,131
- "Not now."
- Listen. Listen.

85
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:57,379
Do you know what kind of thin ice
I'm on right now

86
00:08:57,473 --> 00:08:59,513
with this cheque-cashing thing?
They want to lock me up.

87
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,807
If this $140,000 doesn't show up
somewhere soon,

88
00:09:01,894 --> 00:09:04,136
- things gonna get rough for me.
- But you didn't take it.

89
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,982
Of course I didn't take it, baby.
It's just some lying drug dealer

90
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,975
trying to save his own ass
by fucking me over.

91
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:10,812
- Eventually, it'll go away.
- Then what?

92
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:13,145
- What about us?
- Then, you know, l'll make First Grade

93
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:16,074
and we'll have enough money
to buy a bigger place and then, you know...

94
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:18,946
Why we got to have this conversation
every time your brother gets locked up

95
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,954
- or gets caught stealing a car?
- He's the only family I've got.

96
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,948
All right, I'm sorry, baby. You okay?

97
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,666
- You still love me?
- I'm sorry, too.

98
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:27,329
- You still love me?
- I love you, baby.

99
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,542
All right. Big Willie and the twins for you
when I get home.

100
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,955
- I got the handcuffs.
- I got the gun.

101
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:33,543
Bye, Big Daddy.

102
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:36,887
- Big Willie and the twins, huh?
- That's correct.

103
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:40,838
Her lowlife brother, he's got three priors,
one for armed robbery.

104
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:44,183
17-year-old high-school dropout.
Doesn't have an honest bone in his body

105
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,555
and he's too fucking stupid
to amount to anything. Even as a criminal.

106
00:09:47,648 --> 00:09:49,973
- Can't you get rid of him?
- I could, couldn't I?

107
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,522
No, she loves him. What am I gonna do?
Put him out in the street?

108
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:54,189
- How's he feel about you?
- Oh, he's thrilled.

109
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,987
To have a detective
sleeping in the next room,

110
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:58,279
banging his sister.
Then she tries to bring it all back on me.

111
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:00,988
You know, "If we had a bigger place,
we wouldn't have this problem."

112
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:03,616
Of course, if we got married
then things would be different.

113
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:06,659
- And what's wrong with that?
- A wedding. Furniture. Kids.

114
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,209
You know what a diamond ring costs?

115
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:10,701
- Come on, man. You've been married.
- Please. I was 21.

116
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:14,247
- Yeah, but you give her a ring?
- Yeah, but she won't call me back.

117
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:17,377
- You guys cops?
- Oh, shit! He made us!

118
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:19,877
Christmas came early for you this year.

119
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:23,056
Bank robbery. Hostage situation.
20 Exchange Place.

120
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:25,264
- What?
- Grossman's on vacation. You're up.

121
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:28,021
What about the Madrugada thing?
The cheque-cashing thing?

122
00:10:28,104 --> 00:10:30,477
- I thought I was in the doghouse.
- I just threw you a bone.

123
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:32,273
As far as I'm concerned, you still work here,

124
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:34,565
- but if you don't think you're ready...
- No, no, he's ready!

125
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:36,277
Oh, good. Good.

126
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:38,901
I'm giving you a break, here.
Don't make me look like a fool.

127
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,564
- This is it, baby. The show!
- Yeah.

128
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,237
You got the call, man. God damn!

129
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:45,866
I guess I should be happy.
I might get to put off I.A.B.

130
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:47,913
Here's all you need to know.
You walk in unarmed.

131
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:50,751
Head bad guy puts a gun to your head
and makes you get on your knees.

132
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:53,540
You look around. There are five armed men
pointing Uzis at you.

133
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,172
Just picture them in their underwear.

134
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:56,834
How about orange jumpsuits and shackles?

135
00:10:56,925 --> 00:11:01,218
- There you go, Keith. You can do this, man.
- Look out, bad guys. Here I come.

136
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:27,117
COP: Get back around the corner!
Get back!

137
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:29,696
I told you, move it! Move it!

138
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,709
Get those people back!
Get them the hell out of here!

139
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:38,539
All right, guys, as soon as we pull up,
I want everybody out.

140
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,340
(SHOUTING)

141
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,717
The second floor window. Now.

142
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:46,014
- Let them in there!
- Let's go! Go now!

143
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:49,267
Sarge, what do you got?

144
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:52,056
I got a perp in the bank.
Possible hostage situation.

145
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,391
Who's on today? Who's your boss?

146
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,639
- Sergeant Hernandez. L'll get him over here.
- Get him down here.

147
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:58,140
- Sergeant Hernandez, you on the air?
- On the air. Go.

148
00:11:58,235 --> 00:12:00,987
Sarge, I got Sergeant Collins over here.
He called this in.

149
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:02,482
Can you come over to the other side?

150
00:12:02,573 --> 00:12:04,815
Redirect, on my way. Let's go.

151
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,126
COP 1: Back up! Go around,
around the corner.

152
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,503
COP 1: Pull back. Pull it back.
COP 2: We got to keep this secure.

153
00:12:21,592 --> 00:12:23,714
- Collins? What you got?
- Hernandez.

154
00:12:23,802 --> 00:12:27,966
I got a perp inside with a gun.
He claims he's got some hostages in there.

155
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:31,590
Everyone, heads up! Let's clear the way!

156
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:53,868
Let's go. Set them up. All right.

157
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:56,539
We've got it under control.

158
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,704
Step back, please!

159
00:12:58,795 --> 00:13:01,037
- Step back!
- Get back! Thank you.

160
00:13:01,131 --> 00:13:03,040
There's nothing going on.

161
00:13:03,258 --> 00:13:05,131
You'll see it on the news tonight.

162
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,878
Step back, please.

163
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:20,101
Mr Case?

164
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:22,860
Oh, good morning, Katherine.
What can I do for you?

165
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:26,147
Sir, there's a robbery in progress
at one of our branches.

166
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,437
Oh, my.

167
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,905
- Has anybody been hurt?
- I don't think so, but there are hostages.

168
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:34,371
Oh, how awful.

169
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:39,164
- Which branch is it?
- Number 32. 20 Exchange Place.

170
00:13:39,794 --> 00:13:42,249
- Which one?
- 20 Exchange Place.

171
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,668
Thank you, Katherine.

172
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,502
I'm sorry, Mr Case.

173
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:01,856
Oh, dear God.

174
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,981
Get these people out of here.
Come on, open these gates. Back up.

175
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:09,359
Up on the sidewalk. Come on in.

176
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:17,497
Sergeant Collins, first on scene.
Are you the hostage negotiator?

177
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:20,286
That's right. Detective Frazier.
This is Detective Mitchell. What do you got?

178
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,285
Not much.
Saw the bank was filled with smoke.

179
00:14:22,377 --> 00:14:24,666
The door was locked.
I tried to take a look inside

180
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:28,124
and one of the gunmen opens the door,
sticks a.357 in my face,

181
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:30,790
screaming in some foreign accent
about killing hostages.

182
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:33,638
- See any other gunmen?
- No, sir. I couldn't see anything at all.

183
00:14:33,722 --> 00:14:35,347
- You hear anything inside?
- No, sir,

184
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:39,595
but with that.357 sticking in my face,
I can't really be sure. I'm sorry.

185
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:40,974
Okay.

186
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,731
Good, good. Good, good, good, good.
You did a good job, Sergeant.

187
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:48,142
You ever had a gun
stuck in your face before?

188
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:49,316
- Yeah, once.
- Really?

189
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:51,148
Yeah, by a 12-year-old.

190
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:54,655
- What was that like?
- Not one of my better days.

191
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:56,819
I bet. All right, well, look.

192
00:14:56,912 --> 00:14:59,581
As soon as we get this thing cleared up,
we'll cut you loose, all right?

193
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:01,573
If you don't mind,
I'd rather hang around a while,

194
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,410
at least until we make contact.

195
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,660
That's what I like to hear, Sergeant.

196
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,431
What? Come on. Why you doing this?
Why you doing this to me?

197

to take your cell phones and your keys

- Peter what?
- Peter Hammond.

204
00:16:23,414 --> 00:16:26,865
- Where's your cell phone, Peter Hammond?
- I left it at home.

205
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:32,626
Peter, think very carefully

the bank has been robbed.

253
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,049
The suspect or possible suspects are inside,

of hostages.

Hey.

258
00:20:56,975 --> 00:20:59,301
You may remember,
we worked that hospital thing on 93rd,

00:20:59,394 --> 00:21:01,019
during my training?

260
00:21:01,104 --> 00:21:03,560
Oh, yeah. That was a real shame.

261
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:05,807
Yeah, it was. It was.

262
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:07,146
So, what do we got?

263
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:10,901
I got an unknown number of suspects
and an unknown number of hostages,

264
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:14,524
and a bank, and about a million spectators,
and I can't see shit inside there,

265
00:21:14,618 --> 00:21:16,326
- so I'm kind of busy.
- I understand.

266
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:19,081
The way this works, Mr Frazier,
is I deal with Mr Grossman.

267
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:21,453
So if you need anything,
you can speak with him, okay?

268
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,534
No, it's not okay, Captain.

269
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:26,118
Detective Grossman is away on vacation,

270
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:29,083
so Detective Frazier
is the big dick today, all right?

271
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:32,757
Now, if you need anything,
you can speak to me, all right?

272
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:34,219
I guess it'll have to be.

273
00:21:34,304 --> 00:21:36,593

- BERK: Yo!

275
00:21:38,016 --> 00:21:39,925
- Get these guys some vests!
- Okay.

276
00:21:40,018 --> 00:21:41,892
- And check them into the command log.
- Okay.

277
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:43,638
You know what?
I'm gonna get out of your hair

278
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,604
and let you get control
of this crime scene, okay?

279
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,932
You'll let me know when you're ready
with a detailed briefing?

280
00:21:48,026 --> 00:21:50,943
- Okay.
- We're gonna take a walk down to the diner.

281
00:21:51,237 --> 00:21:53,989
Don't go in the bank without calling us first,
all right? Okay?

282
00:21:54,073 --> 00:21:56,647
- All right.
- Good to see you, Captain.

283
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:06,786
Shouldn't we be in there?

284
00:22:07,462 --> 00:22:10,498
Let's give him some time. See what he does.
Come on.

285
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:13,957
Until he secures his position
and gets the physical layout,

286
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:15,250
he'll only dump on us.

287
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:17,717
If the show starts, he'll call us.
Trust me. I've seen him work.

00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:18,920
Your call, Keith.

289
00:22:19,015 --> 00:22:21,303
Can you get that for me?
I guess it is, isn't it?

290
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:23,183
That's the one thing I learnt
from Grossman,

291
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:25,511
is these guys don't have much respect
for what we do.

292
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:27,977
- How do you mean?
- Well, to them it's a tactical situation.

293
00:22:28,065 --> 00:22:32,193
Us being here means there's
a mental side to it that they don't get.

294
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:34,567
- Told you, you could handle this.
- Yeah.

295
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:38,024
I keep waiting for someone higher up
on the food chain to show up and say,

296
00:22:38,117 --> 00:22:39,232
"Here's what we do."

297
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:40,655
What happened at the hospital?

298
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:43,615

00:23:33,505 --> 00:23:36,956
- Come here, come here, come here!
- I work in the bank!

307
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,877
On your knees! Down on your knees now!

308
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:40,511
- They sent me out here!
- Now!

309
00:23:40,595 --> 00:23:42,387
- They sent me out here!
- Now!

310
00:23:42,472 --> 00:23:44,180
- He said stay away!
- Cuff him.

311
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:46,721
If you come near the bank,
he'll throw out two dead bodies!

312
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,719
- Who said this? Who?
- I don't know who!

313
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:50,222
The guy with the big fucking gun!

314
00:23:50,313 --> 00:23:52,021
- That's who!
- All right, get on your feet. Let's go.

315
00:23:52,107 --> 00:23:53,565
- There's four of them in there!
- Come on.

316
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,812
Christ!

317
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:56,146
- Calm down!
- Let's go!

318
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:59,605
- Am I gonna be on TV?
- Yeah. A big star. Let's go. Come on.

319
00:24:02,534 --> 00:24:05,949
Was it a time when I thought
I might not see my family again? Yeah.

320
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:08,706
Yeah, I thought about it.
I mean, at first, I wasn't...

321
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,197
It was too much to think about at that point.

322
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:14,293
You know, with a gun in your face,
but after a while I...

323
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:16,537
You know, I thought about...

324
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:19,712
Yeah.

325
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:22,636
My wife, you know,
not seeing my wife again.

326
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,097
My kids. I got a 10-year-old son,
17-year-old daughter.

327
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:31,851
Yeah, I thought about it, man.
What do you think?

328
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,348
Those are my babies.

329
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,221
(DOOR OPENING)

330
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:30,865
DALTON: Beautiful.

331
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:49,043
Go ahead.

332
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,423
Miss White, I want you to rest assured

333
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,351
my only intention is to spend time
in your wonderful city

334
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:56,227
and to enjoy all that it has to offer.

335
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:57,688
And no business with your uncle?

336
00:25:57,772 --> 00:26:00,061
In truth, I have very little
to do with him these days.

337
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,605
I'm told you haven't seen him in nine years.
Is that right?

338
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:06,229
- You are extremely well informed.
- I have to be. Yes?

339
00:26:06,322 --> 00:26:09,276
I have a Mr Arthur Case
on the phone for you.

340
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:12,234
We'll need to end this here.

341
00:26:12,328 --> 00:26:14,368
I'm gonna need
a copy of your purchase agreement,

342
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:16,532
your mortgage application,
and the other documentation,

343
00:26:16,624 --> 00:26:18,783
- and l'll be in touch.
- Thank you, Miss White.

344
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,620
Right this way, sir.

345
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:33,513
Arthur Case? You sure?

346
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,639
- That's what he said.
- He said his name, just like that?

347
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,052
It wasn't his secretary
saying he was on the line?

348
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:40,103
- No, ma'am.
- All right. Put him through.

349
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:41,268
Okay.

350
00:26:41,357 --> 00:26:43,100
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

351
00:26:44,694 --> 00:26:47,564
- This is Madeleine White.
- Miss White, I'm Arthur Case.

352
00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:49,114
Oh, good morning, Mr Case.

353
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:53,066
- Have we met formally?
- No, sir, I don't believe we have.

354
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:56,407
Yet, you're always turning up

355
00:26:56,497 --> 00:26:58,822
at my July 4th parties in Southampton.

356
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:03,579
Yes, we know some of the same people.

357
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:04,951
It seems.

358
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:07,253
L'll come right to the point.

359
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:10,636
I have a small problem
which requires someone

360
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:14,005
with very special skills
and complete discretion.

361
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:17,932
Are you such a person
or have I been misinformed?

362
00:27:18,644 --> 00:27:19,806
Go on.

363
00:27:20,562 --> 00:27:23,516
Can I pick you up in front of
your office building in five minutes?

364
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:25,896
- L'll be downstairs.
- Thank you.

365
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,941
They had a kind of genius plan

366
00:27:35,035 --> 00:27:37,526
for throwing us out of whack

367
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:41,998
and depriving us
of any kind of way of controlling ourselves.

368
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:44,160
They were... They were very

369
00:27:46,672 --> 00:27:49,756
insistent, and yet, strangely detached.

370
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:53,709
All I know is that they called each other
a variation of Steve.

371
00:27:54,262 --> 00:27:56,884
Steven, Steve-O, Stevie.

372
00:27:56,973 --> 00:27:58,171
And they called you what?

373
00:27:58,266 --> 00:28:00,259
They didn't call me anything.
They just told me...

374
00:28:00,352 --> 00:28:03,436
You're lying to me. Tell me the truth, now.
You're lying to me.

375
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:05,348
Tell me the...
Look at me and tell me the truth.

376
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,061
They had AK-47 s out. Four of them.

377
00:28:08,151 --> 00:28:09,894
- You know a lot about guns.
- No.

378
00:28:09,986 --> 00:28:12,940
- I don't know anything about guns, except...
- But you know they had an AK-47.

379
00:28:13,031 --> 00:28:16,067
- Everybody knows what an AK-47 is.
- Everybody?

380
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,073
Anybody who's ever watched
a decent action movie would.

381
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:22,784
- You ever rob a bank before?
- Are you kidding?

382
00:28:22,874 --> 00:28:25,543
Me rob a bank? No.

383
00:28:25,752 --> 00:28:27,791
- Never stole a dollar?
- Never.

384
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:30,168
- Never?
- Not ever.

385
00:28:30,256 --> 00:28:33,341
- You know what?
- That one time. That one time, that one time.

386
00:28:33,426 --> 00:28:36,877
I stole a nickel
from my grandmother's pocketbook once.

387
00:28:38,556 --> 00:28:40,050
She was Polish.

388
00:28:40,725 --> 00:28:44,972
I used to go up to her and say,
"Mama, toh nicklah, toh nicklah."

389
00:28:46,606 --> 00:28:51,102
One day, I opened her pocketbook
and there was a nickel.

390
00:28:51,194 --> 00:28:52,569
I took it.

391
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:55,068
That was the only thing I ever took.

392
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,745
Look, Detective, I didn't mean
to give you a hard time back there.

393
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:03,987
Forget about it. What's the story, Captain?

394
00:29:04,081 --> 00:29:07,830
Well, the hostage they let go
was Herman Gluck, 73.

395
00:29:07,918 --> 00:29:10,291
He was having chest pains.
Paramedics have him.

396
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:13,914
They told him to say
that if any cops came near the door,

397
00:29:14,008 --> 00:29:16,297
they'd throw out two dead bodies.

398
00:29:16,385 --> 00:29:20,252
He thinks there's four perps.
Says they came in dressed as painters.

399
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:23,679
There's a video system in the bank.

400
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,684
We're working on getting a download

401
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:29,138
from Manhattan Trust's
central security office, but it'll take a while.

402
00:29:29,231 --> 00:29:32,600
We got the block locked up.
I got men in the windows.

403
00:29:32,693 --> 00:29:35,398
We're checking on the sewers with D.E.P.

404
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:36,768
What about the phones?

405
00:29:36,864 --> 00:29:40,778
Cut and diverted into M.C.C.
We're the only ones they're gonna call.

406
00:29:41,034 --> 00:29:45,577
Cell phones are monitored
and we can jam the air whenever you say.

407
00:29:45,664 --> 00:29:48,867
But we like to leave it clear
in case a hostage is able to get through,

408
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:51,117
but so far nothing.

409
00:29:51,628 --> 00:29:54,119
- 911?
- It's up on the screen.

410
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:57,250
Any call about a bank
gets routed straight to us.

411
00:29:57,467 --> 00:30:01,132
Well, that's my end of it, Detective.

412
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:03,385
Yeah.

413
00:30:04,516 --> 00:30:06,390
Yeah, I'm not calling them yet.

414
00:30:06,476 --> 00:30:08,054
Beg your pardon?

415
00:30:08,812 --> 00:30:10,436
Doesn't feel right yet,
you know what I mean?

416
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:12,396
I'm not gonna call him
and ask what I can do for him.

417
00:30:12,482 --> 00:30:14,226
Let's see what he does.

418
00:30:15,402 --> 00:30:16,730
Your call.

419
00:30:24,828 --> 00:30:27,449
Now, Mr Case, why don't you
let me explain to you how I work?

420
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,496
Please. That would be nice.

421
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:34,541
Well, you say that there are family heirlooms
inside your safety deposit box.

422
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:36,004
That's fine.

423
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:39,789
But in my experience, people like you
have people working for them

424
00:30:39,884 --> 00:30:41,343
that handle these kinds of things.

425
00:30:41,427 --> 00:30:44,345
And when they can't,
well, they don't call me.

426
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,222
Their people call me.

427
00:30:46,474 --> 00:30:49,510
So, immediately, I know
that there's something in that box

428
00:30:49,602 --> 00:30:52,936
that you don't even want
your closest aides to know about.

429
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,350
No problem with me.

430
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:59,569
You tell me I don't need to know
what's in that box and I don't need to know.

431
00:30:59,654 --> 00:31:02,524
But if you tell me
that it's a bunch of old baseball cards

432
00:31:02,615 --> 00:31:06,565
and I find out that it's the launch codes
for a nuclear missile,

433
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,370
then let's just say
we no longer have an agreement.

434
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:12,413
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

435
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:14,743
What's inside that box, young lady,

436
00:31:14,835 --> 00:31:17,540
has belonged to me
since before you were born.

437
00:31:17,713 --> 00:31:21,841
It's very valuable
and poses no danger whatsoever to anyone.

438
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:23,713
Except you.

439
00:31:25,554 --> 00:31:28,389
Okay. Well, first,
there are men with guns in there,

440
00:31:28,474 --> 00:31:30,265
so I can't guarantee any results. Agreed?

441
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:32,059
- Of course.
- All right.

442
00:31:32,144 --> 00:31:35,062
Now, what makes you think
that they want to rob your box?

443
00:31:35,147 --> 00:31:36,392
I don't.

444
00:31:37,566 --> 00:31:41,184
Well, why don't you tell me
how you would like this to end?

445
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:47,774
I'd prefer that nobody
ever touch my safe deposit box.

446
00:31:48,077 --> 00:31:50,864
Not them, not you, not the authorities.

447
00:31:50,954 --> 00:31:53,789
And the sooner this situation ends,
the happier l'll be.

448
00:31:53,874 --> 00:31:56,579
- Is that specific enough for you?
- No.

449
00:31:59,171 --> 00:32:01,128
The contents of that box

450
00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:05,418
are of great value to me.

451
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,843
So long as they remain my secret.

452
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,804
And if they're exposed?

453
00:32:19,775 --> 00:32:21,767
L'll face some difficult questions.

454
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:25,193
- So, it stays locked or it disappears.
- Precisely.

455
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,569
- Can you make that happen?
- Yes.

456
00:32:27,657 --> 00:32:30,991
I hope so.
I have to say, I can't help but be sceptical.

457
00:32:31,077 --> 00:32:33,995
Whoever gave you my number
got the same deal.

458
00:32:34,164 --> 00:32:36,868
Clearly, they must have been satisfied.

459
00:32:44,758 --> 00:32:45,920
Steve?

460
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:48,128
It's time for Steve-O.

461
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:57,977
I came out here to take a look
at the perimeter they laid down.

462
00:32:58,062 --> 00:32:59,438
Guess what I found?

463
00:32:59,522 --> 00:33:02,938
That hostage they let out said these guys
came in dressed like painters, right?

464
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:04,105
Yeah.

465
00:33:14,412 --> 00:33:15,989
Probably stolen.

466
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,618
Have them run it and check it for prints.

467
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:26,005
- Everybody on?
- Yep, I'm there.

468
00:33:27,008 --> 00:33:28,716
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

469
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:40,143
- Sure you got the right number?
- Absolutely.

470
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:52,191
Okay. Nothing yet.

471
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:56,197
We got video.

472
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:57,662
Let's have it.

473
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:02,414
FRAZIER: What happened to that camera
right there?

474
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:04,826
ROURKE: Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

475
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:10,335
FRAZIER: Yeah, there it is.
That guy right there.

476
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:13,711
It's like he blinds the camera
with the flashlight.

477
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:16,342
It's weird, isn't it?
It's like nobody else sees it.

478
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:19,219
- You'd think it'd be pretty bright, huh?
- It could be infrared.

479
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,432
- What's that?
- Infrared bulb.

480
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:24,516
See, humans can't see it,
but a video camera will pick it up.

481
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:26,599
He could knock out the cameras
without no one knowing.

482
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:27,890
FRAZIER: Right, right, right, right.

483
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:29,776
ROURKE: He knocked out
the cameras about 10:00.

484
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:31,984
So, for approximately two minutes,

485
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:35,772
we got no evidence of people
leaving or entering the bank. That's great.

486
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:38,904
MITCHELL: Miriam, how long were you there
before it began?

487
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,490
It was just a few minutes.

488
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,747
Well, can you tell us what happened
after the explosions and the smoke?

489
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:48,127
They just told us to put our heads down.
And then close our eyes.

490
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:51,214
And then I just remember one of them

491
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:54,051
telling the others to just go down
and fix the cameras.

492
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:56,009
- The video cameras?
- I don't know.

493
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,053
Anything else you want to share with us?

494
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,254
No, just...

495
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:01,140
- You sure?
- Yeah, I...

496
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,304
Could you give us
the names of the bank robbers, maybe?

497
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:06,353
I'm just messing with you, sweetheart.

498
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,814
- You okay?
- Thank you.

499
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:08,978
Okay.

500
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,059
- It was pretty awful.
- Was it bad?

501
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,310
I mean, they made us strip.

502
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:16,360
They made us take off our clothes.

503
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:20,821
I don't understand why they had to do that.

504
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:22,406
I really just thought...

505
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:24,822
I thought I was gonna be killed.

506
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,662
Well.

507
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:30,829
- All right, my dear.
- Okay.

508
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:33,339
- I can go?
- No.

509
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:35,132
- No?
- No, you got to stay.

510
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,676
- You got to stay.
- No, you can go.

511
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,967
No, stay. No, go.

512
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:40,597
Did you rob the bank?

513
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:41,926
- You did.
- Did you rob the bank?

514
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,261
- No.
- You sure?

515
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:46,311
- BERK: There's movement at the front door.
- Let's go.

516
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,691
HERNANDEZ: Put down the fucking weapon!
VIKRAM: Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

517
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,650
HERNANDEZ: Don't move! Don't move!

518
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:56,017
COP: He's got a device on him there.

519
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:59,363
I said put your hands on your head
and get down on your fucking knees!

520
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,201
I said put your hands on your head
and down on your knees now!

521
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:03,697
COP: Hands are tied!
HERNANDEZ: Hands are tied.

522
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,910
- Jesus, pat him down.
- All right.

523
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:07,872
- VIKRAM: I'm one of the hostages!
- Careful.

524
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,333
HERNANDEZ: Easy, be very careful,
now. Easy.

525
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:10,829
SNIPER 1: I can't see him from where I'm at.

526
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,790
SNIPER 2: I can see him. I got a clear shot.
HERNANDEZ: Any weapons?

527
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:16,289
- Who are you?
- Vikram Walia. I work in the bank.

528
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,542
Okay. Vikram? Is this a bomb?

529
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,758
- Oh, shit! A fucking Arab!
- What? No. I'm a Sikh!

530
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,008
- Is that a bomb?
- No.

531
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,212
- Answer me, Vikram. Is this a bomb?
- No.

532
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:24,717
- Are you booby-trapped?
- No, fuck, no.

533
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,433
Okay, Vikram, I need you to relax.

534
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,139
- Jesus, give me a hand.
- I don't know.

535
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,269
SNIPER 1: Just watch.
There's a lot of movement in that bank.

536
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,815
- Team, take him down.
- Mike, now, get him.

537
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,310
What the fuck? Easy, easy.

538
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:37,153
Get off my... That's my turban. Get off. Easy.

539
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,656
Get... My turban!
Look, fuck, give my turban back!

540
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:42,069
Come on, shut up. Relax.

541
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,032
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me my turban back.

542
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,779
- You can't fucking rip my turban.
- Shut up, already.

543
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,033
- What the fuck?
- Come on, move it.

544
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,114
Get your fucking hands off me!

545
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,169
And the 11:00 and 12:00...

546
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:58,375
And don't forget about your 1:00
with Chancellor Joel Klein.

547
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,792
- Oh, Madge. What a day...
- Your Honour.

548
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,593
Madeleine! How are you?

549
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,252
I'm just fine, but thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

550
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,598
- Sure. Madge, are we through here?
- Yes, Mr Mayor.

551
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,643
This way, Miss White.

552
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:15,600
I always have time to put on a tux
and eat free food for a good cause.

553
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,519
Who are we saving this week?

554
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,354
Well, I'm doing a round of support

555
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,363
for the Joseph Freidkin Memorial Fund
for Spinal Cord Research

556
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,488
and we're having
our annual fundraiser next month.

557
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,533
If you could attend,
it would give us such a boost.

558
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:30,533
It would be my pleasure.
Is there anything else I can do to...

559
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,616
- What the fuck do you want?
- A favour.

560
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:37,541
- No shit. Which kind?
- The last one l'll ever ask of you.

561
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,289
That's the kind I had in mind.

562
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,922
You know about this hostage situation.

563
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,217
On my way. What's it to do with you?

564
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,427
All right, well, I need to keep an eye on it.

565
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,516
So, I want you to bring me down there
and tell whoever's in charge

566
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,594
to extend me every courtesy.

567
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,806
You're out of your fucking mind.

568
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,194
If it was easy,
it wouldn't square us, would it?

569
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,528
- It's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

570
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,773
You just have to call in a few markers,
that's all.

571
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,026
I may have to give out a few.

572
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,153
Then that's exactly what you'll do.

573
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,580
You're a magnificent cunt.

574
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,291
Thank you.

575
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:27,337
It's been a very tense situation
for several hours now.

576
00:38:27,429 --> 00:38:29,754
It's unclear how many hostages are inside

577
00:38:29,848 --> 00:38:32,256
and how many robbers
police are dealing with.

578
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,601
Officials say this all started out
as a robbery at Manhattan Trust,

579
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:38,558
but has turned into this hostage situation.

580
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,436
Negotiators are here on the scene,
working very hard

581
00:38:41,526 --> 00:38:44,196
and it's still unclear
on any possible injuries.

582
00:38:44,279 --> 00:38:46,521
Of course, we'll keep you up to date
with the very latest

583
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,532
and we will remain here on the scene
as this all unfolds.

584
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,527
That's the latest from here
in lower Manhattan.

585
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,371
Reporting live, I'm Sandra Endo.
Back to you.

586
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:57,373
VIKRAM: "Protect and serve" my ass.
Where's my turban?

587
00:38:57,876 --> 00:38:59,869
I'm not talking to anybody without a turban.

588
00:38:59,961 --> 00:39:03,046
It's part of my religion, to cover my head
in respect to God. I'm a Sikh.

589
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:04,412
MITCHELL: Okay, we'll find your turban.

590
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:06,796
Not an Arab, by the way,
like your cops called me outside.

591
00:39:06,885 --> 00:39:08,877
Now, no, I don't think you heard that.

592
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,295
There was a lot going on.
You were probably disoriented.

593
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:13,346
- I didn't hear that.
- I heard what I heard.

594
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:15,509
L'll give you all the information you want.

595
00:39:15,602 --> 00:39:18,472
I don't need this. I need my turban.
It's part of my religion.

596
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:20,603
- We'll get you your turban.
- We'll find it for you.

597
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,098
No, no, no. Not "get me."
I want my turban now.

598
00:39:23,193 --> 00:39:25,897
You just got to start thinking
about the people inside the bank now.

599
00:39:25,987 --> 00:39:27,066
It's a dangerous situation.

600
00:39:27,155 --> 00:39:29,562
You got to start telling us
about what's going on inside the bank.

601
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:32,065
We can talk about this later.
We'll get an officer to come down.

602
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,619
You can write a formal complaint.

603
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:36,075
But for now,
we got to deal with this situation.

604
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:38,203
First you beat me,
and now you want my help.

605
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:40,912
You need to start thinking
about your coworkers.

606
00:39:41,002 --> 00:39:44,585
I could apologise on behalf of the NYPD,
but that was not us. We are detectives.

607

- What do you want to know?

608
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:49,421

- I think there were about four.

609
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:53,259
- How many hostages?
- I don't know how many hostages, 20, 30.

610
00:39:54,682 --> 00:39:58,632
I'm fucking tired of this shit.
What happened to my fucking civil rights?

611
00:39:58,728 --> 00:40:01,598
Why can't I go anywhere
without being harassed?

612
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:03,895
I get thrown out of a bank.
I'm a hostage. I get harassed.

613
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:05,097
I go to the airport.

614

I can't go through security
without a "random" selection.

615

One jumbo jet with full gas tank

"and pilots at JFK,
parked at the end of runway."

621

They give us until 9:00 pm to do this,

622

- There's no plane. Maybe a bus. Maybe.

Till I talk to them, they get nothing.
Not even a cup of coffee.

For now, we wait.

627

what we're doing, okay?

628

- I'm Chairman, Board of Directors.

- Absolutely.

631
00:40:54,783 --> 00:40:57,452
Mr Case, how are you?
I'm Detective Frazier.

632
00:40:57,536 --> 00:40:59,908
Anything in particular
you think we should know?

633
00:40:59,996 --> 00:41:03,994
No. I just wondered
if I might be of some assistance.

634
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:09,128
- Have they made any demands?
- They want a jet.

635
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,418
Oh, I see.

636
00:41:13,677 --> 00:41:16,464
Would you like me to arrange one for you?

637
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:25,344
I'm so sorry. I must have misunderstood.

638
00:41:25,438 --> 00:41:27,846
That's quite all right, Mr Case.

639
00:41:28,525 --> 00:41:30,316
Where can we reach you
if we need anything?

640
00:41:30,402 --> 00:41:32,228
Well, those are my people in there,
you know,

641
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,191

And I won't disturb you.

for now, okay?

FRAZIER: Thank you very much.

- This way, sir.

- And thank you all so much.

All right.
Are we ready with the listening devices?

652
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:43,136
I'm gonna need 15 minutes
once we get the food.

653

Pizza's the best. No sandwiches.

FRAZIER: Are you for real?

655
00:42:47,311 --> 00:42:50,596
Well, if we send in, say,
10 pizzas boxes with transmitters,

656
00:42:50,689 --> 00:42:53,441
maybe we'll get some conversation
if we give them something to group around.

657
00:42:53,525 --> 00:42:55,482
Give them each a sandwich, it's hit or miss.

658
00:42:55,569 --> 00:42:58,238
They can move around
and I don't have 50 transmitters.

659
00:42:58,322 --> 00:43:00,445
- What's this?
- It's a digital recorder.

660
00:43:00,532 --> 00:43:02,608
You click it, and it'll record for half an hour.

661
00:43:02,701 --> 00:43:05,109
- James Bond shit.
- Well, you can get them on Amazon.

662
00:43:05,203 --> 00:43:07,694
- You gonna ask for a hostage?
- He already gave us one, didn't he?

663
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:09,865
I ask for another one,
he says no, then what?

664
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:11,785
No, he knows what he's doing.

665
00:43:11,877 --> 00:43:13,786
He gave us a hostage.
We'll give him some food.

and try to rescue us

- Great tits.

- Yeah, I saw her one time afterwards.

- I could see under the suit.

How?

This guy took off his mask
and was talking like he wasn't afraid.

"I don't have to wear this damn mask,"
you know?

So, they come in, pull him out of the room
and smack him around a little.

- You see him again after that?
- No.

I'm not gonna talk you out of it.

913
01:00:00,289 --> 01:00:03,705
Then there's also the matter of $140,000
that seems to have walked away

914
01:00:03,792 --> 01:00:05,619
from the Madrugada cheque-cashing bust.

915
01:00:05,711 --> 01:00:06,874
Oh, I see.

916
01:00:08,505 --> 01:00:10,794
Well, I had nothing to do with that.

917
01:00:11,592 --> 01:00:13,917
HERNANDEZ: Yeah, Collins, we got snipers
in the windows here.

918
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:16,680
We got guys in the building next door.
Guys up on the roof.

919
01:00:16,764 --> 01:00:18,887
We're trying to get the blueprints
for the bank

920
01:00:18,974 --> 01:00:22,723
so we can figure out the ventilator shaft.
Maybe we can come down.

921
01:00:26,064 --> 01:00:28,555
DALTON: Well?
FRAZIER: Is this the President of Albania?

922
01:00:28,817 --> 01:00:30,644
- Speaking.
- Pretty funny.

923
01:00:30,903 --> 01:00:33,903
- You shouldn't eavesdrop on people.
- Well, you better get used to it, pal.

924
01:00:33,989 --> 01:00:36,028
There's not gonna be much privacy
where you're going.

925
01:00:36,116 --> 01:00:37,231
You're damn right.

926
01:00:37,326 --> 01:00:40,410
This time next week,
l'll be sucking down pia coladas

927
01:00:40,495 --> 01:00:43,496
in a hot tub with six girls
named Amber and Tiffany.

928
01:00:43,582 --> 01:00:46,748
More like taking a shower with two guys
named Jamal and Jesus,

929
01:00:46,835 --> 01:00:49,408
if you know what I mean.
And here's the bad news,

930
01:00:49,504 --> 01:00:52,589
that thing you're sucking on,
it's not a pia colada.

931
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:58,959
- Maybe you like that kind of thing, huh?
- You really want to piss me off.

932
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:00,384
All right, here's where we stand.

933
01:01:00,473 --> 01:01:03,225
I don't need
your fucking status report, Serpico.

934
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:04,887
I tell you where things stand.

935
01:01:04,978 --> 01:01:07,303
- Sure, sure. I just meant...
- Here's where things stand.

936
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:09,224
You're getting me what I asked you for.

937
01:01:09,315 --> 01:01:11,189
You'll have it ready in the time I gave you

938
01:01:11,276 --> 01:01:14,561
or you'll sit by and you'll watch me do
just what I said I would do. Clear?

939
01:01:14,654 --> 01:01:16,481
Very clear.
I'm trying to get you what you want.

940
01:01:16,573 --> 01:01:18,364
But you got to understand this.

941
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:22,317
You know, it's not like the City of New York
has 747 s waiting around for days like today.

942
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:24,784
I understand that if you don't get
my plane ready,

943
01:01:24,873 --> 01:01:27,198
- then you might as well send a hearse.
- Please.

944
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:29,747
Let's focus on how we can both
get what we want, all right?

945
01:01:29,836 --> 01:01:32,243
Hey! You're not listening.

946
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:37,708
You get me what I want, I won't kill anyone.

947
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,337
All right. I'm on it. I'm on it.

948
01:01:40,972 --> 01:01:43,344
Let's just try to keep everybody calm, okay?

949
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:46,220
- Don't I sound calm to you?
- Yeah, you do.

950
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:50,475
FRAZIER: Yeah, you do.

951
01:02:44,534 --> 01:02:47,370
- So, Mr Damerjian...
- Damerjian.

952
01:02:47,454 --> 01:02:49,530
- Damerjian. Is that Albanian?
- Just call me Kenneth.

953
01:02:49,623 --> 01:02:51,865
- Kenneth?
- Is that Albanian or...

954
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:53,453
It's Armenian.

955
01:02:54,211 --> 01:02:55,835
What's the difference?

956
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,456
Detective, I was born in Queens.

957
01:02:59,382 --> 01:03:02,586
I've never been to Armenia, Albania.
I went surfing in Australia once.

958
01:03:02,677 --> 01:03:04,255
Can I have a glass of water?

959
01:03:04,346 --> 01:03:06,718
- Are you thirsty?
- My throat's parched.

960
01:03:06,806 --> 01:03:08,384
- I'm not nervous.
- Your throat's parched?

961
01:03:08,475 --> 01:03:10,218
- My throat's parched.
- His throat is parched.

962
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:12,848
- I just want a glass of water.
- Oh, shit!

963
01:03:13,396 --> 01:03:15,270
When you start telling us
what really happened...

964
01:03:15,357 --> 01:03:17,230
- I just want a glass of water.
- His throat is parched.

965
01:03:17,317 --> 01:03:18,941
- Here. You want some coffee?
- No, that's all right.

966
01:03:19,027 --> 01:03:20,272
- I don't drink that stuff.
- No, go ahead.

967
01:03:20,362 --> 01:03:21,524
Did you know they were robbing the bank?

968
01:03:21,613 --> 01:03:23,771
I didn't know they were robbing the bank
until they pulled a gun in my face.

969
01:03:23,865 --> 01:03:25,359
Is that why you held the door open
for them?

970
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:26,565
How do you know they robbed the bank?

971
01:03:26,659 --> 01:03:27,940
Because they pulled a gun in my face...

972
01:03:28,036 --> 01:03:29,364
That doesn't mean they were
robbing the bank.

973
01:03:29,454 --> 01:03:31,078
Did they take money?
Did you see them take money?

974
01:03:31,164 --> 01:03:34,782
I was in a bank and I was locked up
for who knows how long.

975
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:37,581
- Okay.
- Tied up in a room. I saw you see me.

976
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:39,046
You saw me see you?

977
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:40,458
- Is that what you just said?
- Yeah.

978
01:03:40,548 --> 01:03:42,920
I was locked up in the room.
You saw me gagged when you came in.

979
01:03:43,009 --> 01:03:45,630
Listen, I can't work miracles over here.
I'm gonna need more time.

980
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,507
Well, perhaps if you'd use the time
that I gave you more efficiently,

981
01:03:48,598 --> 01:03:50,092
you wouldn't be having this problem.

982
01:03:50,183 --> 01:03:53,267
- What do you want me to say?
- That my plane is ready.

983
01:03:53,603 --> 01:03:55,061
Okay, listen.

984
01:03:56,272 --> 01:03:59,937
I promise you, as God is my witness,
I'm working on it as hard as I can.

985
01:04:00,026 --> 01:04:01,769
It's just gonna take a few more hours.

986
01:04:01,861 --> 01:04:03,355
Why should I give you any more time?

987
01:04:03,446 --> 01:04:05,771
Well, it's simple. You give me more time,
you get what you want.

988
01:04:05,865 --> 01:04:07,941
You don't give me the time,
you don't get what you want.

989
01:04:08,034 --> 01:04:09,576
You got nothing to lose.

990
01:04:12,371 --> 01:04:14,494
Meanwhile, we'll send in some more food.

991
01:04:14,582 --> 01:04:17,369
I got a question for you.
You get it right, I give you more time.

992
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,998
- And?
- You know what happens if you don't.

993
01:04:22,006 --> 01:04:23,583
Which weighs more?

994
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,465
All the trains that pass through
Grand Central Station in a year,

995
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:32,714
or the trees cut down to print
all US currency in circulation?

996
01:04:33,309 --> 01:04:35,800
Here's a hint. It's a trick question.

997
01:04:38,522 --> 01:04:41,013
What the hell is that? Playing games now?

998
01:04:41,108 --> 01:04:42,271
It's the trains.

999
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:45,360
US money isn't printed on paper at all.
It's cotton.

1000
01:04:45,446 --> 01:04:47,070
- Yeah, I heard that.
- Yeah, that's right.

1001
01:04:47,156 --> 01:04:48,484
- Okay.
- So no trees were cut down.

1002
01:04:48,574 --> 01:04:51,029
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. 100% .

1003
01:04:51,243 --> 01:04:52,322
Okay.

1004
01:04:54,538 --> 01:04:55,818

- L'll call you back.

It's a trap. They both weigh the same.

1008

They both weigh nothing.

1009

They both weigh nothing
or they both weigh the same?

1010

He said, "Grand Central Station."

1017
01:05:32,617 --> 01:05:35,286
Grand Central Terminal is the train station.

1018
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:38,039

- Is the post office.

FRAZIER: Who's wrong?

1020

Perp One.
Trains don't pass through Grand Central.

1021
01:05:43,419 --> 01:05:44,795
It's the last stop for every train.

- What about the subway? They run through.
- Metro-North goes there.

1023

- How the fuck do you know?
- Metro-North goes there!

1024
01:05:49,801 --> 01:05:51,259
No. Metro-North starts there.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

- Deal is, he said, "Passes through."

Yeah, but the Metro-North goes up
there, though.

- No, no. How you doing?
- I'm doing okay. I'm doing all right.

1059
01:07:24,019 --> 01:07:27,719
Oh, I saw the Mayor on TV. He said
you're doing a great job. I saw you, too.

1060
01:07:27,814 --> 01:07:29,439
- You saw me on TV?
- Yeah.

1061
01:07:29,524 --> 01:07:32,015
- How'd I look?
- You looked good, baby. Real good.

1062
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:34,981
- All right, listen. I got to go.
- All right. Hey.

1063
01:07:35,196 --> 01:07:38,233
- Keep your head down.
- All right, I will. Love you.

1064
01:07:39,409 --> 01:07:40,607
Come on.

1065
01:07:43,538 --> 01:07:46,076
So, are we clear about the ground rules?

1066
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:49,543
- There's no need to worry, Detective.
- I get paid to worry, okay?

1067
01:07:49,627 --> 01:07:51,252
I just need you to look me in the eye

1068
01:07:51,337 --> 01:07:55,002
and make me believe that you understand
everything we talked about.

1069
01:07:55,091 --> 01:07:56,550
- I understand.
- Okay.

1070
01:08:01,889 --> 01:08:04,048
Someone here wants to talk to you.

1071
01:08:06,311 --> 01:08:07,805
- Hello?
- Who is this?

1072
01:08:07,937 --> 01:08:09,930
Let's not get into any names.

1073
01:08:10,023 --> 01:08:12,430
- What matters is what I can offer you.
- And what's that?

1074
01:08:12,525 --> 01:08:15,016
Well, if I can be assured
that certain interests are protected,

1075
01:08:15,111 --> 01:08:17,317
I might be able to help you get
what you came for.

1076
01:08:17,405 --> 01:08:18,650
I doubt that.

1077
01:08:19,782 --> 01:08:22,736
Tell me about these interests
that you are trying to protect.

1078
01:08:22,827 --> 01:08:24,487
Why don't you let me worry about that?

1079
01:08:24,579 --> 01:08:28,078
Now, what is it you were hoping to get out
of all this?

1080
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:30,248
- Rich, of course.
- Of course.

1081
01:08:30,334 --> 01:08:32,742
But you may have bitten off
more than you can chew.

1082
01:08:32,837 --> 01:08:35,672
- How?
- I can't discuss that on the phone.

1083
01:08:35,923 --> 01:08:37,999
- You work for the bank?
- No.

1084
01:08:38,634 --> 01:08:40,294
And you're not a cop.

1085
01:08:40,761 --> 01:08:42,090
That's right.

1086
01:08:43,806 --> 01:08:45,181
Come on in.

1087
01:08:52,398 --> 01:08:53,940
You got 10 minutes. No more.

1088
01:08:54,024 --> 01:08:55,768
If you're not out
before the lights come back on,

1089
01:08:55,859 --> 01:08:57,437
you can stay inside until this thing is over.

1090
01:08:57,528 --> 01:08:59,983
- You don't need to threaten me.
- That's not a threat, lady, but this is.

1091
01:09:00,072 --> 01:09:03,192
I know this game is a mile over my head,
but I'm telling you, if you fuck me over...

1092
01:09:03,283 --> 01:09:05,442
I got where I am by collecting friends,
not enemies.

1093
01:09:05,536 --> 01:09:07,030
Trust me, okay?

1094
01:09:07,871 --> 01:09:09,365
You're on your own.

1095
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:37,348
DALTON: What makes you think
I need help?

1096
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:40,892
MADELEINE: Well,
the hundred people outside, for starters.

1097
01:09:40,987 --> 01:09:42,316
DALTON: It's not a problem.

1098
01:09:42,405 --> 01:09:45,442
MADELEINE: And they're fuelling
your jet right now as we speak.

1099
01:09:46,326 --> 01:09:48,402
Come on. You're not that stupid.

1100
01:09:49,371 --> 01:09:51,162
Here's what I'm thinking.

1101
01:09:51,247 --> 01:09:53,821
If you give up now,
I can ensure that you'll serve the minimum.

1102
01:09:53,917 --> 01:09:56,075
I'm thinking three years,
four years at the most.

1103
01:09:56,169 --> 01:09:57,248
You can arrange that?

1104
01:09:57,337 --> 01:09:59,376
Well, you haven't hurt anyone
or stolen anything,

1105
01:09:59,464 --> 01:10:01,670
so yes, as a matter of fact, I can.

1106
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:05,171
- It's not good enough.
- Well, I wasn't finished.

1107
01:10:05,345 --> 01:10:08,262
When you get out, you'll have $2 million.

1108
01:10:08,556 --> 01:10:10,845
Will I? How?

1109
01:10:10,934 --> 01:10:14,100
We'll put it someplace safe and it'll be
waiting for you when you get out.

1110
01:10:14,187 --> 01:10:15,385
Thanks.

1111
01:10:16,189 --> 01:10:17,731
But no, thanks.

1112
01:10:17,815 --> 01:10:21,019
Oh, come on. I made you such a sweet offer.

1113
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:23,518
I really don't think you have much
in the way of alternatives.

1114
01:10:23,613 --> 01:10:27,562
Why don't you talk to me about these
interests that you're in here to protect?

1115
01:10:27,658 --> 01:10:29,366
- I'm afraid I can't.
- I can.

1116
01:10:29,452 --> 01:10:31,160
Let me tell you a story.

1117
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:37,994
During World War II, there was an American
working for a bank in Switzerland.

1118
01:10:39,211 --> 01:10:41,702
DALTON: Now, I don't need to tell you
that this period in history

1119
01:10:41,797 --> 01:10:44,715
was rife with opportunity
for people of low morals.

1120
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,508
People like this man.

1121
01:10:47,261 --> 01:10:51,555
He used his position with the Nazis
to enrich himself while all around him

1122
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,677
people were being stripped
of everything they owned.

1123
01:10:55,728 --> 01:10:59,725
Then he used his blood money
to start a bank.

1124
01:10:59,815 --> 01:11:00,930
Now,

1125
01:11:02,568 --> 01:11:05,688
does this sound like
it might be the man you work for?

1126
01:11:06,322 --> 01:11:08,943
Or am I just whistling Dixie out of my ass?

1127
01:11:09,575 --> 01:11:12,148
- I believe we understand each other.
- Good.

1128
01:11:13,662 --> 01:11:15,571
So, what the hell can you do for me

1129
01:11:15,664 --> 01:11:19,329
since I clearly know more than you do,
and I've planned this to perfection?

1130
01:11:19,418 --> 01:11:23,629
Believe me, if I need to,
I can change your entire programme.

1131
01:11:23,714 --> 01:11:25,790
So, the sooner
that you stop being my problem

1132
01:11:25,883 --> 01:11:29,382
and you start becoming my solution,
the better off you'll be.

1133
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:31,968
- What is it you want?
- Two minutes.

1134
01:11:32,055 --> 01:11:35,389
The safety deposit box room.
I just need to go to one box.

1135
01:11:37,227 --> 01:11:38,769
Looking for this?

1136
01:11:40,105 --> 01:11:42,975
This could be very embarrassing
to your employer.

1137
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:45,725
He should have destroyed this
a long time ago.

1138
01:11:45,819 --> 01:11:47,776
He didn't, so now it's mine.

1139
01:11:50,198 --> 01:11:53,152
Now, if the day ever comes
where I have to stand before a judge

1140
01:11:53,243 --> 01:11:55,117
and account for what I did here,

1141
01:11:55,203 --> 01:11:58,406
you and your boss
will do whatever it takes to help me.

1142
01:11:59,374 --> 01:12:01,782
You get out of here with that envelope,

1143
01:12:02,294 --> 01:12:04,452
and we'll pay you a lot of money.

1144
01:12:04,796 --> 01:12:06,076
L'll keep that in mind.

1145
01:12:06,172 --> 01:12:09,090
You're not gonna tell me how you're
planning to get out of here, are you?

1146
01:12:09,175 --> 01:12:12,378
I'm gonna walk right out the front door.
Anything else?

1147
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:15,140
- How did you know about all this?
- Doesn't matter.

1148
01:12:15,223 --> 01:12:18,639
Fact is, all lies, all evil deeds, they stink.

1149
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:22,435
You can cover them up for a while,
but they don't go away.

1150
01:12:22,522 --> 01:12:24,811
- Murder will out?
- Precisely.

1151
01:12:25,692 --> 01:12:28,017
Well, I still don't get what you're
doing here.

1152
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:29,190
Really?

1153
01:12:30,738 --> 01:12:31,853
DALTON: Good.

1154
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:37,400
So, we spoke.

1155
01:12:37,495 --> 01:12:39,203
Oh, no. You're gonna have to give me
more than that.

1156
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:40,948
- Let me have this window, fellows.
- Yes, sir.

1157
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,827
I told him that, well,
since he hadn't killed anyone,

1158
01:12:43,918 --> 01:12:46,872
it wasn't too late to surrender
and get off with a lighter sentence.

1159
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:48,042
And?

1160
01:12:48,756 --> 01:12:50,665
And that was basically it.

1161
01:12:52,009 --> 01:12:54,049
You know, I don't ordinarily get offended

1162
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:57,340
the first time somebody treats me
like an idiot, but you are pushing it.

1163
01:12:57,431 --> 01:13:01,014
Now, I know you did not go in there
to tell this guy something he already knew.

1164
01:13:01,102 --> 01:13:02,430
Talk to me.

1165
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:04,058
Look, Detective.

1166
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:06,637
Our arrangement doesn't include me
giving you a detailed explanation.

1167
01:13:06,732 --> 01:13:08,523
I say it does, okay?

1168
01:13:08,859 --> 01:13:10,270
Okay, you don't own me.

1169
01:13:10,361 --> 01:13:13,527
This cheque-cashing thing, this coke bust,
I can face that on my own.

1170
01:13:13,614 --> 01:13:16,152
I know what I did and what I didn't do.

1171
01:13:16,242 --> 01:13:18,697
- Talk to me.
- Off the record?

1172
01:13:18,786 --> 01:13:22,700
"Off the..." Everything about you
is off the record. Just talk to me.

1173
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,365
- Well, I gave him an incentive.
- Okay.

1174
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:29,545
- Did he go for it?
- No. But I'd say he's considering it.

1175
01:13:30,881 --> 01:13:32,541
He's smart, isn't he?

1176
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,507
- He thinks he is.
- Yeah.

1177
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:37,679
One of your types, like the Ivy League type?

1178
01:13:38,222 --> 01:13:40,891
- Clearly well educated.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1179
01:13:40,974 --> 01:13:43,050
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1180
01:13:43,143 --> 01:13:47,093
You talk like him, so think like him.
What do you think he's gonna do?

1181
01:13:48,774 --> 01:13:51,181
- Well, he's not gonna kill anyone.
- How do you know?

1182
01:13:51,276 --> 01:13:54,028
- Because he's not a murderer.
- How do you know?

1183
01:13:54,112 --> 01:13:56,271
I got news for you.
Most of the guys up in Sing Sing

1184
01:13:56,364 --> 01:13:58,072
weren't murderers
until they killed somebody.

1185
01:13:58,158 --> 01:14:02,156
You never know what a person will do
until you push him into a corner.

1186
01:14:02,412 --> 01:14:04,820
But it doesn't seem
like you've pushed him into a corner.

1187
01:14:04,915 --> 01:14:08,284
It doesn't, does it?
Seems more like he chose the corner.

1188
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,200
You're right.

1189
01:14:12,213 --> 01:14:13,756
So, you through?

1190
01:14:14,799 --> 01:14:17,088
- I guess. Are you saying I'm dismissed?
- Yes, I am.

1191
01:14:17,177 --> 01:14:19,798
You got a card, in case I need to call you?

1192
01:14:20,346 --> 01:14:23,264
Please don't take this personally, but no.

1193
01:14:23,433 --> 01:14:25,010
I don't think you can afford me.

1194
01:14:25,101 --> 01:14:29,051
Well, don't take this personally, Miss White.
Kiss my black ass, okay?

1195
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:33,442
Careful, Detective Frazier.
My bite's much worse than my bark.

1196
01:14:39,449 --> 01:14:41,525
- So, how old are you, Brian?
- Eight and three-quarters.

1197
01:14:41,617 --> 01:14:44,191
Eight and three-quarters. Big boy.

1198
01:14:45,413 --> 01:14:47,536
- Were you scared in there?
- No.

1199
01:14:47,623 --> 01:14:50,293
- No? Not at all, huh?
- Nope. I'm from Brooklyn.

1200
01:14:50,376 --> 01:14:51,954
You're from Brooklyn, huh? I understand.

1201
01:14:52,044 --> 01:14:53,752
- Guns don't scare me.
- They don't scare you?

1202
01:14:53,838 --> 01:14:55,249
- Brave, too, huh?
- Yeah.

1203
01:14:55,339 --> 01:14:58,791
So the guys that had the guns,
do you remember them saying anything?

1204
01:14:58,885 --> 01:15:00,758
- Yeah.
- What'd they say?

1205
01:15:00,845 --> 01:15:02,339
They asked me about my game.

1206
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:05,099
- Who did?
- The guy that robbed the bank. Duh.

1207
01:15:05,766 --> 01:15:07,474
Son, be respectful.

1208
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,311
Okay, Brooklyn.
But it... Was he the one in charge?

1209
01:15:10,396 --> 01:15:11,475
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

1210
01:15:11,772 --> 01:15:14,394
And you don't remember anything else?

1211
01:15:14,567 --> 01:15:16,109
He was kind of tall.

1212
01:15:16,902 --> 01:15:18,100
He had a mask.

1213
01:15:18,195 --> 01:15:22,145
Brian, you think you can recognise him
in any of these pictures?

1214
01:15:23,117 --> 01:15:25,406
Take your time. Have a good look.

1215
01:15:25,953 --> 01:15:28,658
Let's keep that over there. Just take a look.

1216
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:38,374
- With the mask, they look all the same.
- It's true.

1217
01:15:40,134 --> 01:15:43,088
With the mask, they all look the same.
That's right, Brian.

1218
01:15:43,178 --> 01:15:46,512
Attempted robbery. Liquor store.

1219
01:15:46,807 --> 01:15:50,342
Well, this was a real step up
for a small-timer like you, huh?

1220
01:15:50,978 --> 01:15:52,804
I got to hand it to you, Pablo.

1221
01:15:52,896 --> 01:15:56,431
First of all, it's Paul. Not Pablo, okay?

Excuse me.

- You want some gum?
- No.

And second, I didn't do it, all right?

1225
01:16:03,281 --> 01:16:05,772
What? I made a few mistakes
when I was a kid.

1226
01:16:05,867 --> 01:16:09,319
I was out with some friends
and they held up a liquor store.

1227
01:16:10,247 --> 01:16:12,073
What was I supposed to do?

1228

Where'd you grow up, you Wassa Wassa,
Park Avenue?

- Nothing.

Don't they look suspicious to you?

want to know who they are.

Hey, just out of curiosity
do you know anything about diamonds?

A bit. What do you need?

What do you think a guy like me
should pay for a diamond ring?

1244
01:16:47,325 --> 01:16:49,282
Depends. How many carats?

If you'd like, I could give you
my nephew's number.

- Underneath your painter's coat?

- What do you have on underneath?
- Clothing.

I'm saying that he wants
to give us more time. He makes demands.

He gives us deadlines. We stall.
Then he gives us more time.

You roll the dice and see what happens.

1357
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,912
COP: All right. Now get the bunker up.

1358
01:24:45,005 --> 01:24:46,997
- So, what's up?
- Got him right where I want him.

1359
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:48,253
Yeah? Where's that?

1360
01:24:48,342 --> 01:24:51,757
Right behind me with my pants
around my ankles, but it's a start.

01:24:51,845 --> 01:24:53,256
Jesus Christ.

1362
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:09,398
- What the fuck, man?
- How long?

1363
01:25:09,487 --> 01:25:10,946
- He got the drop on you!
- Two.

1364
01:25:11,031 --> 01:25:12,406
- How long?
- What if he saw your face?

1365
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:13,819
- Two.
- What if I didn't have my gun?

1366
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:15,652
Two, maybe three hours.

1367
01:25:15,744 --> 01:25:18,910
You know, you're letting this cop
get too fucking close.

1368
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,198
What happened?

1369
01:25:23,293 --> 01:25:25,166
I gave him every excuse
to blow my brains out.

1370
01:25:25,295 --> 01:25:26,409
Yeah.

1371
01:25:26,504 --> 01:25:29,589
He doesn't bite. Why? He ain't the type.

1372
01:25:29,674 --> 01:25:32,130
Let's just step back
and think about this for a second.

1373
01:25:32,218 --> 01:25:35,753
We know that they planned this whole thing.
The tape, the cameras, the costumes.

1374
01:25:35,847 --> 01:25:38,135
There was a game plan,
but it never included aeroplanes.

1375
01:25:38,224 --> 01:25:40,893
He's up to something but it ain't violence.

01:25:47,859 --> 01:25:50,266
- Excuse me?
- The camera on the truck.

1379
01:25:50,695 --> 01:25:53,316
Give me a close-up
on the second-floor window.

- Rourke?
- I'm on it, I'm on it.

What the fuck are you doing?

1386
01:26:26,605 --> 01:26:28,681
You mean beyond the obvious?

1387
01:26:28,857 --> 01:26:31,313
That's what I mean.
Come on, this ain't no bank robbery!

1388
01:26:31,402 --> 01:26:34,272
This is your fault.
I told you to get the buses.

1389
01:26:34,363 --> 01:26:37,779
Fuck you! I didn't kill anybody.

1390

of the longest days of your life.

it is you really want and l'll get it for you.

1393
01:26:49,294 --> 01:26:52,081
- I promise.
- I've told you. Two buses, a plane.

You planned every inch of this thing
right from the start.

You got everybody marching to your beat,
including me, and I'm through buying it.

1398

You're too damn smart to be a cop.

1399
01:27:09,648 --> 01:27:11,391
Now get the fuck out of here.

1400
01:27:11,483 --> 01:27:13,392

Do it. Shit, you got nothing to lose.

I damn sure ain't got nothing to lose,
so shoot me.

Do it.

1404
01:27:19,908 --> 01:27:21,900
- Shoot me.
- Fuck you.

Hey, Detective, this ain't your day.

How you doing, Captain?

1409

Look, I know you
put your trust in me and I just...

1410
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:12,959
Well, you're a good cop.
Frazier, I need more like you.

1411
01:28:13,044 --> 01:28:15,369
But if you're going down on this one,
I can't go with you.

1412
01:28:15,463 --> 01:28:17,040
You got to understand this, though, sir...

1413
01:28:17,131 --> 01:28:19,289
No, no, no. Let me just tell you
what my problem is, okay?

1414
01:28:19,383 --> 01:28:21,340
I go to bed, everything's hunky-dory.

1415
01:28:21,427 --> 01:28:23,799
I get a call at 3:15, and there's what?
A dead hostage.

1416
01:28:23,888 --> 01:28:27,054
- Right, right, right. But I can end this...
- It is ended.

1417
01:28:27,141 --> 01:28:29,050
See, you think I got options.

1418
01:28:29,143 --> 01:28:31,432
I got to answer to the Chief of D's.

1419
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,355
Darius is calling the shots on this. That's it.

Hey, Sarge.

1421
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:55,164
- What'd he say?
- That's it.

1422
01:28:56,503 --> 01:28:57,666
Shit.

1423
01:28:59,173 --> 01:29:01,842
DARIUS: It's a tactical nightmare.
COUGHLIN: I know.

1424
01:29:01,925 --> 01:29:04,962
Well, first, this is the only way in.

1425
01:29:05,053 --> 01:29:07,295
Then we got to make it up the stairs blind.

1426
01:29:07,389 --> 01:29:09,678
Once we get up there,
we're right out in the open.

1427
01:29:09,766 --> 01:29:13,978
DARIUS: They have the advantage of cover.
They can pick us off like sitting ducks.

1428
01:29:14,312 --> 01:29:17,847
Then if we make it across the floor
and down the stairs,

1429
01:29:17,941 --> 01:29:21,275
we still can't tell the homies
from the good guys until they shoot at us.

1430
01:29:21,361 --> 01:29:24,445
Even if it isn't rigged with explosives,
it's still a fucking nightmare.

watch the hands.

1436
01:29:51,724 --> 01:29:54,180
And let's not forget the possibility
of hostages being killed.

1437
01:29:54,269 --> 01:29:56,060
Right now! Put the gun down!

1438

1439
01:29:59,065 --> 01:30:02,398

is to separate them from the hostages.

01:30:02,485 --> 01:30:05,237
If we can get two or three upstairs
and take them out?

1441
01:30:05,321 --> 01:30:06,484
Kill them?

01:30:27,176 --> 01:30:31,885
Yeah, well, that's what's so nuts about it.
Anybody in a painter's suit could be a perp.

1445
01:30:32,014 --> 01:30:35,383
Maybe we should dress our guys up
like a bunch of painters.

1446
01:30:36,143 --> 01:30:40,188
And we should use rubber bullets.
Take head shots. Put their lights out.

1447
01:30:41,941 --> 01:30:43,601
ED: Not a bad idea.
COUGHLIN: Yeah.

1448
01:30:43,692 --> 01:30:45,685

1450
01:30:52,993 --> 01:30:56,243
they're going to dump this whole mess
in your lap, you know?

- I'm making First Grade.
- What?

1452
01:30:58,207 --> 01:31:01,457
I'm making Detective First Grade.
Things ain't all they appear to be.

01:31:01,543 --> 01:31:05,623
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Detective First Grade Keith Frazier.

01:31:05,714 --> 01:31:07,790
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Yes.

1455

Thank the Mayor
and our mystery guest for that.

Everybody's getting theirs.
I'm gonna get mine.

1460
01:31:23,398 --> 01:31:24,976
L'll be outside.

1461
01:31:30,822 --> 01:31:32,364
What a day, what a day.

1462
01:31:32,449 --> 01:31:36,363
Detective, they're gonna storm that bank
without you? It's not right.

1463
01:31:37,329 --> 01:31:40,698
So, tell me about the kid
who pointed the gun at you, the 12-year-old.

1464
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:42,415
- Now?
- Yeah.

1465
01:31:43,126 --> 01:31:44,869
Last year, up in the 33rd,

1466
01:31:44,961 --> 01:31:47,796
I was breaking up a fight
about a half a block from the high school.

1467
01:31:47,881 --> 01:31:50,586
This one little spic is getting
his clock cleaned by another one.

1468
01:31:50,675 --> 01:31:54,174
Do me a favour, Sergeant.
Just tone down the colour commentary.

1469
01:31:56,014 --> 01:31:58,256
So I bust up the fight,

1470
01:31:58,349 --> 01:32:02,014
I turn around
and this kid is pointing a.22 at my chest.

1471
01:32:02,103 --> 01:32:06,183
- Is that right? Now, which kid was this?
- Another kid, an African-American.

1472
01:32:06,274 --> 01:32:07,816
- An African-American, right?
- Yeah.

1473
01:32:07,901 --> 01:32:09,443
Came out of nowhere. I didn't see him.

1474
01:32:09,527 --> 01:32:10,642
So, what'd you do?

1475
01:32:10,737 --> 01:32:12,860
What did I do then?
L'll tell you what I did then.

1476
01:32:12,947 --> 01:32:16,150
I got shot in the fucking chest.
That's what I did then.

1477
01:32:16,284 --> 01:32:18,573
Yeah, so you'll pardon
my euphemisms, Detective,

1478
01:32:18,661 --> 01:32:22,244
but I would rather wind up an old bigot
than a handsome young corpse.

1479
01:32:22,331 --> 01:32:23,956
Now, no offence, Detective,

1480
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:26,497
but I'm just trying
to keep them away from us.

1481
01:32:26,586 --> 01:32:29,789
Now, what do you say we just
get these people safely out of the bank?

1482
01:32:29,881 --> 01:32:30,995
I hear that.

1483
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:34,210
And l'll try and watch
what I say in the future.

1484
01:32:34,302 --> 01:32:36,341
You never know who's listening.

1486
01:32:52,361 --> 01:32:53,606
Jesus. Shit.

1487
01:32:54,196 --> 01:32:55,774
They bugged us.

1488
01:32:56,323 --> 01:32:57,604
They bugged us.

Darius!

1490
01:33:03,289 --> 01:33:05,246
Darius, don't make a move!

1491
01:33:05,332 --> 01:33:07,124
- What?
- It's all fucked up!

1492
01:33:07,209 --> 01:33:09,202
Do not make a move! Keep your men back!

1493
01:33:09,294 --> 01:33:10,705
What are you talking about?

1494
01:33:10,796 --> 01:33:12,456
They heard everything we said in the M.C.C.

1495
01:33:12,548 --> 01:33:14,624
- What?
- Stand down! Stand down!

1496
01:33:14,716 --> 01:33:18,050
The drawer with the demands in it!
They heard everything we said!

1497
01:33:18,137 --> 01:33:20,462
They put a transmitter in it!
They bugged us!

1498
01:33:20,556 --> 01:33:22,465
No, no, no. I'm going in.

1499
01:33:24,059 --> 01:33:25,138
Shit.

1500
01:33:33,318 --> 01:33:34,812
Get everyone together.

1502
01:33:40,325 --> 01:33:41,784
They're coming in.

1503
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:43,701
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

1504
01:33:43,787 --> 01:33:45,826
All right! Everybody out!

1505

Captain, I'm telling you,
this thing is a mess.

They thought this one out, soup to nuts.

1631

So, lay it out for me.

1632
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:17,323
We photograph everybody
that came out of the bank.

1633
01:42:17,419 --> 01:42:20,254
We sit them down, we question them,
we show them the photos.

1634
01:42:20,339 --> 01:42:23,873
Most of them can't point to anybody
that's guilty of anything.

1635
01:42:24,551 --> 01:42:28,002
We ask them if they could recognise
anybody who was not one of the bad guys.

1636
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:30,718
Even if we considered someone
as a possible suspect,

1637
01:42:30,849 --> 01:42:33,554
there's one or two or three other people
that would rule them out.

1638
01:42:33,643 --> 01:42:35,019
It's like the thing never happened.

1639
01:42:35,103 --> 01:42:37,890
- What about prints?
- Everywhere. So what?

1640
01:42:38,773 --> 01:42:42,308
- All it shows is that these people were there.
- Alibis?

1641
01:42:42,402 --> 01:42:43,730
Just about everyone.

1642
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:45,694
Even if their alibi was weak,

1643
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:48,865
a hostage would identify them
as being one of the good guys.

1644
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:50,492
There we are, back to square one.

1645
01:42:50,577 --> 01:42:51,656
Priors?

1646
01:42:51,745 --> 01:42:55,160
We got one employee who had
some juvie stuff. One customer had...

1647
01:42:55,248 --> 01:42:56,363
Excuse me.

1648
01:42:57,083 --> 01:42:59,752
One customer had an out-of-state warrant
for child support.

1649
01:42:59,836 --> 01:43:02,753
Another one had a couple of priors,
G.L.A. Mostly.

1650
01:43:03,590 --> 01:43:06,544
Again, same problem.
Plus, he was a fucking idiot.

1651
01:43:06,634 --> 01:43:08,674
- Bank cameras?
- Useless.

1652
01:43:08,761 --> 01:43:11,169
I'm telling you,
they thought of everything. Almost.

1653
01:43:11,264 --> 01:43:13,553
- Sounded like everything to me.
- But this.

1654
01:43:13,641 --> 01:43:16,891
We haven't found that.357
or the perp that was holding it.

1655
01:43:16,978 --> 01:43:19,683
If you did, there'd be no prints on it anyway.

1656
01:43:20,481 --> 01:43:22,023
- Bury it.
- Bury it?

1657
01:43:22,233 --> 01:43:24,558
What the fuck do you expect me to say?

1658
01:43:28,573 --> 01:43:31,988
Captain, this thing stinks to high hell.
I mean, somebody did something here.

1659
01:43:32,076 --> 01:43:33,618
You said it yourself.

1660
01:43:33,703 --> 01:43:36,276
You got no robbery. No suspects.

1661
01:43:36,831 --> 01:43:39,156
Nobody's breathing down my neck
to come up with answers.

1662
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:41,823
I'm not gonna breathe down yours. Bury it.

1663
01:43:45,297 --> 01:43:47,124
I wasn't expecting this.

1664
01:43:47,216 --> 01:43:50,252
I promise you,
l'll find you guys more cases to solve.

1665
01:43:52,763 --> 01:43:53,842
Okay.

1666
01:43:55,599 --> 01:43:58,470
Oh, here's something
that you probably did expect.

1667
01:43:58,561 --> 01:44:02,261
- They found that missing Madrugada money.
- No shit.

1668
01:44:02,856 --> 01:44:05,063
Yes, you want to know where it was?

1669
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:07,309
- In my bank account?
- No.

1670
01:44:07,403 --> 01:44:09,728
- My summer house in Sag Harbour?
- No.

1671
01:44:09,822 --> 01:44:11,482
- My wallet?
- No.

1672
01:44:12,408 --> 01:44:15,112
Then, no. I don't want to know.

1673
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:24,668
MITCHELL: This is bullshit, man.

1674
01:44:24,753 --> 01:44:26,995
I mean, we're the only ones left
trying to catch the bad guys

1675
01:44:27,089 --> 01:44:28,749
and they're gonna come after us like that?

1676
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:30,833
L'll tell you what.
Every one of your accusers, man,

1677
01:44:30,926 --> 01:44:34,342
I say we go after them all, Keith,
Michael Corleone style.

1678
01:44:34,429 --> 01:44:36,469
"Michael Corleone,
do you renounce Satan?"

1679
01:44:36,556 --> 01:44:38,134
"Yes, I renounce him."

1680
01:44:39,309 --> 01:44:41,349
FRAZIER: There's no 392.

1681
01:44:41,436 --> 01:44:44,390
- Huh?
- Safety deposit box number 392.

1682
01:44:44,481 --> 01:44:46,723
According to these records, it doesn't exist.

1683
01:44:46,816 --> 01:44:49,390
Pinstriped, mayonnaise, lying motherfucker.

1684
01:44:49,569 --> 01:44:52,772
- Didn't Coughlin say we should move on?
- Let's go.

1685
01:45:02,165 --> 01:45:04,490
Thank you, again, Your Honour.
L'll come pick it up tomorrow?

1686
01:45:04,584 --> 01:45:06,660
- Yes, you're welcome.
- Thank you.

1687
01:45:13,468 --> 01:45:14,962
What are you doing, Detective?

1688
01:45:15,053 --> 01:45:17,591
Now, what business do you have
with Judge Pasqua?

1689
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:19,174
Police business.

1690
01:45:19,265 --> 01:45:22,634
- Weren't you told to bury this?
- I got a job to do, Miss White.

1691
01:45:22,727 --> 01:45:25,514
And since when is your job
more important than your career?

1692
01:45:25,605 --> 01:45:28,012
- Or did you forget our arrangement?
- We didn't have any arrangement.

1693
01:45:28,107 --> 01:45:29,518
Let me tell you how this works. You...

1694
01:45:29,609 --> 01:45:31,648
No, let me tell you how this works.

1695
01:45:31,736 --> 01:45:34,939
You press here to record
and you press here to play.

1696
01:45:35,031 --> 01:45:37,356
MADELEINE: (OVER RECORDER) There's
also the matter of the $140,000

1697
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:38,612
that seems to have walked away

1698
01:45:38,701 --> 01:45:41,453
from the Madrugada cheque-cashing bust.

1699
01:45:41,621 --> 01:45:43,862
FRAZIER: I didn't have anything
to do with that, so...

1700
01:45:43,956 --> 01:45:46,032
MAYOR: We'd like to be
in your corner on that.

1701
01:45:46,125 --> 01:45:48,960
In exchange for what? I mean, what,
do you want me to do something unethical?

1702
01:45:49,045 --> 01:45:51,002
I mean, no disrespect to the both of youse

1703
01:45:51,088 --> 01:45:53,128
but I don't need you
to be in my corner, Mr Mayor.

1704
01:45:53,215 --> 01:45:54,544
Look, I'm innocent.

1705
01:45:54,633 --> 01:45:57,385
MADELEINE: Innocent or guilty,
you're still going down.

1706
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:02,218
MAYOR: Give Miss White whatever
she needs, or your career is over.

1707
01:46:02,683 --> 01:46:03,798
Done.

1708
01:46:04,185 --> 01:46:05,383
Kaput.

1709
01:46:06,896 --> 01:46:09,850
So? You gave me what I wanted.

1710
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:13,060
Your career is blossoming
and all is right with the world.

1711
01:46:13,152 --> 01:46:14,646
What was Case hiding?

1712
01:46:17,823 --> 01:46:21,274
You know, there's a famous saying
by the Baron de Rothschild.

1713
01:46:23,036 --> 01:46:26,240
"When there's blood on the streets,
buy property."

1714
01:46:28,709 --> 01:46:31,745
I think Mr Case
really took that sentiment to heart.

1715
01:46:31,837 --> 01:46:34,707
But he is no different
than half the Fortune 500.

1716
01:46:36,091 --> 01:46:37,834
Let it go, Detective.

1717
01:46:39,303 --> 01:46:40,927
You're a good cop.

1718
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,423
This city needs you.

1719
01:47:11,584 --> 01:47:15,084
- Lady! Lady, you're in the wrong place.
- I have an appointment.

1720
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:24,878
Arthur.

1721
01:47:25,682 --> 01:47:28,255
- Good morning.
- Miss White.

1722
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:30,388
Have a seat.

1723
01:47:32,272 --> 01:47:35,107
Thank you, Vincent. That's all for now.
Thank you.

1724
01:47:35,608 --> 01:47:36,937
(CASE CLEARING THROAT)

1725
01:47:38,695 --> 01:47:40,901
Well. What did he say?

1726
01:47:40,988 --> 01:47:43,989
Well, Detective Frazier
turned out to be quite sharp.

1727
01:47:44,075 --> 01:47:47,241
But I just fast-tracked his career a little
and he's under control.

1728
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:50,282
I hope so. Tell me about the envelope.

1729
01:47:50,706 --> 01:47:51,869
Where is it now?

1730
01:47:51,958 --> 01:47:54,828
Well, the gang leader
is going to hang on to it,

1731
01:47:54,919 --> 01:47:58,039
as an insurance policy
to keep you from seeking revenge.

1732
01:47:58,714 --> 01:48:01,466
Clearly, he has a very low opinion of you.

1733
01:48:01,550 --> 01:48:02,879
And what might that be?

1734
01:48:02,968 --> 01:48:06,254
Well, let's see.
In a nutshell, that you got rich,

1735
01:48:06,472 --> 01:48:09,556
doing business with the Nazis
during the Holocaust.

1736
01:48:12,812 --> 01:48:13,926
Yes.

1737
01:48:15,147 --> 01:48:18,231
It was 60 years ago.
I was young and ambitious.

1738
01:48:18,859 --> 01:48:21,646
I saw a short path to success and I took it.

1739
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:24,822
I sold my soul.

1740
01:48:26,575 --> 01:48:29,576
And I've been trying to buy it back
ever since.

1741
01:48:29,662 --> 01:48:34,158
But you and this mystery man,
you have an understanding?

1742
01:48:34,333 --> 01:48:38,165
I think so. And he managed
to get out of there with that envelope.

1743
01:48:39,171 --> 01:48:42,504
If someday
he comes back to blackmail you, well,

1744
01:48:43,342 --> 01:48:46,046
you'll pay him. And you'll get it back.

1745
01:48:47,346 --> 01:48:49,385
- So, I guess that's it.
- I suppose so.

1746
01:48:49,473 --> 01:48:51,346
- Bullshit.
- I beg your pardon?

1747
01:48:51,433 --> 01:48:55,300
He didn't go through all that just to stick
your envelope under his mattress.

1748
01:48:55,395 --> 01:48:58,182
Look, they left money untouched, Arthur.

1749
01:48:58,273 --> 01:48:59,352
So?

1750
01:48:59,483 --> 01:49:03,860
So, he had to have walked out of there
with something else.

1751
01:49:04,863 --> 01:49:07,354
The bank says
that there was nothing missing.

1752
01:49:07,449 --> 01:49:10,022
So, there had to have been
something in that box

1753
01:49:10,118 --> 01:49:12,823
that was worth more to him
than your envelope.

1754
01:49:14,706 --> 01:49:16,699
You don't have to tell me.

1755
01:49:16,791 --> 01:49:19,365
There's only one thing it could be anyway.

1756
01:49:22,547 --> 01:49:23,710
Diamonds.

1757
01:49:24,674 --> 01:49:26,548
And then there's the ring.

1758
01:49:27,218 --> 01:49:28,629
Cartier ring.

1759
01:49:29,262 --> 01:49:32,216
It belonged to the wife of a Parisian banker.

1760
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:35,310
Wealthy family of French Jews.

1761
01:49:35,977 --> 01:49:39,097
And when the war came along,
the ring and everything else they owned

1762
01:49:39,188 --> 01:49:44,016
was confiscated and they were shipped off
to concentration camps. None survived.

1763
01:49:46,029 --> 01:49:47,653
We were friends.

1764
01:49:48,573 --> 01:49:50,364
I could have helped them.

1765
01:49:52,285 --> 01:49:57,112
But the Nazis paid too well.

1766
01:49:59,041 --> 01:50:03,620
Can I trust that you will keep
what you've learnt

1767
01:50:03,713 --> 01:50:06,998
here today confidential?

1768
01:50:08,092 --> 01:50:10,381
Despite whatever you may think?

1769
01:50:19,478 --> 01:50:20,889
Yes, Arthur.

1770
01:50:22,857 --> 01:50:26,023
Well, I'd love to tell you
what a monster you are,

1771
01:50:26,235 --> 01:50:30,398
but I have to help bin Laden's nephew
buy a co-op on Park Avenue.

1772
01:50:34,618 --> 01:50:37,074
If that were true, you wouldn't tell me.

1773
01:50:37,371 --> 01:50:39,529
We're listing you as a reference.

1774
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:53,917
(SIGHING)

1775
01:50:54,012 --> 01:50:56,338
My name is Dalton Russell.

1776
01:50:56,932 --> 01:50:58,759
Pay strict attention to what I say

1777
01:50:58,850 --> 01:51:02,469
because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

1778
01:51:02,562 --> 01:51:05,267
I've told you my name. That's the "who."

1779
01:51:06,316 --> 01:51:09,981
The "where" could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

1780
01:51:10,529 --> 01:51:12,106
But there is a vast difference

1781
01:51:12,197 --> 01:51:15,696
between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.

1782
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:19,035
The "what" is easy.

1783
01:51:20,038 --> 01:51:24,747
Recently I planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

1784
01:51:25,794 --> 01:51:27,703
That's also the "when."

1785
01:51:28,713 --> 01:51:33,091
As for the "why,"
beyond the obvious financial motivation,

1786
01:51:33,843 --> 01:51:35,587
it's exceedingly simple.

1787
01:51:36,012 --> 01:51:37,423
Because I can.

1788
01:51:38,556 --> 01:51:40,798
Which leaves us only with the "how."

1789
01:51:41,601 --> 01:51:44,637
And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

1790
01:51:45,730 --> 01:51:47,189
lies the rub.

1791
01:51:55,448 --> 01:51:56,611
(BANGING)

1792
01:52:36,405 --> 01:52:39,988
STEVE: He's gonna smell like shit.
STEVE-O: What do you expect after a week?

1793
01:52:42,369 --> 01:52:43,449
CHAIM: Yeah.

1794
01:52:43,913 --> 01:52:46,368
Why do you think I rolled down the window?

1795
01:52:49,418 --> 01:52:50,663
(CHUCKLING)

1796
01:53:06,059 --> 01:53:07,304
Oh, shit.

1797
01:53:12,774 --> 01:53:15,312
That cop, Frazier, and his partner
are walking into the bank.

1798
01:53:15,402 --> 01:53:18,687
- Are they coming for me?
- Can't say. It's just the two of them.

1799
01:53:26,329 --> 01:53:29,330
MAN: Yeah, everything's going great today.
No.

1800
01:53:29,666 --> 01:53:32,667
Yeah, about 5:30. Okay.

1801
01:53:33,128 --> 01:53:35,666
Sounds like fun. Okay.

1802
01:53:36,464 --> 01:53:38,007
Talk to you later.

1803
01:53:59,404 --> 01:54:01,147
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

1804
01:54:04,450 --> 01:54:05,861
Mr Hammond?

1805
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:07,695
Good morning, Detectives.

1806
01:54:11,249 --> 01:54:12,826
Just like he planned.

1807
01:54:12,917 --> 01:54:15,490
I got a court order here
to open a safe deposit box.

1808
01:54:15,586 --> 01:54:17,496
Number 392.

1809
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:26,759
(STEVE-O SIGHING)

1810
01:54:28,724 --> 01:54:30,468
STEVE-O: Oh, thank God.

1811
01:54:36,232 --> 01:54:37,607
Where is it?

1812
01:54:38,401 --> 01:54:39,859
I left it in there.

1813
01:54:39,944 --> 01:54:41,604
This way, Detectives.

1814
01:54:41,695 --> 01:54:44,269
Why did you do that? You left the ring.

1815
01:54:44,365 --> 01:54:45,610
Trust me.

1816
01:54:46,575 --> 01:54:48,235
I left it in good hands.

1817
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:50,744
DALTON: I'm no martyr.

1818
01:54:51,455 --> 01:54:53,163
I did it for the money.

1819
01:54:54,875 --> 01:54:58,540
But it's not worth much
if you can't face yourself in the mirror.

1820
01:54:59,338 --> 01:55:01,959
Respect is the ultimate currency.

1821
01:55:04,802 --> 01:55:08,751
I was stealing from a man
who traded his away for a few dollars.

1822
01:55:10,641 --> 01:55:13,132
And then he tried to wash away his guilt.

1823
01:55:14,269 --> 01:55:18,314
Drown it in a lifetime of good deeds
and a sea of respectability.

1824
01:55:19,107 --> 01:55:21,230
- Let me get that.
- Let me.

1825
01:55:21,318 --> 01:55:22,693
It almost worked, too.

1826
01:55:22,778 --> 01:55:23,892
Okay.

1827
01:55:25,989 --> 01:55:27,365
But inevitably,

1828
01:55:28,325 --> 01:55:30,483
the further you run from your sins,

1829
01:55:31,328 --> 01:55:34,412
the more exhausted you are
when they catch up to you.

1830
01:55:34,623 --> 01:55:35,785
And they do.

1831
01:55:37,667 --> 01:55:39,210
Son of a bitch.

1832
01:55:39,294 --> 01:55:40,492
Certain.

1833
01:55:41,505 --> 01:55:43,165
It will not fail.

1834
01:55:47,552 --> 01:55:49,545
FRAZIER: What do you think that's worth?

1835
01:55:49,846 --> 01:55:52,515
(CHUCKLING) If you got to ask, man,
you can't afford it.

1836
01:55:52,599 --> 01:55:54,971
Thank goodness my girlfriend ain't here.

1837
01:55:57,103 --> 01:55:58,847
"Follow the ring"?

1838
01:56:12,911 --> 01:56:15,865
- Detective Frazier.
- Mr Case.

1839
01:56:16,039 --> 01:56:18,031
- How are you?
- I am great.

1840
01:56:18,458 --> 01:56:21,874
Nobody got killed at the bank.
Everybody's happy. My kind of day.

1841
01:56:21,961 --> 01:56:23,918
That's wonderful. Wonderful.

1842
01:56:24,005 --> 01:56:25,713
- Detective Mitchell.
- Mr Case.

1843
01:56:25,798 --> 01:56:27,755
- Be seated, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

1844
01:56:27,842 --> 01:56:30,131
- Can I offer you anything?
- No.

1845
01:56:30,219 --> 01:56:31,797
I must say

1846
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:34,587
I was most impressed

1847
01:56:35,766 --> 01:56:37,676
by the way you handled that business.

1848
01:56:37,768 --> 01:56:39,049
Thank you, Mr Case.

1849
01:56:39,145 --> 01:56:41,054
Whenever I hear the term
"New York's Finest"

1850
01:56:41,147 --> 01:56:42,890
you're who I think of.

1851
01:56:42,982 --> 01:56:46,232
You keep the rest of us safe
and make it look easy.

1852
01:56:48,529 --> 01:56:50,901
- Pardon me.
- Well, what's so amusing?

1853
01:56:50,990 --> 01:56:53,907
When you say "the rest of us," Mr Case,
I mean, you got to look around.

1854
01:56:53,993 --> 01:56:58,073
"The rest of us" is a category
that you haven't qualified for in a long time.

1855
01:56:58,164 --> 01:57:00,868
Touch, Detective.
I won't deny it. I've done well.

1856
01:57:00,958 --> 01:57:03,081
Yes, you have. But I'm very confused.

1857
01:57:03,169 --> 01:57:04,912
You see, I got a case

1858
01:57:05,671 --> 01:57:08,625
where armed robbers
laid siege to your bank.

1859
01:57:08,716 --> 01:57:10,044
It is your bank, right?

1860
01:57:10,134 --> 01:57:12,007
Well, I'm Chairman of the Board of Directors.

1861
01:57:12,094 --> 01:57:13,754
Then ita-zita-vene-gazoo.

1862
01:57:13,846 --> 01:57:15,755
The robbers disappear. Poof.

1863
01:57:16,098 --> 01:57:17,509
And they don't take a nickel, right?

1864
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:19,925
- You're asking me?
- Yes, I'm asking you.

1865
01:57:20,018 --> 01:57:22,177
I mean, it's your bank. You own it.
I'm asking you.

1866
01:57:22,271 --> 01:57:24,144
It's a tiny part of our organisation.

1867
01:57:24,231 --> 01:57:26,354
No robbers. No real victims.
No loot missing.

1868
01:57:26,441 --> 01:57:28,517
It's got to be the first time
in law-enforcement history.

1869
01:57:28,610 --> 01:57:29,773
I never heard of it before.

1870
01:57:29,862 --> 01:57:32,898
So, you got to ask yourself, "What the fuck
happened?" Don't you, Mr Case?

1871
01:57:32,990 --> 01:57:34,614
I'm not quite sure I like your tone, Officer.

1872
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:37,025
You don't like my tone?
Then give me a straight answer.

1873
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:40,951
It's the founding bank of your empire.
You built it. It's your baby.

1874
01:57:41,039 --> 01:57:43,079
Give me a straight answer.
What do you think happened?

1875
01:57:43,166 --> 01:57:46,784
- I have no idea.
- Oh, come on, now. Come on.

1876
01:57:46,878 --> 01:57:48,289
L'll tell you what I think happened.

1877
01:57:48,380 --> 01:57:50,503
I think you sent that woman in there
to patch things up.

1878
01:57:50,590 --> 01:57:53,128
Miss White. I think you paid her.
What was she doing in there?

1879
01:57:53,218 --> 01:57:54,677
Look, this is absurd.

1880
01:57:54,761 --> 01:57:56,718
Are you implying that
I had anything to do with it?

1881
01:57:56,805 --> 01:57:58,429
392.

1882
01:57:58,974 --> 01:58:01,465
Safe deposit box 392.
What's the story on that?

1883
01:58:01,559 --> 01:58:03,932
- I have no idea what you're...
- Don't lie to me, Mr Case.

1884
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:06,511
- I don't lie.
- I looked at all the records.

1885
01:58:06,606 --> 01:58:10,141
All the bank records
for safe deposit boxes at your bank.

1886
01:58:10,318 --> 01:58:13,023
At first glance, everything looked fine,

1887
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:16,105
but there was one safe deposit box
that had no records.

1888
01:58:16,199 --> 01:58:18,156
I mean, going all the way back to 1948.

1889
01:58:18,243 --> 01:58:21,362
So I started thinking.
Who would have the answer to this riddle?

1890
01:58:21,454 --> 01:58:23,328
Probably the man who forgot to mention

1891
01:58:23,414 --> 01:58:25,703
that he built the bank
in the first place in 1948.

1892
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:28,627
It doesn't add up, Mr Case.
It does not add up.

1893
01:58:29,545 --> 01:58:33,875
I'm afraid I can't be
of any further use to you, Detective.

1894
01:58:35,051 --> 01:58:37,542
It's something really bad, isn't it?

1895
01:58:38,262 --> 01:58:42,889
Mr Frazier, I have spent
my whole life serving humanity.

1896
01:58:44,352 --> 01:58:46,391
You can ask anyone who knows me.

1897
01:58:47,688 --> 01:58:50,689
They'll vouch for me,
and for the things that I've done.

1898
01:58:50,775 --> 01:58:53,811
You think they'll vouch for you
after I find out the truth about this ring?

1899
01:58:53,903 --> 01:58:55,278
I don't think so.

1900
01:58:59,950 --> 01:59:02,987
Oh, by the way, that thing you said
about us being New York's finest?

1901
01:59:03,079 --> 01:59:05,783
I want you to know,
we really appreciate that.

1902
01:59:06,332 --> 01:59:07,660
How gracious.

1903
01:59:08,501 --> 01:59:11,170
Let's go. We're gonna follow that ring.

1904
01:59:18,177 --> 01:59:20,750
- Hey, Keith, let me see your shoe.
- What?

1905
01:59:20,846 --> 01:59:23,218
- Let me see your shoe.
- Why?

1906
01:59:23,307 --> 01:59:27,351
'Cause I have never seen anybody
put their foot that far up a guy's ass.

1907
01:59:29,438 --> 01:59:31,098
Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I?

1908
01:59:31,190 --> 01:59:33,763
Oh, man. You cut him an ass
the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

1909
01:59:33,859 --> 01:59:36,528
We're gonna need a traffic cop on that shit.

1910
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:46,283
Good afternoon, sir.

1911
01:59:46,371 --> 01:59:48,280
- Do you have a reservation?
- Looking for the Mayor.

1912
01:59:48,373 --> 01:59:50,330
- May I have your hat, please?
- No, you cannot. Get your own.

1913
01:59:50,417 --> 01:59:52,990
MADELEINE: They're looking to invest
$4 billion over the next four years.

1914
01:59:53,086 --> 01:59:54,201
And that's all in place.

1915
01:59:54,296 --> 01:59:57,297
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Mayor,
but there's an old American saying,

1916
01:59:57,382 --> 02:00:01,131
"When there's blood on the streets,
somebody's got to go to jail."

1917
02:00:01,803 --> 02:00:04,804
Edwin, could you please excuse us
for a minute?

1918
02:00:06,892 --> 02:00:08,469
MAYOR: What's this about, Detective?

1919
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:12,095
I believe Detective Frazier
is looking for some closure?

1920
02:00:12,439 --> 02:00:14,681
That's a good word. Closure.

1921
02:00:14,774 --> 02:00:17,348
Case closed, you know what I mean?

1922
02:00:17,444 --> 02:00:18,772
This is the number

1923
02:00:18,862 --> 02:00:22,906
of the War Crimes Issues office
in Washington, D.C.

1924
02:00:24,534 --> 02:00:27,155
How'd you like to be on the front page
of the New York Times?

1925
02:00:27,245 --> 02:00:28,324
That'd be great.

1926
02:00:28,413 --> 02:00:32,363
Make sure they spell my name right, though.
That's Frazier with a "z".

1927
02:00:32,876 --> 02:00:34,418
You can keep the pen.

1928
02:00:35,128 --> 02:00:36,622
You made copies?

1929
02:00:38,214 --> 02:00:39,412
Please.

1930
02:00:39,841 --> 02:00:43,257
We got to keep the real criminals
off the streets, Your Honour.

1931
02:00:44,721 --> 02:00:47,390
All right, well, thanks for lunch.

1932
02:00:51,769 --> 02:00:53,347
War crimes, huh?

1933
02:00:54,147 --> 02:00:56,353
What have you got me into this time?

1934
02:01:03,614 --> 02:01:04,859
(SNORING SOFTLY)

1935
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:17,039
Mama?

1936
02:01:21,757 --> 02:01:24,509
- Did you bring Big Willie?
- And the twins.

1937
02:01:38,148 --> 02:01:39,393
Slow down, girl.

1938
02:01:39,483 --> 02:01:41,855
L'll get my gun off
before I get my gun off, okay?

1939
02:01:41,944 --> 02:01:43,189
Pow, pow.

1940
02:02:25,153 --> 02:02:26,861
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

1941
02:02:27,614 --> 02:02:29,238
FRAZIER: Why don't you
just walk out the door?

1942
02:02:29,324 --> 02:02:30,403
DALTON: I will.

1943
02:02:30,659 --> 02:02:33,529
I'm gonna walk out of that door
when I'm good and ready.

1944
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:34,900
Son of a bitch.

1945
02:02:42,295 --> 02:02:45,166
Come on, honey.
The handcuffs are getting cold.
