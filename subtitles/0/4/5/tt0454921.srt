1
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:37,163
Time to get up, man.

2
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,293
- All right, Dad.
- Come on.

3
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:50,987
Should be here soon.

4
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,662
- I think I should make a list.
- What do you mean?

5
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,248
- For your birthday gifts?
- Yeah.

6
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:46,007
You know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?

7
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:50,255
Yeah, I know. Just to look at
and study so I can choose better.

8
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,383
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.

9
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:55,802
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?

10
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:59,598
- I think so.
- All right. That's good.

11
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,438
- How you doing in here, man?
- Okay.

12
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:16,656
Can we go to the park today, after?

13
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,911
No, I gotta go to Oakland.
Well, maybe, we'll see.

14
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,704
Give me a kiss.

15
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,457
I'll talk to you later.

16
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,545
Excuse me.

17
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,048
Oh, excuse me...

18
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:35,550
...when is somebody
gonna clean this off?

19
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:41,097
And the Y?
The Y. We talked about this.

20
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,726
It's an I in "happiness."
There's no Y in "happiness." It's an I.

21
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,897
<i>I'm Chris Gardner.</i>

22
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:52,400
<i>I met my father for the first time</i>
<i>when I was 28 years old.</i>

23
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,861
<i>And I made up my mind</i>
<i>as a young kid...</i>

24
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:56,571
<i>... that when I had children...</i>

25
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,116
<i>... my children were gonna know</i>
<i>who their father was.</i>

26
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:04,746
<i>This is part of my life story.</i>

27
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,917
<i>This part is called "Riding the Bus."</i>

28
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:17,092
What's that?

29
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,928
It's a time machine, isn't it?

30
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,305
Seems like a time machine.

31
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,600
That seems like a time machine.
It's a time machine. Take me with you.

32
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,018
<i>This machine...</i>

33
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:28,728
<i>... this machine on my lap...</i>

34
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,897
This guy, he has a time machine.

35
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:34,150
He travels in the past
with this machine and...

36
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,611
- <i>it is not a time machine.</i>

37
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:39,781
<i>It's a portable</i>
<i>bone-density scanner.</i>

38
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:43,243
<i>A medical device I sell for a living.</i>

39
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:45,954
Thank you for the opportunity
to discuss it with you.

40
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:48,248
- I appreciate it.
- We just don't need it, Chris.

41
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,208
It's unnecessary and expensive.

42
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,544
- Well, maybe next...
- Thank you.

43
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,717
<i>It gave a slightly denser picture</i>
<i>than an x-ray for twice the money.</i>

44
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,305
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

45
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:05,181
- What happened?
- No, nothing.

46
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,975
Look, I can't get Christopher today.

47
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:09,686
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I'm back on at 7.

48
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,646
I know. I have got to go to Oakland.

49
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,983
So I gotta get Christopher home,
feed him, bathe him...

50
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:17,819
...get him in bed,
and be back here by 7?

51
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:20,155
- Yes.
- And we got the tax-bill notice today.

52
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:23,867
- What are you gonna do about that?
- Look, this is what we gotta do.

53
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:32,375
<i>You see that car? The one</i>
<i>with the pretty yellow shoe on it?</i>

54
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,960
<i>That's mine.</i>

55
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,129
<i>There's no parking near hospitals.</i>

56
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:38,840
<i>That's what happens</i>
<i>when you're always in a rush.</i>

57
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:40,926
Thanks anyway. Very much.

58
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,054
- Maybe next quarter.
- It's possible.

59
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:50,477
<i>I needed to sell at least two scanners</i>
<i>a month for rent and daycare.</i>

60
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:52,687
<i>I'd have to sell one more...</i>

61
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:56,691
<i>... to pay off all of those tickets</i>
<i>under my windshield wiper.</i>

62
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,492
<i>The problem is...</i>

63
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:08,870
<i>... I haven't sold any for a while.</i>

64
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,250
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?

65
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,002
Since birth?

66
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,507
- What's that?
- What?

67
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:23,802
- What is this?
- It's a gift for Christopher.

68
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,513
- From who?
- Cynthia from work.

69
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:29,808
It's for adults. Chris can't use it.
She didn't know.

70
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,018
What are you supposed
to do with it?

71
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:35,814
Make every side the same colour.

72
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:39,401
Did you pay the taxes?

73
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,821
No, I'm gonna
have to file an extension.

74
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:47,742
- You already filed an extension.
- Yeah, well, I gotta file another one.

75
00:07:48,118 --> 00:07:51,830
That's... It's $650.
I'll have it in the next month.

76
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,165
That means interest, right?

77
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:56,751
- And a penalty?
- Yeah, a little bit.

78
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,591
Look, why don't you let me do this?
All right, just relax. Okay?

79
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:06,928
- Come here. Calm down.
- I have to go back to work.

80
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:18,607
Let's get ready for bed.
Hey, put your plate in the sink.

81
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:22,235
<i>A few days ago I was presented</i>
<i>with a report I'd asked for...</i>

82
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:26,156
<i>... a comprehensive audit, if you will,</i>
<i>of our economic condition.</i>

83
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:29,576
<i>You won't like it. I didn't like it.</i>

84
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:31,453
<i>But we have to face the truth...</i>

85
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:34,289
<i>... and then go to work</i>
<i>to turn things around.</i>

86
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:38,251
<i>And make no mistake about it,</i>
<i>we can turn them around.</i>

87
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:41,546
<i>The federal budget is out of control.</i>

88
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:45,133
<i>And we face runaway deficits</i>
<i>of almost $80 billion...</i>

89
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:48,762
<i>... for this budget year</i>
<i>that ends September 30th.</i>

90
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:54,184
<i>That deficit is larger than</i>
<i>the entire federal budget in 1957.</i>

91
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,978
<i>And so is the almost $80 billion...</i>

92
00:08:57,187 --> 00:09:01,483
<i>... we will pay in interest</i>
<i>this year on the national debt.</i>

93
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,653
<i>Twenty years ago, in 1960...</i>

94
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:08,990
<i>... our federal government payroll</i>
<i>was less than $13 billion.</i>

95
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:11,910
<i>Today it is 75 billion.</i>

96
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:17,666
<i>During these 20 years, our population</i>
<i>has only increased by 23.3 percent...</i>

97
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:38,603
Man, I got two questions for you:

98
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:41,940
What do you do?
And how do you do it?

99
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:46,528
- I'm a stockbroker.
- Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.

100
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:48,697
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?

101
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:52,701
You don't have to. Have to be good
with numbers and good with people.

102
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:55,287
- That's it.
- Hey, you take care.

103
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:57,539
I'll let you hang on to my car
for the weekend.

104
00:09:57,747 --> 00:10:00,208
- But I need it back for Monday.
- Feed the meter.

105
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:09,801
<i>I still remember that moment.</i>

106
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:18,727
<i>They all looked</i>
<i>so damn happy to me.</i>

107
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:28,320
<i>Why couldn't I look like that?</i>

108
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:47,255
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

109
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:50,592
I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm
after work.

110
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,095
- For what?
- I wanna see about a job there.

111
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:56,932
Yeah? What job?

112
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:59,434
You know, when I...

113
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:02,270
When I was a kid, I could go through
a math book in a week.

114
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:05,815
So I'm gonna go see about
what job they got down there.

115
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:08,860
What job?

116
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:13,573
Stockbroker.

117
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:19,079
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

118
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:21,456
Not an astronaut?

119
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:39,975
Don't talk to me like that, Linda.

120
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,896
I'm gonna go down and see about this,
and I'm gonna do it during the day.

121
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,815
You should probably
do your sales calls.

122
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,693
I don't need you to tell me
about my sales calls, Linda.

123
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:53,113
I got three of them
before the damn office is even open.

124
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:56,074
Do you remember
that rent is due next week?

125
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,159
Probably not.

126
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,829
We're already two months behind.

127
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:04,082
Next week we'll owe three months.

128
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:08,670
I've been pulling double shifts
for four months now, Chris.

129
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,383
Just sell what's in your contract.
Get us out of that business.

130
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:17,304
Linda, that is what I am trying to do.

131
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:20,724
This is what I'm trying to do
for my family...

132
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,309
...for you and for Christopher.

133
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:25,854
What's the matter with you?

134
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:31,693
Linda.

135
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,820
Linda.

136
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:05,894
<i>This part of my life</i>
<i>is called "Being Stupid."</i>

137
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:09,231
Can I ask you a favour, miss?

138
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:13,318
Do you mind if I leave this here
with you just for five minutes?

139
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,029
I have a meeting in there
and I don't wanna carry that...

140
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,240
...looking smalltime.

141
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:23,536
Here is a dollar and I'll give you
more money when I come back out.

142
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:26,998
Okay? It's not valuable.
You can't sell it anywhere.

143
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:33,088
I can't even sell it, and it's my job.
All right? Be right back.

144
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:42,138
- Chris? Tim Brophy, Resources.
- Yes. How are you?

145
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,682
- Follow me.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,643
Let me see if I can find you
an application for our internship.

147
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,105
I'm afraid that's all we can do for you.
See, this is a satellite office.

148
00:13:50,313 --> 00:13:52,941
Jay Twistle in the main office,
he oversees Witter Resources.

149
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:55,277
I mean, I'm... You know,
I'm just this office.

150
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:58,405
As you can see, we got a hell of lot
of applications here, so...

154
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,915
I'll bring this back.

- Bye, baby.

00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:25,927
- Come back without that, please.
- Oh, yeah, I'm going to.

182

Bye, Mom.

186
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:37,981
Bye.

187
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,776
It's written as P-P-Y, but it's
supposed to be an I in "happiness."

188
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:45,113
- Is it an adjective?
- No, actually it's a noun.

189
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:47,073
But it's not spelled right.

190
00:16:47,324 --> 00:16:50,869
- Is "fuck" spelled right?
- Yeah, that's spelled right.

191
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:54,205
But that's not part of the motto,
so you're not supposed to learn that.

192
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:59,294
That's an adult word to show anger
and other things.

193
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:02,380
- But just don't use that one, okay?
- Okay.

194
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,758
What's that say
on the back of your bag?

195
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,052
My nickname.

196
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,845
We pick nicknames.

197
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:12,432
- Oh, yeah? What's it say?
- "Hot Rod."

198
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,479
- Did you have a nickname?
- Yep.

199
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:20,398
- What?
- "Ten-Gallon Head."

200
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:23,485
- What's that?
- I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas.

201
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:28,323
Everybody wears cowboy hats.
And a ten-gallon's a big hat.

202
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:32,118
I was smart back then,
so they called me Ten-Gallon Head.

203
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:34,829
- Hoss wears that hat.
- Hoss?

204
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,831
Hoss Cartwright on <i>Bonanza.</i>

205
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,835
- How do you know <i>Bonanza?</i>
- We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.

206
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:44,589
- You watch <i>Bonanza</i> at daycare?
- Yeah.

207
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:47,717
When? When do you watch it?

208
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:51,596
- After snack? After your nap?
- After <i>Love Boat.</i>

209
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,687
I made my list for my birthday.

210
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:03,984
- Yeah, what'd you put on there?
- A basketball or an ant farm.

211
00:18:07,571 --> 00:18:11,866
- He says he's been watching TV.
- Oh, little TV for history.

212
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:15,161
- <i>Love Boat?</i>
- For history. Navy.

213
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:17,622
That's not the Navy.

214
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:19,958
I mean, he could
watch television at home.

215
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:24,546
We're paying you $150 a month.
If he's gonna be sitting around...

216
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:27,132
...watching TV all day,
we're taking him out of here.

217
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,136
Go pay more at other daycare
if you don't like Navy TV.

218
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:38,226
You late pay anyway.
You complain. I complain.

219
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:43,523
Can you at least put the dog upstairs
in your room or something?

220
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:45,191

- Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner.
- Hi.

226
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:49,798
I wanted to drop this off personally
and make your acquaintance.

227
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:53,385
I thought I'd catch you on the way in.
I'd love the opportunity to discuss...

228
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,804
...what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.

229
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:58,807
We'll start with this, and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.

230
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:01,977
- Yes, sir. You have a great day.
- You too.

231
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,652
<i>Hey, yeah, how you doing?</i>

232
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,029
This is Chris Gardner calling
for Dr. Delsey.

233
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,407
Yeah, I'm running a little late
for a sales call.

234
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:19,119
I was wondering if...
Yeah, Osteo National.

235
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:21,871
Right. We can still...? Half an hour?

236
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,750
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.

237
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:38,430
Hey! Hey!

238
00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:40,890
Hey!

241
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,565
<i>... it's called "Running."</i>

00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,692
Hey! Hey!

243
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,485
Wait!

244
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:56,197
Hey! Wait!

245
00:20:56,406 --> 00:20:58,783
<i>That was my stolen machine.</i>

246
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,036
<i>Unless she was with</i>
<i>a guy who sold them too.</i>

247
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:03,830
<i>Which was unlikely...</i>

248
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,750
<i>... because I was the only one</i>
<i>selling them in the Bay Area.</i>

249
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:09,544
<i>I spent our entire life savings</i>
<i>on these things.</i>

250
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:15,550
<i>It was such</i>
<i>a revolutionary machine.</i>

251
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,136
- Can you feel it, baby?
- Oh, yeah.

252
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:19,888
You got me doing all the work.

253
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:22,599
<i>What I didn't know</i>
<i>is that doctors and hospitals...</i>

254
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:26,686
<i>... would consider them</i>
<i>unnecessary luxuries.</i>

255
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:32,734
<i>I even asked the landlord</i>
<i>to take a picture.</i>

256
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:38,907
<i>So if I lost one, it was like losing</i>
<i>a month's groceries.</i>

257
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:44,788
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

258
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:50,377
Hey, get back here!

259
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:57,425
Hey, man, I...

260
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:01,596
- Who's he?
- He's that guy...

261
00:22:12,148 --> 00:22:15,986
- Did you forget?
- Forget what?

262
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:19,447
You're not supposed
to have any of those.

263
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:22,867
- Yeah, I know.
- You have two now.

264
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:34,796
Hey.

265
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,342
Hey, Mom.

266
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:48,560
One, two, three!

267
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:52,772
- That's a basketball!
- Hey, hey. What do you mean?

268
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:54,691
You don't know that
that's a basketball.

269
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:58,820
This could be an ant farm. This could
be a microscope or anything.

270
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:01,489
- No, it's not.
- There, there.

271
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:04,993
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.

272
00:23:10,874 --> 00:23:15,253
- That paper's a little heavy, huh?
- Yeah, but I got it.

273
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:29,017
You should've seen me
out there today.

274
00:23:29,226 --> 00:23:31,770
Somebody stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down...

275
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:33,563
Whatever.

276
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:38,235
- What?
- Whatever, Chris.

277
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:40,654
What the hell
you got attitude about?

278
00:23:40,904 --> 00:23:43,657
- "Whatever" what?
- Every day's got some damn story.

279
00:23:43,907 --> 00:23:45,200
Hey, Roy. Roy!

280
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,702
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?

281
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:49,371
There's dust and shit all over.

282
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:51,957
- I'm trying to keep a clean house.
- Hey, wait a second.

283
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:54,918
Look, Linda, relax.

284
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:58,463
We're gonna come out of this.
Everything is gonna be fine, all right?

285
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:03,468
You said that before,
when I got pregnant. "It'll be fine."

286
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:08,682
- So you don't trust me now?
- Whatever. I don't care.

287
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:26,074
- Taxi!
- Mr. Twistle.

288
00:24:26,283 --> 00:24:28,952
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi. Chris Gardner.

289
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:30,996
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

290
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:34,249
I submitted an application for the
intern programme about a month ago...

291
00:24:34,457 --> 00:24:36,710
...and I would just love
to sit with you briefly...

292
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,878
Listen, I'm going
to Noe Valley, Chris.

293
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:42,382
- Take care of yourself.
- Mr. Twistle.

294
00:24:42,632 --> 00:24:44,926
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

295
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:46,886
How about we share a ride?

296
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:50,557
- All right, get in.
- All right.

297
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:59,399
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor...

298
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:02,444
...who loved to play golf,
hours every day...

299
00:25:02,652 --> 00:25:07,282
...and I would actually
perform medical procedures...

300
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,034
...when he'd leave me in the office.

301
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:14,497
So I'm used to being in a position
where I have to make decisions and...

302
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:18,793
Mr. Twistle, listen.
This is a very important...

303
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:21,212
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This thing's impossible.

304
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,425
- I can do it.
- No, you can't. No one can.

305
00:25:25,675 --> 00:25:28,345
- That's bullshit.
- No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.

306
00:25:28,762 --> 00:25:31,932
- No, you can't.
- Let me see it.

307
00:25:32,515 --> 00:25:33,725
Give it here.

308
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:40,982
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,
you really messed it up.

309
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:42,734
Sorry.

310
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:49,241
It looks like it works around a swivel,
so the centre pieces never move.

311
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:52,535
So if it's yellow in the centre,
that's the yellow side.

312
00:25:52,786 --> 00:25:55,247
If it's red in the centre,
that's the red side.

313
00:25:55,455 --> 00:25:59,084
- Okay.
- So... You can slow down.

314
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:02,337
Listen, we can drive around all day.
I don't believe you can do this.

315
00:26:02,545 --> 00:26:04,256
- Yeah, I can.
- No, you can't.

316
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:05,632
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

317
00:26:05,882 --> 00:26:07,759
I'm telling you, no one can.

318
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:11,930
See? That's all I ever do.

319
00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:27,112
You almost have this side.

320
00:26:27,737 --> 00:26:29,197
Holy cow.

321
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:43,211
- You almost had that one.
- I'm gonna get it.

322
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,512
Look at that.

323
00:27:15,785 --> 00:27:16,995
You're almost there.

324
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:44,439
- 1710.
- This is me.

325
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:47,943
Good job.

326
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:52,906
- Goodbye.
- Yeah. I'll see you soon.

327
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,035
Where are you going, sir?

328
00:27:57,244 --> 00:28:00,247
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please?

329
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:05,293
Two... A couple of blocks.

330
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:08,922
- Just flip around.
- Okay.

331
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,592
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

332
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:55,510
- Where are you going? Come here!
- No!

333
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:58,555
- No, no, no!
- You asshole, give me my money!

334
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:00,098
- Give me my money.
- Please stop.

335
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:02,309
- Please, please, please!
- Son of a bitch.

336
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,061
Please! He should've paid you!

337
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:06,813
- Come here!
- I'm sorry.

338
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:08,690
- I'm so sorry.
- I'll kick your ass!

339
00:29:09,232 --> 00:29:12,360
- I'm sorry!
- Idiot.

340
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:24,497
I'll get you!

341
00:29:24,748 --> 00:29:28,209
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

342
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,685
Hey!

343
00:29:45,936 --> 00:29:48,772
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

344
00:29:49,105 --> 00:29:51,149
Stop him!

345
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:57,072
Stop him!

346
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,037
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

347
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:07,082
<i>Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

348
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:18,134
No! No! No!

349
00:30:20,804 --> 00:30:22,597
No!

350
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:48,123
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, yeah.

351
00:30:48,331 --> 00:30:50,041
Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.

352
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,462
- <i>Chris, I missed my shift.</i>
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that.

353
00:30:54,671 --> 00:30:57,966
Look, I'm on my way right now.
Are you all right with Christopher?

354
00:30:58,174 --> 00:31:00,552
<i>I'm leaving. Chris, I'm leaving.</i>

355
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,762
- What?
- <i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

356
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,559
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...

357
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:09,311
...and we're gonna leave now.

358
00:31:09,686 --> 00:31:11,062
<i>I'm gonna put the phone down.</i>

359
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:14,816
- Linda, wait a minute. Hold it, hold...
- <i>I'm going to leave. We are leaving.</i>

360
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:23,950
<i>It was right then that I started</i>
<i>thinking about Thomas Jefferson...</i>

361
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:27,704
<i>... the Declaration of Independence...</i>

362
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:34,002
<i>... and the part about our right to life,</i>
<i>liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</i>

363
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,046
<i>And I remember thinking.</i>

364
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:40,634
<i>How did he know</i>
<i>to put the "pursuit" part in there?</i>

365
00:31:40,884 --> 00:31:45,513
<i>That maybe happiness is something</i>
<i>that we can only pursue.</i>

366
00:31:45,722 --> 00:31:48,767
<i>And maybe we can actually</i>
<i>never have it...</i>

367
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:50,769
<i>... no matter what.</i>

368
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,687
<i>How did he know that?</i>

369
00:31:57,901 --> 00:32:00,695
Linda. Linda.

370
00:32:33,687 --> 00:32:35,355
- Hello?
- <i>Chris.</i>

371
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:38,191
- Who is this?
- <i>Jay Twistle.</i>

372
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:40,860
- Hey.
- <i>Dean Witter.</i>

373
00:32:41,111 --> 00:32:43,780
Yeah, of course. How are you?

374
00:32:43,947 --> 00:32:46,408
<i>I'm fine. Listen, do you still</i>
<i>wanna come in and talk?</i>

375
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:47,909
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

376
00:32:48,118 --> 00:32:50,996
<i>I'll tell you what. Come on by</i>
<i>day after tomorrow, in the morning.</i>

377
00:32:51,204 --> 00:32:54,958
<i>We're interviewing for the internships.</i>
<i>You got a pen and paper?</i>

378
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,751
Yes. Yes, I do.

379
00:32:59,713 --> 00:33:02,465
- Hold on one second.
- <i>All right.</i>

380
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:08,471
<i>Hello?</i>

381
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:11,016
- <i>Chris?</i>
- Go ahead. I have one.

382
00:33:11,224 --> 00:33:13,852
<i>Write this number down so you can</i>
<i>call my secretary, Janice.</i>

383
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,104
- <i>She can give you all the specifics.</i>
- Yep.

384
00:33:16,313 --> 00:33:18,189
- <i>Okay, 415.</i>
- 415.

385
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:20,108
- <i>864.</i>
- 864.

386
00:33:20,317 --> 00:33:22,319
- <i>0256.</i>
- 0256.

387
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:25,530
- <i>Yeah, extension 4796.</i>
- 4796.

388
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:29,993
- <i>Right. Call her tomorrow.</i>
- Yes, sir. 415-864-0256.

389
00:33:30,243 --> 00:33:31,494
- <i>Okay, buddy.</i>
- All right, yes.

390
00:33:31,745 --> 00:33:33,872
- Thank you very much.
- <i>We'll see you soon.</i>

391
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:37,792
864-0256.

392
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:41,212
4796. Janice.

393
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:46,092
- Chris.
- Hey.

394
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:48,553
Did you...? Have you seen
Linda and Christopher?

395
00:33:48,762 --> 00:33:50,639
- No. You catch the game last night?
- No, no.

396
00:33:50,847 --> 00:33:52,224
You didn't see that, 118, 1...?

397
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:54,643
Excuse me, did Linda
and Christopher come in here?

398
00:33:54,851 --> 00:33:58,480
- No, I haven't seen them.
- 119-120. Double overtime.

399
00:33:58,688 --> 00:34:00,815
Moons hits a three-pointer
at 17 seconds left.

400
00:34:01,024 --> 00:34:02,651
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

401
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:04,986
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.

402
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:07,822
- What's your problem with numbers?
- <i>864-2...</i>

403
00:34:08,031 --> 00:34:09,950
- And you owe me money.
- Yeah.

404
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,910
You owe me $14.

405
00:34:12,118 --> 00:34:13,995
I'm gonna get that to you.

406
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:17,332
I need my money.
I need my money.

407
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,502
Fourteen's a number.

408
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:50,198
Hey, don't you ever take my son
away from me again.

409
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:51,700
- You hear me?
- Leave me alone!

410
00:34:51,908 --> 00:34:53,702
Don't take my son away
from me again.

411
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,704
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

412
00:34:55,912 --> 00:34:59,207
Don't you walk away from me when
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

413
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:00,917
- Do you wanna leave?
- Yeah.

414
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,962
- You wanna leave?
- Yes, I want to leave!

415
00:35:05,255 --> 00:35:07,048
Get the hell out of here,
then, Linda.

416
00:35:07,257 --> 00:35:09,801
Get the hell out of here.
Christopher's staying with me.

417
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,304
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?

418
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,599
- You are so weak.
- No. I am not happy anymore.

419
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:18,393
- I'm just not happy!
- Then go get happy, Linda!

420
00:35:18,602 --> 00:35:19,978
Just go get happy.

421
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,397
But Christopher's living with me.

422
00:35:22,606 --> 00:35:24,399
- Stop!
- Did you hear what I said?

423
00:35:24,691 --> 00:35:27,068
Christopher's living with me!

424
00:35:53,303 --> 00:35:56,181
Hey. Come on, let's go.

425
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:58,725
- How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
- Hi.

426
00:36:02,395 --> 00:36:04,940
- Where's Mom?
- Look, just get your stuff.

427
00:36:05,148 --> 00:36:08,610
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.

428
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:10,862
Yeah, I know.

429
00:36:11,988 --> 00:36:16,618
I talked to Mom earlier.
Everything's fine, okay?

430
00:36:22,082 --> 00:36:24,292
Where do I sleep tonight?

431
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:26,628
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

432
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:29,464
- Yeah.
- All right. Because I'm happy.

433
00:36:29,673 --> 00:36:33,134
And if you're happy and I'm happy,
then that's a good thing, right?

434
00:36:33,343 --> 00:36:34,886
- Yeah.
- All right.

435
00:36:35,136 --> 00:36:37,138
You're sleeping with me.

436
00:36:37,347 --> 00:36:41,977
You're staying at home,
where you belong, all right?

437
00:36:56,491 --> 00:36:58,118
Christopher.

438
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:18,513
Hey, listen. I need the rent.

439
00:37:18,722 --> 00:37:20,140
I can't wait anymore.

440
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,726
Yeah, I'm good for that, Charlie.
I'm gonna get it.

441
00:37:22,976 --> 00:37:25,979
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission Inn motel?

442
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:27,731
It's half what you pay here.

443
00:37:27,981 --> 00:37:31,359
Listen, Chris. I need you out
of here in the morning.

444
00:37:32,736 --> 00:37:34,863
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?

445
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:36,281
I got painters coming in.

446
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:38,783
- All right, look. I need more time.
- No.

447
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:41,119
All right, I'll paint it myself.

448
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:46,708
All right, but I just... I gotta have some
more time... I got my son up in here.

449
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:56,384
All right. One week.
And you paint it.

450
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:49,896
Chris Gardner?

451
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,191
Yeah. What happened?

452
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,279
- Payable to the City of San Francisco.
- Does it have to be the full amount?

453
00:38:57,487 --> 00:39:00,949
You gotta pay each parking ticket,
otherwise, you're staying.

454
00:39:01,157 --> 00:39:02,617
This is all I got.

455
00:39:08,164 --> 00:39:10,834
We verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.

456
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:14,379
- What?
- You gotta stay until this thing clears.

457
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,133
No.

458
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:20,135
No, I can't spend the night here.

459
00:39:20,385 --> 00:39:22,929
- I have to pick up my son.
- We verify at 9:30 tomorrow.

460
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:27,767
Sir, I have a job interview at Dean
Witter at 10: 15 tomorrow morning.

461
00:39:27,976 --> 00:39:29,644
- I cannot stay...
- 9:30 tomorrow morning.

462
00:39:29,853 --> 00:39:32,188
What am I supposed to do
with my son?

463
00:39:32,397 --> 00:39:34,858
- Is there anyone else who can...?
- I take care of him.

464
00:39:35,108 --> 00:39:38,111
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.

465
00:39:42,198 --> 00:39:45,827
All right.
Can I have my phone call, please?

466
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,291
- Hello.
- <i>Hey.</i>

467
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:53,209
What do you want?

468
00:39:54,377 --> 00:39:59,007
You gotta get Christopher
from daycare. I can't.

469
00:40:00,216 --> 00:40:03,845
Just keep him for the night and I'm...
And... Just one night.

470
00:40:04,054 --> 00:40:06,097
<i>What happened?</i>

471
00:40:06,306 --> 00:40:09,768
I'll pick him up
from daycare tomorrow.

472
00:40:09,976 --> 00:40:11,728
I'm gonna go right...
You can just...

473
00:40:11,978 --> 00:40:14,231
You can drop him off
and I'll pick him up.

474
00:40:14,606 --> 00:40:18,026
- No.
- <i>Come on, Linda.</i>

475
00:40:18,276 --> 00:40:22,489
- <i>Why you doing that?</i>
- No, I wanna take him to the park.

476
00:40:22,948 --> 00:40:27,035
To Golden Gate
after daycare tomorrow.

477
00:40:28,328 --> 00:40:30,413
- How is he?
- He's fine.

478
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:33,708
All right, just... All right,
take him to the park...

479
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:37,712
...and bring him back, all right?

480
00:40:37,921 --> 00:40:40,882
All right, just bring me my son back.

481
00:40:41,841 --> 00:40:43,718
<i>Okay?</i>

482
00:40:43,927 --> 00:40:45,470
<i>Linda?</i>

483
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,556
I'll bring him back around 6.

484
00:40:49,432 --> 00:40:51,601
All right, all right.

485
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:53,687
Thank you.

486
00:40:56,106 --> 00:40:57,607
Bye.

487
00:41:22,465 --> 00:41:24,134
I'm okay?

488
00:41:59,085 --> 00:42:01,212
Excuse me. Excuse me.

489
00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:03,214
Yes, I did.

490
00:42:11,848 --> 00:42:13,642
Mr. Gardner.

491
00:42:20,774 --> 00:42:22,651
This way.

492
00:42:24,861 --> 00:42:26,905
It'll be right over there.

493
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:40,377
What is the one like that one?

494
00:43:02,065 --> 00:43:03,942
Chris Gardner.

495
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,196
Chris Gardner.

496
00:43:08,655 --> 00:43:10,615
How are you? Good morning.

497
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:15,078
Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.

498
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:17,247
Chris Gardner. Pleasure.

499
00:43:18,915 --> 00:43:21,001
I've been sitting there
for the last half-hour...

500
00:43:21,251 --> 00:43:22,752
...trying to come up with a story...

501
00:43:23,003 --> 00:43:27,215
...that would explain my being here
dressed like this.

502
00:43:27,424 --> 00:43:31,469
And I wanted to come up with a story
that would demonstrate qualities...

503
00:43:31,678 --> 00:43:36,516
...that I'm sure you all admire here,
like earnestness or diligence.

504
00:43:36,766 --> 00:43:41,396
Team-playing, something.
And I couldn't think of anything.

505
00:43:42,647 --> 00:43:44,357
So the truth is...

506
00:43:44,608 --> 00:43:47,193
...I was arrested
for failure to pay parking tickets.

507
00:43:47,444 --> 00:43:49,237
Parking tickets?

508
00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:53,325
And I ran all the way here from
the Polk Station, the police station.

509
00:43:53,575 --> 00:43:55,535
What were you doing
before you were arrested?

510
00:43:55,785 --> 00:43:58,747
I was painting my apartment.

511
00:43:58,955 --> 00:44:01,124
Is it dry now?

512
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:03,084
I hope so.

513
00:44:03,293 --> 00:44:05,003
Jay says you're pretty determined.

514
00:44:05,211 --> 00:44:07,589
He's been waiting outside
the front of the building...

515
00:44:07,797 --> 00:44:09,925
...with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.

516
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:13,511
- He said you're smart.
- Well, I like to think so.

517
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,723
- And you want to learn this business?
- Yes, sir, I wanna learn.

518
00:44:16,973 --> 00:44:18,934
Have you already started learning
on your own?

519
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:20,810
Absolutely.

520
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:23,355
- Jay?
- Yes, sir.

521
00:44:23,563 --> 00:44:25,649
How many times
have you seen Chris?

522
00:44:25,899 --> 00:44:28,526
I don't know.
One too many, apparently.

523
00:44:29,152 --> 00:44:31,488
- Was he ever dressed like this?
- No.

524
00:44:31,738 --> 00:44:33,907
No. Jacket and tie.

525
00:44:35,825 --> 00:44:38,703
First in your class in school?

526
00:44:38,954 --> 00:44:40,747
- High school?
- Yes, sir.

527
00:44:41,164 --> 00:44:44,167
- How many in the class?
- Twelve.

528
00:44:44,417 --> 00:44:46,127
It was a small town.

529
00:44:46,586 --> 00:44:49,923
- I'll say.
- But I was also first in my radar class...

530
00:44:50,173 --> 00:44:53,385
...in the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.

531
00:44:55,887 --> 00:44:57,681
Can I say something?

532
00:44:58,848 --> 00:45:00,559
I'm the type of person...

533
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:04,020
...if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer...

534
00:45:04,229 --> 00:45:06,481
...I'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.

535
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:08,024
But I bet you what.

536
00:45:08,275 --> 00:45:13,238
I know how to find the answer,
and I will find the answer.

537
00:45:14,447 --> 00:45:16,157
Is that fair enough?

538
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,618
Chris.

539
00:45:19,953 --> 00:45:23,665
What would you say
if a guy walked in for an interview...

540
00:45:23,873 --> 00:45:25,875
...without a shirt on...

541
00:45:26,126 --> 00:45:29,004
...and I hired him?
What would you say?

542
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,344
He must've had on
some really nice pants.

543
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:54,613
Chris, I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man...

544
00:45:54,821 --> 00:45:57,073
...but you pulled it off.
- Thank you, Mr. Twistle.

545
00:45:57,324 --> 00:45:59,701
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.

546
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:02,829
All right, so I'll let you know, Jay.

547
00:46:03,663 --> 00:46:05,916
"You'll let me know, Jay"?
What do you mean?

548
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:08,084
Yeah, I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime...

549
00:46:08,335 --> 00:46:10,420
What are you talking...?
You hounded me for this.

550
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:13,381
- You stood here...
- Listen, there's no salary.

551
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:14,966
- No.
- I was not aware of that.

552
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:16,760
My circumstances
have changed some...

553
00:46:17,344 --> 00:46:21,014
...and I need to be certain that I'll be...
- All right. Okay.

554
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:25,727
Tonight.

555
00:46:25,936 --> 00:46:29,439
I swear I will fill your spot. I promise.

556
00:46:29,689 --> 00:46:32,651
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?

557
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:35,820
Yes, an ass... A-hole.

558
00:46:36,112 --> 00:46:39,532
Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way.

559
00:46:42,452 --> 00:46:44,996
You are a piece of work.

560
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:47,582
Tonight.

561
00:46:55,882 --> 00:46:57,842
<i>There was no salary.</i>

562
00:46:58,051 --> 00:47:01,221
<i>Not even a reasonable promise</i>
<i>of a job.</i>

563
00:47:07,894 --> 00:47:12,524
<i>One intern was hired at the end</i>
<i>of the programme from a pool of 20.</i>

564
00:47:12,899 --> 00:47:14,150
<i>And if you weren't that guy...</i>

565
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:16,736
<i>... you couldn't even apply</i>
<i>the six months' training...</i>

566
00:47:16,987 --> 00:47:18,780
<i>... to another brokerage.</i>

567
00:47:21,324 --> 00:47:23,451
<i>The only resource I would have</i>
<i>for six months...</i>

568
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:27,581
<i>... would be my six scanners,</i>
<i>which I could still try to sell.</i>

569
00:47:28,832 --> 00:47:32,252
<i>If I sold them all,</i>
<i>maybe we might get by.</i>

570
00:48:19,132 --> 00:48:22,344
- I got him. I got him.
- He's asleep.

571
00:48:22,552 --> 00:48:24,095
All right.

572
00:48:30,477 --> 00:48:32,354
Okay, baby.

573
00:48:44,908 --> 00:48:46,701
I got it.

574
00:48:51,665 --> 00:48:53,708
I'm going to New York.

575
00:49:23,196 --> 00:49:25,490
My sister's boyfriend...

576
00:49:26,116 --> 00:49:29,578
...opened a restaurant,
and they may have a job for me there.

577
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,831
So I'm going to New York, Chris.

578
00:49:35,792 --> 00:49:37,711
Christopher's staying with me.

579
00:49:44,634 --> 00:49:47,470
I'm his mom, you know?

580
00:49:47,721 --> 00:49:49,764
He should be with his mom.

581
00:49:49,973 --> 00:49:51,850
I should have him, right?

582
00:49:52,726 --> 00:49:55,103
You know
you can't take care of him.

583
00:50:02,986 --> 00:50:04,529
What are you gonna do for money?

584
00:50:06,823 --> 00:50:12,287
I had an interview
at Dean Witter for an internship...

585
00:50:12,495 --> 00:50:13,955
...and I got it.

586
00:50:14,164 --> 00:50:16,708
So I'm gonna stand out
in my programme.

587
00:50:18,418 --> 00:50:20,503
Salesman to intern's backwards.

588
00:50:20,754 --> 00:50:22,631
No, it's not.

589
00:50:24,841 --> 00:50:26,468
I gotta go.

590
00:51:00,043 --> 00:51:02,420
Tell him I love him, okay?

591
00:51:03,046 --> 00:51:04,673
<i>And...</i>

592
00:51:10,637 --> 00:51:12,931
I know you'll take care of him, Chris.

593
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:14,849
I know that.

594
00:51:56,433 --> 00:51:59,185
- <i>Dean Witter.</i>
- Yes, hi.

595
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,231
Yes, I'd like to leave a message
for Mr. Jay Twistle.

596
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,985
- <i>Your name?</i>
- Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner.

597
00:52:07,193 --> 00:52:08,320
The message is:

598
00:52:08,528 --> 00:52:14,200
Thank you very much
for inviting me into the programme.

599
00:52:14,451 --> 00:52:20,248
I really appreciate it and I'd be
very pleased to accept your invitation.

600
00:52:20,457 --> 00:52:22,334
<i>Is that all?</i>

601
00:52:22,626 --> 00:52:24,169
Yes, that's it.

602
00:52:24,377 --> 00:52:26,129
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Thank you.

603
00:52:26,379 --> 00:52:27,923
<i>Bye.</i>

604
00:52:54,491 --> 00:52:55,784
- Be careful with that.
- What?

605
00:52:55,992 --> 00:52:58,787
Be care... Go ahead.

606
00:53:22,686 --> 00:53:25,564
- Are we there?
- Yep.

607
00:53:38,868 --> 00:53:41,413
- Hey, you know what today is?
- Yeah.

608
00:53:41,621 --> 00:53:43,290
- What?
- Saturday.

609
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,792
- You know what Saturday is, right?
- Yeah.

610
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:48,420
- What?
- Basketball.

611
00:53:48,628 --> 00:53:51,506
- You wanna go play some basketball?
- Okay.

612
00:53:51,715 --> 00:53:54,301
All right, then we're gonna go
sell a bone-density scanner.

613
00:53:54,551 --> 00:53:58,763
- How about that? Wanna do that?
- No.

614
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:02,350
Hey, Dad. I'm going pro.

615
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,021
I'm going pro.

616
00:54:07,314 --> 00:54:08,690
Okay.

617
00:54:08,899 --> 00:54:11,693
Yeah, I don't know, you know.

618
00:54:12,402 --> 00:54:14,654
You'll probably be about as good
as I was.

619
00:54:14,905 --> 00:54:17,949
That's kind of the way it works,
you know. I was below average.

620
00:54:18,325 --> 00:54:21,953
You know, so you'll probably
ultimately rank...

621
00:54:22,162 --> 00:54:24,789
...somewhere around there,
you know, so...

622
00:54:24,998 --> 00:54:27,876
...I really... You'll excel at
a lot of things, just not this.

623
00:54:28,084 --> 00:54:30,503
I don't want you shooting
this ball all day and night.

624
00:54:30,754 --> 00:54:32,214
- All right?
- All right.

625
00:54:32,422 --> 00:54:34,257
Okay.

626
00:54:35,425 --> 00:54:37,052
All right, go ahead.

627
00:55:00,867 --> 00:55:02,494
Hey.

628
00:55:05,705 --> 00:55:07,999
Don't ever let somebody tell you...

629
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:10,752
...you can't do something.

630
00:55:11,461 --> 00:55:13,588
Not even me.

631
00:55:14,965 --> 00:55:18,093
- All right?
- All right.

632
00:55:18,802 --> 00:55:20,971
You got a dream...

633
00:55:21,221 --> 00:55:23,431
...you gotta protect it.

634
00:55:24,558 --> 00:55:26,184
People can't do something
themselves...

635
00:55:26,393 --> 00:55:28,812
...they wanna tell you
you can't do it.

636
00:55:33,149 --> 00:55:36,945
If you want something,
go get it. Period.

637
00:55:44,995 --> 00:55:46,580
Let's go.

638
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:52,210
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

639
00:55:52,419 --> 00:55:54,880
I told you. Because I'm getting
a better job.

640
00:55:56,172 --> 00:55:59,175
- You gotta trust me, all right?
- I trust you.

641
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:02,137
All right, here.
Come on, come on. Keep up.

642
00:56:03,346 --> 00:56:06,308
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

643
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:09,060
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

644
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:11,479
I don't know, Christopher.

645
00:56:11,855 --> 00:56:13,773
Dad, listen to this.

646
00:56:14,024 --> 00:56:17,444
One day, a man was <i>drownding</i>
in the water.

647
00:56:17,694 --> 00:56:20,113
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"

648
00:56:20,363 --> 00:56:22,657
He said, " No, thank you.
God will save me."

649
00:56:22,866 --> 00:56:26,036
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"

650
00:56:26,286 --> 00:56:28,622
And he said, " No, thank you.
God will save me."

651
00:56:28,872 --> 00:56:30,957
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.

652
00:56:31,207 --> 00:56:34,377
And he said, " God,
why didn't you save me?"

653
00:56:34,628 --> 00:56:38,089
And God said, " I sent you
two big boats, you dummy."

654
00:56:39,382 --> 00:56:40,842
Do you like it?

655
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:43,762
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.

656
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:51,436
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Yes, sir.

657
00:56:51,645 --> 00:56:53,271
- You got the bill of sale here.
- Yes.

658
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,856
All the information you'll need.

659
00:56:55,065 --> 00:56:56,691
Thank you very much
for your business.

660
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,401
Thank you.

661
00:57:01,154 --> 00:57:03,865
One hundred, 200,
20, 40, 45, 46...

662
00:57:04,074 --> 00:57:05,700
...7, 8, 9, 10.

663
00:57:06,326 --> 00:57:07,369
Thank you.

664
00:57:09,746 --> 00:57:12,666
- Hey, you want one of those?
- No, it's okay.

665
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:15,168
Come on, you can have one.
Which one?

666
00:57:16,086 --> 00:57:19,589
- You like that one? How much?
- Twenty-five cents.

667
00:57:33,853 --> 00:57:37,524
<i>This part of my life</i>
<i>is called "Internship."</i>

668
00:57:37,774 --> 00:57:41,069
The 1200 building is
Medley Industrial and Sanko Oil.

669
00:57:41,278 --> 00:57:43,572
The building across the street
is Lee-Ray Shipping.

670
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,657
In a couple weeks,
you'll get call sheets...

671
00:57:45,865 --> 00:57:47,701
...with the phone numbers
of employees...

672
00:57:47,951 --> 00:57:51,037
...from every <i>Fortune 500</i> company
in the financial district.

673
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:54,040
You will be pooling
from 60 <i>Fortune</i> companies.

674
00:57:54,291 --> 00:57:57,002
You will mainly be cold-calling
potential clients.

675
00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:00,213
But if you have to have lunch
with them, have breakfast with them...

676
00:58:00,463 --> 00:58:03,675
...even baby-sit for them, do whatever
it takes to familiarize them...

677
00:58:03,884 --> 00:58:06,803
...with our packages. We need you
to match their needs and goals...

678
00:58:07,053 --> 00:58:11,933
...to one of our many financial plans.
In essence, you reel them in...

679
00:58:12,142 --> 00:58:14,269
...we'll cook the fish.

680
00:58:15,061 --> 00:58:17,105
Some of you are here
because you know somebody.

681
00:58:17,314 --> 00:58:19,691
Some of you are here because
you think you're somebody.

682
00:58:19,983 --> 00:58:22,444
There's one guy in here
who's gonna be somebody.

683
00:58:22,652 --> 00:58:24,863
That person's gonna be the guy...

684
00:58:25,071 --> 00:58:27,324
...who can turn this into this.

685
00:58:27,574 --> 00:58:30,619
Eight hundred thousand
in commission dollars.

686
00:58:31,161 --> 00:58:32,954
You, you, help me hand these out.

687
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:36,875
This is going to be your bible.

688
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:38,418
You'll eat with it.

689
00:58:38,668 --> 00:58:40,295
- You'll drink with it.
- <i>It was simple.</i>

690
00:58:40,503 --> 00:58:43,465
<i>X number of calls</i>
<i>equals X number of prospects.</i>

691
00:58:43,673 --> 00:58:46,635
<i>X number of prospects</i>
<i>equals X number of customers.</i>

692
00:58:46,927 --> 00:58:50,013
<i>X number of customers</i>
<i>equals X number of dollars...</i>

693
00:58:50,263 --> 00:58:52,390
- <i>... in the company's pocket.</i>
- Your board exam.

694
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:58,480
Last year, we had an intern score
a 96.4 percent on the written exam.

695
00:58:58,688 --> 00:59:02,025
He wasn't chosen.
It's not a simple pass-fail.

696
00:59:02,275 --> 00:59:05,654
It's an evaluation tool we use
to separate applicants.

697
00:59:05,862 --> 00:59:08,198
Be safe, score a hundred.

698
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:12,327
Okay, let's take a break.
Be back in 10.

699
00:59:21,628 --> 00:59:24,548
- Hey, Mr. Frohm. Chris.
- Hi.

700
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:26,967
- Chris, how are you?
- I'm good. How you doing?

701
00:59:27,217 --> 00:59:31,263
- Fine, thank you for asking.
- First day in there. It was exciting.

702
00:59:31,471 --> 00:59:33,557
You're not quitting on us yet,
are you?

703
00:59:33,807 --> 00:59:35,600
No, sir. Ten-minute break.

704
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:38,603
Pop out, get a quick bite and then
back in there for board prep.

705
00:59:38,812 --> 00:59:40,522
Oh, man, I remember mine.

706
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:43,233
And ours were only an hour,
not three like yours.

707
00:59:43,483 --> 00:59:45,860
We didn't do world markets,
didn't bother with taxes...

708
00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:49,447
...and it was still a pain in the ass.
Funny what you remember.

709
00:59:49,656 --> 00:59:51,825
There was a beautiful girl
in that class.

710
00:59:52,075 --> 00:59:54,369
I can't remember her name,
but her face was so...

711
00:59:54,578 --> 00:59:56,913
I've seen an old friend of mine.
Do you mind?

712
00:59:57,163 --> 00:59:59,916
- No, go ahead.
- Good talking to you, sir.

713
01:00:29,446 --> 01:00:33,366
Hey, asshole.
Are you all right, asshole?

714
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:36,536
Are you okay?
What were you thinking?

715
01:00:36,786 --> 01:00:38,914
What are you doing?
I could've killed you.

716
01:00:39,122 --> 01:00:41,416
I'm trying to cross the street.

717
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:45,086
- Well, you're all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

718
01:00:45,462 --> 01:00:46,963
- Where's my shoe?
- What?

719
01:00:47,214 --> 01:00:50,967
- You knocked off my shoe!
- I don't know where your shoe is.

720
01:00:52,469 --> 01:00:55,305
- Where's my damn shoe?
- I don't know.

721
01:01:01,144 --> 01:01:02,604
Hey.

722
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,775
- Did you see it? I lost my shoe.
- No, I'm sorry.

723
01:01:06,983 --> 01:01:10,320
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

724
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:13,448
- We should wait for the police.
- I gotta go to work.

725
01:01:14,157 --> 01:01:17,869
Hey, you just got hit by a car.
Go to the hospital.

726
01:01:18,245 --> 01:01:21,748
I'm in a competitive internship
at Dean Witter.

727
01:01:32,342 --> 01:01:33,969
Hey, man, you're missing a shoe.

728
01:01:34,177 --> 01:01:38,265
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thank you.

729
01:01:44,104 --> 01:01:45,480
Dad.

730
01:01:46,022 --> 01:01:49,025
- You don't have a shoe.
- Yeah, I know.

731
01:01:49,276 --> 01:01:52,320
- Wanna know what happened?
- Yeah.

732
01:01:53,029 --> 01:01:54,531
I got hit by a car.

733
01:01:54,781 --> 01:01:57,450
- You got hit by a car?
- Yep.

734
01:01:57,617 --> 01:02:01,246
- Where?
- Just right by the office.

735
01:02:01,454 --> 01:02:04,499
- No, where in your body?
- Like, the back of my legs.

736
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:06,543
- Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu.
- Goodbye.

737
01:02:06,793 --> 01:02:09,921
- Were you on the street?
- Yeah, I was running in the street.

738
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,008
Don't do that. You can get hurt.

739
01:02:13,383 --> 01:02:15,218
Yeah, thanks.

740
01:02:15,468 --> 01:02:17,178
I'll remember that next time.

741
01:02:19,472 --> 01:02:20,849
<i>And here I was again.</i>

742
01:02:21,057 --> 01:02:23,685

- While qualified persons...

743
01:02:23,977 --> 01:02:27,814
...qualified persons are interested in
investing and have money to invest.

744
01:02:28,064 --> 01:02:29,900
- Now, Chris.
- Yes, sir.

745
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,152
Would you get me
some coffee, please?

746
01:02:32,402 --> 01:02:36,239

749
01:02:41,912 --> 01:02:44,748
Okay, next time.
All right, I'm gonna hold you to that.

750
01:02:44,998 --> 01:02:46,291
Okay, yes, thank you.

I'm calling from Dean Witter.

757
01:03:02,432 --> 01:03:05,644
Yes, I have some very, very valuable
information on what's called a tax...

758
01:03:05,852 --> 01:03:08,104
Okay, thank you, sir.

763
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:25,247
- I'm waiting.
- All right, I got that for you, Ralph.

764
01:03:25,455 --> 01:03:27,540
I'm gonna get that for you.

- Yes, sir.

769
01:03:47,477 --> 01:03:50,146
- <i>From the doorman to the CEO.</i>
- Okay.

770

<i>They'd stay till 7,</i>
<i>but I had Christopher.</i>

<i>I had to do in six hours</i>

Good afternoon, my name is Chris
Gardner. I'm calling from Dean Witter.

773
01:04:00,323 --> 01:04:01,908
<i>In order not to waste any time...</i>

774
01:04:02,158 --> 01:04:04,286
<i>... I wasn't hanging up the phone</i>
<i>in between calls.</i>

775
01:04:04,494 --> 01:04:06,580
Okay, thank you very much.

776
01:04:08,164 --> 01:04:10,333
<i>I realized that</i>

<i>... I gained another eight minutes</i>

Why, good morning to you,
my name is Chris Gardner.

779
01:04:15,171 --> 01:04:17,674
- I'm calling from Dean Witter.
- <i>I wasn't drinking water...</i>

780
01:04:17,924 --> 01:04:19,926
<i>... so I didn't waste any time</i>
<i>in the bathroom.</i>

781
01:04:20,176 --> 01:04:22,304
Yes, I'd love to have
the opportunity...

782
01:04:22,512 --> 01:04:25,599
Okay, no problem at all, sir.
Thank you very much.

783
01:04:25,849 --> 01:04:27,142
<i>But even doing all this...</i>

784
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:31,438
<i>... after two months, I still didn't have</i>
<i>time to work my way up a sheet.</i>

785
01:04:44,701 --> 01:04:47,162
We're feeling really confident
about that one as well.

790
01:04:55,128 --> 01:04:56,796
<i>Just a moment.</i>

791
01:04:58,715 --> 01:05:00,425

Hello, sir. My name's Chris Gardner.
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

793
01:05:03,803 --> 01:05:05,513
- <i>Yeah, Chris.</i>
- Yes, Mr. Ribbon...

794
01:05:05,722 --> 01:05:09,142
...I would love to have the opportunity
to discuss some of our products.

795
01:05:09,392 --> 01:05:11,770
I'm certain that I could
be of some assistance to you.

796
01:05:11,978 --> 01:05:13,813
<i>Can you be here in 20 minutes?</i>

797
01:05:15,148 --> 01:05:18,026
- Twenty minutes. Absolutely.
- <i>Just had someone cancel.</i>

<i>I can give you a few minutes</i>

- <i>Monday Night Football, buddy.</i>
- Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

800

- Bye-bye.

801

Excuse me. Thank you.

802
01:05:31,164 --> 01:05:32,707
- Chris, what's up?
- Hey, Mr. Frakesh.

803
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:34,209
Hey, do you have five minutes?

804
01:05:34,417 --> 01:05:36,086
I got a green light
from Walter Ribbon...

805
01:05:36,336 --> 01:05:39,381
I'm supposed to present commodities
to Bromer. Could you move my car?

806
01:05:39,589 --> 01:05:42,842
That'd really help me out. It's on
Samson, half block, silver Caprice.

807
01:05:43,093 --> 01:05:46,221
Just move it to the other side. They're
street sweeping. There's spaces.

808
01:05:46,429 --> 01:05:49,015
Hang on to these.
I have backups in my desk.

809
01:05:49,266 --> 01:05:50,725
And you have to jimmy that.

810
01:05:50,934 --> 01:05:52,894
- Jimmy what?
- You have to jimmy the key.

811
01:05:53,103 --> 01:05:57,774
And the other doors don't unlock.
You have to jimmy it.

812
01:06:13,957 --> 01:06:15,709
Come on, I'm jimmying it.

813
01:06:18,962 --> 01:06:20,380
Oh, no!

814
01:06:21,715 --> 01:06:23,133
Come on.

815
01:06:36,229 --> 01:06:38,231
- Here's the file, Mr. Ribbon.
- Thank you.

816
01:06:43,153 --> 01:06:45,947
- Thanks a lot.
- Oh, yeah, thanks. Great idea.

817
01:06:50,243 --> 01:06:53,204
No, no, no!

818
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:06,092
Rachel, get Ristuccia on the phone
for me, please.

819
01:07:54,558 --> 01:07:55,725
- Hi.
- Hi.

820
01:07:55,976 --> 01:07:58,520
I'm Chris Gardner. I have
an appointment with Mr. Ribbon.

821
01:07:58,728 --> 01:08:00,146
Oh, you just missed him.

822
01:08:02,732 --> 01:08:04,276
Thank you.

823
01:08:28,425 --> 01:08:32,262
- What's that?
- Just filling out a cheque...

824
01:08:32,512 --> 01:08:34,973
...paying some bills...

825
01:08:35,181 --> 01:08:37,225
...and a parking ticket.

826
01:08:39,102 --> 01:08:41,146
We don't have a car anymore.

827
01:08:41,354 --> 01:08:43,565
Yep, I know.

828
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:50,155
I'm gonna need to take you
with me this weekend.

829
01:08:50,363 --> 01:08:52,616
A couple of doctors' offices.

830
01:08:53,116 --> 01:08:56,912
- On sales calls, okay?
- Okay.

831
01:08:59,873 --> 01:09:03,835
Then, possibly,
we'll go to the football game.

832
01:09:04,044 --> 01:09:06,880
- Really?
- Possibly.

833
01:09:07,297 --> 01:09:09,758
- All right?
- All right.

834
01:09:09,966 --> 01:09:12,052
Come on, finish up.

835
01:09:12,552 --> 01:09:15,513
- Are you sure?
- Possibly.

836
01:09:16,723 --> 01:09:18,308
Really?

837
01:09:48,255 --> 01:09:52,801
- Are you bringing it to the game?
- Yeah, I don't wanna leave it.

838
01:09:53,009 --> 01:09:55,971
And maybe
we're going to the game.

839
01:09:57,514 --> 01:10:01,434
- Where are we going now?
- To see someone about my job.

840
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:03,478
I don't understand.

841
01:10:03,687 --> 01:10:06,898
- You don't understand what?
- Are we going to the game?

842
01:10:07,107 --> 01:10:09,651
I said possibly
we're going to the game.

843
01:10:09,859 --> 01:10:12,195
- You know what "possibly" means?
- Like probably.

844
01:10:12,445 --> 01:10:15,031
No, "probably" means there's
a good chance that we're going.

845
01:10:15,282 --> 01:10:17,993
"Possibly" means we might,
we might not.

846
01:10:18,201 --> 01:10:21,246
- What does "probably" mean?
- It means we have a good chance.

847
01:10:21,454 --> 01:10:22,831
And what does "possibly" mean?

848
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:25,500
- I know what it means.
- What does it mean?

849
01:10:25,709 --> 01:10:28,253
It means that we're not going
to the game.

850
01:10:29,963 --> 01:10:33,174
- How did you get so smart?
- Because you're smart.

851
01:10:38,305 --> 01:10:41,016
- Are we there?
- Yeah.

852
01:10:46,563 --> 01:10:48,106
- Mr. Ribbon.
- Yes?

853
01:10:48,315 --> 01:10:51,192
How are you, sir?
Chris Gardner. Dean Witter.

854
01:10:51,735 --> 01:10:54,195
- Oh, hi. Hi.
- This is my son, Christopher.

855
01:10:54,404 --> 01:10:55,906
- Hi.
- Hey, Christopher.

856
01:10:56,156 --> 01:10:58,533
- What are you doing up here?
- I came to apologise...

857
01:10:58,742 --> 01:11:01,369
...for missing our appointment.
- You didn't need to come up.

858
01:11:01,578 --> 01:11:04,206
We were in the neighbourhood
visiting a very close friend...

859
01:11:04,414 --> 01:11:07,918
...and I wanted to take this opportunity
to say thank you for your time.

860
01:11:08,168 --> 01:11:10,962
- I know you probably waited for me.
- Little bit.

861
01:11:11,171 --> 01:11:13,715
I want you to know
that I do not take that for granted.

862
01:11:13,924 --> 01:11:15,967
Oh, come on. What's that?

863
01:11:16,218 --> 01:11:19,638
Oh, it's an Osteo National
bone-density scanner.

864
01:11:20,472 --> 01:11:23,391
A company I bought into
prior to going to work at Witter.

865
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,228
- I have a meeting after the game.
- You're going to the game?

866
01:11:26,436 --> 01:11:28,230
- Yeah.
- Possibly.

867
01:11:29,272 --> 01:11:30,607
- Possibly.
- We're going too.

868
01:11:30,857 --> 01:11:32,484
I'm taking my son, Tim.
My 12-year-old.

869
01:11:32,692 --> 01:11:33,818
We were just leaving. Tim!

870
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:36,029
Listen, we'll get out of your way.

871
01:11:36,279 --> 01:11:38,949
Again, thank you very much,
and I'm sorry about the other day.

872
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,243
And I hope that
we can reschedule for later.

873
01:11:41,451 --> 01:11:42,953
- You got it.
- Thank you very much.

874
01:11:43,203 --> 01:11:44,829
You take care. Here, come on.

875
01:11:45,038 --> 01:11:46,373
- Say bye-bye, Chris.
- Bye.

876
01:11:46,623 --> 01:11:48,208
Bye, Christopher.

877
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:49,918
Hey, you guys wanna
come with us?

878
01:11:50,126 --> 01:11:53,088
- What...? To Candlestick?
- We're going now. Come with us.

879
01:11:53,296 --> 01:11:56,424
- Where are your seats?
- We've... We're upper deck.

880
01:11:56,633 --> 01:11:57,884
We got a box. Come on.

881
01:11:58,134 --> 01:12:00,262
- You wanna sit in the box?
- No.

882
01:12:01,471 --> 01:12:05,392
It's not actually a box.
It's, you know, a private section.

883
01:12:05,642 --> 01:12:08,061
It's more comfortable.
You wanna go?

884
01:12:08,728 --> 01:12:12,440
- Okay.
- Okay, kids in the back.

885
01:12:13,066 --> 01:12:15,277
Hey, why don't you just put that
in your car?

886
01:12:17,988 --> 01:12:20,949
- Yeah, okay. Sure, sure.
- We don't have a car.

887
01:12:21,825 --> 01:12:24,035
- Oh, my...
- What happened?

888
01:12:24,244 --> 01:12:25,620
I think I got stung by a bee.

889
01:12:25,829 --> 01:12:28,748
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah. Goodness. I'm fine.

890
01:12:28,999 --> 01:12:31,543
- You're not allergic or anything?
- No, no, no.

891
01:12:31,793 --> 01:12:35,088
- Where'd he get you?
- Just right at the back of my head.

892
01:12:35,338 --> 01:12:37,716
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Christopher.

893
01:12:37,924 --> 01:12:40,051
- Does it hurt?
- Christopher, I'm fine.

894
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:44,139
- Let me see.
- Christopher, sit back. Sit back.

01:13:12,042 --> 01:13:13,835
<i>Whether I'd make it.</i>

904
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,841
<i>And Walter Ribbon</i>
<i>and his Pacific Bell pension money...</i>

905
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:21,384
<i>... which was millions.</i>

906
01:13:21,635 --> 01:13:23,220
Yeah!

907
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:26,598
<i>It was a way to another place.</i>

908
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:29,476
Wow, this is...

909
01:13:29,893 --> 01:13:31,811
This is the way
to watch a football game here.

910
01:13:32,062 --> 01:13:35,106
- Thank you very much for this, really.
- Hey, it's my pleasure, Chris.

911
01:13:35,315 --> 01:13:38,568
And, Mr. Ribbon, I also wanna thank
you for giving me the opportunity...

912
01:13:38,818 --> 01:13:41,655
...to discuss the asset management
capabilities of Dean Witter...

913
01:13:41,988 --> 01:13:44,115
...which we believe
to be far superior...

914
01:13:44,324 --> 01:13:46,910
...to anything you got going
over at Morgan Stanley.

915
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,954
Really, I think you're gonna
be blown away.

916
01:13:49,496 --> 01:13:54,209
Point blank, Dean Witter needs to be
managing your retirement portfolio.

917
01:13:54,417 --> 01:13:56,962
You know, I didn't have any notion
that you were new there.

918
01:13:57,170 --> 01:14:00,632
I like you, but there's not a chance
I'm gonna let you direct our fund.

919
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,926
That's just not gonna happen
anytime soon, buddy.

920
01:14:03,134 --> 01:14:06,263
So, you know, come on, relax.
Enjoy the game. Go, go, go!

921
01:14:07,264 --> 01:14:08,515
Yes!

922
01:14:11,518 --> 01:14:13,562
Yes! Yeah!

923
01:14:18,275 --> 01:14:19,317
- Here you go.
- All right.

924
01:14:19,526 --> 01:14:21,278
I've had a few ideas
already, absolutely.

925
01:14:21,528 --> 01:14:24,072
- Chris, I'll talk to you later.
- I'm gonna give you a call.

926
01:14:24,281 --> 01:14:25,949
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Give me a call.

927
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:27,742
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

928
01:14:34,624 --> 01:14:37,335
- Bye.
- Bye, Christopher.

929
01:15:06,823 --> 01:15:11,369
<i>After four months, we had sold</i>

930
01:15:12,662 --> 01:15:14,039
<i>It seemed we were making it.</i>

931
01:15:14,998 --> 01:15:16,208
What's the...

...fastest animal in the world?
- Jackrabbit.

933

<i>It seemed we were doing good.</i>

934
01:15:24,925 --> 01:15:26,676
<i>Until one day...</i>

935
01:15:26,968 --> 01:15:28,637
<i>... that day...</i>

936
01:15:29,179 --> 01:15:31,139
<i>... that letter brought me</i>

<i>This part of my life is called</i>
<i>"Paying Taxes."</i>

938
01:15:43,193 --> 01:15:44,486
<i>If you didn't pay them...</i>

939
01:15:44,736 --> 01:15:47,614
<i>... the government could stick</i>

941
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:50,659
Dad.

942
01:15:50,867 --> 01:15:52,869
<i>No warning. Nothing.</i>

943
01:15:53,078 --> 01:15:56,206
It can't be too late.
That's my money.

944
01:15:56,456 --> 01:15:59,543
How is somebody just gonna
just take my money?

945
01:15:59,876 --> 01:16:01,169
I was... I was...

946
01:16:01,419 --> 01:16:04,673
Listen, I...
That's all the money that I have.

947
01:16:04,881 --> 01:16:09,177
You cannot go into my bank acc...
No...

948
01:16:09,386 --> 01:16:11,763
<i>It was the 25th of September.</i>

949
01:16:11,972 --> 01:16:13,682
<i>I remember that day.</i>

950
01:16:13,932 --> 01:16:15,976
<i>Because that's the day</i>
<i>that I found out...</i>

951
01:16:16,226 --> 01:16:21,314
<i>... there was only 21 dollars</i>

952
01:16:21,565 --> 01:16:23,191
<i>I was broke.</i>

953
01:16:33,577 --> 01:16:35,871
- Dressed yet?
- No.

954
01:16:39,749 --> 01:16:43,086
Chris! Chris!
Don't jerk me around, okay, Chris?

955
01:16:43,336 --> 01:16:46,047
I'm not jerking you around, Ralph,
all right? I'm gonna get it.

956
01:16:46,256 --> 01:16:49,843
- I need that money now, not later.
- When I get it, you get it, Ralph.

957
01:16:50,093 --> 01:16:51,928
Now!

958
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,684
Hey, what's happening, man?

959
01:16:57,934 --> 01:17:00,770
Wayne, I need to get
that $14 from you.

960
01:17:02,439 --> 01:17:04,316
I thought I didn't owe you that now.

961
01:17:04,524 --> 01:17:07,569
- What? Why?
- Why what?

962
01:17:07,777 --> 01:17:10,155
Why would you think
you don't owe me my money?

963
01:17:10,363 --> 01:17:12,324
I helped you move.

964
01:17:14,618 --> 01:17:17,454
You drove me two blocks, Wayne.

965
01:17:17,704 --> 01:17:19,414
That's 200 yards.

966
01:17:19,623 --> 01:17:21,583
It's been four months, Wayne.

967
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:25,378
I need my money. I need my money.
I need my money right now.

968
01:17:25,629 --> 01:17:27,923
- I don't have it, man. I'm sorry.
- Go get my money.

969
01:17:28,131 --> 01:17:30,342
- Wayne, get my mo...
- I really don't, man. It's $14.

970
01:17:30,592 --> 01:17:32,260
It's my $14!
Go get my money!

971
01:17:32,469 --> 01:17:35,013
- All of this for $14.
- Get my money, Wayne.

972
01:17:53,406 --> 01:17:55,533
Dad, look at me!

973
01:17:55,992 --> 01:17:57,702
Dad.

974
01:17:58,745 --> 01:18:02,249
- Should I go?
- Sure, man. Why not?

975
01:18:18,348 --> 01:18:19,349
- Stay here.
- Dad, look.

976
01:18:19,599 --> 01:18:21,142
- No, no. Stay right here.
- Dad.

977
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:24,145
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me?

978
01:18:29,276 --> 01:18:32,737
- Dad, where you going?
- Hey, what did I say?

979
01:18:35,782 --> 01:18:37,409
Dad!

980
01:18:37,617 --> 01:18:40,996
Dad, wait! Dad!

981
01:18:49,212 --> 01:18:51,214
- Dad.
- I gotta...

982
01:18:51,423 --> 01:18:54,801
I gotta get back to the '60s, man.
That's what I wanna do.

983
01:18:55,051 --> 01:18:59,306
When I was younger. I wanna see
Jimi Hendrix do that guitar on fire.

984
01:19:02,392 --> 01:19:05,061
Bring back my time machine!

985
01:19:06,396 --> 01:19:08,064
Bring my time machine back!

986
01:19:16,948 --> 01:19:20,535
- Dad, where are we going?
- Be quiet.

987
01:19:21,161 --> 01:19:23,872
Go get your things. Go.

988
01:19:47,145 --> 01:19:48,772
- Chris?
- Yes.

989
01:19:49,022 --> 01:19:52,901
Dr. Telm can't get back to meet you.
I'm sorry.

990
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,540
Where are we going now?

991
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:10,585
We gotta... We gotta
see somebody else.

992
01:20:12,712 --> 01:20:14,798
I'm tired.

993
01:20:16,841 --> 01:20:18,426
I know.

994
01:20:25,809 --> 01:20:29,938
Doesn't seem to be functioning
right now.

995
01:20:30,397 --> 01:20:32,649
- I have to go now, Chris.
- No, no, no.

996
01:20:32,899 --> 01:20:36,736
Just give me a second. I'm sure
I'm gonna be able to figure it out.

997
01:20:38,572 --> 01:20:40,824
Chris. Chris, just come back
when it's working.

998
01:20:41,074 --> 01:20:43,869
- No, no. I have to fix it now.
- No.

999
01:20:44,077 --> 01:20:49,291
Look, I'll still be putting money
in the office, then, all right?

1000
01:20:49,499 --> 01:20:51,626
I really have to go, Chris.

1001
01:20:52,878 --> 01:20:54,546
Thank you. Thank you.

1002
01:20:54,754 --> 01:20:56,631
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

1003
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,508
I'll see you soon.

1004
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,938
Why are our things here?

1005
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:55,565
Dad.

1006
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:40,819
- Let's go. Come on.
- Where?

1007
01:22:42,445 --> 01:22:44,739
- Just out of here.
- Why?

1008
01:22:44,948 --> 01:22:47,951
- We can't stay here tonight.
- Yes, we can. Open the door!

1009
01:22:48,201 --> 01:22:51,121
- Did you hear what I said? Let's go.
- Open the door!

1010
01:22:52,831 --> 01:22:56,710
Hey, did you hear what I said?
Stop it.

1011
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,420
Stop it.

1012
01:23:02,674 --> 01:23:04,092
Come on.

1013
01:23:13,226 --> 01:23:14,686
Come on.

1014
01:23:31,661 --> 01:23:33,330

Wayne!

1017
01:24:01,358 --> 01:24:05,070
Get up. Stand up. Come on.

1018
01:24:20,919 --> 01:24:22,963
Where are we going?

1019
01:24:25,131 --> 01:24:28,468
- Dad, where are we going?
- I don't know.

1020
01:24:43,984 --> 01:24:46,361
It's not a time machine.

1021
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:47,988
Dad.

1022
01:24:48,405 --> 01:24:49,698
It's not a time machine.

1023
01:24:49,906 --> 01:24:53,159
The guy said it was a time machine.
It's not a time machine. He was wrong.

1024
01:24:53,577 --> 01:24:55,912
- What guy?
- The guy. He was at the park.

1025
01:24:56,162 --> 01:24:58,039
He said it was a time machine.

1026
01:25:04,421 --> 01:25:05,630
Yes, it is.

1027
01:25:07,257 --> 01:25:09,009
No, it's not.

1028
01:25:11,011 --> 01:25:12,971
- It is.
- No, it's not.

1029
01:25:19,227 --> 01:25:23,732
All we gotta do is push
this black button right here.

1030
01:25:26,943 --> 01:25:28,069
Wanna push it?

1031
01:25:32,616 --> 01:25:34,242
Okay.

1032
01:25:35,785 --> 01:25:37,370
Come on.

1033
01:25:38,872 --> 01:25:40,498
Come on, man.

1034
01:25:46,213 --> 01:25:47,255
Right here.

1035
01:25:47,631 --> 01:25:49,257
Wait a minute.
Where you wanna go?

1036
01:25:49,633 --> 01:25:51,593
I don't know.
Some place from before.

1037
01:25:52,135 --> 01:25:53,386
You gotta close your eyes.

1038
01:25:53,678 --> 01:25:55,555
You close your eyes. I wanna see.

1039
01:25:57,724 --> 01:26:00,143
All right, come on.
We'll push it together.

1040
01:26:05,982 --> 01:26:07,776
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

1041
01:26:08,485 --> 01:26:10,654
It takes a few seconds.

1042
01:26:13,073 --> 01:26:14,950
Oh, my goodness.

1043
01:26:15,158 --> 01:26:17,369
Open, open, open!

1044
01:26:20,789 --> 01:26:23,416
- What is it?
- Dinosaurs.

1045
01:26:23,667 --> 01:26:25,794
- Where?
- You don't see all these dinosaurs?

1046
01:26:27,170 --> 01:26:30,840
Look around.
Look at all these dinosaurs.

1047
01:26:32,592 --> 01:26:34,970
- Do you see them?
- Yeah.

1048
01:26:35,178 --> 01:26:36,596
Wait. Come on, come on.

1049
01:26:36,846 --> 01:26:38,139
- Wait, watch out.
- What is it?

1050
01:26:38,348 --> 01:26:40,392
Don't step in the fire.
We're cavemen.

1051
01:26:40,767 --> 01:26:42,978
We need this fire,
because there's no electricity...

1052
01:26:43,228 --> 01:26:44,604
...and it's cold out here, okay?

1053
01:26:45,313 --> 01:26:47,649
- Watch out!
- Whoa! Oh, my good... A <i>T. rex.</i>

1054
01:26:47,899 --> 01:26:51,486
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Get it.

1055
01:26:52,529 --> 01:26:55,574
- We gotta find someplace safe.
- Like what?

1056
01:26:55,782 --> 01:26:57,742
We need a cave.

1057
01:26:57,951 --> 01:26:59,035
A cave?

1058
01:26:59,286 --> 01:27:01,288
- We gotta find a cave. Come on.
- Okay.

1059
01:27:01,496 --> 01:27:03,248
Come on, come on.

1060
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:06,209
Watch your back! Look out.

1061
01:27:06,459 --> 01:27:08,461
Here it is. Here's a cave. Come on.

1062
01:27:08,712 --> 01:27:11,548
Right here, right here.
Go, go, go.

1063
01:27:11,798 --> 01:27:13,008
Go ahead. Get in.

1064
01:27:13,216 --> 01:27:15,051
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1065
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:22,434
- Are we safe?
- Yeah, I think so.

1066
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:32,045
Hey.

1067
01:28:33,630 --> 01:28:35,257
- How you doing, Jay?
- I'm doing good.

1068
01:28:35,465 --> 01:28:36,925
How are you getting along?

1069
01:28:37,133 --> 01:28:39,302
- Good. I'm good.
- You doing good?

1070
01:28:39,511 --> 01:28:42,055
- How you doing?
- I'm doing great.

1071
01:28:43,181 --> 01:28:44,808
Where you going?

1072
01:28:48,144 --> 01:28:51,106
I... Sacramento.

1073
01:28:51,815 --> 01:28:54,442
Because I'm trying to move
a couple guys from...

1074
01:28:54,651 --> 01:28:57,279
They're at PacBell,
and I'm trying to bring them over...

1075
01:28:57,487 --> 01:28:58,738
Get them over to us.

1076
01:28:58,989 --> 01:29:00,657
So they got me
going out there golfing.

1077
01:29:00,866 --> 01:29:02,701
Awesome.

1078
01:29:02,951 --> 01:29:04,870
Hey, let them win a round.

1079
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:12,043
Deborah, someone's asking for you.

1080
01:29:12,294 --> 01:29:15,338
- Where?
- He's outside. Please come with me.

1081
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:26,683
- Hi.
- How you doing?

1082
01:29:28,101 --> 01:29:30,645
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1083
01:29:32,856 --> 01:29:34,482
We need a room.

1084
01:29:35,108 --> 01:29:38,069
Just until I can fix this and sell it.

1085
01:29:38,278 --> 01:29:40,906
- There's just some glass work.
- Let me stop you right there.

1086
01:29:41,114 --> 01:29:43,575
- I wish I could help you...
- This is my son, Christopher.

1087
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:45,911
- He's 5 years old.
- Hi, baby.

1088
01:29:46,161 --> 01:29:49,164
- We need some place to stay.
- Okay, and I would love to help you...

1089
01:29:49,372 --> 01:29:52,250
...but we don't take men here.
It's only women and children.

1090
01:29:52,459 --> 01:29:55,503
He can stay here, but you have
to find someplace else to go.

1091
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:57,130
We gotta stay together.

1092
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:58,673
We got... We're...

1093
01:29:58,882 --> 01:30:00,717
- Okay, listen.
- You gotta have some place...

1094
01:30:00,967 --> 01:30:03,803
Try Glide Memorial.
The building books up at 5.

1095
01:30:04,054 --> 01:30:05,513
So you hurry up. There's a line.

1096
01:30:05,722 --> 01:30:09,100
- And where is it? Come on.
- Ellis and Jones.

1097
01:30:44,344 --> 01:30:49,975
Hey, everybody. We have
four spots left, and that's all.

1098
01:30:50,392 --> 01:30:53,270
- Man.
- Hey, come on, man.

1099
01:30:53,478 --> 01:30:54,688
- Come on.
- Come on, what?

1100
01:30:54,938 --> 01:30:56,481
- Hey, that's my spot.
- Back off.

1101
01:30:56,690 --> 01:30:59,109
Come on, don't do this to me.
Don't...

1102
01:31:01,528 --> 01:31:03,071
Dad!

1103
01:31:03,530 --> 01:31:05,574
Stop it! Break it up!
Break it up!

1104
01:31:05,782 --> 01:31:07,367
Stop! Stop!

1105
01:31:07,576 --> 01:31:09,870
Get out of line, both of you.
Both of you.

1106
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:12,664
I was here first. They told me
that we had to be on time.

1107
01:31:12,956 --> 01:31:14,916
I got here on time. I was in line.

1108
01:31:15,125 --> 01:31:16,877
I came from work, I got my son.

1109
01:31:17,127 --> 01:31:19,588
I was here on time.
We were here on time!

1110
01:31:19,796 --> 01:31:21,423
He sliced in front of him in line.

1111
01:31:21,631 --> 01:31:23,925
- Who did?
- He did.

1112
01:31:24,217 --> 01:31:28,722
Come on, come on, Rodney.
Come on. Let's go. Get out of line.

1113
01:31:37,981 --> 01:31:39,941
That's it. No more.

1114
01:31:46,990 --> 01:31:49,951
- What's your favourite colour?
- Green.

1115
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:51,411
Green?

1116
01:31:51,661 --> 01:31:54,623
- What do you like that's green?
- Trees.

1117
01:31:54,831 --> 01:31:57,792
Trees. What else?

1118
01:31:58,001 --> 01:31:59,461
Holly.

1119
01:32:01,254 --> 01:32:05,217
- Holly. What's holly?
- The Christmas stuff.

1120
01:32:06,009 --> 01:32:07,969
Christmas stuff.

1121
01:32:08,762 --> 01:32:10,513
What's that?

1122
01:32:13,767 --> 01:32:16,645
I guess they want us to go to sleep.

1123
01:32:23,193 --> 01:32:28,198
Here you go. We gotta make sure
Captain America's warm in there.

1124
01:32:28,698 --> 01:32:30,367
Can he breathe?

1125
01:32:30,617 --> 01:32:32,827
- He's good?
- Yeah.

1126
01:32:33,286 --> 01:32:35,288
- I gotta go work on the scanner...
- Don't go.

1127
01:32:35,539 --> 01:32:38,667
No, no, no. I'm gonna be
right outside the door.

1128
01:32:38,875 --> 01:32:43,004
All right? I'm just gonna be right there.
I'll leave the door open a little bit.

1129
01:32:43,547 --> 01:32:46,216
And I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1130
01:32:46,383 --> 01:32:48,885
I wanna go home.

1131
01:32:50,971 --> 01:32:54,766
But that's why I gotta
work on the scanner.

1132
01:32:55,725 --> 01:32:57,477
All right?

1133
01:32:57,727 --> 01:32:59,604
I'm gonna go out there.

1134
01:32:59,813 --> 01:33:03,191
I'm gonna leave the door open.
I'll be right up the stairs.

1135
01:33:04,317 --> 01:33:05,986
I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1136
01:33:06,987 --> 01:33:09,072
- All right?
- All right.

1137
01:33:09,322 --> 01:33:11,616
You gotta trust me, okay?

1138
01:33:11,825 --> 01:33:13,869
You gotta trust me.

1139
01:33:14,744 --> 01:33:17,372
I trust you. I trust you.

1140
01:33:17,581 --> 01:33:19,040
I trust you.

1141
01:33:19,249 --> 01:33:22,210
- I can't hear you.
- I trust you. I trust you.

1142
01:33:26,089 --> 01:33:27,757
Give me a kiss.

1143
01:33:40,437 --> 01:33:43,398
- I'll just be a little while, okay?
- All right.

1144
01:33:43,857 --> 01:33:46,318
- I'll be right here.
- Okay.

1145
01:33:46,526 --> 01:33:48,737
- Can you still hear me?
- Yeah.

1146
01:33:48,945 --> 01:33:50,405
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

1147
01:33:50,697 --> 01:33:53,116
- Do you trust me?
- Yeah.

1148
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:41,998
- Yeah.
- Like that?

1149
01:34:42,249 --> 01:34:45,877
- Yeah, put that...
- Then you go like that.

1150
01:34:46,086 --> 01:34:49,589
- Is that okay?
- I don't know. What do you think?

1151
01:34:49,839 --> 01:34:50,840
Good.

1152
01:34:52,175 --> 01:34:54,427
Let's go. Get your stuff.

1153
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:58,640
- Dad, why don't you leave it?
- We can't.

1154
01:34:58,848 --> 01:35:00,976
We're gonna have
a different room later.

1155
01:35:01,184 --> 01:35:02,727
Go.

1156
01:35:08,108 --> 01:35:09,442
Hey, Chris.

1157
01:35:09,693 --> 01:35:12,988
- Hey, good morning, Mr. Frakesh.
- What's up?

1158
01:35:14,030 --> 01:35:15,156
Work trip.

1159
01:35:15,365 --> 01:35:17,659
Your wife, Martha, works at
PacBell also, correct?

1160
01:35:17,868 --> 01:35:19,619
- Yes, she does.
- And you guys are both...

1161
01:35:19,870 --> 01:35:21,496
...looking to retire at the same time?

1162
01:35:21,705 --> 01:35:23,790
We'd like to retire
and maintain our lifestyle...

1163
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,417
...without paying a lot of taxes.

1164
01:35:25,625 --> 01:35:29,129
So basically, you want nobody's hands
in your pockets but your own?

1165
01:35:29,713 --> 01:35:31,631
Are you familiar with
tax-free municipal?

1166
01:35:31,882 --> 01:35:33,717
<i>I learned to finish my work quickly.</i>

1167
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:36,219
<i>I had to finish quickly.</i>

1168
01:35:36,553 --> 01:35:40,056
<i>To get in line at Glide by 5.</i>

1169
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:45,687
Come on.

1170
01:35:46,229 --> 01:35:47,772
Come on.

1171
01:35:51,902 --> 01:35:54,654
Hold that bus! Hold the bus!

1172
01:35:55,572 --> 01:35:57,282
My Captain America!

1173
01:35:57,574 --> 01:35:59,826
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1174
01:36:00,076 --> 01:36:03,288
Stop it! Shut up! Shut up!

1175
01:36:05,665 --> 01:36:07,667
- Why don't you let the lady in?
- Hey, back up.

1176
01:36:07,918 --> 01:36:10,921
- Hey, man, that's not cool.
- Back up! Back up!

1177
01:36:19,262 --> 01:36:20,722
Come on.

1178
01:36:23,767 --> 01:36:25,936
Dad, we need to get it!

1179
01:36:28,605 --> 01:36:31,191
<i>The important thing about</i>
<i>that freedom train...</i>

1180
01:36:31,441 --> 01:36:33,568
<i>... is it's got to climb mountains.</i>

1181
01:36:33,777 --> 01:36:36,530
<i>We all have to deal with mountains.</i>

1182
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:39,658
<i>You know, mountains</i>
<i>that go way up high.</i>

1183
01:36:40,116 --> 01:36:42,077
And mountains that go
deep and low.

1184
01:36:42,285 --> 01:36:43,578
- Amen, preacher!
- Yes.

1185
01:36:43,787 --> 01:36:46,081
We know what those mountains are,
here at Glide.

1186
01:36:46,373 --> 01:36:48,500
We sing about them.

1187
01:36:49,292 --> 01:36:54,798
<i>Lord, don't move that mountain</i>

1188
01:36:56,216 --> 01:37:02,639
<i>Give me strength to climb it</i>

1189
01:37:03,139 --> 01:37:09,813
<i>Please don't move</i>
<i>That stumbling block</i>

1190
01:37:10,063 --> 01:37:16,611
<i>But lead me, Lord, around it</i>

1191
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:23,285
<i>My burdens, they get so heavy</i>

1192
01:37:25,161 --> 01:37:30,750
<i>Seems hard to bear</i>

1193
01:37:31,668 --> 01:37:35,255
<i>But I won't give up</i>
<i>No, no</i>

1194
01:37:35,505 --> 01:37:37,465
<i>Because you promised me</i>

1195
01:37:37,674 --> 01:37:44,431
<i>You'd meet me at the altar of prayer</i>

1196
01:37:44,681 --> 01:37:52,147
- <i>Lord don't move that mountain</i>
- <i>Please don't move that mountain</i>

1197
01:37:52,355 --> 01:37:57,652
<i>But give me strength to climb it</i>

1198
01:37:59,863 --> 01:38:01,865
When's your test?

1199
01:38:03,116 --> 01:38:04,576
Tomorrow.

1200
01:38:08,955 --> 01:38:10,749
Are you ready?

1201
01:38:14,711 --> 01:38:16,087
Of course.

1202
01:38:55,252 --> 01:38:56,503
Thank you, sir.

1203
01:39:05,929 --> 01:39:08,056
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey.

1204
01:39:12,102 --> 01:39:15,063
So did you finish the whole thing,
or you have to go somewhere?

1205
01:39:15,272 --> 01:39:17,732
I have to go somewhere.

1206
01:39:18,358 --> 01:39:21,152
- But I finished the whole thing too.
- Oh, good.

1207
01:39:21,361 --> 01:39:23,280
- You?
- Yeah.

1208
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:26,741
- How'd you feel about the graphs?
- Easy.

1209
01:39:27,784 --> 01:39:31,830
I struggled with the essay question
on the back. What did you write?

1210
01:39:32,038 --> 01:39:35,667
- Essay question?
- Yeah, on the back.

1211
01:39:45,635 --> 01:39:46,928
Hey, Chris.

1212
01:39:47,137 --> 01:39:50,432
- Hey. Jeff, right? 49ers game.
- Yeah.

1213
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:54,102
- Yeah, you were gonna give me a call?
- I never actually got your number.

1214
01:39:55,896 --> 01:39:57,814
Here's my number.
Call me, okay?

1215
01:39:58,064 --> 01:40:00,734
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Thank you very much.

1216
01:40:01,484 --> 01:40:05,238
Chris, you got five bucks?
I left my wallet upstairs.

1217
01:40:05,488 --> 01:40:07,699
Let me run up and grab that
for you, Mr. Frohm.

1218
01:40:07,908 --> 01:40:10,911
No, I gotta be at CAL Bank at 4,
and I'm late.

1219
01:40:16,333 --> 01:40:18,460
- I'll pay you back, honest.
- Five is good?

1220
01:40:18,668 --> 01:40:22,297
Five is lovely. Thank you.
Thank you.

1221
01:40:35,685 --> 01:40:38,146
That's it. That's the room quota.

1222
01:40:38,521 --> 01:40:41,274
There's no more space.
You gotta head out.

1223
01:40:41,524 --> 01:40:44,361
That's it for today.
Come back tomorrow.

1224
01:40:44,611 --> 01:40:47,572
All the rooms are full.
It's completely full.

1225
01:40:47,781 --> 01:40:52,077
That's it. Just keep heading out.
Come back tomorrow.

1226
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:28,822
You like it?

1227
01:42:19,873 --> 01:42:23,543
Twenty. One, two, three, four.

1228
01:42:26,630 --> 01:42:30,258
Now, here's your bulb,
and there's your ferrite core inductor.

1229
01:42:30,467 --> 01:42:33,261
- How much?
- Eight dollars.

1230
01:42:34,387 --> 01:42:37,682
- What's that?
- It's to repair the light.

1231
01:42:37,891 --> 01:42:39,935
Can I see it?

1232
01:42:41,811 --> 01:42:44,898
Yeah, sure. Just don't break it.

1233
01:42:45,148 --> 01:42:49,611
Unless you wanna sleep in a room
with me for the rest of your life.

1234
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:52,656
I don't mind.

1235
01:42:53,156 --> 01:42:54,950
Yeah, you will.

1236
01:43:11,258 --> 01:43:13,635
Why don't you
get some sleep, okay?

1237
01:43:13,843 --> 01:43:14,970
Okay.

1238
01:43:15,178 --> 01:43:18,306
- Warm enough?
- Yeah.

1239
01:43:18,598 --> 01:43:20,225
All right.

1240
01:43:22,352 --> 01:43:25,230
Did Mom leave because of me?

1241
01:43:28,608 --> 01:43:32,779
- What?
- Did Mom leave because of me?

1242
01:43:37,367 --> 01:43:41,872
Don't... Don't even think
something like that.

1243
01:43:42,956 --> 01:43:45,083
Mom left because of Mom.

1244
01:43:45,292 --> 01:43:47,544
And you didn't have anything
to do with that, okay?

1245
01:43:48,295 --> 01:43:50,171
Okay.

1246
01:44:00,056 --> 01:44:02,058
You're a good papa.

1247
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:11,902
All right, go to sleep.

1248
01:44:12,736 --> 01:44:15,655
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1249
01:45:12,128 --> 01:45:14,089
So far, so good, Chris.

1250
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:22,764
- It works.
- Thank you very much.

1251
01:45:22,973 --> 01:45:26,768
<i>Two hundred and fifty dollars.</i>
<i>Four more weeks of oxygen.</i>

1252
01:45:27,143 --> 01:45:31,356
One hundred, 20, 40, 60, 80, 200.

1253
01:45:31,565 --> 01:45:34,317
Twenty, 30, 40, 50.

1254
01:45:35,485 --> 01:45:37,112
- Anything else?
- Nope, that's it.

1255
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:38,613
Thank you. Thank you.

1256
01:45:38,822 --> 01:45:40,782
- You ready?
- Yep.

1257
01:45:42,742 --> 01:45:45,620
- Are we going to the church place?
- No.

1258
01:45:45,829 --> 01:45:47,789
Where are we going, then?

1259
01:45:48,582 --> 01:45:51,126
- Probably stay at a hotel.
- A hotel?

1260
01:45:51,334 --> 01:45:52,419
Just for the night.

1261
01:45:52,669 --> 01:45:55,380
We can go back to the cave
if you like.

1262
01:45:55,589 --> 01:45:57,299
No, thank you.

1263
01:45:57,507 --> 01:46:00,051
- Ever?
- I hope not.

1264
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:01,720
Why not?

1265
01:46:01,928 --> 01:46:04,723
Well, because some things are fun
the first time you do them...

1266
01:46:04,931 --> 01:46:07,267
...and then not so much the next.

1267
01:46:07,517 --> 01:46:10,353
- Like the bus?
- Yeah, like the bus.

1268
01:46:10,604 --> 01:46:14,024
<i>I'm sorry. Guess I shouldn't laugh,</i>
<i>should I?</i>

1269
01:46:14,274 --> 01:46:17,611
<i>It's promised in the Bible.</i>
<i>Pa says we'll find it some day.</i>

1270
01:46:17,861 --> 01:46:20,197
<i>He doesn't know where it is, though.</i>

1271
01:46:21,114 --> 01:46:24,326
<i>Didn't you ever want to have a home</i>
<i>of your own like other people?</i>

1272
01:46:24,534 --> 01:46:26,369
<i>Sure.</i>

1273
01:46:26,786 --> 01:46:28,872
<i>Sometimes when we're moving</i>
<i>at night...</i>

1274
01:46:29,122 --> 01:46:32,250
<i>... we pass houses with lights</i>
<i>and people.</i>

1275
01:46:32,459 --> 01:46:35,212
<i>Sometimes you can</i>
<i>hear them laughing...</i>

1276
01:46:39,466 --> 01:46:42,844
<i>The next day, after work...</i>

1277
01:46:43,053 --> 01:46:45,263
<i>... we just went to the beach.</i>

1278
01:46:45,472 --> 01:46:47,349
<i>Far away from anything.</i>

1279
01:46:47,557 --> 01:46:48,934
<i>Everything.</i>

1280
01:46:49,142 --> 01:46:50,810
<i>Just Christopher and me.</i>

1281
01:46:52,479 --> 01:46:54,814
- Did you see me?
- Yeah.

1282
01:46:55,065 --> 01:46:58,109
<i>Far away from buses and noise...</i>

1283
01:46:58,318 --> 01:47:03,949
<i>... and a constant disappointment</i>
<i>in my ten-gallon head...</i>

1284
01:47:05,158 --> 01:47:06,993
<i>... and in myself.</i>

1285
01:47:07,577 --> 01:47:09,955
- Chris, thank you very much.
- Well, thank you, Dean.

1286
01:47:10,163 --> 01:47:11,998
- Take care.
- You made all the right moves.

1287
01:47:12,249 --> 01:47:13,708
Thanks, Chris.

1288
01:47:15,835 --> 01:47:17,128
<i>Because when I was young...</i>

1289
01:47:17,337 --> 01:47:21,091
<i>... and I'd get an A on a history test</i>
<i>or whatever...</i>

1290
01:47:21,341 --> 01:47:25,887
<i>... I'd get this good feeling about</i>
<i>all the things that I could be.</i>

1291
01:47:27,847 --> 01:47:31,434
<i>And then I never became</i>
<i>any of them.</i>

1292
01:47:38,942 --> 01:47:41,486
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey.

1293
01:47:41,695 --> 01:47:44,322
- How you doing, Jay?
- I'm doing fine.

1294
01:47:44,531 --> 01:47:48,660
Rumour has it you signed 31 accounts
for us from Pacific Bell.

1295
01:47:48,869 --> 01:47:50,287
Yeah, yeah.

1296
01:47:50,537 --> 01:47:54,291
Met some guys at a ball game,
got some cards. I've been working.

1297
01:47:54,541 --> 01:47:56,126
I guess.

1298
01:47:59,129 --> 01:48:01,339
So one more day.

1299
01:48:01,548 --> 01:48:03,133
Getting nervous?

1300
01:48:03,717 --> 01:48:06,094
- No, I'm okay.
- Yeah?

1301
01:48:06,303 --> 01:48:08,221
Listen, whatever happens...

1302
01:48:08,471 --> 01:48:10,849
...you've done a fantastic job, Chris.

1303
01:48:11,057 --> 01:48:12,601
I mean that.

1304
01:48:13,476 --> 01:48:15,270
Take care of yourself.

1305
01:48:30,327 --> 01:48:33,455
Yes, Mr. Johnson.
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.

1306
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:35,874
Yes, sir. Just calling
to thank you very much...

1307
01:48:36,082 --> 01:48:38,585
...for your support
at last month's seminar.

1308
01:48:39,169 --> 01:48:40,795
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

1309
01:48:41,421 --> 01:48:43,048
Yes, sir.

1310
01:48:43,256 --> 01:48:44,633
No, sir, that's it.

1311
01:48:44,841 --> 01:48:47,302
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

1312
01:48:48,929 --> 01:48:51,806
Chris. Come.

1313
01:49:19,209 --> 01:49:22,295
- Hi, Chris.
- Mr. Frohm, good to see you.

1314
01:49:23,463 --> 01:49:25,340
- Nice shirt.
- Thank you, sir.

1315
01:49:25,549 --> 01:49:26,758
- Chris.
- Hey, Jay.

1316
01:49:27,217 --> 01:49:31,471
- Chris.
- Chris, sit down, please.

1317
01:49:34,391 --> 01:49:38,478
I thought I'd wear a shirt today.

1318
01:49:38,728 --> 01:49:40,647
You know,
being the last day and all.

1319
01:49:40,897 --> 01:49:44,192
Well, thank you. Thank you.
We appreciate that.

1320
01:49:45,068 --> 01:49:46,862
But...

1321
01:49:47,070 --> 01:49:49,865
...wear one tomorrow though, okay?

1322
01:49:50,073 --> 01:49:52,993
Because tomorrow's
going to be your first day...

1323
01:49:53,743 --> 01:49:56,955
...if you'd like to work here
as a broker.

1324
01:49:58,331 --> 01:50:00,125
Would you like that, Chris?

1325
01:50:01,084 --> 01:50:02,627
Yes, sir.

1326
01:50:02,836 --> 01:50:06,214
Good. We couldn't be happier.

1327
01:50:07,173 --> 01:50:10,343
So welcome.

1328
01:50:12,262 --> 01:50:17,225
- Was it as easy as it looked?
- No, sir. No, sir, it wasn't.

1329
01:50:19,603 --> 01:50:21,938
- Good luck, Chris.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1330
01:50:26,359 --> 01:50:28,028
Thank you, sir.

1331
01:50:28,361 --> 01:50:30,238
Oh, Chris.

1332
01:50:32,782 --> 01:50:34,826
I almost forgot.

1333
01:50:36,870 --> 01:50:38,413
Thank you.

1334
01:50:58,808 --> 01:51:01,019
<i>This part of my life...</i>

1335
01:51:01,978 --> 01:51:04,105
<i>... this little part...</i>

1336
01:51:07,484 --> 01:51:10,111
<i>... is called "Happiness."</i>

1337
01:51:56,867 --> 01:52:00,453
Christopher. Christopher.
Come here.

1338
01:52:30,150 --> 01:52:32,527
So how many...

1339
01:52:32,736 --> 01:52:34,654
...planets are there?

1340
01:52:35,989 --> 01:52:37,741
- Seven.
- Seven?

1341
01:52:38,241 --> 01:52:40,076
Nine.

1342
01:52:42,495 --> 01:52:44,539
Who's the king of the jungle?

1343
01:52:44,915 --> 01:52:47,667
- Gorilla.
- The gorilla?

1344
01:52:48,001 --> 01:52:49,377
The gorilla?

1345
01:52:49,586 --> 01:52:51,213
No. Lion.

1346
01:52:51,421 --> 01:52:54,049
Oh, yeah. Lion, lion, lion.

1347
01:52:56,092 --> 01:52:59,095
Hey, Dad, listen to this.
Knock, knock.

1348
01:52:59,346 --> 01:53:01,223
- Who's there?
- Shelby.

1349
01:53:01,431 --> 01:53:02,557
Shelby who?

1350
01:53:02,766 --> 01:53:06,561
<i>Shelby coming around the mountain</i>
<i>When she comes</i>

1351
01:53:07,437 --> 01:53:08,730
- Knock knock.
- Who's there?

1352
01:53:08,939 --> 01:53:11,399
- Nobody.
- Nobody who?

1353
01:53:12,359 --> 01:53:14,069
Nobody who?

1354
01:53:17,447 --> 01:53:20,367
Now, that's funny. I like that one.
