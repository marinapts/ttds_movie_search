00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:29,140
Grandpa, l arrange a professor
for your friends on Sunday

485
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,107
Very good... very good

486
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:33,206
He'll deliver you a lecture on Gandhi Ji

487
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,703
You all need it.

488
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,337
Bhai, don't get tense

489
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:40,051
Professor's will make the
key and putting it in...

490
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,888
...your pocket and pasting in you
leg and drop it in you underwear

491
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,855
Put it in my underwear?

492
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,258
They ask questions and
l put my hand in my...

493
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,394
...underwear and take out
the key and answer them

494
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,725
You're talking nonsense.

495
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,230
Ajeet why are putting you hand
in you underwear frequently

496
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,800
We use the phone

497
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:00,638
They ask the question
and you said l'll be back

498
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,162
Call us from the washroom

499
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,740
- Professor's will answer the questions
- How many times l go to the washroom?

500
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,706
That is not operated by the phone

501
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,654
Bhai then there is only one way

502
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,525
And there is no other way

503
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,191
The other radio station...

504
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,134
over there is an item Anphwa Choppra...

505
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,066
You meet her

506
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,670
She talk about the
Shahrukhan all day long

507
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,373
Granted her children are
the fan of Dalip Kumar

508
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,674
You can take care of them

509
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,009
Stop this nonsense.

510
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,408
Let me think

511
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,480
Bhai we don't have any other way

512
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,745
We only have five day study
as much you can about Bapu

513
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:53,785
Ok! l'm leaving

514
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,623
Ok! Bhai...

515
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:56,955

518
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,601

519
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:14,236

Namshkar (hello)... l'm Harri Ram

522
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,515
May l help you?

523

Can l'm able to find
some information on Bapu?

524
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:30,218

525
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:34,299
After so many years some
one come here l' m very happy

527
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,065

All the old books are over here

529
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,276
Munna

530
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,890
Who is it? Mohan Das Karamchand Gandhi

531
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,598
Look Uncle l'm up from three nights

532
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,466
- Don't waste my mind
- The what else do you do?

533
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:54,795
Unique just because of your age

534
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:56,708
Let me study either...

535
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,505
Moreover, you beat me up?

536
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:03,241
lf you slap me on my right cheek
then present my left cheek, professor.

537
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,851
Who tell you about that professor thing?

538
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:07,118
-Tea

539
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,986
- Serve it to the fancy dress
and ask him to be quite...

540
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,227
- To whom?
- That duplicate of Bapu

541
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,251
Where?

542
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,654
There you can't see him

543
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,796
Everyone crazy come over here

544
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,104
Who are you?

545
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,173
You can call me Bapu

546
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,872
Don't touch me

547
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,787
Don't be afraid, l never
harm anybody till that day

548
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,948
Boss, here is some problem

549
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,092
Are you not a soul?

550
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:50,728
You can call me spirit instead of Soul

551
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:54,892
- l'm unable to understand Baap (Father)
- Not Baap (Father), lt's Bapu (Gandhi)

552
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,698
You love to much with Janvi

553
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,232
You'll going to her home on Sunday

554
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,368
How can you know?

555
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,303
- Hari Ram
- Don't be afraid Son

556
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:07,643
- l come to help you
- Hari Ram

557
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,405
l'll leave because you're afraid

558
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,575
Whenever you need me call me
from the depth of your heart

559
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,182
- l'll come
- Hari Ram

560
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,222
What happens?

561
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,513
There some one over there

562
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,258
Who's it?

563
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,234
lllusion, what is this?

564
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,972
May times you hear voices due to the...

565
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:37,875
...mental tiredness and
the chemical imbalance

566
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:42,175
See that kind of things that's
not real... that's illumination

567
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,575
Mahatma Gandhi was there
l saw him over there

568
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,181
He's the soul of Bapu

569
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,824
lf there's a sprit then why
only you're able to see him

570
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:56,194
lt depends upon the mood of the sprit

571
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:59,230
From past three nights
you are researching...

572
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,899
...on Gandhi without
having rest and food

573
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:06,671
That's why a restless
mind show you Gandhi Ji.

574
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,231
What do you mean to say? that l'm Mad...

575
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,639
Don't worry, take this medicine

576
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,204
- Just a minute... Look...

577
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:19,283
Bapu said that lf l call
him from heart... he show up

578
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,250
l'll try

579
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:34,659
How're you Murli Parsad

580
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,836
Don't touch me Don't touch me

581
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:42,340
Don't be afraid son l hear to help you

582
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,831
Look... look over there Bapu
Now what do you think l'm mad

583
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,845
Nobody is over there Mr. Sharma

584
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,540
l see him clearly

585
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,715
lt's in your mind

586
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,381
Circuit, do you see him?

587
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,558
Hello Bapu... Last time
you showed up amazingly

588
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:01,490
He's scared

589
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,596
He's brave and he reorder so many guys

590
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:08,030
Circuit, He's over here

591
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,161
l'm offering him water

592
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,106
Bapu, would you like to have
cold rink, tea or anything?

593
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,539
What is this?

594
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,744
Don't reinforces hallucination

595
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,512
l'm going to slap you

596
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,047
Bhai Says it there it means that over...

597
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,844
...there, now l show
you the stars in day time

598
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,606
Not really but they are

599
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,651
you can say that Hallucination

600
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,584
Come here... Come here...

601
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,713
Bhai you may sit with Bapu

602
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,216
l'll take care of him

603
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,991
You mental hospital

604
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,450
What're you saying?

605
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:43,701
l know that there is no Bapu
and why are you spoiling his mind

606
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,793
are you making him mad?

607
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:45,999
Give me the medicine

608
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:47,835
l'll give him the doze

609
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,202
- Circuit...
- Bhai...

610
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,173
Why Bapu only shows in front you and me?

611
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:59,314
Because of you will power
he came out from the book

612
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,950
Just like Aladdin's lamp

613
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,012
l went also along with you

614
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,916
lt's Gandhi... that's
why he says hello to us

615
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,851
Don't take any kind of tension

616
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,062
He spent two or there
days over here and after...

617
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,053
...seeing the state of
our country he returns back

618
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:14,828
Don't take any tension

619
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,428
Why to spoil while thinking?

620
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:21,439
He said, he's going to help us

621
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,236
May l directed him towards
the Lucky's job of that house

622
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:38,780
Take the medicine

623
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:55,640
Murli Parsad... What favour
can Mohan Das do for you

624
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,607
Bapu...

625
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,177
- Like that Bapu
- Where's the bottle

626
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:01,940
l need your help...

627
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:07,475
l can't kill and kidnap any one

628
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,620
l'm weak in these kind ofjobs

629
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,451
No Bapu... l can do that...

630
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:15,652
Tomorrow you accompany
me at Janvi's place...

631
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,785
Just like that...

632
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:17,653
invisible

633
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,222
Like Mr. lndia

634
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,228
They ask about your self

635
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,195
you'll answer me in my ear

636
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,993
My history is weak

637
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,330

639
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,679
But do this favour for me

640
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,213
Listen my job

642
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:41,912
l'm giving you oath

643
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,547
My job is not easy

644
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:48,714
Bapu, Nothing is

Son, that's not so bad

692

Country is developing now these days

693
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,590

731

735
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:08,774
Her husband and Ferozah are no more

00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,447
Then marry her

737
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,950
Children says, Dad don't embarrass us

738

00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:44,947
Any song might be the
reason to call Bapu

All alone...

Girls are very emotional

01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:08,197
Take her far away to the sunset and
ask her marry me or leave the boat

- Yes
- l got the 2nd innings house

52
01:09:34,343 --> 01:09:37,613
How can you get it...? Khorana
Ji is trying for it since 2 years

53
01:09:37,613 --> 01:09:40,844
He do business with consultation
of his fortune teller

54
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:44,854
l tell him don't put
this project over here

55
01:09:44,854 --> 01:09:49,257
But No, He said Maharaj says that
it'll be here then what can l do?

56
01:09:49,558 --> 01:09:53,129
He purchased 7 billion
rupees land around this house

57
01:09:53,129 --> 01:09:56,292
lf he unable to buy this house
then these 7 billion will be wasted

58
01:09:56,599 --> 01:09:59,363
Sir Ji, Khurana here? What timing...

59
01:10:00,002 --> 01:10:02,903
Look his smiley face
when l'll show him the key

60
01:10:04,407 --> 01:10:06,475
2nd innings house is yours

61
01:10:06,475 --> 01:10:07,874
Consider it a wedding gift

62
01:10:11,447 --> 01:10:16,385
Lucky Sing Ji, this
wedding can't be done

63
01:10:16,385 --> 01:10:17,953
What're you saying?

64
01:10:17,953 --> 01:10:22,583
l make the horoscope of
your daughter she's unlucky

65
01:10:22,758 --> 01:10:24,953
- Then...?
- lt means if that wedding is on then...

66
01:10:26,662 --> 01:10:30,299
- Sunny will be destroyed
- My daughter will turn any home into heaven

67
01:10:30,299 --> 01:10:32,001
and make all the family decease

68
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:35,801
lt's very clear in the horoscope
that if this wedding will happens

69
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:40,202
Sunny can't live more then a year

70
01:10:40,976 --> 01:10:41,943
That's confirm...

71
01:10:42,778 --> 01:10:46,737
- Khorana Ji... ln this century
- l can't ignore his fortunetelling

72
01:10:47,183 --> 01:10:51,142
What ever we are today it's
just because of Battook Maharaj

73
01:10:51,554 --> 01:10:53,317
We lost our factories

74
01:10:53,722 --> 01:10:57,626
He said, put one more 'K' in Khorana

75
01:10:57,626 --> 01:11:00,220
Look... today where're we

76
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:06,499
lf your daughter born after few
hours then the fate will be different

77
01:11:08,337 --> 01:11:09,599
Bad timing Ji...

78
01:11:14,443 --> 01:11:18,777
lf you gave birth to simran after
5 minutes then the date was changed

79
01:11:19,882 --> 01:11:21,650
How can date been changed

80
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:23,886
Simran was born at 1 1 :55 correct

81
01:11:23,886 --> 01:11:24,853
- Yes

82
01:11:24,987 --> 01:11:29,947
lf you hold on for five more minutes
then 7 April changed in to 8th April

83
01:11:30,926 --> 01:11:33,554
- Understand my words?
- One minute... One minute

84
01:11:33,963 --> 01:11:38,000
Your daughter was born
at 1 1 :55am in morning

85
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,903
No... No... at 1 1 :55 pm

86
01:11:40,903 --> 01:11:44,440
- lt was night
- No... No... you tell me... Look...

87
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,407
Look that...

88
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:47,536
lsn't it written over here

89
01:11:52,848 --> 01:11:54,083
Subramanian Chacha

90
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:55,050
Subramanian

91
01:11:55,618 --> 01:11:58,314
Our typist now he's def

92
01:11:58,521 --> 01:12:00,890
He's lip-read the dictation

93
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:03,759
am, pm shows same in lip-read am, pm

94
01:12:03,759 --> 01:12:04,691
lt's a big problem

95
01:12:04,827 --> 01:12:08,831
He writes lawyer as liar and
risky business as whiskey business

96
01:12:08,831 --> 01:12:12,434
Once l tell him that wrote down the
cement Supplier ''send us an email''

97
01:12:12,434 --> 01:12:15,767
He wrote, Send us a female

98
01:12:16,939 --> 01:12:19,041
and he sends because of the order

99
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:21,566
Very embarrassing situation in office

100
01:12:22,077 --> 01:12:27,183
Koko buy a big machine
for Subramaniyum's ear

101
01:12:27,183 --> 01:12:28,250
Who's Subramaniyum?

102
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:31,554
Buy two machine for both ears,
its doesn't makes any difference

103
01:12:31,554 --> 01:12:35,547
lf l whisper, he can
get me loud and clear

104
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:37,891
Thank Koko... Thanks...

105
01:12:40,129 --> 01:12:44,133
lt's a pleasure that Simran is unlucky

106
01:12:44,133 --> 01:12:48,297
Aunty... What a time of
her birth... Well done...

107
01:12:48,804 --> 01:12:51,307
- Now take the keys
- No... No... wait a minute

108
01:12:51,307 --> 01:12:56,045
Key will be taken on
wedding day at 10:27 pm

109
01:12:56,045 --> 01:12:59,315
Ok... Offer them sweets...
Offer them sweets...

110
01:12:59,315 --> 01:13:01,850
Congrats... Congrats....
Final... Final...

111
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:03,841
That's it deal it done...

112
01:13:14,997 --> 01:13:17,158
- You know that
- What?

113
01:13:17,733 --> 01:13:19,428
That Janvi lives in that bungalow

114
01:13:19,835 --> 01:13:21,804
You cheat me and send me to Goa

115
01:13:21,804 --> 01:13:24,773
Tomorrow if l'll enter in you
house and says that's mine then

116
01:13:25,107 --> 01:13:28,978
Look... Look Madam, property

118
01:13:29,979 --> 01:13:33,082
You must serve a notice
before transferring the liaison

119
01:13:33,082 --> 01:13:37,314
Look BMC must serve you a notice
you check it from the post office

120
01:13:37,519 --> 01:13:41,223
Oye Munna, house has
been evacuated peacefully

121
01:13:41,223 --> 01:13:43,726
lt's don't look nice to
have a fight with aged

122
01:13:43,726 --> 01:13:46,095
Look... l'll give you a flat in Vevar

123
01:13:46,095 --> 01:13:48,256

225
01:20:57,526 --> 01:20:58,857
At least 15 years

226
01:21:01,329 --> 01:21:03,799

01:21:32,794 --> 01:21:35,729
You ask for six months and can't
give the grantee of six years

236
01:21:36,398 --> 01:21:38,161
- Go... Move from here

He's a great lawyer, he studied in
London and practiced in South Africa

239

He said, don't use harm
ways be a Gandhi devotee

That Ghuju Swine.... Taking
over my clients from the gate

241
01:21:58,153 --> 01:22:02,257
- lf enemy gives you harm then give him a smile
- Ghuju Said this?

242
01:22:02,257 --> 01:22:06,785
Hey Said that, lf someone slaps you on your
left cheek then give him your right cheek

243
01:22:07,729 --> 01:22:11,324
lf you do that, it controls
his anger and raze your respect

244
01:22:12,868 --> 01:22:17,973
He also said, if you try win's your enemy
heart then there is no need of lawyers

245
01:22:17,973 --> 01:22:19,372
Who said this? Who said that?

246
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:25,774
Move...

247
01:22:47,435 --> 01:22:48,959

opposite of bully

250
01:22:53,275 --> 01:22:57,045
Lucky thinks we going to fight
with him but we do the opposite

251
01:22:57,045 --> 01:22:58,444
l'll send him the flowers

252
01:23:00,315 --> 01:23:01,550
Good Morning Pops

253
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:05,053

With Sunny... Never...

257
01:23:10,792 --> 01:23:11,690
Then?

258
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:17,259
Batook Maharaja tells khoranas
that roses are unlucky for them

259
01:23:17,766 --> 01:23:20,902
Khorana uncle, cut all
the roses of his home

260
01:23:20,902 --> 01:23:27,398
and he changed the name of her
sectary from ross to chambali

261
01:23:28,743 --> 01:23:31,177
How can sunny bare his father

262
01:23:31,646 --> 01:23:33,081
because his father is a good man

263
01:23:33,081 --> 01:23:35,350
He's a little bit
superstitious, but its ok

264
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:38,253
Little bit... without any fortune
decision he can't go to washroom

265
01:23:38,253 --> 01:23:40,989
Already he placed two ''KK''

lf behave like him will bare me

268
01:23:46,294 --> 01:23:48,296
You also expose your self all day

269
01:23:48,296 --> 01:23:50,899
Like this... Like that.... Like this

270
01:23:50,899 --> 01:23:54,903
Then sometimes with
Ashwerya, Bush and Queen

271
01:23:54,903 --> 01:23:56,700
But l still love you

272
01:23:56,771 --> 01:23:58,295
Because you are a good man

273

That hard night will be over
and Lucky you going to loose it

291
01:25:44,512 --> 01:25:47,482
- What kind of drama it this Munna?
- That's the right way

292
01:25:47,482 --> 01:25:52,620
- We're not going to fight you till that time
- Till when...

293
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:55,790

294
01:25:55,790 --> 01:26:01,786
One should be present in front of your home
if one slips down the other will fill his place

295
01:26:01,863 --> 01:26:04,499
We'll pray for your cure

296
01:26:04,499 --> 01:26:06,301

Go... and get our home keys

298
01:26:13,375 --> 01:26:14,637

299
01:26:37,065 --> 01:26:37,724

300
01:26:44,339 --> 01:26:46,068
- Beat them all
- No... No...

301
01:26:47,809 --> 01:26:52,313
Bapu says, if enemy hits you on you
right cheek then present him the left one

302
01:26:52,313 --> 01:26:55,009
Here it is... Look nothing is happens

303
01:26:57,318 --> 01:26:58,580
Bhai he done it

304
01:27:05,827 --> 01:27:07,962
When slapped on both
cheeks then what to do?

305
01:27:07,962 --> 01:27:09,831
That's not addressed by the Bapu

306
01:27:09,831 --> 01:27:13,468
Munna, let them do...

307
01:27:13,468 --> 01:27:15,129
But you don't fight them

308
01:27:15,603 --> 01:27:19,095
That changes the mood of your enemy

309
01:27:19,507 --> 01:27:23,078
His odium decreases and
increases you respect

310
01:27:23,078 --> 01:27:27,447
Show him that we can't hit him

311
01:27:27,849 --> 01:27:29,578
Neither we're going to leave our path

312
01:27:30,452 --> 01:27:33,182
Go Munna and ask him for forgiveness

313
01:27:37,225 --> 01:27:39,260
We'll take back the house
with peace, if you do...

314
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:41,228
...some thing wrong then we
going to give you a bamboo

315
01:27:42,764 --> 01:27:45,800
- Say sorry to him
- But why Bhai?

316
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:51,339
Look... Bapu says if l do this then it'll
decrease there odium and increase our respect

317
01:27:51,339 --> 01:27:54,433
- Say sorry to him
- Bapu going to shatter our business

318
01:27:55,743 --> 01:27:58,803
- l'm sorry
- Now get up we're sorry

319
01:27:59,547 --> 01:28:00,809
Get up or l'm going to hit you

320
01:28:05,753 --> 01:28:07,311
- Bhai
- Yes

321
01:28:08,356 --> 01:28:10,950
We take over 1 15 houses

322
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,889
52 Kidnappings

323
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:19,966
More of less we broke 250 bones

324
01:28:21,669 --> 01:28:22,897
but never sentence to jail

325
01:28:24,172 --> 01:28:27,475
First time... First time...
We say sorry to some one

326
01:28:27,475 --> 01:28:28,442
and sentence to jail

327
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,438
Public going to laugh at us

328
01:28:34,649 --> 01:28:36,617
Our reputation is ended

329
01:28:37,018 --> 01:28:40,454
lf you sentenced to jail after murdering
some one then it'll increases your respect?

330
01:28:41,156 --> 01:28:43,954
But the must charged us in kidnapping

331
01:28:44,359 --> 01:28:47,624
Do you know that...?
Bapu only made the salt

332
01:28:48,096 --> 01:28:49,461
and he sentence to jail directly

333
01:28:50,064 --> 01:28:52,828
- What about his reputation
- No...

334
01:28:54,035 --> 01:28:57,368
His reputation increases buy
the which he spent in the jail

335
01:28:57,672 --> 01:28:58,604
because he's right

336
01:28:59,607 --> 01:29:02,043
lf we sentence to jail after
doing right things then...

337
01:29:02,043 --> 01:29:04,511
Then our sculpture will
place in the park after death

338
01:29:06,981 --> 01:29:09,176

357
01:30:15,283 --> 01:30:18,480

358
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:22,557

My friend Says, They going to be doubled

01:32:10,231 --> 01:32:12,324
Save each penne and return them back

388
01:32:13,601 --> 01:32:17,638
Look... work hard, and save the money

389
01:32:17,638 --> 01:32:21,042
That's not a solution
it's takes ten years

390
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:22,236
What can l'd right now

But you'll fear less
to fight for her house

484
01:40:18,419 --> 01:40:20,887
You'll see one day she'll come back

485

How can l tell her it's need courage

l decided to speak truth to
my father then l got peace

491
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:48,145
But l was unable to dare it

492
01:40:48,616 --> 01:40:51,585
Then l wrote him a letter

493
01:40:52,419 --> 01:40:54,319
l admit my fault and
asked for forgiveness

494
01:40:55,222 --> 01:41:00,023
Promise that l'll never
do anything wrong again

495
01:41:01,161 --> 01:41:03,664
Then your father beat you up

496
01:41:03,664 --> 01:41:06,462

My friend is in coma

600
01:50:17,818 --> 01:50:20,020
He can't understand what's
right and what's wrong

601
01:50:20,020 --> 01:50:22,682

Dad, took a boy for me

He says, meet him once and decide

But how can l judge him in one meeting

He behave good in first meeting

609
01:50:44,611 --> 01:50:50,641

can he behave with lower society people

613
01:51:13,607 --> 01:51:14,665

726
01:59:51,524 --> 01:59:53,014
Ok! Go ask me

727
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:59,023
- Question one... Bapu your first name?
- Mohan Das

02:00:00,266 --> 02:00:01,367

You don't know the name of your mother

734
02:00:14,747 --> 02:00:15,509
Tell me Bapu

735
02:00:17,717 --> 02:00:20,015
Who gave you title name of Mahatma?

736
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:27,957
What is the name of your
house in South Africa?

737
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:35,524
Tell me Bapu

l still have 55 seconds left

740
02:00:48,881 --> 02:00:52,214
Mr. Murli Parsad Sharma is very sick

741
02:00:52,685 --> 02:00:57,490
Due to a mind chemical
imbalance he's seeing Gandhi

742

parents, wife or there children

745
02:01:05,965 --> 02:01:08,559
lf Gandhi Ji is a reality

746
02:01:09,602 --> 02:01:13,806
Then he must tell Mr.
Sharma the name of his mother

747
02:01:13,806 --> 02:01:17,071
l know you read a lot about him

748
02:01:17,310 --> 02:01:19,369
But you don't read every thing

749
02:01:19,846 --> 02:01:25,218
He'll only answer the
questions which you know about

750

Which girl going to dare this

926
02:12:37,289 --> 02:12:40,588
lf she born at 1 1 :55pm

927
02:12:40,826 --> 02:12:44,263
lt's common sense, why are
you involving the fortune in it

928
02:12:44,263 --> 02:12:45,787
What do you want Mr.?

929
02:12:46,098 --> 02:12:48,760
After knowing that should
we leave our child for death

930
02:12:50,202 --> 02:12:51,226
Who are you boss?

932
02:12:53,405 --> 02:12:54,606
Batook Maharaj

So you're the one

934
02:12:56,475 --> 02:12:59,244
Bhai our aged men house
was gone just because of him

935
02:12:59,244 --> 02:13:00,802
He come up with a new story

936
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:03,307
that if this marriage will
go on then the boy will die

937
02:13:03,715 --> 02:13:04,917
How can you know?

938
02:13:04,917 --> 02:13:06,942
Because l saw their horoscopes

939
02:13:07,853 --> 02:13:09,655
Might be your knowledge
show the wrong side

940
02:13:09,655 --> 02:13:10,952
Not till today

941
02:13:11,623 --> 02:13:12,920
Bhai he's a god

02:13:20,966 --> 02:13:22,365
On hundred not out

You're mocking on my knowledge

947

When tsunami came,
earthquake came, Mumbai...

where is your knowledge?

02:13:36,748 --> 02:13:41,014
You don't know about your future
then how can you tell others

952
02:13:41,386 --> 02:13:44,256
Who say that l don't

02:13:48,126 --> 02:13:50,185
- What'll happen

956
02:13:50,462 --> 02:13:55,024
You're the astrologer you tells
us about your problematic future

957
02:13:57,569 --> 02:13:58,637
Bad time... why problematic time come?

958
02:13:58,637 --> 02:14:00,798
Circuit take out you gun

959

ten fire the bullet

962
02:14:09,414 --> 02:14:11,149

964
02:14:12,284 --> 02:14:14,411
You've full confidence on your horoscope

969
02:14:24,229 --> 02:14:27,232
But l'm sure that bullet
is going to through his head

970
02:14:27,232 --> 02:14:28,567
What are you talking?

- No listen to me...
- Two... - Stop it

976
02:14:38,243 --> 02:14:40,143
- Three
- Are you listening me or not?

977
02:14:40,779 --> 02:14:42,214
- Get a side

- Five

980
02:14:45,284 --> 02:14:46,979

- Why you all people are doing nothing

981
02:14:47,386 --> 02:14:48,978
- Seven
- Nobody can do like this

982
02:14:49,521 --> 02:14:51,657
- Khoorana Saab do some this... Look

983
02:14:51,657 --> 02:14:52,988
- Nine
- Enough

984
02:14:54,693 --> 02:14:56,092
Don't speak Ten

985
02:14:59,431 --> 02:15:00,830
He's fainted Bhai

986
02:15:01,466 --> 02:15:03,195
Come over here l wants to say sorry

987
02:15:03,869 --> 02:15:04,198
Uncle

988
02:15:05,470 --> 02:15:09,497
That person who are not sure about his
future then how come he tell others future

989
02:15:10,442 --> 02:15:11,875
Don't stop this marriage

990
02:15:12,377 --> 02:15:13,605
l'm requesting you

991
02:15:15,981 --> 02:15:18,381
Somebody try to explain him

992
02:15:20,018 --> 02:15:21,610
Somebody tell him anything

993
02:15:23,021 --> 02:15:24,489
l'm a mad person

994
02:15:24,489 --> 02:15:27,059
But l can see it clear that
something is happening wrong

995
02:15:27,059 --> 02:15:29,857
You smart peoples can't
understand this thing...

996
02:15:39,938 --> 02:15:43,499
Circuit it's better that
Bapu is not in reality

997
02:15:44,543 --> 02:15:49,310
lf today he's here, then he'll
cry after seeing this scary nation

998
02:15:50,615 --> 02:15:52,549
He died saying this that speak the truth

999
02:15:53,485 --> 02:15:56,386
But today if somebody speaks the
truth then people are going to bust him

1000
02:15:59,591 --> 02:16:02,924
That girl dare to do
it.... then guests returns

1001
02:16:05,464 --> 02:16:06,260
Go Circuit

1002
02:16:10,769 --> 02:16:11,531
Go...

1003
02:16:11,937 --> 02:16:13,063
Take me in

1004
02:16:14,206 --> 02:16:16,367
l don't live among these smart people

1005
02:16:17,809 --> 02:16:18,833
Go...

1006
02:16:22,514 --> 02:16:23,242
Go...

1007
02:16:25,517 --> 02:16:26,245
Where is Sunny?

1008
02:16:41,166 --> 02:16:43,634
Sunny... Go...

1009
02:16:44,169 --> 02:16:44,931
Dad...

1010
02:16:46,538 --> 02:16:48,938
lf l'll marry Simran
then may be l'll die...

1011
02:16:50,742 --> 02:16:53,006
But if not then l must die

1012
02:16:56,848 --> 02:16:57,576
Sorry Dad...

1013
02:17:10,929 --> 02:17:12,055
- Bhai
- Yes

1014
02:17:12,964 --> 02:17:15,567
Bhai are you sure that
after paying visit...

1015
02:17:15,567 --> 02:17:18,331
...daily over here that
increases our reputation

1016
02:17:19,337 --> 02:17:20,497
Write a letter

1017
02:17:21,106 --> 02:17:22,368
To whom Bhai?

1018
02:17:26,878 --> 02:17:29,108
l'm sorry that l came into your life

1019
02:17:30,682 --> 02:17:31,910
But what can l do?

1020
02:17:32,951 --> 02:17:35,317
When you say ''Good Morning Mumbai''

1021
02:17:36,621 --> 02:17:39,681
Then sunlight came to my life

1022
02:17:43,562 --> 02:17:46,326
and when you left after
saying ''Good Night Mumbai''

1023
02:17:47,265 --> 02:17:50,166
Then l'll remember you all the night

1024
02:17:53,004 --> 02:17:54,471
This life is wasted

1025
02:17:55,474 --> 02:17:59,001
But after reborn l'll
be a real professor

1026
02:18:02,147 --> 02:18:06,208
And win the quiz without
cheating and come into your studio

1027
02:18:07,652 --> 02:18:11,144
But Janvi... Don't change your self

1028
02:18:12,057 --> 02:18:13,752
Who saw the next life Munna?

1029
02:18:14,092 --> 02:18:17,220
l wants to live this life with you

1030
02:18:17,796 --> 02:18:21,926
l'm going to see you from studios window

1031
02:18:23,268 --> 02:18:27,637
Then you remove your curl with help of
your finger and place it behind your ear

1032
02:18:29,841 --> 02:18:30,705
Like this

1033
02:18:32,644 --> 02:18:35,841
Well next time lf l'll go to Goa

1034
02:18:36,281 --> 02:18:39,614
Then l'll give you the
ring in full confidence

1035
02:18:43,555 --> 02:18:44,817
How can you do that?

1036
02:18:45,624 --> 02:18:46,818
l've it

1037
02:19:01,139 --> 02:19:04,939
Circuit l've a very big
mental chemical disbalance

1038
02:19:05,911 --> 02:19:07,378
Can you able to see Janvi

1039
02:19:07,946 --> 02:19:08,378

1040

1044
02:19:21,493 --> 02:19:23,290
Yes... behind your back

1045
02:19:24,896 --> 02:19:26,386
Why you lied?

1046
02:19:27,632 --> 02:19:29,361
Why you said that you're not a professor

1047
02:19:33,104 --> 02:19:36,096
You're the best professor ever met Murli

1048
02:19:37,909 --> 02:19:40,571
l saw too many professors
teaching Gandhi history

1049

They think they'll change him

1064
02:21:05,063 --> 02:21:08,294
They changed but not Circuit

1065

One day he lay of Batook from
