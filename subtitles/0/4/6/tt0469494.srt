1
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,697
No!

2
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,604
There she is. There she is.

3
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:44,442
There she is.

4
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:35,106
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

5
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,380
<i>I've traveled over half our state
to be here tonight.</i>

6
00:14:39,488 --> 00:14:42,013
<i>I couldn't get away sooner
because my new well was coming in</i>

7
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:45,025
<i>at Coyote Hills
and I had to see about it.</i>

8
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:48,119
<i>That well is now flowing
at 2,000 barrels</i>

9
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:51,426
<i>and it's paying me an income
of $5,000 a week.</i>

10
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,399
I have two others drilling
and I have 16 producing at Antelope,

11
00:14:55,537 --> 00:14:59,940
so, ladies and gentlemen,
if I say I'm an oilman, you will agree.

12
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:05,440
Now, you have a great chance here,

13
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,447
but bear in mind you could lose it all
if you're not careful.

14
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,949
Out of all men that beg for a chance
to drill your lots,

15
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:14,283
maybe one in twenty will be oilmen.

16
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:15,617
The rest will be speculators,

17
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:18,249
that's men trying to get between
you and the oilmen

18
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,955
to get some of the money that ought,
by rights, come to you.

19
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:24,999
Even if you find one that has money
and means to drill,

20
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,567
he'll maybe know nothing about drilling.

21
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:29,637
He'll have to hire the job out
on contract,

22
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:32,569
and then you're depending
on a contractor,

23
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:33,732
who'll rush the job through

24
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:35,935
so he can get another contract
just as quick as he can.

25
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:37,602
This is the way that this works.

26
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:40,978
What is your offer? We're wasting time.

27
00:15:41,283 --> 00:15:42,250
Please!

28
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,421
I do my own drilling.

29
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,958
And the men that work for me,
work for me, and they are men I know.

30
00:15:52,094 --> 00:15:55,791
I make it my business to be there
and to see their work.

31
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:58,991
I don't lose my tools in the hole
and spend months fishing for them.

32
00:15:59,134 --> 00:16:00,260
I don't botch the cementing off

33
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:03,930
and let water in the hole
and ruin the whole lease.

34
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:06,063
I'm a family man.

35
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:10,804
I run a family business. This is my son
and my partner, H.W. Plainview.

36
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:16,614
We offer you the bond of family
that very few oilmen can understand.

37
00:16:18,587 --> 00:16:21,647
I'm fixed like no other company
in this field

38
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,953
and that's because
my Coyote Hills well has just come in.

39
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:27,527
I have a string of tools
all ready to put to work.

40
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:29,756
I can load a rig onto trucks
and have them here in a week.

41
00:16:29,898 --> 00:16:32,958
I have business connections,
so I can get the lumber for the derricks.

42
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:36,867
Such things go by friendship
in a rush like this.

43
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:40,839
And this is why I can guarantee
to start drilling

44
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:43,911
and to put up the cash to back my word.

45
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:45,570
I assure you, ladies and gentlemen,

46
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,979
no matter what the others
promise to do,

47
00:16:49,117 --> 00:16:52,518
when it comes to the showdown,
they won't be there.

48
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:56,758
Sit down! Sit down, you have no right...

49
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,787
Let us discuss what the man has to say.

50
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:02,887
- Prescott, do you trust this man?
- Let's discuss what he has to say.

51
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:06,456
- There's logic to what he's saying.
- How does he know? My lot is there!

52
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:11,431
Two or three years,
it could be ten years!

53
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,668
- We gain nothing by losing our heads!
- Look at that well out there!

54
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:16,300
Nobody's losing their heads.

55
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,839
You have no business being here!

56
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:23,284
Sit that woman down, sir!

57
00:17:24,953 --> 00:17:26,318
You can sit down.

58
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:28,923
Mr. Plainview! Please, Mr. Plainview.

59
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:32,016
No, Mr. Plainview!
No, where are you going?

60
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:35,221
- I don't need the lease. Thank you.
- But we need you.

61
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,560
Too much confusion.
Thank you for your time.

62
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,327
No, no, there's no confusion.

63
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:43,131
I wouldn't take the lease
if you gave it to me as a gift.

64
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:56,579
<i>Mr. Bankside,
I'm not going to waste your time.</i>

65
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:59,153
<i>I'd certainly appreciate it
if you didn't waste mine.</i>

66
00:17:59,254 --> 00:18:03,987
Now, if you wish to sign with me, we
can have a well drilling within 10 days.

67
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:07,493
Your lot is further north
from the discovery well up here.

68
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:10,187
That means
we'll probably have to dig deeper.

69
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:12,698
And if there's as much oil here
as I think there is,

70
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:15,826
it'll be harder to reach, but once
we find it, we can take it right out.

71
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:20,533
We have to act quickly, because
very soon these fields will be dry.

72
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:22,973
I need you to know what you want to do.

73
00:18:23,078 --> 00:18:26,104
Now, because of the distance
from the discovery well,

74
00:18:26,214 --> 00:18:28,478
I'll pay you a smaller royalty
than you'd get down there

75
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:32,417
but I'm prepared to give you
a $1,000 bonus on your lot.

76
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:34,079
What kind of royalty
are you talking about?

77
00:18:34,189 --> 00:18:38,626
One-sixth, plus a guarantee
to start drilling within 10 days.

78
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:41,958
Now, that's something
you won't find anywhere else.

79
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:52,840
What age are your children, ma'am?

80
00:18:52,974 --> 00:18:54,669
Ten and twelve.

81
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:59,678
Mr. Plainview, a question, sir.
Where is your wife?

82
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:04,649
She died in childbirth, Mrs. Bankside.

83
00:19:05,754 --> 00:19:08,052
So it's just me and my son now.

84
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,795
It's coming in, boss!

85
00:19:17,232 --> 00:19:18,529
Hear it?

86
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:46,521
Mr. Plainview?

87
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:47,856
Yes?

88
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:52,191
Are you Daniel Plainview?

89
00:19:54,102 --> 00:19:55,228
Yes.

90
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,873
What can I do for you?

91
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:02,506
You look for oil.

92
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,212
That's right.

93
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:08,373
What do you pay for a place that has it?

94
00:20:08,516 --> 00:20:11,508
- Well, that depends.
- What does it depend on?

95
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:15,386
On a lot of things.

96
00:20:16,324 --> 00:20:21,318
If I told you I knew a place that had oil
where land could be bought cheaply,

97
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,193
what do you think that would be worth?

98
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,432
I think that you should let me know
what you know

99
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:32,665
and then we'll try
and work something out.

100
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:36,836
- Can I sit down?
- Please.

101
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:50,287
What church do you belong to?

102
00:20:55,997 --> 00:20:57,294
I...

103
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,959
I enjoy all faiths. I don't belong
to one church in particular.

104
00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:07,097
I like them all. I like everything.
Where are you from?

105
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:11,076
That would be telling you.
That's what I want to sell you.

106
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:16,208
What are you doing in Signal Hill?

107
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,718
We have oil,
and it seeps through the ground.

108
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,378
Do you want to pay me
to know where it is?

109
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,546
Just 'cause there's something
on the ground

110
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,419
doesn't mean
there's anything beneath it.

111
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:26,255
Why did Standard Oil buy up land?

112
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,695
Is it in California?

113
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:34,761
- Maybe.
- How much land did they buy?

114
00:21:34,903 --> 00:21:38,304
I'd like it better
if you didn't think I was stupid.

115
00:21:46,748 --> 00:21:49,080
Why did you come to me?

116
00:21:49,217 --> 00:21:53,517
- You just brought this well in.
- That's right.

117
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:57,921
Yes, so just give me $500 in cash
right now

118
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:00,493
and I'll tell you where it is.

119
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:02,859
I'll tell you what I'll do, son.
I'll give you $100 now,

120
00:22:02,964 --> 00:22:07,594
and if it proves to be a promising lease,
then give you a $1,000 bonus.

121
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:09,670
Six hundred dollars.

122
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:15,374
Tell me one thing to help me decide.
What else have you got up there?

123
00:22:15,477 --> 00:22:17,172
What do you grow?

124
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:21,009
We have a big ranch,
but it's mostly rocks.

125
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:23,584
Plant things.
Nothing will grow but weeds.

126
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:24,912
What makes you think it's up?

127
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:28,113
Is there sulfur around?
Or alkali deposits?

128
00:22:28,256 --> 00:22:31,282
Alkali nearby. I don't know sulfur.

129
00:22:37,866 --> 00:22:39,663
Is that your son?

130
00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:41,398
Yes.

131
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:43,999
- Hi.
- Hi.

132
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,041
- Who are you?
- I'm Fletcher Hamilton.

133
00:22:50,178 --> 00:22:52,146
Nice to meet you, son.
What's your name?

134
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,874
What do you do?

135
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:56,976
I work with Mr. Plainview.

136
00:22:57,685 --> 00:22:59,414
Here's $500, son.

137
00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:03,388
You tell me something worth hearing,
this money's yours.

138
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:11,230
I come from a town called Little Boston
in Isabella County.

139
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:17,838
This is us, here.
Spur station here at Little Boston.

140
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:20,931
The Sunday ranch
is what you're looking for.

141
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:23,272
There's a sheep trail
that takes you there.

142
00:23:23,378 --> 00:23:26,347
It's a mile out of town headed west,
not far.

143
00:23:26,481 --> 00:23:30,383
Just through a small pass here
near the base of the hills.

144
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:34,215
You'll pass a church
and just follow the sheep trail.

145
00:23:34,355 --> 00:23:38,485
- Where's Standard buying up?
- Here and here.

146
00:23:40,662 --> 00:23:43,096
- Your family name is Sunday, yes?
- That's right.

147
00:23:43,198 --> 00:23:44,665
How many's in your family?

148
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,996
My father and mother and sisters
and my brother Eli.

149
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,798
- How many sisters do you have?
- Two.

150
00:23:50,905 --> 00:23:53,237
- What's your name?
- Paul.

151
00:23:53,341 --> 00:23:56,572
Does any of your family know
about the oil that you say is there?

152
00:23:56,678 --> 00:23:58,111
I don't know.

153
00:23:58,213 --> 00:24:00,807
My uncle always said
there was oil there,

154
00:24:00,949 --> 00:24:03,417
but I don't know what they heard
or what they think.

155
00:24:03,518 --> 00:24:04,951
What do you grow?

156
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:10,218
It's goats. It's a goat farm.
I told you, nothing grows but weeds.

157
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,816
- Is there water?
- It's salty.

158
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:16,328
You drill a well,
it's hard not to get saltwater.

159
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:21,600
The oil is there. I'm telling you.

160
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:29,438
- I want to go now, so...
- You can stay tonight.

161
00:24:29,577 --> 00:24:33,638
- No, I want to go now. I want to leave.
- Listen, Paul.

162
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:40,284
If I travel all the way out there
and I find that you've been lying to me,

163
00:24:40,421 --> 00:24:43,015
I'm going to find you and I'm going
to take more than my money back.

164
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:45,354
Is that all right with you?

165
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,690
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then.

166
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:52,559
- Nice luck to you. God bless.
- And to you, young man.

167
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,991
- There's someone coming.
- Thank you, Mary.

168
00:26:43,745 --> 00:26:47,272
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

169
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:53,082
My name's Daniel Plainview.
This is my son, H.W.

170
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:56,719
- Are you hunting?
- Hunting for quail.

171
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:59,691
We're told there might be a good place
to camp up near the Sunday ranch.

172
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:01,625
This is the Sunday ranch.
You can camp here.

173
00:27:01,763 --> 00:27:04,459
- Thank you. Do you have water?
- Yes.

174
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:07,457
We heard there was an earthquake
up here a few days ago.

175
00:27:07,602 --> 00:27:09,433
- Is that right?
- Yes.

176
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:13,967
- Your family?
- Yeah, all fine. Thank you.

177
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,046
- We have goat's milk, if you'd like.
- That would be fine.

178
00:27:21,082 --> 00:27:22,049
Now,

179
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:28,012
if we set our tent away over there,
we'd be out of your way over there.

180
00:27:28,122 --> 00:27:29,384
That's fine.

181
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,685
Ruth! Help these men
and bring them some water.

182
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:33,226
No! H.W.

183
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:38,587
Mr. Plainview,
would you like that milk now?

184
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:42,794
- That would be fine. Thank you.
- Mary! Bring them some milk.

185
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:44,370
My family will help you set up your tent.

186
00:27:44,472 --> 00:27:46,702
No, please.
We set ourselves on this camping trip.

187
00:27:46,808 --> 00:27:48,469
We have to do the camping.

188
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:49,974
Hurry up!

189
00:27:52,947 --> 00:27:56,940
- Do you have bread?
- We have potatoes.

190
00:27:57,085 --> 00:27:58,712
Potatoes would be nice, thank you.

191
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,287
I'll have them boil you up
some potatoes.

192
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:02,719
That's all right.
I thought maybe we'd make a fire.

193
00:28:02,824 --> 00:28:05,054
I wanted to work with my son
on making a fire.

194
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:07,093
All right. My son, Eli, will bring you
some wood.

195
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,253
Thank you so much for your hospitality,
Mr. Sunday.

196
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:11,422
- Yes.
- And we'll be out of your way.

197
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:14,262
- We're just hunting for quail.
- Yes.

198
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,398
- I'm sorry we don't have any bread.
- No, no, no.

199
00:28:18,506 --> 00:28:21,304
Corn doesn't fill out in the hills here.
It's mostly rock.

200
00:28:21,442 --> 00:28:24,240
We don't have room to raise the grain.

201
00:28:27,982 --> 00:28:30,041
Thank you, young lady.

202
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:56,903
My name is Eli.

203
00:28:58,246 --> 00:29:00,214
Yes, you're Eli Sunday.

204
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:02,614
Welcome.

205
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,015
- H.W.
- Eli.

206
00:29:13,327 --> 00:29:16,421
- You're hunting quail?
- That's right.

207
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:25,195
- We will bring dinner.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

208
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:48,482
Dad!

209
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,919
Dad, look at my shoe.

210
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:20,046
That's earthquake oil. Set loose.

211
00:31:43,577 --> 00:31:44,874
<i>So...</i>

212
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,674
<i>So?</i>

213
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:49,914
<i>So, so.</i>

214
00:31:50,718 --> 00:31:54,017
<i>If there's anything here,
we take it to the sea.</i>

215
00:31:55,156 --> 00:31:58,887
What we do is we build a pipeline
to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula,

216
00:31:58,993 --> 00:32:00,517
it's about 100 miles,

217
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:04,530
and we do a deal with Union Oil.
This is what we do.

218
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:08,035
Then we don't need the railroads
and their shipping costs anymore.

219
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:09,534
You see?

220
00:32:12,373 --> 00:32:13,397
Yeah.

221
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:16,143
- You see that?
- Yeah.

222
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:19,508
Then we're making money.
We're making the real money.

223
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:21,444
What we should be making.
Not just...

224
00:32:21,582 --> 00:32:23,948
Not just throwing it away
on shipping costs.

225
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:26,212
Otherwise, it's just mud.

226
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:33,018
How much are we going to pay them?

227
00:32:33,894 --> 00:32:35,384
Who's that?

228
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:39,896
The Sunday family.

229
00:32:40,468 --> 00:32:43,335
I'm not going to give them oil prices.

230
00:32:45,906 --> 00:32:48,170
I'll give them quail prices.

231
00:32:53,914 --> 00:32:55,541
If we could take a few minutes,

232
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:58,777
there's something I'd very much
like to talk with you about.

233
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,252
Mother, would you take the girls
outside, please?

234
00:33:14,468 --> 00:33:17,232
I believe in plain speaking, so...

235
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:21,034
This is a beautiful ranch.
I love hunting for quail.

236
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:24,969
My boy has been sick, you know.
He needs fresh air.

237
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,310
Doctors all say
he needs plentiful fresh air.

238
00:33:30,151 --> 00:33:31,118
So,

239
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:37,680
what would you say would be
a fair price for this lot, Abel?

240
00:33:38,826 --> 00:33:41,386
- To buy this place?
- That's right.

241
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,197
Take a moment.

242
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:55,804
- I'm sorry. I don't know.
- Six dollars an acre.

243
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,346
Six dollars? Thank you, Eli.

244
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,177
And then with the improvements
to the ranch over the years at $500...

245
00:34:03,317 --> 00:34:05,842
I'd like to offer you $3,700
for this ranch.

246
00:34:05,986 --> 00:34:08,546
- That's $3,700.
- No.

247
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,788
The Lord has sent this man here, Eli.

248
00:34:11,892 --> 00:34:13,382
Yes, I believe He has.

249
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:17,588
- My offer to you is $3,700.
- What is it that brought you here, sir?

250
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:20,460
The Good Lord's guidance.

251
00:34:20,568 --> 00:34:21,899
- Now, of course, within that...
- What about our oil?

252
00:34:22,002 --> 00:34:23,663
...we're going to develop a lease.

253
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:28,464
- What's that?
- What about our oil?

254
00:34:29,877 --> 00:34:31,310
What about it?

255
00:34:31,412 --> 00:34:33,607
We have oil here.
That's worth something.

256
00:34:33,714 --> 00:34:36,148
Do you have someone
who can drill for it?

257
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,184
- Do you think there's oil here?
- I know there is.

258
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:40,344
It's very expensive to drill.

259
00:34:40,488 --> 00:34:42,649
To get it up and out of the ground.
You ever tried that before?

260
00:34:42,756 --> 00:34:44,815
- How much is it?
- Costly.

261
00:34:44,925 --> 00:34:47,985
Well, our oil sits right up
on top of the ground.

262
00:34:49,029 --> 00:34:50,758
I believe that's called seepage.

263
00:34:50,898 --> 00:34:52,388
Doesn't necessarily mean
there's anything underneath.

264
00:34:52,533 --> 00:34:54,694
- What would you give us for it?
- I don't know.

265
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:57,737
- Something you don't know.
- That's right.

266
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:03,009
What would you like, Eli?

267
00:35:04,745 --> 00:35:07,043
Ten thousand dollars.

268
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,717
For what?

269
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:14,381
For my church.

270
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,821
That's good.

271
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,633
That's a good one.

272
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:33,273
Well...

273
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:38,137
If we decide to drill for oil
and if the well begins to produce,

274
00:35:38,245 --> 00:35:39,940
I'll give your church
a $5,000 signing bonus.

275
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:41,014
Ten thousand.

276
00:35:41,115 --> 00:35:43,606
Do you want to find someone else
that's going to come here and drill, Eli?

277
00:35:43,717 --> 00:35:46,811
Make the investment and do
all the hard work that goes into it?

278
00:35:46,954 --> 00:35:50,822
I can just as easily hunt for quail
on another ranch as I can here, so...

279
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:55,588
Though I'll happily be a supporter
of your church for as long as I can.

280
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:57,493
For the bonus only.

281
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,100
Now, as it happens, I do have some
connections in the drilling business

282
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:07,766
who might help get us started.
How do you feel about this, Abel?

283
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,775
Yes. What Eli says.

284
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:13,073
Well, good! Let's draw up
some contracts and let's...

285
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,080
Let's give it a try.

286
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:19,283
Appreciate your help with this, Eli.

287
00:36:30,598 --> 00:36:32,225
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

288
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,630
- Real estate?
- Yes.

289
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:35,758
Yes, I'd like to talk to you.

290
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:40,397
I'm looking for some land.
I just bought the Sunday ranch.

291
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:44,568
And, well, where's the map?

292
00:36:45,145 --> 00:36:47,579
Where are the hills
behind the Sunday ranch?

293
00:36:47,715 --> 00:36:51,378
That's here. It's the Bandy tract.
He has over 600 acres.

294
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:55,546
Bandy, 600.

295
00:36:55,689 --> 00:37:02,151
- What about this?
- A.C. Maude, Blodget, Redlick, Carr.

296
00:37:03,864 --> 00:37:06,856
- What's it held at?
- Six dollars an acre.

297
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:08,898
Six.

298
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:10,663
What about this?

299
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:14,366
That's the Belvins,
and that could be got, I'm sure.

300
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,973
Can everything around here be got?

301
00:37:19,747 --> 00:37:21,214
Sure.

302
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:48,997
Paul Sunday turned out
to be a good friend of ours.

303
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,302
That's right.

304
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:57,640
Well, you get here just as soon
as you can. Bring Fred English.

305
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:00,452
Good enough.

306
00:38:01,121 --> 00:38:02,850
Thank you, porter.

307
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:08,087
- H.W., how are you?
- Fine, and you?

308
00:38:08,195 --> 00:38:10,095
- Pretty good. Where's your dad?
- He's inside.

309
00:38:10,197 --> 00:38:11,596
You fellas are a long way
from Signal Hill.

310
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:13,667
- Hello, Plainview.
- Hello, Gene.

311
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:16,292
- Good to see you.
- Charlie.

312
00:38:16,437 --> 00:38:20,965
- On your way somewhere else?
- Passing through. Looking around.

313
00:38:21,108 --> 00:38:23,599
- Funny to see you.
- Funny, isn't it?

314
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,474
You boys are a regular family business.

315
00:38:26,613 --> 00:38:28,274
You boys are a little late.

316
00:38:28,415 --> 00:38:32,442
- What did you find?
- I found some interesting prospects.

317
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:33,814
Did you hear Standard bought up?

318
00:38:33,954 --> 00:38:36,548
- Mostly in the north, so far.
- That's what I hear.

319
00:38:36,657 --> 00:38:40,093
I'm gonna tell you, Gene,
if you're gonna make a play, look east.

320
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:45,460
I'd rather it be you than someone else.
This mud around here has been taken.

321
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,126
It must be easy when you have such
a cute face to carry around with you.

322
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:52,329
- Telling me how handsome my son is?
- Well, that I am.

323
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:55,602
That's very nice. Thank you.
Good luck, Gene.

324
00:38:55,743 --> 00:38:58,211
- Take care.
- Like I said, go east.

325
00:38:58,312 --> 00:38:59,404
H.W.

326
00:39:00,447 --> 00:39:03,109
I'll be your lawyer
if you need to draw up a contract.

327
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,516
Make sure you don't get swindled, boy.
Get half what your dad's making.

328
00:39:17,798 --> 00:39:19,390
How's that?

329
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:36,509
What are those men doing?

330
00:39:38,852 --> 00:39:41,377
They're just guys
that are working for us.

331
00:39:41,522 --> 00:39:43,820
They're just looking around.

332
00:39:46,026 --> 00:39:48,256
How much money can we make?

333
00:39:52,299 --> 00:39:54,665
I don't know. It depends.

334
00:39:58,872 --> 00:40:00,965
One thousand dollars?

335
00:40:08,816 --> 00:40:12,582
Mary said that her father beats her
if she doesn't pray.

336
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:21,593
Mary, she's the smaller one?

337
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:25,788
Yes, she is.

338
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,105
- Everyone here?
- Very successful.

339
00:40:42,883 --> 00:40:43,907
But?

340
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:47,418
There were a few vacant lots
and one holdout.

341
00:40:47,554 --> 00:40:49,181
- Who?
- William Bandy.

342
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:51,348
...eight. Who's he?

343
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:52,857
He's an old man
who homesteaded here.

344
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,088
Lives with his grandson.
He said he'd like to speak with you.

345
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,390
Is he here?

346
00:40:57,531 --> 00:41:00,557
No, he'd like you to come visit with him.

347
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:02,396
He's boosting his price.

348
00:41:02,536 --> 00:41:06,336
He said he'd like to speak
with whoever is doing the buying.

349
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,705
Well, let him wait. He'll come around.
Let's go.

350
00:41:16,783 --> 00:41:18,717
Ladies and gentlemen?

351
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,745
Ladies and gentlemen.

352
00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:25,256
Thank you so much
for visiting with us this evening.

353
00:41:25,392 --> 00:41:28,953
Now, I've traveled across half our state
to be here and to see about this land.

354
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,522
<i>Now, I daresay some of you
might have heard</i>

355
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:37,501
<i>some of the more extravagant rumors
about what my plans are,</i>

356
00:41:37,604 --> 00:41:40,368
<i>so I just thought
you'd like to hear it from me.</i>

357
00:41:40,507 --> 00:41:43,374
<i>This is the face. It's no great mystery.</i>

358
00:41:46,246 --> 00:41:50,205
<i>I'm an oilman, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

359
00:41:51,084 --> 00:41:54,485
<i>I have numerous concerns
spread across this state.</i>

360
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:57,989
<i>I have many wells flowing
at many thousand barrels per day,</i>

361
00:41:58,091 --> 00:42:01,060
<i>so I like to think of myself as an oilman.</i>

362
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:03,859
<i>As an oilman, I hope that you'll forgive</i>

363
00:42:03,964 --> 00:42:06,865
<i>just good old-fashioned plain speaking.</i>

364
00:42:08,502 --> 00:42:12,029
<i>Now, this work that we do
is very much a family enterprise.</i>

365
00:42:12,172 --> 00:42:14,834
<i>I work side by side
with my wonderful son, H. W.</i>

366
00:42:14,942 --> 00:42:18,173
<i>I think one or two of you
might have met him already.</i>

367
00:42:18,278 --> 00:42:22,044
<i>And I encourage my men
to bring their families, as well.</i>

368
00:42:22,182 --> 00:42:26,141
<i>Of course, it makes for an ever
so much more rewarding life for them.</i>

369
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:30,212
<i>Family means children,
and children means education.</i>

370
00:42:30,357 --> 00:42:34,020
<i>So, wherever we set up camp,
education is a necessity,</i>

371
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:36,356
<i>and we're just so happy
to take care of that.</i>

372
00:42:36,496 --> 00:42:38,862
So let's build a wonderful school
in Little Boston.

373
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:41,194
These children are the future
that we strive for,

374
00:42:41,335 --> 00:42:44,429
and so they should have
the very best of things.

375
00:42:44,538 --> 00:42:46,529
Now, something else,

376
00:42:46,673 --> 00:42:50,507
and please don't be insulted
if I speak about this. Bread.

377
00:42:50,644 --> 00:42:52,612
Let's talk about bread.

378
00:42:53,313 --> 00:42:56,646
Now, to my mind, it's an abomination
to consider

379
00:42:56,783 --> 00:43:00,981
that any man, woman, or child
in this magnificent country of ours

380
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:04,579
should have to look upon
a loaf of bread as a luxury.

381
00:43:05,392 --> 00:43:08,953
<i>We're going to dig water wells here,
and water wells means irrigation.</i>

382
00:43:09,096 --> 00:43:11,462
<i>Irrigation means cultivation.</i>

383
00:43:11,598 --> 00:43:15,466
<i>We're going to raise crops here where
before it just simply wasn't possible.</i>

384
00:43:15,602 --> 00:43:18,002
<i>You're going to have more grain
than you'll know what to do with,</i>

385
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:21,073
<i>and bread will be coming right
out of your ears, ma'am.</i>

386
00:43:21,174 --> 00:43:26,476
<i>New roads, agriculture,
employment, education.</i>

387
00:43:26,613 --> 00:43:28,581
These are just a few of the things
we can offer you,

388
00:43:28,682 --> 00:43:30,650
and I assure you,
ladies and gentlemen,

389
00:43:30,784 --> 00:43:32,945
that if we do find oil here,

390
00:43:33,086 --> 00:43:36,487
and I think there's a very good chance
that we will,

391
00:43:36,623 --> 00:43:41,117
this community of yours
will not only survive, it will flourish.

392
00:43:43,363 --> 00:43:46,389
I'd be happy to answer any questions
that you might have. Yes?

393
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,025
Will the new road lead to the church?

394
00:43:49,136 --> 00:43:53,573
That'll be the first place that it leads.
Thank you, Eli. Anyone else?

395
00:43:54,241 --> 00:43:56,539
Well, if anything comes up,
I'm pretty easy to find.

396
00:43:56,643 --> 00:43:57,905
You just come visit with me.

397
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:00,036
Thank you so much for your time,
and good night.

398
00:44:38,585 --> 00:44:43,545
<i>What a privilege to carry</i>

399
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:47,558
<i>everything to God in prayer!</i>

400
00:44:48,528 --> 00:44:52,089
<i>What a privilege to carry...</i>

401
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:11,314
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

402
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:13,648
The new road will lead you there.

403
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:15,415
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

404
00:45:15,555 --> 00:45:19,082
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

405
00:45:19,226 --> 00:45:20,921
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

406
00:45:21,061 --> 00:45:23,359
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

407
00:45:23,497 --> 00:45:26,523
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

408
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:38,936
<i>Jesus knows our every weakness</i>

409
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:43,716
<i>Take it to the Lord in prayer</i>

410
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:49,115
<i>Are we weak and heavy-laden</i>

411
00:45:50,157 --> 00:45:53,149
<i>Cumbered with a load of care?</i>

412
00:45:54,394 --> 00:45:57,488
<i>Precious Savior still our refuge</i>

413
00:45:59,533 --> 00:46:02,127
<i>Take it to the Lord in prayer...</i>

414
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:17,207
- Daniel, may I speak with you?
- Yes, come in.

415
00:46:19,352 --> 00:46:22,321
I'll bring them up when they arrive.

416
00:46:22,455 --> 00:46:24,650
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

417
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:26,691
How is all the work coming?

418
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,260
Everything's good.

419
00:46:28,361 --> 00:46:31,489
- All the men are provided for?
- Of course.

420
00:46:33,567 --> 00:46:35,432
Spirits seem high.

421
00:46:37,904 --> 00:46:41,340
Is there anything
that you need from me?

422
00:46:44,444 --> 00:46:48,676
- Anything the church can do for you?
- I don't believe so. No. Thank you.

423
00:46:48,815 --> 00:46:51,147
I understand you've asked the people
to gather around

424
00:46:51,284 --> 00:46:52,876
and watch the well begin tomorrow.
Is that right?

425
00:46:52,986 --> 00:46:54,954
- That's right.
- I will bless the well.

426
00:46:56,723 --> 00:46:59,419
Before you begin,
you should introduce me.

427
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:02,086
You'll see me walk up
towards the oil well, and when I...

428
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:03,253
The derrick.

429
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:07,163
You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say my name.

430
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,427
When you walk up?

431
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:13,438
Yes. You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say,

432
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,671
"The proud son of these hills
who tended his Father's flock,"

433
00:47:18,912 --> 00:47:21,312
and then you could say my name.

434
00:47:22,616 --> 00:47:24,174
That's fine.

435
00:47:25,185 --> 00:47:28,586
- And what happens then?
- Well, then we start the drill.

436
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:35,387
It's a simple blessing, Daniel,
but an important one.

437
00:47:35,528 --> 00:47:38,497
It's just a few words. It won't take long.

438
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,693
- What time?
- What time's good for you, Eli?

439
00:47:42,836 --> 00:47:45,634
- 4:00.
- Well, let's make it 4:00 then.

440
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,471
- My thanks for your visit.
- Good day. Thank you.

441
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:07,860
Afternoon, everyone.

442
00:48:09,195 --> 00:48:10,787
Come with me.

443
00:48:16,202 --> 00:48:19,660
I thank you all so much
for visiting with us at this time.

444
00:48:19,806 --> 00:48:21,603
I've had the pleasure of
meeting some of you

445
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:23,539
and I hope very much
in the months to come,

446
00:48:23,677 --> 00:48:26,840
I'll be able to visit with
each and every one of you.

447
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,642
I'm better at digging holes in the
ground than making speeches,

448
00:48:29,783 --> 00:48:31,307
so let's forget the speech
for this evening,

449
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:33,351
just make it a simple blessing.

450
00:48:33,486 --> 00:48:35,249
You see, one man doesn't prospect
from the ground.

451
00:48:35,355 --> 00:48:39,291
It takes a whole community of
good people, such as yourselves,

452
00:48:39,392 --> 00:48:42,384
and this is good. We stay together.

453
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,258
We pray together, we work together,

454
00:48:44,364 --> 00:48:47,333
and if the Good Lord smiles kindly
on our endeavor,

455
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:49,935
we share in the wealth together.

456
00:48:52,372 --> 00:48:54,431
Now, before we spud in
Mary's Well Number One,

457
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:57,704
named for the lovely
Miss Mary Sunday, here by my side,

458
00:48:57,811 --> 00:49:00,803
a proud daughter of these hills,

459
00:49:00,947 --> 00:49:04,644
I'd just like to say God bless these
honest labors of ours, and, of course,

460
00:49:04,784 --> 00:49:06,809
God bless you all.

461
00:49:06,953 --> 00:49:08,045
Amen.

462
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,451
Now go.

463
00:49:14,427 --> 00:49:16,190
Wort be a minute.

464
00:49:19,265 --> 00:49:21,233
Fast as you can, H.W.

465
00:49:24,738 --> 00:49:26,865
Are you ready to do this?

466
00:49:36,716 --> 00:49:39,184
That's it, ladies and gentlemen!

467
00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:47,185
Al Rose has very generously provided
some refreshments for this occasion

468
00:49:47,293 --> 00:49:50,023
out of his own pocket. Thank you, Al.

469
00:49:50,764 --> 00:49:55,201
If you'll all just care to help yourselves,
I'll be back in a minute.

470
00:51:08,174 --> 00:51:09,698
Mary.

471
00:51:11,377 --> 00:51:13,004
Mary Sunday.

472
00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:18,579
- Do you like your new dress?
- Yes. Thank you.

473
00:51:18,685 --> 00:51:21,586
You're welcome. I thought you'd like it.

474
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:24,980
- Are you happy I came here?
- Yes.

475
00:51:26,693 --> 00:51:30,390
Your daddy doesn't hit you anymore,
does he? Does he now?

476
00:51:31,264 --> 00:51:33,129
Better not, right?

477
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,791
I'll take care of you.

478
00:51:36,903 --> 00:51:42,034
No more hitting, right?
No more hitting. Now go.

479
00:51:42,175 --> 00:51:45,201
Go and play some more
and don't come back.

480
00:51:54,354 --> 00:51:55,787
Daniel?

481
00:51:59,459 --> 00:52:03,623
It's okay, H.W. Go back to sleep.
Go on. Go back to sleep.

482
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:07,326
Daniel.

483
00:52:09,736 --> 00:52:10,930
Daniel.

484
00:52:13,873 --> 00:52:15,135
Daniel!

485
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:17,903
Daniel!

486
00:52:18,011 --> 00:52:19,273
What?

487
00:52:21,147 --> 00:52:23,240
Lost a man down the well.

488
00:52:27,787 --> 00:52:29,914
- What man?
- Joe Gundha.

489
00:52:31,925 --> 00:52:33,984
- Did I know him?
- No.

490
00:52:34,494 --> 00:52:35,552
What happened?

491
00:52:43,236 --> 00:52:44,635
Pick it up.

492
00:52:45,305 --> 00:52:46,897
Set the brake.

493
00:52:47,006 --> 00:52:49,304
- Tie it down.
- Tie it on.

494
00:52:53,913 --> 00:52:55,244
Shit!

495
00:52:57,317 --> 00:53:00,115
God damn it. Where's the body?

496
00:53:00,453 --> 00:53:03,445
- They're fishing it out now.
- All right.

497
00:53:06,826 --> 00:53:09,454
- Where's the bit?
- It's on the deck.

498
00:53:53,006 --> 00:53:55,839
Clean him up. Put some clothes on him.

499
00:53:56,976 --> 00:53:58,238
And...

500
00:53:59,879 --> 00:54:01,437
Set up a tent.

501
00:54:01,547 --> 00:54:05,506
Anyone goes down into the cellar,
you tell somebody. Yes?

502
00:54:06,152 --> 00:54:07,551
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

503
00:54:11,491 --> 00:54:13,516
Shut down till midday.

504
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:50,228
And I had a vision.
Yes, last night, I had a vision

505
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:53,231
and I felt God's breath
move through me.

506
00:54:56,869 --> 00:55:00,965
And it rolled down into my stomach.

507
00:55:02,975 --> 00:55:04,840
It sloshed around.

508
00:55:06,245 --> 00:55:10,113
And my stomach spoke in a whisper,
not a shout,

509
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:17,551
"Touch this woman with your hands
and caress her." Yes.

510
00:55:21,928 --> 00:55:24,089
My dear Mrs. Hunter,

511
00:55:25,264 --> 00:55:27,596
you have arthritis, don't you?

512
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:29,725
- Yes, I do, Eli.
- Yes.

513
00:55:29,836 --> 00:55:33,431
The devil is in your hands,
and I will suck it out.

514
00:55:34,607 --> 00:55:39,067
Now, I will not cast this ghost out
with a fever

515
00:55:39,212 --> 00:55:44,240
for the new spirit inside me has shown
me I have a new way to communicate.

516
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:48,744
It is a gentle whisper.

517
00:55:55,128 --> 00:55:57,494
Get out of here, ghost.

518
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:02,398
Get out of here, ghost.

519
00:56:04,437 --> 00:56:05,870
Get out.

520
00:56:06,472 --> 00:56:09,373
Get out of here, ghost.

521
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:14,907
Get out of here, ghost.

522
00:56:15,047 --> 00:56:18,949
...and enter this woman's body now.
- Get out of here, ghost.

523
00:56:19,051 --> 00:56:23,886
Get out of here. Don't you dare turn
around and come back.

524
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:26,786
For if you do,

525
00:56:26,893 --> 00:56:32,388
all the armies of my boot
will kick you in the teeth

526
00:56:32,532 --> 00:56:36,024
and you will be cast up
and thrown in the dirt

527
00:56:36,169 --> 00:56:38,535
and thrust back to perdition!

528
00:56:38,671 --> 00:56:42,368
And as long as I have teeth,
I will bite you,

529
00:56:42,508 --> 00:56:46,467
and if I have no teeth, I will gum you!

530
00:56:46,579 --> 00:56:50,310
And as long as I have fists,
I will bash you!

531
00:56:50,416 --> 00:56:55,149
Now, get out of here, ghost!
Get out of here, ghost!

532
00:56:55,288 --> 00:56:58,314
Get out of here, ghost!

533
00:57:01,494 --> 00:57:03,086
And it left!

534
00:57:03,863 --> 00:57:05,854
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

535
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,834
- Praise the Lord and his holy days!
- Praise God!

536
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:13,405
- Amen! Thank you.
- Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, God.

537
00:57:14,674 --> 00:57:16,835
My dear Mrs. Hunter.

538
00:57:20,446 --> 00:57:22,175
Dance with me.

539
00:57:29,422 --> 00:57:31,754
- Thanks for coming.
- It was a wonderful sermon.

540
00:57:31,858 --> 00:57:34,258
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- Yes.

541
00:57:39,265 --> 00:57:40,232
Eli.

542
00:57:42,802 --> 00:57:45,600
Had a tragedy at the well last night.

543
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:48,534
Yes, I heard.

544
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:51,041
Joe Gundha was a man
of considerable faith.

545
00:57:51,143 --> 00:57:55,375
So if you wish to say a few words,
his burial is at noon tomorrow.

546
00:57:55,481 --> 00:57:58,314
Daniel, this accident
could have been avoided.

547
00:57:58,451 --> 00:58:00,544
It is terrible to think of that well

548
00:58:00,653 --> 00:58:02,518
- working away out there...
- These men work in 12-hour shifts.

549
00:58:02,622 --> 00:58:03,611
...unblessed.
- They need their rest.

550
00:58:03,756 --> 00:58:05,485
If they don't have it,
they start to make stupid mistakes.

551
00:58:05,591 --> 00:58:08,355
I've seen the men drinking. Don't you
think that has something to do with this?

552
00:58:08,461 --> 00:58:09,928
We need these men well-rested
to bring in this well.

553
00:58:10,062 --> 00:58:12,223
They can't get that if they're up here
listening to your gospel,

554
00:58:12,331 --> 00:58:14,458
and then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

555
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,568
I wish I had more time with Joe Gundha.

556
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:17,896
More could have been done.

557
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:23,031
Then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

558
00:58:29,382 --> 00:58:31,680
Now, would you see to it
that his personal possessions

559
00:58:31,784 --> 00:58:33,911
find their way
back to his family, please?

560
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:35,520
Thank you.

561
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:39,183
Heard you were planning
some renovations.

562
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:42,261
Yes, our congregation
is growing strongly.

563
00:58:42,929 --> 00:58:47,389
- We need more room.
- That was one goddamn hell of a show.

564
00:58:48,534 --> 00:58:51,059
We were happy to have you, Daniel.

565
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:46,413
Gas, gas, gas!

566
01:00:55,494 --> 01:00:58,588
Lights out! Wait here. Wait here.
Lights out!

567
01:01:08,741 --> 01:01:10,538
Put that fire out!

568
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:41,169
Is he hurt? H.W.!
Hand him down to me!

569
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:47,975
- Hand him down!
- Here.

570
01:01:52,118 --> 01:01:54,211
- Got him?
- I've got him!

571
01:02:01,527 --> 01:02:02,892
Oh, God.

572
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:19,709
Come on.

573
01:02:31,857 --> 01:02:33,415
Open the door.

574
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,970
Let go. There you go. You're safe.
You're safe.

575
01:02:51,944 --> 01:02:55,778
You're safe now. I got you here.
You're safe. Let go, son.

576
01:02:57,149 --> 01:03:00,016
Tell me where it hurts.
Tell me where it hurts. Tell me where...

577
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:01,619
- Did you see this?
- No.

578
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:02,778
Tell me where it hurts.

579
01:03:02,888 --> 01:03:05,448
Where does it hurt you?
Where does it hurt you?

580
01:03:05,558 --> 01:03:09,221
- I can't hear my voice.
- Were you hit in the head?

581
01:03:09,929 --> 01:03:14,457
Were you hit in the head? Tell me!
You have to tell me if you were!

582
01:03:14,567 --> 01:03:16,592
I can't hear my voice.

583
01:03:25,578 --> 01:03:28,308
I have to go and deal with this now.
You wait here for me.

584
01:03:28,414 --> 01:03:32,248
You understand? You wait here for me.
I'll be back. I'll be back in a minute.

585
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,511
- Wait here.
- Don't leave!

586
01:03:33,652 --> 01:03:38,089
I'm going to take care of you. Wait.
Stay here, son. I'm going to fix this.

587
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,088
- Don't leave!
- You're going to be fine!

588
01:03:39,191 --> 01:03:40,180
Wait for me here!

589
01:03:40,292 --> 01:03:43,284
- Hold him down. Hold him down.
- Don't leave!

590
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:48,159
Got to break the cables, Daniel!

591
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,165
Get me a hammer!

592
01:03:56,475 --> 01:03:58,306
Get me a hammer!

593
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,575
Here you go.

594
01:04:27,907 --> 01:04:29,238
Get back!

595
01:05:06,879 --> 01:05:08,176
- Michael!
- Sir!

596
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,714
Take Dave and two of the fellas,
pick up some hoses...

597
01:05:10,816 --> 01:05:14,752
Billy, protect the roof.
Don't wait before it gets too hot.

598
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:39,770
What are you looking
so miserable about?

599
01:05:39,912 --> 01:05:42,745
There's a whole ocean of oil
under our feet!

600
01:05:42,881 --> 01:05:45,543
No one can get at it except for me.

601
01:06:32,264 --> 01:06:33,856
H.W. okay?

602
01:06:34,867 --> 01:06:36,425
No, he isn't.

603
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:41,036
- Where is he?
- Mess room.

604
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:23,868
That's enough now.
That's enough, H.W. That's enough.

605
01:08:26,545 --> 01:08:29,571
Do you hear me?
Can you hear me in there?

606
01:08:35,354 --> 01:08:37,049
That's enough.

607
01:08:49,401 --> 01:08:52,165
- Grab his legs.
- I have his legs.

608
01:08:52,271 --> 01:08:54,171
- No. Nope.
- No, lad.

609
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:01,506
Give me that.

610
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:06,809
Steady. That's it.

611
01:09:06,919 --> 01:09:09,319
- Easy, boy. Easy.
- Soon be over.

612
01:09:09,421 --> 01:09:13,187
Yeah, and that's good.
Now the other side. Turn him over.

613
01:09:17,129 --> 01:09:18,096
Almost done.

614
01:09:21,633 --> 01:09:23,100
That's it.

615
01:09:23,969 --> 01:09:26,767
Come here. It's over. It's over.

616
01:11:33,065 --> 01:11:35,693
Who do we know in San Francisco

617
01:11:37,269 --> 01:11:40,033
or Los Angeles, who could work with...

618
01:11:42,574 --> 01:11:46,305
You know, we could...
Someone, a teacher for H.W.

619
01:11:50,649 --> 01:11:52,981
How could you figure out that?

620
01:11:53,852 --> 01:11:57,845
Now, call...
God damn it, what's his name?

621
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:00,288
Bob Brody in San Francisco?

622
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:04,520
Call Bob Brody
and get someone down here.

623
01:12:11,136 --> 01:12:13,036
I'll do it right away.

624
01:13:20,672 --> 01:13:22,936
When do we get our money, Daniel?

625
01:13:28,981 --> 01:13:32,508
Aren't you a healer?
And a vessel for the Holy Spirit?

626
01:13:32,651 --> 01:13:35,643
When are you coming over
and make my son hear again?

627
01:13:35,788 --> 01:13:36,914
Can't you do that?

628
01:13:37,022 --> 01:13:38,990
If you had let me bless the well,
this wouldn't have happened.

629
01:13:39,124 --> 01:13:41,922
- Daniel.
- You shouldn't have done that.

630
01:13:43,295 --> 01:13:47,595
You owe the Church of
the Third Revelation $5,000

631
01:13:47,699 --> 01:13:50,566
as part of the arrangement
that we made!

632
01:14:00,345 --> 01:14:05,146
Don't even try it, you little runt!
You splash around in here.

633
01:14:12,024 --> 01:14:13,924
That's it, that's it.

634
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:28,666
I'm going to bury you underground, Eli.

635
01:14:32,711 --> 01:14:35,305
I'm going to bury you underground.

636
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:09,643
You are a stupid man, Abel.

637
01:15:11,483 --> 01:15:16,113
You've let someone come in here
and walk all over us.

638
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:22,750
You let him in and do his work here,

639
01:15:22,861 --> 01:15:26,854
and you are a stupid man
for what we could have had.

640
01:15:26,999 --> 01:15:30,935
I followed His word, Eli. I tried.

641
01:15:31,036 --> 01:15:33,766
You didn't do anything but sit down.

642
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:37,608
You're lazy, and you're stupid.

643
01:15:41,313 --> 01:15:45,443
Do you think God is going
to save you for being stupid?

644
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,680
He doesn't save stupid people, Abel.

645
01:15:54,059 --> 01:15:58,496
I will tear you apart for
what you've done, you stupid man!

646
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:00,928
How did he come here?
Do you really know? I know!

647
01:16:01,033 --> 01:16:03,661
- Son, don't do this, please!
- Be quiet!

648
01:16:03,802 --> 01:16:08,830
Shut your mouth, Abel!
It was your stupid son!

649
01:16:08,974 --> 01:16:12,910
It was Paul who told him to come here.
I know it.

650
01:16:13,011 --> 01:16:14,740
He went to him and he said,

651
01:16:14,846 --> 01:16:19,579
"My stupid, weak father
will give away his lots.

652
01:16:19,685 --> 01:16:23,143
"Go and take him."
And you let it happen.

653
01:16:27,693 --> 01:16:30,821
A stupid father to a stupid son.

654
01:16:36,468 --> 01:16:38,129
Get out of there!

655
01:17:08,834 --> 01:17:10,461
Can I help you?

656
01:17:12,037 --> 01:17:13,561
Daniel?

657
01:17:13,672 --> 01:17:17,403
- Who's that?
- My name is Henry.

658
01:17:18,377 --> 01:17:19,776
Yeah?

659
01:17:20,946 --> 01:17:22,345
I'm Henry.

660
01:17:23,882 --> 01:17:25,907
What can I do for you?

661
01:17:28,787 --> 01:17:32,587
I'm Henry Plainview.
I'm from Fond du Lac.

662
01:17:35,127 --> 01:17:38,961
I'm your brother, from another mother.

663
01:17:41,233 --> 01:17:43,133
Ernest is my father.

664
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:48,963
Who are you?

665
01:17:50,342 --> 01:17:51,570
Henry.

666
01:18:18,637 --> 01:18:23,097
- Mary Branch? Is that your mother?
- Yes, sir, that's right.

667
01:18:25,343 --> 01:18:30,508
I read about your gusher in the paper,
about your success.

668
01:18:30,649 --> 01:18:33,675
You heard about my strike?
You just show up?

669
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,483
Our father's dead.

670
01:18:38,123 --> 01:18:41,320
Ernest died, I heard.
I wanted to find you.

671
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:43,087
When?

672
01:18:43,195 --> 01:18:46,790
Three months ago.
I got a letter from Annabelle.

673
01:18:47,799 --> 01:18:49,664
My sister, Annabelle?

674
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:55,333
- Where is she?
- Still at home. Fond du Lac.

675
01:18:57,075 --> 01:19:00,533
You came all the way
from Wisconsin to tell me this?

676
01:19:00,679 --> 01:19:03,705
I'm coming from New Mexico.
I've been there.

677
01:19:04,916 --> 01:19:06,781
I came to find you.

678
01:19:07,919 --> 01:19:09,978
Did you know about me?

679
01:19:18,096 --> 01:19:20,291
Do you have identification?

680
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:23,059
Do you have this letter?

681
01:19:46,224 --> 01:19:48,283
- Where are you coming from?
- From New Mexico.

682
01:19:48,393 --> 01:19:50,851
Yes, I know, but from where?

683
01:19:50,996 --> 01:19:54,022
Silver City.
I've been there for two years.

684
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:59,901
I was trying drilling of my own for years.

685
01:20:00,038 --> 01:20:06,443
- Getting leases in Texas. Louisiana.
- Anything that produced?

686
01:20:06,545 --> 01:20:09,537
No. Not like your success, no.

687
01:20:16,054 --> 01:20:18,488
- Are you married?
- No.

688
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:22,983
I spent time in jail.
I had a stretch of very bad time.

689
01:20:23,662 --> 01:20:26,859
I had nothing.
I was picked up in Louisiana.

690
01:20:28,366 --> 01:20:31,995
I worked on a chain gang
for six months building roads.

691
01:20:32,537 --> 01:20:35,700
That was a very hard time.

692
01:20:39,477 --> 01:20:41,274
Are you married?

693
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:44,981
What were you in jail for?

694
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:49,611
Believe it or not, for all the
terrible things I've gotten myself into,

695
01:20:49,721 --> 01:20:53,248
when they picked me up,
I hadn't done anything.

696
01:20:53,358 --> 01:20:57,158
But I've done my share of things

697
01:20:59,464 --> 01:21:01,864
that shouldn't be talked about.

698
01:21:24,356 --> 01:21:27,416
Drink it. Drink it!

699
01:22:10,001 --> 01:22:11,298
Come on.

700
01:22:42,968 --> 01:22:44,265
So...

701
01:22:49,074 --> 01:22:50,837
What do you want, Henry?

702
01:22:53,278 --> 01:22:54,677
Nothing.

703
01:22:57,816 --> 01:23:01,980
If you can spare something,
I can work for you in any way.

704
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:06,420
I know I'll keep moving, before long,
to get back to Fond du Lac.

705
01:23:07,459 --> 01:23:09,791
- Do you have any money?
- Some.

706
01:23:10,895 --> 01:23:13,056
- Not much.
- Just answer me directly.

707
01:23:13,164 --> 01:23:16,759
You say "nothing," then you say
you'd like to stay and work.

708
01:23:16,868 --> 01:23:21,805
And it's better, I'd just like to hear
you say you'd like to be here.

709
01:23:22,941 --> 01:23:24,841
I'd like to be here.

710
01:23:30,181 --> 01:23:35,778
I'm a good worker.
I worked cable tool rigs, built railroads.

711
01:23:37,956 --> 01:23:39,981
I won't need any favors.

712
01:23:44,996 --> 01:23:46,122
Good.

713
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:14,151
<i>What did my mother know?</i>

714
01:24:16,761 --> 01:24:18,422
<i>I don't know.</i>

715
01:24:18,997 --> 01:24:23,525
<i>I don't know if she knew and looked
the other way, if she never knew.</i>

716
01:24:26,271 --> 01:24:28,034
<i>Why did you leave?</i>

717
01:24:29,974 --> 01:24:32,943
<i>I know you didn't get on with our father.</i>

718
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:41,880
I worked for Geological Survey
and went to Kansas.

719
01:24:44,322 --> 01:24:47,348
I couldn't stay there. I just couldn't.

720
01:24:49,094 --> 01:24:51,619
I don't like to explain myself.

721
01:24:57,669 --> 01:25:01,901
- Are you an angry man, Henry?
- About what?

722
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:06,506
Are you envious? Do you get envious?

723
01:25:07,812 --> 01:25:09,746
I don't think so, no.

724
01:25:14,219 --> 01:25:16,551
I have a competition in me.

725
01:25:17,789 --> 01:25:20,189
I want no one else to succeed.

726
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:29,724
- I hate most people.
- That part of me is gone.

727
01:25:30,969 --> 01:25:33,836
Working and not succeeding,

728
01:25:33,938 --> 01:25:37,931
all my failures have left me...

729
01:25:40,979 --> 01:25:42,844
I just don't care.

730
01:25:44,549 --> 01:25:47,143
Well, if it's in me, it's in you.

731
01:25:48,686 --> 01:25:54,090
There are times when I look at people
and I see nothing worth liking.

732
01:26:00,098 --> 01:26:04,125
I want to earn enough money
I can get away from everyone.

733
01:26:09,174 --> 01:26:11,642
What will you do about your boy?

734
01:26:19,384 --> 01:26:21,011
I don't know.

735
01:26:22,554 --> 01:26:24,988
Maybe it'll change.

736
01:26:25,156 --> 01:26:29,559
Does your sound come back to you?
I don't know. Maybe no one knows that.

737
01:26:29,694 --> 01:26:33,858
- Doctor might not know that.
- Where's his mother?

738
01:26:39,837 --> 01:26:42,863
I don't want to talk about those things.

739
01:26:46,211 --> 01:26:48,441
I see the worst in people, Henry.

740
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:54,315
I don't need to look past seeing them
to get all I need.

741
01:26:56,487 --> 01:27:00,446
I've built up my hatreds over the years,
little by little.

742
01:27:04,162 --> 01:27:07,495
Having you here
gives me a second breath of life.

743
01:27:08,733 --> 01:27:11,327
I can't keep doing this on my own

744
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:19,702
with these people.

745
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:02,075
Daniel! Daniel, wake up! Daniel!

746
01:29:44,422 --> 01:29:47,880
Just have to go and have a word
with the conductor.

747
01:29:48,659 --> 01:29:50,752
I'll be right back.

748
01:29:50,895 --> 01:29:55,594
You stay here. You understand?
You stay here.

749
01:29:56,667 --> 01:29:58,498
I'll be right back.

750
01:30:51,222 --> 01:30:53,053
No! No!

751
01:30:54,759 --> 01:30:55,987
No!

752
01:31:05,837 --> 01:31:07,361
- Tilford!
- Plainview.

753
01:31:07,505 --> 01:31:09,803
This is my brother,
Henry Plainview from Fond du Lac.

754
01:31:09,907 --> 01:31:11,534
H.M. Tilford. Pleasure.

755
01:31:11,676 --> 01:31:14,144
Henry Plainview. J.J. Carter.

756
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:17,545
So...

757
01:31:17,682 --> 01:31:19,309
- Shall we?
- Yes.

758
01:31:27,492 --> 01:31:29,687
How's your boy?

759
01:31:29,827 --> 01:31:33,194
- Thank you for asking.
- Is there anything we can do?

760
01:31:33,331 --> 01:31:35,731
Thanks for asking is enough.

761
01:31:37,401 --> 01:31:39,392
So what are your plans?

762
01:31:41,172 --> 01:31:44,403
Is this about buying up my tracts here?

763
01:31:44,542 --> 01:31:45,600
Yes.

764
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:48,543
The cable was
about my Coyote Hills lease.

765
01:31:48,679 --> 01:31:52,843
- We'd like that, too.
- What's your offer on Coyote Hills?

766
01:31:52,984 --> 01:31:57,546
- We'll offer 150,000 for full title.
- That's a deal. What's next?

767
01:31:58,389 --> 01:32:02,951
You have 11,000 acres in Little Boston.
You have one proven well

768
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,550
- that was damaged...
- I have three wells proven.

769
01:32:04,695 --> 01:32:08,756
You haven't been paying attention.
That's three proven wells.

770
01:32:13,037 --> 01:32:14,937
We'll make you a millionaire
while you're sitting here

771
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:17,371
from one minute to the next.

772
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:21,974
And what else would I do with myself?

773
01:32:23,714 --> 01:32:28,083
- Are you asking me?
- What else would I do with myself?

774
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,812
Take care of your son.

775
01:32:32,490 --> 01:32:34,958
I don't know what you would do.

776
01:32:37,562 --> 01:32:40,030
If you were me and Standard
offered to buy what you had

777
01:32:40,164 --> 01:32:42,826
for a million dollars, why? So, why?

778
01:32:44,068 --> 01:32:45,160
You know why.

779
01:32:45,303 --> 01:32:47,134
Yeah, you fellas
should just scratch around in the dirt

780
01:32:47,238 --> 01:32:50,674
and find it like the rest of us, instead of
buying up someone else's hard work.

781
01:32:50,808 --> 01:32:52,742
I've scratched around the dirt, son.

782
01:32:52,843 --> 01:32:54,834
You going to change
your shipping costs?

783
01:32:54,979 --> 01:32:57,948
We don't dictate shipping costs.
That's railroad business.

784
01:32:58,983 --> 01:33:01,611
You don't own the railroads?

785
01:33:05,623 --> 01:33:08,183
'Course you do. Of course you do.

786
01:33:09,894 --> 01:33:12,328
Where you going to put it all?

787
01:33:13,364 --> 01:33:14,797
Where?

788
01:33:16,634 --> 01:33:20,627
Build a pipeline? Make a deal
with Union Oil? Be my guest.

789
01:33:20,771 --> 01:33:22,432
But if you can't pull it off,

790
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:26,636
you've got an ocean of oil
under your feet with nowhere to go.

791
01:33:27,645 --> 01:33:32,275
Why not turn it over to us?
We'll make you rich.

792
01:33:32,416 --> 01:33:34,714
You spend time with your boy.

793
01:33:35,786 --> 01:33:37,913
It's a great discovery.

794
01:33:38,856 --> 01:33:40,949
Now, let us help you.

795
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:53,261
Did you just tell me
how to run my family?

796
01:33:53,404 --> 01:33:55,599
It might be more important now
that you've proven the field

797
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:57,605
and we're offering to buy you out.

798
01:33:57,742 --> 01:33:59,937
One night I'm going to come to you,
inside of your house,

799
01:34:00,077 --> 01:34:03,046
or wherever you're sleeping,
and I'm going to cut your throat.

800
01:34:03,147 --> 01:34:04,307
What?

801
01:34:05,082 --> 01:34:06,344
What are you talking about?
Have you gone crazy?

802
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:07,747
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard what you said,

803
01:34:07,885 --> 01:34:10,353
- why did you say it?
- You don't tell me about my son.

804
01:34:10,454 --> 01:34:12,649
Why are you acting insane
and threatening to cut my throat?

805
01:34:12,757 --> 01:34:15,817
- You don't tell me about my son.
- I'm not telling you anything!

806
01:34:15,926 --> 01:34:19,726
I'm asking you to be reasonable.
If I've offended you, I apologize.

807
01:34:19,864 --> 01:34:22,025
You'll see what I can do.

808
01:34:29,807 --> 01:34:34,005
This parcel here is the 3,000-acre
ranch owned by B.L. Harper.

809
01:34:34,145 --> 01:34:36,636
This is San Luis Obispo County land.

810
01:34:36,781 --> 01:34:38,612
And from here to the coast,
it's all Union Oil.

811
01:34:38,716 --> 01:34:41,844
What's this? Why don't I own this?

812
01:34:44,822 --> 01:34:49,350
- Why don't I own this?
- That's the Bandy tract.

813
01:34:50,161 --> 01:34:53,324
He was the holdout,
when we were doing the buying.

814
01:34:53,431 --> 01:34:55,865
He had hoped to speak with you.

815
01:35:00,071 --> 01:35:03,563
Can't you just build the pipeline
around this tract?

816
01:35:06,544 --> 01:35:10,605
Can I build around 50 miles
of Tehachapi mountains?

817
01:35:10,748 --> 01:35:13,273
Don't be thick in front of me, Al.

818
01:35:13,918 --> 01:35:17,615
- I can go to him again.
- No, I'll go and talk to the man.

819
01:35:17,755 --> 01:35:20,656
I'll talk to him. Show you how it's done.

820
01:35:24,495 --> 01:35:26,929
All right. Pack it up, Henry.

821
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:41,176
- How big is his room?
- He's sharing with another boy.

822
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:44,145
- Who?
- An older boy. About 12.

823
01:35:44,248 --> 01:35:47,274
He's been there for a year.
Named Ballard.

824
01:35:52,490 --> 01:35:56,893
- How big is the room?
- It's a fair size. Got enough space.

825
01:35:59,196 --> 01:36:02,427
Are you taking Henry with you
to meet Union Oil?

826
01:36:15,713 --> 01:36:19,274
- Are you the son of William Bandy?
- Grandson.

827
01:36:19,383 --> 01:36:21,146
- Is he here?
- No, he's out.

828
01:36:21,285 --> 01:36:22,343
Where is he?

829
01:36:22,486 --> 01:36:25,353
Told you, he's out.
Now, what do you want?

830
01:36:28,859 --> 01:36:32,795
I'm Daniel Plainview. I want to talk
with him about his property.

831
01:36:32,897 --> 01:36:37,766
- About what?
- I believe I'll talk with him about that.

832
01:36:38,235 --> 01:36:40,669
- You're that oilman, aren't you?
- That's right.

833
01:36:40,805 --> 01:36:42,773
We don't want you drilling out here.

834
01:36:42,873 --> 01:36:46,274
I don't want it either.
Now, when will he be back?

835
01:36:46,377 --> 01:36:47,435
Few days.

836
01:36:47,545 --> 01:36:50,139
Tell him I'd like to speak with him.
Not about drilling.

837
01:36:50,247 --> 01:36:52,477
And I'll be back in a week.

838
01:39:11,588 --> 01:39:13,715
Put that in a glass case.

839
01:39:14,625 --> 01:39:16,490
Here's to Union Oil.

840
01:39:17,194 --> 01:39:18,252
Hundred miles of pipeline,

841
01:39:18,395 --> 01:39:20,829
and all the independent producers
of this great state.

842
01:39:20,931 --> 01:39:21,898
Cheers.

843
01:39:47,057 --> 01:39:49,753
<i>There's that house in Fond du Lac</i>

844
01:39:51,662 --> 01:39:54,927
<i>that John Hollister built.
Do you remember it?</i>

845
01:39:57,801 --> 01:40:01,237
I thought as a boy that was
the most beautiful house I'd ever seen,

846
01:40:01,338 --> 01:40:02,965
and I wanted it.

847
01:40:03,707 --> 01:40:06,175
I wanted to live in it.

848
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:07,834
And eat in it.

849
01:40:08,712 --> 01:40:10,304
And clean it.

850
01:40:13,317 --> 01:40:17,617
And even as a boy, I wanted
to have children to run around in it.

851
01:40:19,323 --> 01:40:22,053
You can have
anything you'd like now, Daniel.

852
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,387
And you should.

853
01:40:25,162 --> 01:40:29,826
- Where are you going to build it?
- Here, maybe. Near the ocean.

854
01:40:32,736 --> 01:40:35,500
Would you make it look like that house?

855
01:40:40,244 --> 01:40:43,702
I think if I saw that house now,
it'd make me sick.

856
01:40:50,154 --> 01:40:52,622
We can eat and get some women.

857
01:40:55,592 --> 01:40:57,719
Take them to the Peachtree dance.

858
01:41:01,465 --> 01:41:05,401
I say get liquored up and take them
to the Peachtree dance.

859
01:41:08,305 --> 01:41:09,533
Yeah.

860
01:42:28,485 --> 01:42:30,885
Can I have some money, please?

861
01:42:38,295 --> 01:42:40,695
Can I have some money, please?

862
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:32,271
I want you to tell me something.

863
01:43:35,953 --> 01:43:37,113
What?

864
01:43:38,155 --> 01:43:41,613
What's the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

865
01:43:52,669 --> 01:43:57,333
What was the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

866
01:44:00,877 --> 01:44:03,869
- I can't remember...
- Who are you?

867
01:44:06,817 --> 01:44:08,717
I'll leave, Daniel.

868
01:44:10,487 --> 01:44:12,045
Who are you?

869
01:44:15,392 --> 01:44:16,916
I'm no one.

870
01:44:17,995 --> 01:44:20,259
Just let me get up and go.

871
01:44:22,766 --> 01:44:24,631
Do I have a brother?

872
01:44:28,605 --> 01:44:33,804
I met a man in King City
who said he was your brother.

873
01:44:36,346 --> 01:44:39,440
We were friends for months.

874
01:44:40,917 --> 01:44:42,851
Working in King City.

875
01:44:45,088 --> 01:44:47,955
And he wanted
to make his way to you, Daniel.

876
01:44:49,226 --> 01:44:51,353
We didn't have any money.

877
01:44:56,233 --> 01:44:58,497
He died of tuberculosis.

878
01:44:59,936 --> 01:45:01,767
He wasn't harmed.

879
01:45:02,806 --> 01:45:05,036
Wasn't killed, nothing bad.

880
01:45:06,877 --> 01:45:09,141
But he told me about you,

881
01:45:12,182 --> 01:45:14,480
and I just took his story,

882
01:45:18,188 --> 01:45:19,985
used his diary.

883
01:45:23,627 --> 01:45:24,594
Daniel.

884
01:45:26,229 --> 01:45:29,562
Daniel, I'm your friend.

885
01:45:31,768 --> 01:45:34,202
I'm not trying to hurt you.

886
01:45:34,338 --> 01:45:35,566
Never.

887
01:45:36,707 --> 01:45:38,231
Just survive.

888
01:45:38,775 --> 01:45:40,003
No!

889
01:48:49,633 --> 01:48:51,100
Who is it?

890
01:48:52,402 --> 01:48:53,869
I'm Bandy.

891
01:49:06,650 --> 01:49:08,515
Yes. Yes.

892
01:49:11,021 --> 01:49:12,750
William Bandy.

893
01:49:15,959 --> 01:49:18,587
Yeah, I'd like to lease your land.

894
01:49:21,031 --> 01:49:24,592
I had asked for you
to come and talk to me before.

895
01:49:24,701 --> 01:49:26,965
When you were leasing land.

896
01:49:28,204 --> 01:49:30,001
That's right, yes.

897
01:49:31,708 --> 01:49:34,233
My boy's been very sick, you know.

898
01:49:35,378 --> 01:49:37,903
This was before your boy got sick.

899
01:49:41,017 --> 01:49:45,545
Now, I know
that you would like to build a pipeline

900
01:49:45,689 --> 01:49:48,351
through my property.

901
01:49:48,458 --> 01:49:52,588
- Is that right, what I've heard?
- It's absolutely right. And,

902
01:49:53,296 --> 01:49:54,263
well...

903
01:49:55,565 --> 01:49:58,796
Eight inch pipe.
It could be buried with your consent.

904
01:49:58,935 --> 01:50:01,460
I guarantee you
absolutely no disruption...

905
01:50:01,605 --> 01:50:02,765
God.

906
01:50:04,641 --> 01:50:07,269
God has told me what you must do.

907
01:50:11,648 --> 01:50:13,377
And what is that?

908
01:50:14,351 --> 01:50:18,253
You should be washed
in the blood of Jesus Christ.

909
01:50:20,056 --> 01:50:21,990
But I am.

910
01:50:23,526 --> 01:50:26,222
I have been washed, Mr. Bandy.
I have been.

911
01:50:26,363 --> 01:50:32,063
It's your only way to salvation.
And your only way for what you want.

912
01:50:33,903 --> 01:50:37,464
You can take it at
the Church of the Third Revelation.

913
01:50:39,909 --> 01:50:41,877
I'll pay you $3,000.

914
01:50:44,514 --> 01:50:47,278
I'd like you to be part of our church.

915
01:50:49,185 --> 01:50:51,085
I'll pay you $5,000.

916
01:50:52,188 --> 01:50:53,655
Be baptized.

917
01:50:55,025 --> 01:50:58,859
Be forgiven for the sin that you've done.

918
01:51:03,133 --> 01:51:08,002
What sin are you referring to,
Mr. Bandy?

919
01:51:09,172 --> 01:51:11,074
My sin of drilling?

920
01:52:01,758 --> 01:52:05,751
<i>I truly wish everyone could be saved,
don't you?</i>

921
01:52:05,895 --> 01:52:07,795
<i>Yes.</i>

922
01:52:07,931 --> 01:52:10,627
<i>I am afraid that's just not the case.</i>

923
01:52:11,501 --> 01:52:15,995
The doctrine of universal salvation
is a lie, is it not?

924
01:52:16,139 --> 01:52:18,767
- It's a lie.
- It's a lie.

925
01:52:18,875 --> 01:52:23,642
I wish everyone could be saved,
but they won't. No, they won't.

926
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:27,238
You will never be saved if you...

927
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:29,318
Reject the blood.

928
01:52:30,153 --> 01:52:31,313
Good.

929
01:52:32,388 --> 01:52:36,848
Now, is there a sinner here
looking for salvation?

930
01:52:39,529 --> 01:52:41,121
A new member?

931
01:52:45,602 --> 01:52:47,365
I'll ask it again.

932
01:52:49,372 --> 01:52:52,068
Is there a sinner here looking for God?

933
01:52:52,208 --> 01:52:53,368
Yes.

934
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:58,913
Allow me.

935
01:53:01,151 --> 01:53:03,915
Thank you for coming, brother Daniel.

936
01:53:06,022 --> 01:53:07,683
Thank you, Eli.

937
01:53:08,825 --> 01:53:13,922
We have a sinner with us here
who wishes for salvation!

938
01:53:14,030 --> 01:53:17,625
- Daniel, are you a sinner?
- Yes.

939
01:53:17,734 --> 01:53:20,430
The Lord can't hear you, Daniel.

940
01:53:20,537 --> 01:53:24,371
Say it to him. Go ahead
and speak to him. It's all right.

941
01:53:25,175 --> 01:53:27,473
- Yes.
- Down on your knees.

942
01:53:27,577 --> 01:53:29,135
Pray to him.

943
01:53:30,547 --> 01:53:34,916
Look up to the sky and say it.

944
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:39,681
What do you want me to say?

945
01:53:40,723 --> 01:53:45,217
Daniel, you've come here and
you've brought good and wealth,

946
01:53:45,328 --> 01:53:49,526
but you have also brought
your bad habits as a backslider.

947
01:53:49,632 --> 01:53:53,898
You've lusted after women,
and you have abandoned your child.

948
01:53:54,003 --> 01:53:57,063
Your child, that you raised,
you have abandoned

949
01:53:57,173 --> 01:53:59,607
all because he was sick
and you have sinned.

950
01:53:59,742 --> 01:54:01,903
So say it now. I am a sinner.

951
01:54:02,011 --> 01:54:03,911
- I am a sinner.
- Say it louder.

952
01:54:04,013 --> 01:54:06,743
- I am a sinner.
- I am a sinner.

953
01:54:06,883 --> 01:54:08,783
Louder, Daniel! I am a sinner!

954
01:54:08,918 --> 01:54:11,853
- I am a sinner.
- I am sorry, Lord.

955
01:54:11,955 --> 01:54:14,116
- I am sorry, Lord.
- I want the blood.

956
01:54:14,257 --> 01:54:17,624
- I want the blood.
- You have abandoned your child.

957
01:54:18,394 --> 01:54:19,691
I have abandoned my child.

958
01:54:19,796 --> 01:54:22,128
- I will never backslide.
- I will never backslide.

959
01:54:22,265 --> 01:54:25,257
I was lost, but now I am found.

960
01:54:25,401 --> 01:54:29,303
- I was lost, but now I'm found.
- I have abandoned my child.

961
01:54:31,074 --> 01:54:34,237
Say it. Say it.

962
01:54:34,344 --> 01:54:37,370
- I abandoned my child.
- Say it louder. Say it louder!

963
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:39,573
I've abandoned my child!

964
01:54:40,483 --> 01:54:43,008
I've abandoned my child!

965
01:54:43,152 --> 01:54:45,143
I've abandoned my boy!

966
01:54:45,288 --> 01:54:47,688
Now beg for the blood!

967
01:54:48,892 --> 01:54:50,757
Just give me the blood, Eli.
Let me get out of here.

968
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:53,624
Give me the blood, Lord,
and let me get away!

969
01:54:53,730 --> 01:54:57,496
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior?

970
01:54:57,634 --> 01:55:00,364
- Yes, I do.
- Get out of here, devil!

971
01:55:00,503 --> 01:55:03,301
Out, devil! Out, sin!

972
01:55:03,473 --> 01:55:05,998
- Let me feel the power of the Lord, Eli.
- Do you accept

973
01:55:06,142 --> 01:55:10,010
the Church of the Third Revelation
as your spiritual guide?

974
01:55:11,547 --> 01:55:15,745
- Get out of here, ghost!
- Where is your Lord, Eli?

975
01:55:15,885 --> 01:55:19,946
- Get out! Go back where you belong!
- Where is he? There he is!

976
01:55:20,089 --> 01:55:23,684
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Savior?

977
01:55:23,793 --> 01:55:25,226
Yes, I do.

978
01:55:27,997 --> 01:55:32,297
<i>Would you be free
from the burden of sin?</i>

979
01:55:32,435 --> 01:55:34,767
<i>There's power in the blood</i>

980
01:55:34,904 --> 01:55:36,929
<i>Power in the blood</i>

981
01:55:37,206 --> 01:55:39,003
<i>Would you o'er evil a victory win?</i>

982
01:55:39,108 --> 01:55:41,303
There's a pipeline.

983
01:55:41,444 --> 01:55:45,608
<i>There's wonderful power in the blood</i>

984
01:55:45,748 --> 01:55:50,117
<i>There is power, power
wonder-working power</i>

985
01:55:50,219 --> 01:55:53,916
<i>In the blood of the Lamb</i>

986
01:55:54,023 --> 01:55:55,786
Praise the Lord!

987
01:56:00,396 --> 01:56:03,263
Welcome to the fold, brother Plainview.

988
01:56:14,610 --> 01:56:16,874
Welcome, brother Daniel.
God bless you.

989
01:56:18,147 --> 01:56:19,580
God bless you.

990
01:56:22,752 --> 01:56:24,413
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

991
01:56:24,854 --> 01:56:26,788
Welcome home, brother.

992
01:56:27,423 --> 01:56:30,881
That's enough. That's enough, now.

993
01:56:33,129 --> 01:56:37,293
He must take the spirit in on his own.

994
01:56:40,069 --> 01:56:41,934
We have a new member.

995
01:56:42,071 --> 01:56:44,198
- Yes, brother.
- Hallelujah.

996
01:56:44,307 --> 01:56:46,275
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

997
01:56:48,444 --> 01:56:50,537
- My sweet Mary.
- Mr. Plainview has been generous

998
01:56:50,646 --> 01:56:53,376
enough to make a $5,000 donation

999
01:56:53,516 --> 01:56:56,542
to the church
which we are still waiting for.

1000
01:58:08,691 --> 01:58:11,990
That does me good.
That does me good.

1001
01:58:14,097 --> 01:58:15,928
Welcome home, son.

1002
01:58:18,534 --> 01:58:20,502
Welcome home, son.

1003
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:26,499
This here's George Reynolds.
Teacher from the deaf school.

1004
01:58:26,609 --> 01:58:29,601
- Mr. Plainview.
- Fletcher.

1005
01:58:32,415 --> 01:58:34,508
You're too heavy for me.

1006
01:58:37,587 --> 01:58:40,283
Do you want to get something to eat?

1007
01:58:41,491 --> 01:58:45,791
That's the pipeline, see?
All the way to the sea.

1008
01:59:06,916 --> 01:59:08,474
Come here.

1009
01:59:15,358 --> 01:59:17,121
I love you, son.

1010
01:59:19,028 --> 01:59:21,155
Let's take a look at you.

1011
01:59:23,432 --> 01:59:26,299
All right. That's it, that's it. That's it.

1012
01:59:50,359 --> 01:59:53,658
Let's get some decent food
inside of you.

1013
01:59:53,763 --> 01:59:57,563
That's all we need here
is a good, strong, expensive meal.

1014
01:59:58,201 --> 01:59:59,691
You hungry?

1015
02:00:00,770 --> 02:00:01,862
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir.

1016
02:00:02,004 --> 02:00:04,996
Two steaks, a whiskey,
and water for him.

1017
02:00:06,642 --> 02:00:09,167
- And goat's milk.
- Very good, sir.

1018
02:00:15,985 --> 02:00:18,920
We're going to have
this teacher help you.

1019
02:00:19,488 --> 02:00:23,948
He's going to help take care
of all of this. Understand?

1020
02:00:24,093 --> 02:00:26,789
'Cause I need you. Need your help.

1021
02:00:26,929 --> 02:00:30,888
Got everything we need now
to build this company. Come here.

1022
02:00:38,708 --> 02:00:40,403
Good afternoon.

1023
02:00:56,559 --> 02:00:58,618
- How are you doing?
- It's nice to see you again.

1024
02:00:58,728 --> 02:01:01,526
- We need four.
- I'll have them right up.

1025
02:01:05,701 --> 02:01:07,692
- Good afternoon, Daniel.
- Tilford.

1026
02:01:07,803 --> 02:01:09,168
Good afternoon.

1027
02:01:10,740 --> 02:01:16,007
- Hello! H.M. Tilford!
- You don't have to shout.

1028
02:01:18,047 --> 02:01:19,446
Pleasure.

1029
02:01:24,153 --> 02:01:26,417
It's good to be in Little B.

1030
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:30,989
- Could use some rain out here.
- Yeah, we could.

1031
02:01:31,861 --> 02:01:34,955
- There we go.
- R.J., how's the London broil?

1032
02:01:35,097 --> 02:01:37,759
Believe we ordered these drinks
before those people.

1033
02:01:37,867 --> 02:01:42,133
- R.J., tell us. How's the London broil?
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Sorry.

1034
02:01:44,206 --> 02:01:48,142
I am sorry about that, sir.
I'll have your steaks right out.

1035
02:01:57,987 --> 02:02:00,547
- So that green turtle soup is fantastic.
- Is it?

1036
02:02:00,690 --> 02:02:02,317
It's delicious.

1037
02:02:07,363 --> 02:02:08,330
Sounds good to me.

1038
02:02:08,464 --> 02:02:14,198
So Standard offered us a million
dollars for the Little Boston leases.

1039
02:02:14,303 --> 02:02:17,204
I told H.M. Tilford
where he could shove that.

1040
02:02:17,306 --> 02:02:21,902
And we made a deal with Union!
On the pipeline!

1041
02:02:22,044 --> 02:02:25,502
And that whole ocean of oil
underneath our fields.

1042
02:02:25,614 --> 02:02:27,275
...$150,000.
- Yes.

1043
02:02:27,383 --> 02:02:29,681
We needed the money to drill.

1044
02:02:29,819 --> 02:02:32,049
- Who is this guy?
- I go out to meet him.

1045
02:02:32,154 --> 02:02:34,918
He's getting oil on the property.
We're trying to make a claim on it.

1046
02:02:35,057 --> 02:02:36,957
Offered him a million dollars.

1047
02:02:37,093 --> 02:02:40,290
- Turned us down flat.
- Well, I'm hungry.

1048
02:02:40,429 --> 02:02:45,059
Orange fritters,
mashed potatoes, green peas.

1049
02:02:45,167 --> 02:02:47,635
- All the way around?
- All right.

1050
02:02:50,539 --> 02:02:51,904
Hold on.

1051
02:02:55,678 --> 02:02:57,942
I want you to look over there.

1052
02:02:58,047 --> 02:03:00,845
- Daniel, let me introduce...
- Look over there. You see?

1053
02:03:00,983 --> 02:03:03,076
That's my son. See him?

1054
02:03:03,185 --> 02:03:05,517
- Yes.
- Do you see?

1055
02:03:07,857 --> 02:03:09,290
I see him.

1056
02:03:10,159 --> 02:03:13,026
You don't tell me
how to raise my family.

1057
02:03:15,164 --> 02:03:18,691
I told you not to tell me
how to raise my family.

1058
02:03:20,169 --> 02:03:22,034
Daniel...

1059
02:03:22,872 --> 02:03:24,703
So what do you see?

1060
02:03:26,709 --> 02:03:29,872
- I'm very happy for you that the deal...
- Yes, I made a deal with Union.

1061
02:03:29,979 --> 02:03:32,345
- My son is happy. He's safe.
- Congratulations.

1062
02:03:32,448 --> 02:03:35,611
- I'm taking care of him now, so...
- Excellent.

1063
02:03:36,919 --> 02:03:39,911
You look like a fool, don't you, Tilford?

1064
02:03:44,593 --> 02:03:47,426
- Yes.
- Yes.

1065
02:03:49,265 --> 02:03:50,926
Yes, you do.

1066
02:03:51,834 --> 02:03:53,301
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1067
02:03:53,636 --> 02:03:56,867
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse him, gentlemen.

1068
02:04:00,409 --> 02:04:03,037
I told you what I was going to do.

1069
02:04:13,355 --> 02:04:14,583
My son.

1070
02:04:32,641 --> 02:04:35,940
Mr. Sunday, I understand
that you're leaving our fair community.

1071
02:04:36,078 --> 02:04:39,206
- Yes, I'm going on a mission.
- Where you going?

1072
02:04:39,315 --> 02:04:41,476
Oildale, Taft,
and then on to Bakersfield.

1073
02:04:41,617 --> 02:04:43,949
Well, I want you to know...

1074
02:04:44,086 --> 02:04:45,951
Three quarters of an hour.

1075
02:04:46,088 --> 02:04:47,612
...you done a great job for us.

1076
02:04:47,756 --> 02:04:50,623
- Thank you. You will be in my prayers.
- I thank you very much.

1077
02:04:50,726 --> 02:04:53,991
Union Oil Company,
Santa Paula, California.

1078
02:07:02,992 --> 02:07:06,792
"The woman saith unto him,
'Sir, give me this water

1079
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:12,790
"'and I shall thirst not,
neither come hither to draw."'

1080
02:08:54,303 --> 02:08:55,964
Come in, come in.

1081
02:09:22,731 --> 02:09:24,961
Can we be alone?

1082
02:09:25,067 --> 02:09:28,764
This is my closest associate.
He hears everything.

1083
02:09:35,844 --> 02:09:40,907
- I'd prefer to speak to you in private.
- You can't speak.

1084
02:09:41,016 --> 02:09:43,246
So why don't you flap your hands about

1085
02:09:43,352 --> 02:09:46,913
and have what's-his-name tell me
where you've been.

1086
02:09:54,897 --> 02:09:57,627
Or do you think I don't know?

1087
02:10:12,114 --> 02:10:14,344
This is hard for me to say.

1088
02:10:15,450 --> 02:10:19,580
I'll tell you first, I love you very much.

1089
02:10:22,858 --> 02:10:26,851
I've learned to love what I do
because of you.

1090
02:10:30,299 --> 02:10:32,164
I'm leaving here.

1091
02:10:33,602 --> 02:10:35,934
I'm going to Mexico.

1092
02:10:36,071 --> 02:10:39,040
I'm taking Mary,
and I'm going to Mexico.

1093
02:10:40,709 --> 02:10:42,802
I miss working outside.

1094
02:10:43,846 --> 02:10:45,711
I miss the fields.

1095
02:10:48,684 --> 02:10:50,811
It'll only be for a time,

1096
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:54,352
for me to do my own drilling

1097
02:10:56,058 --> 02:10:58,185
and start my own company.

1098
02:11:01,196 --> 02:11:05,656
It's time to make a change.

1099
02:11:18,714 --> 02:11:21,205
This makes you my competitor.

1100
02:11:25,187 --> 02:11:30,284
- No. No, it's not like that.
- It is like that, boy.

1101
02:11:31,526 --> 02:11:33,494
Your own company, huh?

1102
02:11:33,929 --> 02:11:35,419
That's right.

1103
02:11:37,766 --> 02:11:39,529
In Mexico?

1104
02:11:41,003 --> 02:11:42,061
Yes.

1105
02:11:42,170 --> 02:11:47,233
You are making such a misstep.
So, what are you doing?

1106
02:11:49,278 --> 02:11:52,611
I know you and I
have disagreed over many things.

1107
02:11:53,548 --> 02:11:57,882
I'd rather keep you as my father
than my partner.

1108
02:11:57,986 --> 02:11:59,453
Then say it.

1109
02:11:59,588 --> 02:12:01,283
If you've got something to say to me,
then say it.

1110
02:12:01,390 --> 02:12:05,053
I'd like to hear you speak
instead of your little dog.

1111
02:12:23,178 --> 02:12:25,840
I'm going to Mexico with my wife.

1112
02:12:26,848 --> 02:12:28,975
I'm going away from you.

1113
02:12:35,023 --> 02:12:37,685
That wasn't so hard, was it?

1114
02:12:39,628 --> 02:12:42,256
Killing us with what you're doing.

1115
02:12:45,167 --> 02:12:48,625
You're killing my image of you
as my son.

1116
02:12:48,770 --> 02:12:52,137
You are stubborn. You won't listen.

1117
02:12:52,274 --> 02:12:54,572
You're not my son.

1118
02:12:54,676 --> 02:12:57,873
Please don't say that.
I know you don't mean it.

1119
02:12:57,980 --> 02:13:01,939
It's the truth. You're not my son.
You never have been.

1120
02:13:03,318 --> 02:13:05,115
You're an orphan!

1121
02:13:07,823 --> 02:13:10,053
Did you ever hear that word?

1122
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:13,460
Tell him what I said.

1123
02:13:14,229 --> 02:13:17,198
You operated here today like one.

1124
02:13:18,834 --> 02:13:21,302
I should have seen this coming.

1125
02:13:22,804 --> 02:13:27,639
I should have known that,
under this all, these past years

1126
02:13:27,776 --> 02:13:31,143
you've been building new hate for me,
piece by piece.

1127
02:13:31,279 --> 02:13:34,908
I don't even know who you are
because you have none of me in you.

1128
02:13:35,017 --> 02:13:37,884
You're someone else's.

1129
02:13:39,321 --> 02:13:42,779
This anger. Your maliciousness.

1130
02:13:43,892 --> 02:13:46,793
Backwards dealings with me.

1131
02:13:48,463 --> 02:13:52,422
You're an orphan from a basket
in the middle of the desert.

1132
02:13:55,237 --> 02:14:00,197
And I took you for no other reason
than I needed a sweet face to buy land.

1133
02:14:01,710 --> 02:14:03,473
Did you get that?

1134
02:14:04,713 --> 02:14:06,476
So now you know.

1135
02:14:09,785 --> 02:14:14,085
Look at me!
You're lower than a bastard.

1136
02:14:39,047 --> 02:14:43,507
You have none of me in you.
You're just a bastard from a basket.

1137
02:14:53,195 --> 02:14:57,461
I thank God I have none of you in me.

1138
02:15:02,370 --> 02:15:06,830
Not my son.
Just a little piece of competition.

1139
02:15:08,743 --> 02:15:10,836
Bastard from a basket.

1140
02:15:13,248 --> 02:15:15,443
Bastard from a basket!

1141
02:15:23,825 --> 02:15:26,350
You're a bastard from a basket!

1142
02:16:28,890 --> 02:16:30,687
<i>Get up, Mr. Daniel.</i>

1143
02:16:35,063 --> 02:16:36,621
<i>Mr. Daniel.</i>

1144
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:41,160
Mr. Daniel, you've got a visitor.

1145
02:16:44,839 --> 02:16:46,670
Wake up, Mr. Daniel.

1146
02:16:49,411 --> 02:16:51,003
Sir?

1147
02:17:04,526 --> 02:17:06,460
You can leave us now.

1148
02:17:14,769 --> 02:17:15,736
Daniel.

1149
02:17:19,107 --> 02:17:20,267
Daniel.

1150
02:17:22,877 --> 02:17:26,074
Daniel Plainview, the house is on fire!

1151
02:17:30,752 --> 02:17:33,721
Brother Daniel, it's Eli.

1152
02:17:43,965 --> 02:17:47,696
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

1153
02:17:49,804 --> 02:17:51,738
I'll make us a drink.

1154
02:17:58,313 --> 02:18:01,476
Your home is a miracle.

1155
02:18:02,751 --> 02:18:04,383
It's beautiful.

1156
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:07,079
God bless it.

1157
02:18:07,222 --> 02:18:11,215
I've been spreading His word
far and wide.

1158
02:18:12,494 --> 02:18:14,291
Far and wide.

1159
02:18:16,097 --> 02:18:18,861
So much travel for Him.

1160
02:18:23,571 --> 02:18:25,971
I've been working in radio.

1161
02:18:28,677 --> 02:18:32,636
Yes, so much...
So much has been happening.

1162
02:18:33,682 --> 02:18:39,143
To be here and find you
and see you well is wonderful.

1163
02:18:39,287 --> 02:18:41,847
And we have a chance to catch up.

1164
02:18:55,003 --> 02:18:57,062
No. Thank you so much.

1165
02:19:15,190 --> 02:19:16,714
My brother.

1166
02:19:18,126 --> 02:19:21,391
Daniel, my brother by marriage.

1167
02:19:23,398 --> 02:19:27,494
We're such old friends. So much time.

1168
02:19:34,008 --> 02:19:37,102
Things go up, things go down,

1169
02:19:37,212 --> 02:19:41,512
but at least the Lord is always around.

1170
02:19:43,118 --> 02:19:45,780
We've seen ups and downs,
haven't we?

1171
02:19:49,591 --> 02:19:52,560
Are things down for you right now, Eli?

1172
02:19:53,928 --> 02:19:55,327
No. No.

1173
02:19:57,766 --> 02:20:00,394
But I do come with some sad news.

1174
02:20:02,137 --> 02:20:04,867
Perhaps you remember Mr. Bandy?

1175
02:20:07,509 --> 02:20:10,842
Mr. Bandy has passed on to the Lord.

1176
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:14,943
He lived to be 99 years old,
God bless him.

1177
02:20:15,650 --> 02:20:19,518
Mr. Bandy has a grandson.
Have you met his grandson, William?

1178
02:20:20,522 --> 02:20:25,118
William Bandy is one of
the finest members we have

1179
02:20:25,226 --> 02:20:27,786
at the Church of the Third Revelation.

1180
02:20:27,896 --> 02:20:31,195
He's eager to come to Hollywood
to be in movies.

1181
02:20:32,667 --> 02:20:34,828
He is very good-looking.

1182
02:20:37,038 --> 02:20:42,032
- And I do think he will have success.
- That's wonderful.

1183
02:20:44,179 --> 02:20:46,943
Would you like me to speak with him?

1184
02:20:54,355 --> 02:20:59,088
Daniel, I'm asking
if you'd like to have business

1185
02:20:59,227 --> 02:21:01,457
with the Church of the Third Revelation

1186
02:21:01,563 --> 02:21:05,795
in developing this lease
on young Bandy's 1,000-acre tract.

1187
02:21:08,269 --> 02:21:09,861
I'm offering you to drill

1188
02:21:10,004 --> 02:21:13,462
on one of the great undeveloped fields
of Little Boston.

1189
02:21:13,575 --> 02:21:17,705
- I'd be happy to work with you.
- You would?

1190
02:21:19,314 --> 02:21:22,147
Yes, yes, of course. That's wonderful.

1191
02:21:22,283 --> 02:21:25,252
But there is one condition for this work.

1192
02:21:25,353 --> 02:21:26,843
All right.

1193
02:21:28,923 --> 02:21:32,450
I'd like you to tell me
that you are a false prophet.

1194
02:21:37,832 --> 02:21:43,236
I'd like you to tell me that you are,
and have been a false prophet.

1195
02:21:44,439 --> 02:21:46,805
And that God is a superstition.

1196
02:21:52,914 --> 02:21:54,711
But that's a lie.

1197
02:21:57,519 --> 02:22:00,044
It's a lie. I cannot say it.

1198
02:22:14,335 --> 02:22:16,769
- When can we begin to drill?
- Very soon.

1199
02:22:16,871 --> 02:22:18,463
How long will it take
to bring in the well?

1200
02:22:18,606 --> 02:22:20,506
It shouldn't take long.

1201
02:22:20,642 --> 02:22:23,907
I would like a $100,000 signing bonus,

1202
02:22:24,012 --> 02:22:27,277
plus the five that is owed to me
with interest.

1203
02:22:27,982 --> 02:22:29,745
That's only fair.

1204
02:22:35,523 --> 02:22:40,290
I am a false prophet,
and God is a superstition.

1205
02:22:40,428 --> 02:22:43,397
If that's what you believe,
then I will say it.

1206
02:22:43,498 --> 02:22:46,990
- Say it like you mean it.
- Daniel.

1207
02:22:47,535 --> 02:22:49,867
Say it like it's your sermon.

1208
02:22:53,041 --> 02:22:54,668
Don't smile.

1209
02:23:00,448 --> 02:23:02,348
I am a false prophet.

1210
02:23:02,450 --> 02:23:05,783
- God is a superstition.
- Why don't you stand up?

1211
02:23:08,856 --> 02:23:10,847
Put your glass down.

1212
02:23:23,037 --> 02:23:26,598
I am a false prophet.

1213
02:23:26,741 --> 02:23:29,801
- God is a superstition.
- Eli, stop.

1214
02:23:29,911 --> 02:23:35,315
Just imagine this is your church here
and you have a full congregation, so...

1215
02:23:37,852 --> 02:23:41,618
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1216
02:23:41,723 --> 02:23:43,315
Say it again.

1217
02:23:44,392 --> 02:23:48,260
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1218
02:23:48,363 --> 02:23:49,489
They can't hear you at the back.

1219
02:23:49,631 --> 02:23:52,998
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1220
02:23:53,134 --> 02:23:54,158
Say it again.

1221
02:23:54,302 --> 02:23:58,932
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1222
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:00,735
Say it again.

1223
02:24:00,842 --> 02:24:04,573
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1224
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:08,112
Those areas have been drilled.

1225
02:24:11,219 --> 02:24:12,618
What?

1226
02:24:12,754 --> 02:24:15,348
Those areas, they've been drilled.

1227
02:24:16,958 --> 02:24:20,485
- No, they haven't.
- Yes, it's...

1228
02:24:20,595 --> 02:24:21,926
It's called drainage, Eli.

1229
02:24:22,063 --> 02:24:26,898
See, I own everything around it, so,
of course, I get what's underneath it.

1230
02:24:28,369 --> 02:24:31,532
But there are no derricks there.

1231
02:24:31,673 --> 02:24:34,039
This is the Bandy tract.
Do you understand?

1232
02:24:34,175 --> 02:24:36,143
Do you understand, Eli?

1233
02:24:36,878 --> 02:24:40,109
That's more to the point.
Do you understand?

1234
02:24:40,214 --> 02:24:45,618
I drink your water. I drink it up every day.

1235
02:24:46,621 --> 02:24:50,853
I drink the blood of Lamb
from Bandy's tract.

1236
02:24:56,130 --> 02:24:58,223
You can sit down again.

1237
02:25:16,384 --> 02:25:17,715
Daniel.

1238
02:25:20,988 --> 02:25:21,977
Daniel.

1239
02:25:25,860 --> 02:25:27,157
Please.

1240
02:25:29,797 --> 02:25:34,131
- I am in desperate times.
- I know.

1241
02:25:34,235 --> 02:25:37,102
- I need a friend.
- Yes. Of course, you do.

1242
02:25:37,505 --> 02:25:39,097
I've sinned.

1243
02:25:40,875 --> 02:25:43,969
I need help. I'm a sinner.

1244
02:25:44,112 --> 02:25:48,708
I've let the devil grab hold of me
in ways I never imagined.

1245
02:25:48,816 --> 02:25:50,249
I'm so full of sin.

1246
02:25:50,351 --> 02:25:53,616
The Lord sometimes challenges us,
doesn't He, Eli?

1247
02:25:53,755 --> 02:25:55,723
- Yes, He does, Daniel.
- Yes, He does.

1248
02:25:55,823 --> 02:25:58,417
Yes, He does!

1249
02:25:58,559 --> 02:26:00,459
Yes, He does!

1250
02:26:01,763 --> 02:26:07,326
He's completely failed to alert me
to the recent panic in our economy.

1251
02:26:07,435 --> 02:26:09,596
- And this...
- Oh, dear.

1252
02:26:09,737 --> 02:26:16,404
I must have this, Daniel.
I must, I must, I must have this.

1253
02:26:16,544 --> 02:26:18,808
My investments have...

1254
02:26:18,913 --> 02:26:23,941
Daniel, I won't bore you, but if I could
grab the Lord's hand for help I would,

1255
02:26:24,051 --> 02:26:26,952
but He does these things all the time.

1256
02:26:27,054 --> 02:26:31,013
These mysteries that He presents,
and while we wait...

1257
02:26:32,293 --> 02:26:34,454
While we wait for His word!

1258
02:26:34,595 --> 02:26:37,558
Because you're not
the chosen brother, Eli.

1259
02:26:39,967 --> 02:26:43,767
'Twas Paul who was chosen.

1260
02:26:44,672 --> 02:26:47,607
He found me and told me
about your land. You're just a fool.

1261
02:26:47,742 --> 02:26:50,575
- Why are you talking about Paul?
- I did what your brother couldn't.

1262
02:26:50,678 --> 02:26:53,203
- Don't say this to me.
- I broke you and I beat you.

1263
02:26:54,115 --> 02:26:56,913
It was Paul told me about you.

1264
02:26:57,051 --> 02:27:01,511
He's the prophet. He's the smart one.
He knew what was there

1265
02:27:01,622 --> 02:27:03,988
and he found me to take it
out of the ground.

1266
02:27:04,091 --> 02:27:07,185
Know what the funny thing is?
Listen, listen.

1267
02:27:08,062 --> 02:27:11,964
I paid him $10,000 cash in hand.
Just like that.

1268
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:16,333
He has his own company now.
Prosperous little business.

1269
02:27:16,437 --> 02:27:19,964
Three wells producing, $5,000 a week.

1270
02:27:22,043 --> 02:27:25,843
Stop crying, you sniveling ass.
Stop your nonsense.

1271
02:27:27,048 --> 02:27:30,882
- You're just the afterbirth, Eli.
- No.

1272
02:27:30,985 --> 02:27:33,613
That slithered out on your mother's filth.

1273
02:27:33,754 --> 02:27:35,085
No.

1274
02:27:35,189 --> 02:27:39,387
They should've put you in a glass jar
on the mantelpiece.

1275
02:27:41,095 --> 02:27:44,462
Where were you when Paul
was suckling at his mother's teat?

1276
02:27:44,599 --> 02:27:46,089
Where were you?

1277
02:27:46,234 --> 02:27:50,933
Who was nursing you, poor Eli?
One of Bandy's sows?

1278
02:27:51,072 --> 02:27:54,007
That land has been had.
Nothing you can do about it. It's gone.

1279
02:27:54,108 --> 02:27:56,269
- If you would just take this lease...
- You lose.

1280
02:27:56,410 --> 02:27:59,641
Drainage!

1281
02:28:00,681 --> 02:28:04,242
Drainage, Eli, you boy.

1282
02:28:05,386 --> 02:28:08,287
Drained dry. I'm so sorry.

1283
02:28:09,523 --> 02:28:11,616
If you have a milkshake

1284
02:28:12,727 --> 02:28:14,490
and I have a milkshake,

1285
02:28:14,595 --> 02:28:17,792
and I have a straw, there it is.
That's the straw, you see?

1286
02:28:17,899 --> 02:28:19,457
Watch it.

1287
02:28:20,902 --> 02:28:27,831
Now my straw reaches across the room

1288
02:28:29,110 --> 02:28:31,908
and starts to drink your milkshake.

1289
02:28:32,847 --> 02:28:36,613
I drink your milkshake!

1290
02:28:38,819 --> 02:28:42,277
- I drink it up!
- Don't bully me, Daniel.

1291
02:28:45,026 --> 02:28:50,225
Did you think your song and dance and
your superstition would help you, Eli?

1292
02:28:50,364 --> 02:28:54,994
I am the Third Revelation.
I am who the Lord has chosen.

1293
02:28:57,204 --> 02:28:59,502
- Daniel!
- Because I'm smarter than you!

1294
02:28:59,607 --> 02:29:01,074
I'm older!

1295
02:29:01,909 --> 02:29:03,740
I'm your old friend, Daniel!

1296
02:29:03,844 --> 02:29:06,278
- I'm not a false prophet...
- Help me! Help me!

1297
02:29:06,380 --> 02:29:08,644
...you sniveling boy!

1298
02:29:08,749 --> 02:29:15,416
I am the Third Revelation!
I am the Third Revelation!

1299
02:29:15,523 --> 02:29:18,492
- I told you I would eat you.
- We're family!

1300
02:29:18,626 --> 02:29:23,063
- I told you I would eat you up!
- We're brothers! We're brothers!

1301
02:29:30,171 --> 02:29:32,969
Daniel, please forgive me. I beg you.

1302
02:29:36,644 --> 02:29:38,703
That's it. That's it.

1303
02:30:41,108 --> 02:30:42,575
Mr. Daniel?

1304
02:30:50,484 --> 02:30:52,145
I'm finished.

1305
02:31:52,146 --> 02:31:53,148
