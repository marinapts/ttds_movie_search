1
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,401
<i> When I was lying there in the VA hospital ...</i>

2
00:00:37,072 --> 00:00:39,221
<i> ... with a big hole
blown through the middle of my life, ...</i>

3
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:42,647
<i> ... I started having these dreams of flying.</i>

4
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:46,042
<i> I was free.</i>

5
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:50,362
<i>Sooner or later though, ...</i>

6
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,454
<i> ... you always have to wake up.</i>

7
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:11,449
<i>In Cryo you don't dream at all.</i>

8
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,427
<i>It doesn't feel like 6 years.</i>

9
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:16,867
<i>More like a fifth of
tequila and ass-kicking.</i>

10
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:25,455
<i>Tommy was the scientist, not me.</i>

11
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:29,970
<i>He was the one who wanted to get shot
light-years out in space to find the answers.</i>

12
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,739
Are we there yet?

13
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:34,163
Yeah, we're there sunshine.

14
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:36,171
We're there.

15
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:38,296
<i>It's about your brother.</i>

16
00:01:41,176 --> 00:01:43,738
<i>So, a week before Tommy
was gonna ship out...</i>

17
00:01:43,774 --> 00:01:46,299
<i>A guy with a gun ends his journey ...</i>

18
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,746
<i>... for the paper in his wallet.</i>

19
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:52,862
Being in Cryo for 5 years,
9 months and 22 days.

20
00:01:52,902 --> 00:01:55,902
You will be hungry,
you will be weak.

21
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:58,549
If you feel nauseous please use the ...

22
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,749
<i>Yeah, Tommy was the scientist.</i>

23
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:05,465
<i>Me, I'm just another dumb grunt
going some place he's gonna regret.</i>

24
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:20,594
<i>Up ahead was Pandora.</i>

25
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:25,995
<i>You grew up hearing about it,
but I never figured I'd be going there.</i>

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,763
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

27
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,801
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

28
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:44,401
And since your genome is identical to his,

29
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:47,002
you could step into his shoes.

30
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:49,806
So to speak.

31
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:59,529
<i>It'd be a fresh start,
on a new world.</i>

32
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,492
And the pay is good.

33
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:11,213
Very good.

34
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:34,788
Exo-Packs on!
Let's go, Exo-Packs on!

35
00:03:34,823 --> 00:03:38,825
Remember people, you lose that mask
you're unconscious in 20 seconds.

36
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:42,027
You're dead in 4 minutes.
Let nobody be dead today.

37
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:45,428
It looks very bad on my report.

38
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:48,238
This is TAD-1-6 on approach.

39
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:50,447
Crossing outer marker.
Monument in sight

40
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:30,527
<i>One life ends...</i>

41
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:32,846
<i>Another begins.</i>

42
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,349
Harnesses off. Get your packs ...
-- Put it together. Let's go.

43
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:45,205
One minute, let's go.

44
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,574
When the ramp comes down, go
directly into the base. Do not stop.

45
00:04:49,609 --> 00:04:52,853
Go straight inside.
Wait for my mark!

46
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:00,777
Go! Go! Go! Go! ..

47
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:01,578
Get out of there!

48
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:03,064
Keep moving. Let's go!

49
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:10,227
<i>There's no such thing
as an ex-Marine.</i>

50
00:05:10,463 --> 00:05:11,423
<i>You may be out...</i>

51
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:13,461
<i> ... but you never lose the attitude.</i>

52
00:05:14,783 --> 00:05:18,943
<i>I told myself I could pass
any test a man can pass.</i>

53
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:25,434
<i>They can fix the spine,
if you got the money.</i>

54
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:29,270
<i>But not on Vet benefits,
not in this economy.</i>

55
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:33,352
Let's go Special K.
Do not make me wait for you!

56
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,872
Well, well, ladies.

57
00:05:36,392 --> 00:05:39,274
Look at all this fresh meat!

58
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:48,171
<i> Back on Earth, these guys
were Army dogs. Marines.</i>

59
00:05:48,212 --> 00:05:51,101
<i>Fighting for freedom.</i>

60
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:59,215
<i>Look out hot rod.</i>

61
00:05:59,254 --> 00:06:03,832
<i>But out here they're just hired guns,
taking the money, working for the company.</i>

62
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:08,488
Check this out man.
Meals on wheels.

63
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:12,987
Aww, man , that is just wrong.

64
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,040
You are not in Kansas any more.

65
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:33,025
You are on Pandora,
ladies and gentlemen.

66
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,560
Respect that fact,
every second of every day.

67
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,661
If there is a hell,

68
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:47,035
you might wanna go there for some
R and R after a tour on Pandora.

69
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:52,416
Out there beyond that fence,
every living thing that

70
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:57,876
crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to
kill you and eat your eyes for Ju-Ju Beads

71
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,658
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

72
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:06,287
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

73
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:08,877
that will stop your heart in one minute.

74
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:13,212
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occuring carbon fiber.

75
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:17,396
They are very hard to kill.

76
00:07:17,432 --> 00:07:21,727
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

77
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:26,545
I will not succeed.

78
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:29,642
Not with all of you.

79
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:35,298
If you wish to survive you need to
cultivate a strong mental attitude.

80
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:38,510
You've got to obey the rules.

81
00:07:38,544 --> 00:07:41,402
Pandora rules.

82
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:43,693
Rule number one...

83
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:48,066
It's nothing like an old school safety
brief to put your mind at ease.

84
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:53,771
Jake, you're Jake right?

85
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,196
Tom's brother.

86
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,553
You look just like him.

87
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:02,923
Sorry, I'm Norm Spellman.
I went through Avatar training with him.

88
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:06,417
The Bio-Lab. We're gonna
spend a lot of time here.

89
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:10,397
How you doing,
Norm, Avatar driver.

90
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:12,676
Here's the link room right here.

91
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,453
This is where we're
connecting to the Avatar.

92
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:21,794
Me and Norm are here to drive these
remotely controlled bodies called Avatars.

93
00:08:21,827 --> 00:08:26,892
And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives.

94
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:28,865
Hey, welcome.

95
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,834
Welcome to Pandora,
good to have you.

96
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:37,335
Damn, they got big. - They fully
mature on the flight out.

97
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,545
So the progress up the stim
seem to work really well.

98
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:42,518
Yeah, they got great muscle tone.

99
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:44,561
It'll take us a few hours
to get them prepared,

100
00:08:44,562 --> 00:08:46,568
but you can take them out tomorrow.

101
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:49,379
There's yours.

102
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:53,310
Doctor, Norm Spellman.
- Pleasure to meet you.

103
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,979
Looks like him.

104
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:23,996
Looks like you.

105
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:27,403
This is your Avatar now, Jake.

106
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,669
The concept is that every driver
is matched to his own Avatar.

107
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:37,561
So that their nervous system are in tune.

108
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:40,252
Or something...

109
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:46,116
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's Avatar.

110
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:48,276
Which is insanely expensive.

111
00:09:48,312 --> 00:09:50,243
Is this right?

112
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,445
I just say whatever
to the video log?

113
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,941
Yeah, we gotta get the habit
of documenting everything.

114
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:57,365
What we see, what we feel,
it's all part of the science.

115
00:09:57,401 --> 00:10:00,483
And good science is good observation.
- Plus it'll help keep you sane

116
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,485
for the next 6 years.

117
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,686
Whatever.

118
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:07,500
So uh, ...

119
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,090
Here I am.

120
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:14,571
Doing science.

121
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,455
They're coming out.

122
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,813
<i>Attention, drivers coming out of the lane.</i>

123
00:10:26,874 --> 00:10:27,691
Oh God ...

124
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:31,180
<i>- Where's the lab coat?
- Where's her lab coat?</i>

125
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:34,802
Who's got my goddamn cigarette!?

126
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:38,426
Guys, what's wrong with this picture?

127
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,272
Thank you!

128
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,070
Grace Augustine is a legend.

129
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:44,873
She's the head of the Avatar
program. She wrote the book.

130
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:47,830
I mean literally wrote the
book on Pandoran botany.

131
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:50,593
That's because she likes
plants better than people.

132
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:52,479
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

133
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:56,916
Grace I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

134
00:10:57,995 --> 00:11:01,716
Norm, I hear good things about
you. How's your Na'vi?

135
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:19,813
Grace, this is Jake Sully.

136
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:22,697
Yeah yeah, I know who you are
and I don't need you.

137
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:25,338
I need your brother.
You know, the PHD

138
00:11:25,374 --> 00:11:28,016
who trained for three
years for this mission...

139
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:30,221
He's dead.

140
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,616
I know it's a big
inconvenience for everyone.

141
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:35,538
How much lab training have you had?

142
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:37,739
I dissected a frog once.

143
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,104
You see?

144
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:43,945
They're just pissing on us with out
even a courtesy of calling it rain.

145
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:45,464
I'm going to Selfridge.
- No Grace!

146
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,027
No man, this is such bullshit!

147
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:49,629
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

148
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,069
He has no business sticking
his nose in my department.

149
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,677
Here tomorrow, 08:00.

150
00:11:55,712 --> 00:11:57,873
Try and use big words.

151
00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:10,013
<i>Scorpion 2 Hotel, Hell's Gate Tower.
You are cleared for South departure. ...</i>

152
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,530
Did you see that?
- Yes sir.

153
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:24,567
No you didn't, you were looking at
the monitor. I love this putter Ronnie.

154
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:29,135
Parker...

155
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:31,971
I used to think it
was benign neglect,

156
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:34,772
but now I see that you're
intentionally screwing me.

157
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:38,775
Grace, I enjoy our little talks...

158
00:12:42,777 --> 00:12:46,059
I need a researcher,
not some jar-head drop out.

159
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,979
Well, actually,
I thought we got lucky with him.

160
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:49,545
Lucky?
- Yeah.

161
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:51,746
How is this in any way 'lucky'?

162
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:53,655
Lucky your guy had a twin brother.

163
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:56,656
And lucky that brother
wasn't some oral hygenist or something.

164
00:12:56,823 --> 00:13:00,468
A Marine we could use. I'm assigning him
to your team as security escort.

165
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:04,555
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there.

166
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,651
Look, you're supposed to be
winning the hearts and the

167
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,712
minds of the natives, isn't that the
whole point of your little puppet show?

168
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,195
You look like them, you talk like
them and they'll start trusting us.

169
00:13:12,229 --> 00:13:14,363
We build them a school,
we teach them English...

170
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:18,198
But after how many years relations with
the indigenous are only getting worse.

171
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:21,400
That tends to happen when you
use machine guns on them.

172
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,682
Right, come here.

173
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:32,570
This is why we're here, Unobtanium.

174
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:35,690
Because this little gray
rock sells for 20 million a kilo.

175
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,011
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

176
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:42,291
It's what pays for
your science. Comprendo?

177
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:45,499
Now, those savages are
threatening our whole operation.

178
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,935
We're on the brink of war and you're

179
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:50,337
supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

180
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:54,100
So use what you've got
and get me some results.

181
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,705
How much link-time have you logged?

182
00:14:07,744 --> 00:14:10,907
About 520 hours.
- That's good.

183
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:13,797
You're in there.
You're here.

184
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:16,433
How much have you logged?
- Zip.

185
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:19,194
But I read a manual.

186
00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:21,555
Tell me you're joking.

187
00:14:22,356 --> 00:14:24,236
This is cool.

188
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:26,238
Let's go.

189
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,242
Don't. I got this.

190
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:38,344
So you just figured you'd come out here

191
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:41,047
to the most hostile environment
known to man...

192
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:44,766
with no training of any kind
and see how it went?

193
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,133
What was going through your head?

194
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:50,654
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

195
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,855
Biometrics are good.
- 1-3 is ready.

196
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:56,137
Keep your arms in,
hands in.

197
00:14:56,857 --> 00:14:58,858
Head down.

198
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:00,270
Down.

199
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,178
Just relax and let your mind go blank.

200
00:15:03,581 --> 00:15:05,739
That shouldn't be hard for you.

201
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:09,743
Kiss the darkest part of my...
- Initiate link.

202
00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:13,665
Run sequence, Unit 3.
- Launching.

203
00:15:19,348 --> 00:15:21,669
I have the first congruency.

204
00:15:29,197 --> 00:15:32,157
That's a gorgeous brain.
Nice activity.

205
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:37,201
Go figure.
- Phase lock 40%.

206
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:42,800
I'm going in.

207
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,414
I'm going in in 4.

208
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,765
Phase lock 99%.
Link is stable.

209
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,596
Jake, can you hear me?

210
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,399
Can you hear me, Jake?

211
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:13,221
Pupillary reflex is good.

212
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:18,983
Hearing response normal.
How are you feeling Jake?

213
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:21,384
Hey guys.

214
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:22,902
Welcome to your
new body Jake.

215
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:24,364
<i> Good.</i>

216
00:16:24,973 --> 00:16:26,474
We're gonna take this
nice and easy Jake.

217
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,941
And touch your thumb to your fingers.

218
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:29,337
Thumb to your fingers.

219
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:31,948
No problem.
- Good. I can see you remember that one.

220
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:32,952
Got it.

221
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:35,040
Well, if you want to
sit up, that's fine.

222
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:38,763
Let's take it nice and slow Jake.
No tranquil attacks here, that's good.

223
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:40,852
Do you feel lightheaded or dizzy?

224
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:42,772
Wiggling your toes.
- Good Jake.

225
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:47,986
System motor control is good.

226
00:16:48,026 --> 00:16:50,632
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

227
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:56,488
Take it easy, don't get
ahead of yourself, okay?

228
00:16:56,524 --> 00:17:00,013
There are few more sensory and motor
reflex tests we need to run, so take it easy.

229
00:17:01,517 --> 00:17:04,021
Sit down.
- Jake listen to me.

230
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:09,232
Jake I need you to sit down.
- It's OK, I got this.

231
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:12,860
Jake you need to sit down.
- Guys get him back on the gurney now.

232
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:16,448
You need to sit down.
you need time to adjust to atm..

233
00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:19,956
Yeah!

234
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:22,462
Sedate him!

235
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:23,909
1,000 mg of Seconal.

236
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:25,121
Stop! ...
-- Stop!

237
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,088
Woah ... Woah.

238
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,569
- Jake!
- Jake, listen to me.

239
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:32,084
You're not used to your
Avatar body, this is dangerous.

240
00:17:32,126 --> 00:17:35,292
This is great.
- Come on, they're gonna put you out.

241
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,190
Sit down!

242
00:17:40,485 --> 00:17:41,625
No no, ...
I got to get out of these leads.

243
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:43,162
Goddammit!
Bring them!

244
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,447
Come on, you ain't got no skills.

245
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:54,456
I don't even have to
play defense. - Hey guys.

246
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:57,863
It's OK, I'll get him.
- Jake you have to come inside.

247
00:18:02,276 --> 00:18:04,278
Sorry.

248
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,492
You're not supposed to be running!

249
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,116
Sorry.
- Watch it.

250
00:18:42,966 --> 00:18:45,334
Hey Marine!

251
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:47,698
Damn...

252
00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:49,747
Grace?

253
00:18:49,782 --> 00:18:52,667
Who did you expect numb nuts?

254
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:55,360
Think fast!

255
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:58,281
Motor control is looking good.

256
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:10,087
C'mon everybody quiet down.

257
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:12,397
Lights out.

258
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:14,556
C'mon Louise, chop chop.

259
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,848
Don't play with that,
you'll go blind.

260
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:21,655
That's kinda freaky.
- C'mon.

261
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:22,658
Scat.

262
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:30,474
Lights out, see you at dinner kitties.

263
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:55,733
Welcome back.

264
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:05,674
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

265
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:10,044
I'm Trudy, I fly all the Scientzoids.

266
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,690
And this here is my baby.

267
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:14,855
Hold on a second.

268
00:20:14,895 --> 00:20:18,268
Hey Wainfleet, get it done.

269
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:21,991
We bounce at 09:00.
- I'm on it captain.

270
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:27,082
Mine-Strike's still loose.
- You guys are packing some heavy gear.

271
00:20:27,203 --> 00:20:29,286
Watch it!

272
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:31,932
That's cause we're not the only
thing flying around out there.

273
00:20:31,966 --> 00:20:33,705
Or the biggest.

274
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,826
But I need you on a Door-Gun.
I'm a man short.

275
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,031
Thought you'd never ask.

276
00:20:39,953 --> 00:20:43,560
There's your man.
See you on the flight lane.

277
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:56,233
You wanted to see me Colonel?

278
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:59,357
This low gravity
will make you soft.

279
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,684
You get soft...

280
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:08,976
Pandora will shit you out
dead with zero warning.

281
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,167
I pulled your record Corporal.

282
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:15,315
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

283
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:19,202
Nothing like this here though.

284
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:24,097
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

285
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:28,864
Figured it's just another hell hole.
- I was the first Recon myself.

286
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:32,951
Few years ahead of you,
well maybe more than a few.

287
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:36,159
Three tours in Nigeria,
not a scratch.

288
00:21:36,193 --> 00:21:38,245
I come out here...

289
00:21:38,285 --> 00:21:42,090
Day one. Think I felt
like a shavetail Louie?

290
00:21:42,975 --> 00:21:46,661
They could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

291
00:21:46,703 --> 00:21:49,267
Make me pretty again.

292
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:52,277
But you know what,
I kinda like it.

293
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:55,285
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

294
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:59,492
The Avatar program is a bad joke.

295
00:21:59,532 --> 00:22:03,281
Bunch a limp dick
science majors.

296
00:22:03,316 --> 00:22:07,639
However, it does present
an opportunity

297
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:11,961
most timely and unique.
Clear!

298
00:22:16,853 --> 00:22:20,224
A Recon GI-re in an Avatar body.

299
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,831
That's a potent mix,
Gives me the goosebumps.

300
00:22:23,866 --> 00:22:29,282
Such a Marine could provide the
intel I need, right on the ground.

301
00:22:30,203 --> 00:22:32,974
Right in the hostile's camp.

302
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:38,301
Look Sully, I want you to learn
these savages from the inside.

303
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,270
I want you to gain their trust.

304
00:22:40,304 --> 00:22:42,030
I need to know
how to force their cooperation

305
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:43,707
or hammer them hard if they won't.

306
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,525
Am I still with Augustine?
- On paper.

307
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,048
You walk like on of her science pukes. ...

308
00:22:51,084 --> 00:22:53,215
You quack like one...

309
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:56,782
But you report to me.

310
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:59,626
Can you do that for me son?

311
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,434
Hell yeah sir.

312
00:23:02,474 --> 00:23:05,240
Well all right then.

313
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:18,277
Son, I take care of my own.

314
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:20,798
You get me what I need,
I'll see to it you get

315
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,282
your legs back when you rotate home.

316
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:26,409
Your real legs.

317
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:30,499
That sounds real good sir.

318
00:23:36,913 --> 00:23:38,918
Link's ready.

319
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:44,131
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

320
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:47,889
<i> Link 3 ready.</i>

321
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:51,870
All right, I'm going in.

322
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:03,913
Shut it down, we're gonna stay a while.

323
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,243
Norm, your pack.

324
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:14,736
Stay with the ship.

325
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:17,663
One idiot with a gun is enough.

326
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:21,672
You the man, Doc.

327
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:01,643
Prolemurs, they're not aggressive.

328
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:07,778
Relax Marine, you're making me nervous.

329
00:26:12,462 --> 00:26:17,509
So, how will they know we're here?
- I'm sure they're watching us right now.

330
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,274
Keep moving Norm.
- Keep up guys.

331
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:27,279
And here I go.
- Scanning.

332
00:26:32,486 --> 00:26:34,725
It's that fast?

333
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:37,894
Amazing isn't it?
- Yeah

334
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,651
That is signal transduction

335
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:43,418
from this root to the root
of the tree next to it.

336
00:26:44,496 --> 00:26:45,859
So, we should take a sample.

337
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:47,500
Okay, ... Sample.

338
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:53,706
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

339
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:58,231
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

340
00:26:58,633 --> 00:26:59,434
Oh, right.

341
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:56,696
Don't shoot.

342
00:27:57,555 --> 00:27:59,518
Don't shoot. You'll piss him off.

343
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,267
It's already pissed off.

344
00:28:05,302 --> 00:28:08,705
Jake, that armor is
too thick, trust me.

345
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:18,718
It's a territorial threat display,
do not run or he'll charge.

346
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:20,839
So what do I do?
Dance with it?

347
00:28:20,874 --> 00:28:24,722
Just, hold your ground.

348
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:41,799
C'mon, what you got?!

349
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:44,464
Oh yeah. Who's bad?
That's right.

350
00:28:45,663 --> 00:28:48,471
That's what I'm talking about bitch.

351
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:52,840
That's right, get your
punk ass back to mommy.

352
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:57,038
You got nothing, keep running.
Why don't you bring back some friends.

353
00:29:14,257 --> 00:29:16,897
What about this one?
Run, don't run, what?!

354
00:29:17,977 --> 00:29:20,981
Run, definitely run!

355
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:11,150
We're gonna have to call it guys,
we're not allowed to run Night Ops. Col's orders.

356
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,713
Sorry doc, he's just gonna
have to hang on till morning.

357
00:33:15,753 --> 00:33:18,758
He won't make it till morning.

358
00:35:10,237 --> 00:35:13,040
I don't have all goddamn night.

359
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:15,884
Come on!

360
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,844
Wait, don't!

361
00:36:34,246 --> 00:36:36,248
Great.

362
00:37:32,906 --> 00:37:36,631
I know you probably
don't understand this.

363
00:37:37,191 --> 00:37:39,314
But...

364
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:45,204
Thank you.

365
00:37:48,926 --> 00:37:51,207
Thank you.

366
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:57,214
That was pretty impressive.

367
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:02,060
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along.

368
00:38:05,062 --> 00:38:08,146
Wait a second,
where are you going?

369
00:38:09,347 --> 00:38:11,249
Wait up.

370
00:38:11,283 --> 00:38:13,112
Slow down.

371
00:38:13,147 --> 00:38:16,432
I just wanted to say thanks
for killing those things...

372
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:21,241
Don't thank.

373
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:24,442
You don't thank for this.

374
00:38:24,483 --> 00:38:27,387
This is sad.

375
00:38:27,422 --> 00:38:29,994
Very sad, only.

376
00:38:30,029 --> 00:38:32,572
OK, I'm sorry.

377
00:38:33,092 --> 00:38:35,975
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

378
00:38:38,459 --> 00:38:42,267
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

379
00:38:42,301 --> 00:38:44,464
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

380
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:46,292
Your fault!
- Aye, wooo.

381
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,898
Your fault.
-- Easy.

382
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:53,793
You're like a baby, making noise,
don't know what to do.

383
00:38:57,057 --> 00:38:57,642
Fine

384
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:03,286
If you love your
little forest friends...

385
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:07,129
Why not let them just kill my ass?

386
00:39:07,164 --> 00:39:09,575
What's the thinking?

387
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,896
Why save you?
- Why save me?

388
00:39:16,618 --> 00:39:19,540
You have a strong heart.

389
00:39:20,743 --> 00:39:23,145
No fear.

390
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,512
But stupid, ignorant like a child.

391
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,924
Well if I'm like a child, then ..

392
00:39:38,963 --> 00:39:41,412
... maybe you should teach me.

393
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:45,569
Sky people can not learn. You do not see.
- Teach me how to see.

394
00:39:45,605 --> 00:39:48,534
No one can teach you to see.

395
00:39:49,573 --> 00:39:52,538
Come on, can't we talk?

396
00:39:52,578 --> 00:39:55,080
Where did you learn to speak english?

397
00:39:55,113 --> 00:39:57,581
Dr. Augustine's school?

398
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:04,549
You're like a baby.

399
00:40:09,353 --> 00:40:12,157
I need your help.

400
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:14,962
You should not be here.

401
00:40:15,002 --> 00:40:18,565
OK, take me with you.
- No, go back.

402
00:40:20,206 --> 00:40:22,210
No.

403
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:24,969
Go back.

404
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:15,744
What are they?

405
00:41:16,545 --> 00:41:19,267
Seeds of the sacred tree.

406
00:41:19,303 --> 00:41:22,871
Very pure spirits.

407
00:41:45,457 --> 00:41:47,579
What was that all about?

408
00:41:49,183 --> 00:41:51,182
Come.

409
00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:57,471
Where are we going?

410
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:08,524
Come.

411
00:42:12,689 --> 00:42:14,689
What's your name?

412
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:16,754
What's going on?

413
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:24,084
What's happening?

414
00:45:05,947 --> 00:45:07,879
What's he saying?

415
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:11,760
What's he saying?

416
00:45:11,794 --> 00:45:14,881
My father is deciding
whether to kill you.

417
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,566
Your father?

418
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,008
It's nice to meet you sir.

419
00:45:30,086 --> 00:45:32,884
That is mother, she is Tsahik,

420
00:45:32,919 --> 00:45:35,681
the one who interprets the will of Eywa.

421
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:38,767
Who's Eywa?

422
00:45:44,376 --> 00:45:46,579
What are you called?

423
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:48,781
Jake Sully.

424
00:45:57,997 --> 00:46:00,161
Why did you come to us?

425
00:46:00,196 --> 00:46:02,288
I came to learn.

426
00:46:02,323 --> 00:46:05,927
We have tried to teach
other sky people.

427
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:09,534
It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full.

428
00:46:10,255 --> 00:46:13,705
My cup is empty,
trust me.

429
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:16,744
Ask Dr. Augustine,
I'm no scientist.

430
00:46:16,779 --> 00:46:18,946
What are you?

431
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:22,756
I was a Marine.

432
00:46:24,357 --> 00:46:27,524
A warrior, of the jarhead clan.

433
00:46:57,728 --> 00:46:59,690
It is decided.

434
00:46:59,812 --> 00:47:02,015
My daughter will teach you our ways,

435
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:06,305
Learn well Jake Sully.

436
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:11,547
And we will see if your
insanity can be cured.

437
00:47:28,937 --> 00:47:30,938
Good evening.

438
00:47:33,343 --> 00:47:35,586
Please don't get up.

439
00:47:40,675 --> 00:47:42,876
Sorry.

440
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,362
Hey, how you doing?

441
00:48:31,655 --> 00:48:34,197
Jake. ... Jake.
- He's coming out.

442
00:48:35,015 --> 00:48:35,759
Jake!

443
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:41,168
Come on back kid.
Come on. That's it.

444
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:44,775
There you go.

445
00:48:47,696 --> 00:48:50,661
You were talking like a tick.

446
00:48:53,585 --> 00:48:56,392
Is the Avatar safe?
- Yeah Doc.

447
00:48:57,311 --> 00:49:00,597
You are not gonna
believe where I am.

448
00:49:01,196 --> 00:49:04,662
The last thing we see
is this Marine's ass

449
00:49:04,696 --> 00:49:08,130
disappearing in the bush with this
angry Thanator coming after him.

450
00:49:08,165 --> 00:49:10,614
It's not something you can teach.

451
00:49:11,213 --> 00:49:15,822
For reasons I cannot fathom
the Omaticaya have chosen you.

452
00:49:15,856 --> 00:49:18,023
God help us all.

453
00:49:18,058 --> 00:49:20,548
Jarhead clan?

454
00:49:21,509 --> 00:49:23,198
And it worked?

455
00:49:23,233 --> 00:49:25,516
I'm practically family.

456
00:49:25,556 --> 00:49:29,005
They're gonna study me,
I have to learn to be one of them.

457
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,247
That's called taking initiative son.
I wish I had ten more like you,

458
00:49:32,281 --> 00:49:36,570
Sully, just find out what
the blue monkeys want.

459
00:49:37,572 --> 00:49:42,059
You know, we tried to give them
medicine, education...

460
00:49:42,582 --> 00:49:44,866
... roads, but no, they like mud.

461
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:49,073
And that wouldn't bother
me, it's just that their uh ...

462
00:49:50,074 --> 00:49:53,478
Can somebody just...
Sector 12.

463
00:49:56,764 --> 00:49:57,207
Stop.

464
00:49:57,546 --> 00:49:58,980
Where .. Stop. Jesus.

465
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:03,046
Their damn village
happens to be resting on

466
00:50:03,214 --> 00:50:09,301
the richest Unobtanium deposit
within 200 clicks in any direction.

467
00:50:09,337 --> 00:50:12,107
I mean, look at all that cheddar.

468
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,396
Who gets them to move?
- Guess?

469
00:50:19,597 --> 00:50:22,002
What if they won't go?

470
00:50:22,042 --> 00:50:24,407
I'm betting that they will.

471
00:50:27,612 --> 00:50:30,337
Killing the indigenous looks bad.

472
00:50:30,657 --> 00:50:34,139
But there's one thing that shareholders
hate more than bad press.

473
00:50:34,175 --> 00:50:37,625
And that's a bad quarterly statement.
I didn't make up the rules.

474
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:41,232
So just find me a carrot
that will get them to move,

475
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,999
otherwise it's going to
have to be all stick.

476
00:50:43,509 --> 00:50:44,231
Okay?

477
00:50:45,077 --> 00:50:48,685
You got three months.
That's when the dozers get there.

478
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,367
Well we're wasting time.

479
00:50:51,767 --> 00:50:54,170
I like this guy.

480
00:50:54,206 --> 00:50:56,375
OK, let's run through them again.

481
00:50:56,456 --> 00:50:59,578
Moat: Dragon lady.

482
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,672
Eytuken.
- Eytukan

483
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:05,671
He's the clan leader.
She's their spiritual leader.

484
00:51:05,711 --> 00:51:08,195
Like a Shaman.
- Got it.

485
00:51:08,876 --> 00:51:12,285
Tsutey.
- Tsu'tey

486
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:15,205
He'll be the next clan leader.

487
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,490
Neytiri.
- She'll be the next Tsahik.

488
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,813
They become a mated pair.

489
00:51:21,534 --> 00:51:24,218
So who's this Eywa?
- Who's Eywa?!

490
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,525
Only their Deity. Their Goddess
made up of all living things.

491
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,057
Everything they know. You'd know this if
you had any training whatsoever.

492
00:51:32,091 --> 00:51:35,554
Who's got a date with
the chief's daughter?

493
00:51:36,117 --> 00:51:38,439
Let's go. Village life starts early.

494
00:51:40,124 --> 00:51:43,169
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

495
00:52:01,476 --> 00:52:03,879
Easy boy.

496
00:52:03,914 --> 00:52:06,283
It's a female.

497
00:52:10,089 --> 00:52:12,413
Easy girl

498
00:52:39,934 --> 00:52:43,421
That is Sa'helu, the bond.

499
00:52:45,424 --> 00:52:47,426
Feel her.

500
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:52,753
Feel her heart beat.

501
00:52:52,787 --> 00:52:55,681
Her breath.

502
00:52:57,364 --> 00:52:59,566
Feel her strong legs.

503
00:53:01,569 --> 00:53:05,455
You may tell her what to do, inside.

504
00:53:06,095 --> 00:53:09,982
For now, say where to go.

505
00:53:11,862 --> 00:53:13,867
Forward.

506
00:53:30,933 --> 00:53:33,078
You should go away.

507
00:53:33,114 --> 00:53:35,369
Nah, you'd miss me.

508
00:53:35,405 --> 00:53:37,625
I knew you could speak english.

509
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:57,420
Again.

510
00:53:57,454 --> 00:54:00,360
If you want to hit this thing,
it's going to be complicated.

511
00:54:00,394 --> 00:54:03,570
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

512
00:54:03,087 --> 00:54:06,235
There's an outer row of columns,
real heavy duty.

513
00:54:06,274 --> 00:54:08,962
There's a secondary ring here,
and an inner ring.

514
00:54:08,997 --> 00:54:12,175
There's a core structure like a spiral.

515
00:54:12,209 --> 00:54:13,944
That's how they move up and down.

516
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,788
We're gonna need accurate
scans of every column.

517
00:54:16,824 --> 00:54:18,479
Roger that.

518
00:54:18,513 --> 00:54:21,165
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

519
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,530
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load bearing.

520
00:54:28,543 --> 00:54:30,709
Where are we going?

521
00:54:30,749 --> 00:54:33,201
Gettin out of Dodge.

522
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:37,414
I'm not about to let Selfridge and
Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

523
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:42,864
There's a mobile link up as site 26, we can
work out of, way up in the mountains.

524
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,912
The Hallelujah mountains?

525
00:54:45,948 --> 00:54:48,280
That's right.
- Are you serious?

526
00:54:48,315 --> 00:54:49,324
Yeah.

527
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:50,497
Yes!

528
00:54:53,818 --> 00:54:57,590
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora, heard of them?

529
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:13,120
We're getting close.

530
00:55:13,155 --> 00:55:15,565
Yeah, look at my instruments.

531
00:55:16,687 --> 00:55:19,253
We're in the flux vortex.

532
00:55:19,292 --> 00:55:22,462
VFR from here on.
- What's VFR?

533
00:55:23,104 --> 00:55:25,792
Means you got to see
where you're going.

534
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:28,403
You can't see anything.
- Exactly.

535
00:55:28,439 --> 00:55:30,890
Ain't that a bitch.

536
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:51,751
Oh my God...

537
00:56:01,618 --> 00:56:04,106
You should see your faces.

538
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:32,914
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

539
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,454
Welcome to Camp.

540
00:56:56,466 --> 00:57:01,279
So, this is my bunk.
- This stuff is nasty.

541
00:57:02,682 --> 00:57:04,769
Norm, go under.

542
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:07,016
<i>Grace didn't miss a thing.</i>

543
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,592
<i>She knew I was
talking to the Colonel.</i>

544
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:14,237
<i>But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan.</i>

545
00:57:14,271 --> 00:57:16,523
<i>So she's playing nice.</i>

546
00:57:17,326 --> 00:57:19,898
Jake, hang a left.

547
00:57:19,934 --> 00:57:22,264
You'll be in the link at the end.

548
00:57:24,269 --> 00:57:26,837
Unit 1, Beulah.

549
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:29,485
She's the least glitchy.

550
00:58:17,607 --> 00:58:19,598
Holy shit.

551
00:58:19,631 --> 00:58:22,321
Do not look in her eye.

552
00:58:30,223 --> 00:58:33,031
Ikran is not horse.

553
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:36,080
When Sa'helu is made...

554
00:58:38,971 --> 00:58:41,058
Ikran will fly well.

555
00:58:41,098 --> 00:58:44,589
Only one hunter
in the whole life.

556
00:58:53,213 --> 00:58:55,900
To become Aron'yu, hunter...

557
00:58:55,941 --> 00:59:00,435
You must choose your own
Ikran and he must choose you.

558
00:59:01,919 --> 00:59:04,848
When?
- When you are ready.

559
00:59:54,861 --> 00:59:55,769
Okay, ...

560
00:59:56,404 --> 00:59:58,971
This is video log 12.

561
00:59:59,005 --> 01:00:01,503
Time is 21:32.

562
01:00:01,538 --> 01:00:05,709
Do I have to do this now?
Like, I really need to get some rack.

563
01:00:05,748 --> 01:00:09,321
No, now, when it's fresh.

564
01:00:11,328 --> 01:00:13,734
Location, shack.

565
01:00:13,774 --> 01:00:16,863
The days are starting to blur together.

566
01:00:18,466 --> 01:00:21,040
<i>The language is a pain, but...</i>

567
01:00:21,077 --> 01:00:25,206
<i>I figure it's like field stripping a
weapon, repetition, repetition...</i>

568
01:00:31,105 --> 01:00:34,598
If only you were stronger.

569
01:00:38,207 --> 01:00:40,215
<i>Neytiri calls me Scoun.</i>

570
01:00:40,254 --> 01:00:43,142
<i>It means moron.</i>

571
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:47,757
<i>Norm's attitude is
improved lately.</i>

572
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:50,163
But it's not just I'm
seeing you in front of me

573
01:00:50,197 --> 01:00:51,847
I see into you...

574
01:00:51,886 --> 01:00:54,897
<i>It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a Scoun too.</i>

575
01:00:57,184 --> 01:00:59,472
You've got to run, OK?

576
01:00:59,512 --> 01:01:00,216
Let's go.

577
01:01:00,641 --> 01:01:03,286
<i>I feel me getting tougher.</i>

578
01:01:03,321 --> 01:01:06,174
<i>I can run farther every day.</i>

579
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:09,499
<i>I have to trust my body
to know what to do.</i>

580
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:15,717
Yeah, check it out!

581
01:01:17,066 --> 01:01:17,944
Crap.

582
01:01:22,531 --> 01:01:24,652
<i>Every day it's reading the trail,</i>

583
01:01:25,513 --> 01:01:28,904
<i>track's of the wora'hon,
tiniest scents and sounds.</i>

584
01:01:35,178 --> 01:01:37,353
<i>She's always going on
about the flow of energy</i>

585
01:01:38,405 --> 01:01:40,096
<i>the spirits of animals.</i>

586
01:01:40,566 --> 01:01:43,070
<i>I really hope this tree hugging
crap isn't on the final.</i>

587
01:01:43,763 --> 01:01:46,642
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there you know.

588
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:49,417
You need to listen to what she says.

589
01:01:49,984 --> 01:01:53,363
Try to see the forest
through her eyes.

590
01:01:53,429 --> 01:01:56,362
Excuse me, this is my video log here.

591
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:13,476
<i>With Neytiri it's
learn fast or die.</i>

592
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,110
You got to be kidding me.

593
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:48,836
<i>I talked Moat into letting Grace into the village.</i>

594
01:02:49,744 --> 01:02:51,779
<i>1st time since her school was closed down.</i>

595
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:58,345
No you don't, come back here.

596
01:03:00,352 --> 01:03:02,557
Bon apetit.

597
01:03:28,688 --> 01:03:29,885
Come on, Marine.

598
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,093
<i>I'm trying to understand
this deep connection</i>

599
01:03:58,426 --> 01:04:00,933
<i>the people have to the forest.</i>

600
01:04:00,968 --> 01:04:04,263
<i>She talks about a network of energy.</i>

601
01:04:04,311 --> 01:04:08,301
<i>That flows through all living things.</i>

602
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:12,492
<i>She says, all energy is only borrowed.</i>

603
01:04:12,527 --> 01:04:16,643
<i>And one day you
have to give it back.</i>

604
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,212
A clean kill.

605
01:05:02,673 --> 01:05:04,597
You are ready.

606
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:33,636
Learning to ride an Ikran,
we call them Banshees,

607
01:05:33,672 --> 01:05:36,666
is the test every young
hunter has to pass.

608
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:42,602
But to do that, you got to go
where the banshees are.

609
01:05:42,603 --> 01:05:43,604
Ooh-rah

610
01:07:46,352 --> 01:07:48,603
Jake Sully will go first.

611
01:08:21,533 --> 01:08:23,693
Now you choose your Ikran.

612
01:08:23,731 --> 01:08:26,097
This you must feel inside.

613
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:28,576
If he also chooses you
move quick like I showed.

614
01:08:28,762 --> 01:08:31,811
You will have one chance Jake.

615
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:34,609
How will I know if he chooses me?

616
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:37,206
He will try to kill you.

617
01:08:37,242 --> 01:08:40,125
Outstanding.

618
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:41,696
Let's dance.

619
01:10:15,242 --> 01:10:17,540
Make the bond!

620
01:10:24,077 --> 01:10:26,072
Jake!

621
01:10:39,747 --> 01:10:42,047
Sa'Helu Jake!

622
01:10:43,544 --> 01:10:45,544
Sa'Helu!

623
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:57,340
Stop!

624
01:11:06,216 --> 01:11:09,212
That's right, you're mine.

625
01:11:23,127 --> 01:11:26,444
First flight seals the bond,
you can not wait.

626
01:11:27,407 --> 01:11:30,043
Think fly.
- Fly?

627
01:11:38,201 --> 01:11:40,440
God damn...

628
01:11:43,918 --> 01:11:46,195
Oh shit!

629
01:11:54,991 --> 01:11:58,429
Shut up and fly straight!

630
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:08,389
That's it.

631
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,626
Bank left.

632
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:21,698
Level out!
That's it.

633
01:12:25,899 --> 01:12:27,646
Go Jake Sully!

634
01:13:12,795 --> 01:13:15,671
Yeah baby I got this!

635
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:17,592
Oh shit!

636
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:25,870
<i>I may not be much of a horse guy,
but I was born to do this.</i>

637
01:13:28,867 --> 01:13:31,231
I came like this,
this you,

638
01:13:32,329 --> 01:13:35,842
I turn, I feel the wind,
I turn very strong.

639
01:13:35,876 --> 01:13:37,915
I see, I bank so hard.

640
01:14:39,853 --> 01:14:41,487
The Tree of Souls.

641
01:14:42,298 --> 01:14:48,033
Aybetraya Ramunam
It's their most sacred place.

642
01:14:48,073 --> 01:14:50,549
See the flux vortex and
these full color images?

643
01:14:51,146 --> 01:14:53,228
That's what messes up my instruments.

644
01:14:53,263 --> 01:14:58,730
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

645
01:14:58,765 --> 01:15:00,310
I would die to get samples.

646
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:03,075
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

647
01:15:04,013 --> 01:15:05,138
You lucky swine.

648
01:15:12,514 --> 01:15:14,857
<i>I was a stone cold
aerial hunter.</i>

649
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,674
<i>Death from above.</i>

650
01:15:17,595 --> 01:15:20,756
<i>Only problem is,
you're not the only one.</i>

651
01:15:24,668 --> 01:15:26,382
Dive!

652
01:15:57,763 --> 01:15:58,915
Follow me!

653
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:48,092
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

654
01:16:49,044 --> 01:16:53,183
It is Toruk, Last Shadow.

655
01:16:54,063 --> 01:16:58,174
Right, it's the last one
you ever see.

656
01:17:01,743 --> 01:17:05,915
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Makto.

657
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:08,827
Rider of last shadow.

658
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:11,821
He rode this?

659
01:17:12,537 --> 01:17:14,500
Toruk chose him.

660
01:17:14,534 --> 01:17:18,605
It has only happen five times since
the time from the first songs.

661
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,083
That's a long time.
- Yes.

662
01:17:21,118 --> 01:17:23,674
Toruk Makto was mighty.

663
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:28,581
He brought the clans together
in a time of Great Sorrow.

664
01:17:28,616 --> 01:17:32,492
All Na'vi people know the story.

665
01:17:37,641 --> 01:17:40,319
<i>Everything is backwards now.</i>

666
01:17:40,354 --> 01:17:44,225
<i>Like out there is the true world,
and in here is the dream.</i>

667
01:18:05,495 --> 01:18:08,886
It's hard to believe it's
only been three months.

668
01:18:11,237 --> 01:18:13,874
I barely remember my own life.

669
01:18:17,169 --> 01:18:19,111
I don't know who I am anymore.

670
01:18:37,638 --> 01:18:40,448
Haven't got lost in
the woods, have you?

671
01:18:43,656 --> 01:18:46,984
Your last report was more
than two weeks ago.

672
01:18:48,909 --> 01:18:51,998
I'm starting to doubt your resolve.

673
01:18:53,923 --> 01:18:57,413
Way I see it, it's time to terminate
the mission. - I can do this.

674
01:18:58,215 --> 01:19:00,986
You already have.

675
01:19:01,023 --> 01:19:03,148
You've given me good usable intel.

676
01:19:03,182 --> 01:19:06,001
This Tree of Souls place...

677
01:19:06,037 --> 01:19:09,446
Yeah, I got them by the balls with
that when this turns into a shit fight

678
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,817
which it will.

679
01:19:11,852 --> 01:19:15,182
Now is time to come in.

680
01:19:15,461 --> 01:19:20,156
By the way, you're gonna
get your legs back.

681
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:24,083
Yeah, I got you Corporate approval.

682
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:26,811
It's a done deal,
gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

683
01:19:26,846 --> 01:19:29,900
I'm a man of my word.

684
01:19:31,705 --> 01:19:34,114
I got to finish this.

685
01:19:35,716 --> 01:19:38,122
It's one more thing.

686
01:19:38,156 --> 01:19:40,048
Ceremony...

687
01:19:40,849 --> 01:19:44,338
It's the final stage of becoming a man.

688
01:19:45,421 --> 01:19:48,228
If I do it, I'm one of them.

689
01:19:49,071 --> 01:19:51,638
They'll trust me.

690
01:19:54,566 --> 01:19:58,094
And I can negotiate the
terms of their relocation.

691
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:15,140
Than you better get
it done Corporal.

692
01:20:31,545 --> 01:20:35,397
<i>The Na'vi say, every person is born twice.</i>

693
01:20:37,483 --> 01:20:39,995
<i>The second time is
when you earn</i>

694
01:20:39,995 --> 01:20:44,099
<i>your place among
the people, forever.</i>

695
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:45,746
Come.

696
01:22:03,311 --> 01:22:06,923
This is a place for
prayers to be heard.

697
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:10,733
And sometimes answered.

698
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:20,560
We call this tree Utral Aymokriy

699
01:22:20,594 --> 01:22:23,768
The Tree of Voices.

700
01:22:24,769 --> 01:22:28,181
The voices of our ancestors.

701
01:22:41,816 --> 01:22:44,222
I can hear them

702
01:22:48,314 --> 01:22:51,842
They live Jake.

703
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:54,848
Within Eywa.

704
01:22:57,859 --> 01:23:00,346
You are Omaticaya now.

705
01:23:00,385 --> 01:23:04,155
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

706
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:11,912
And you may choose a woman.

707
01:23:13,513 --> 01:23:16,396
We have many fine women.

708
01:23:16,434 --> 01:23:19,717
Nenat is the best singer.

709
01:23:21,638 --> 01:23:24,599
I don't want Nenat.

710
01:23:27,641 --> 01:23:30,723
Paral is good hunter.

711
01:23:31,405 --> 01:23:34,126
Yes, she is a good hunter.

712
01:23:35,526 --> 01:23:38,407
I've already chosen.

713
01:23:40,929 --> 01:23:44,531
But this woman must also choose me.

714
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:50,535
She already has.

715
01:24:19,672 --> 01:24:23,113
I'm with you now Jake.

716
01:24:23,148 --> 01:24:26,556
We are mated for life.

717
01:24:31,437 --> 01:24:34,159
<i>What the hell are you doing Jake?</i>

718
01:25:04,978 --> 01:25:07,779
Don't forget the phase
integration, middle button.

719
01:25:07,814 --> 01:25:09,900
You got to eat something.

720
01:25:17,667 --> 01:25:18,536
Jake!

721
01:25:20,186 --> 01:25:23,188
Wake up. Jake please!

722
01:25:23,608 --> 01:25:26,911
Don't make me force feed a cripple.

723
01:25:54,627 --> 01:25:56,275
There, I'm done, let's go.

724
01:25:56,869 --> 01:25:58,509
And when was the last
time you took a shower?

725
01:25:59,047 --> 01:26:02,011
I don't need a shower.
- Jesus Marine.

726
01:26:05,343 --> 01:26:06,612
Jake!

727
01:26:13,564 --> 01:26:14,564
Jake!

728
01:26:14,565 --> 01:26:15,386
Wake up!

729
01:26:15,487 --> 01:26:16,387
Jake!

730
01:26:16,688 --> 01:26:17,488
Wake up!

731
01:26:21,689 --> 01:26:22,582
Hey!

732
01:26:23,965 --> 01:26:26,424
Stop!

733
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:34,935
Hey boss...

734
01:26:38,849 --> 01:26:40,971
What? - I got a native
doing a funky chicken here.

735
01:26:41,281 --> 01:26:42,639
He's blocking my blade.

736
01:26:44,138 --> 01:26:45,517
Keep going, he'll move.

737
01:26:46,402 --> 01:26:48,080
These people have to
learn that we don't stop.

738
01:26:48,181 --> 01:26:49,452
Come on, go, go go ..

739
01:26:51,863 --> 01:26:52,888
Stop!

740
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:56,185
Go! Go!

741
01:26:57,463 --> 01:26:59,304
There, see, he moved.

742
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:13,125
Woah, woah, ...
Dude, woah, dude, no!

743
01:27:13,386 --> 01:27:16,065
Oh! I'm blind!

744
01:27:27,459 --> 01:27:29,982
Jake!
- Neytiri!

745
01:27:31,382 --> 01:27:33,784
Come on!

746
01:27:57,798 --> 01:28:00,479
Freeze it, right there!

747
01:28:01,881 --> 01:28:04,762
Scale up, enhance.

748
01:28:06,082 --> 01:28:08,284
Son of a bitch.

749
01:28:09,163 --> 01:28:11,086
Unbelievable.

750
01:28:11,566 --> 01:28:14,208
Get me a pilot.
- Yes sir.

751
01:28:34,534 --> 01:28:36,782
You do not speak here!

752
01:28:48,106 --> 01:28:50,307
Don't do this!

753
01:28:51,908 --> 01:28:53,910
You!
- Listen, brother...

754
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:02,797
You mated with the human!
- Oh shit...

755
01:29:03,596 --> 01:29:05,838
Is this true?

756
01:29:07,038 --> 01:29:11,284
We are mated before Eywa.
It is done.

757
01:29:11,321 --> 01:29:15,007
Brother please, do not
attack the sky people.

758
01:29:15,042 --> 01:29:19,325
Many Omatacaya will die if you do.
- You are not my brother!

759
01:29:22,406 --> 01:29:25,209
And I am not your enemy!

760
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:28,651
The enemy is out there!
And they are very powerful!

761
01:29:35,534 --> 01:29:37,735
I can talk to them!
- No more talk!

762
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:49,342
I am Omaticaya,
I am one of you.

763
01:29:49,377 --> 01:29:52,665
And I have the right to speak.

764
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:09,155
These words are like
stones in my heart.

765
01:30:12,676 --> 01:30:14,242
Sir, I'm sorry.

766
01:30:14,276 --> 01:30:16,958
You can't interrupt
a link in progress.

767
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:20,040
It's very dangerous!

768
01:30:22,003 --> 01:30:22,849
Grace!

769
01:30:25,741 --> 01:30:27,217
Wait!
- Stay down sir!

770
01:30:30,857 --> 01:30:31,616
Look, ...

771
01:30:32,366 --> 01:30:34,849
I was sent here to ...

772
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:05,105
Are you out of your Goddamned mind?!
- You crossed the line.

773
01:31:08,308 --> 01:31:11,111
Wheel this meat out of here.

774
01:31:12,069 --> 01:31:14,992
Jake! What the hell
is going on here?

775
01:31:17,912 --> 01:31:20,395
You let me down son.

776
01:31:21,596 --> 01:31:23,597
So what, you...

777
01:31:24,478 --> 01:31:27,040
You found yourself some local tail

778
01:31:27,041 --> 01:31:29,602
and you completely forget
what team you're playing for?

779
01:31:29,636 --> 01:31:32,322
Parker, there is time to
salvage this situation...

780
01:31:32,358 --> 01:31:34,882
Shut your pie hole!

781
01:31:34,923 --> 01:31:37,370
Or what, Ranger Rick?

782
01:31:37,405 --> 01:31:40,068
You gonna shoot me?
- I could do that.

783
01:31:40,102 --> 01:31:42,497
You need to muzzle your dog.

784
01:31:42,531 --> 01:31:44,889
Can we take this down a
couple of notches please?

785
01:31:44,931 --> 01:31:47,411
You say you want to keep
your people alive?

786
01:31:47,446 --> 01:31:49,497
Start by listening to her.

787
01:31:49,533 --> 01:31:53,014
Those trees were sacred to
Omaticaya in a way you can't imagine.

788
01:31:53,015 --> 01:31:54,018
You know what?

789
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:56,300
You throw a stick
in the air around here

790
01:31:56,336 --> 01:31:59,978
it's gonna land on some
sacred fern for Christ's sake.

791
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:03,585
I'm not talking about
some kind of pagan voodoo

792
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:05,781
I'm talking about something real,

793
01:32:05,782 --> 01:32:07,943
something measurable in
a biology of the forest.

794
01:32:07,979 --> 01:32:10,308
Which is what exactly?

795
01:32:10,343 --> 01:32:13,791
What we think we know,
is that there's some kind of

796
01:32:13,826 --> 01:32:17,307
electro chemical communication
between the roots of the trees.

797
01:32:17,349 --> 01:32:19,514
Like synapses between neurons.

798
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:24,353
And each tree has 10 to the fourth
connections to the trees around it.

799
01:32:24,388 --> 01:32:27,635
And there are 10 to the
tvelfth trees on Pandora.

800
01:32:28,434 --> 01:32:30,435
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

801
01:32:30,838 --> 01:32:33,958
It's more connections
than the human brain.

802
01:32:34,238 --> 01:32:36,919
Get it?
It's a network.

803
01:32:36,959 --> 01:32:40,243
It's a global network, and
the Na'vi can access it.

804
01:32:40,277 --> 01:32:42,408
They can upload and download data.

805
01:32:42,443 --> 01:32:46,927
Memories, at sites like the
one you just destroyed.

806
01:32:46,928 --> 01:32:47,929
Yes!

807
01:32:49,166 --> 01:32:53,450
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

808
01:32:54,129 --> 01:32:57,452
They're just Goddamn trees.

809
01:32:58,132 --> 01:33:01,454
You need to wake up Parker.
- No, you need to wake up.

810
01:33:00,848 --> 01:33:04,187
The wealth of this world isn't in
the ground, it's all around us.

811
01:33:04,756 --> 01:33:08,414
The Na'vi know that, and
they're fighting to defend it

812
01:33:08,656 --> 01:33:11,244
If you want to share
this world with them,

813
01:33:11,342 --> 01:33:13,227
you need to understand them.

814
01:33:13,307 --> 01:33:18,090
I'd say we understand them just
fine, thanks to Jake here.

815
01:33:19,512 --> 01:33:21,631
Hey Doc, come take a look.

816
01:33:21,668 --> 01:33:24,513
<i>They're not gonna
give up their home.</i>

817
01:33:26,138 --> 01:33:28,455
<i>They're not gonna make a deal.</i>

818
01:33:28,984 --> 01:33:31,505
<i>For light beer?</i>

819
01:33:32,237 --> 01:33:34,025
<i>And blue jeans?</i>

820
01:33:36,383 --> 01:33:39,961
<i>There's nothing that
we have that they want.</i>

821
01:33:41,588 --> 01:33:45,124
<i>Everything they sent me out
here to do is a waste of time.</i>

822
01:33:49,718 --> 01:33:52,643
<i>They're never gonna
leave Hometree.</i>

823
01:33:55,978 --> 01:34:00,977
Since a deal can't be made I guess
things get real simple, Jake.

824
01:34:01,668 --> 01:34:03,179
Thanks.

825
01:34:03,215 --> 01:34:07,604
I'm getting all emotional.
I might just give you big wet kiss.

826
01:34:13,854 --> 01:34:17,189
I'll do with minimal
casualties to indigenous.

827
01:34:17,829 --> 01:34:20,794
I'll drive them out with gas first.

828
01:34:21,717 --> 01:34:24,122
It'll be humane.

829
01:34:24,925 --> 01:34:27,531
More or less.

830
01:34:27,612 --> 01:34:30,657
Alright, let's pull the trigger.

831
01:34:37,875 --> 01:34:40,038
This is how it's done.

832
01:34:42,044 --> 01:34:45,738
When people are sitting on shit you want,

833
01:34:45,771 --> 01:34:49,102
you make them your enemy,
then you justify taking it.

834
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:51,986
Quatrich just rolled in the gunships.

835
01:34:52,021 --> 01:34:54,872
He's gonna hit Hometree.
- My God.

836
01:35:00,805 --> 01:35:03,933
Dr. Augustine, you cannot be up here!

837
01:35:03,967 --> 01:35:04,901
Back off!

838
01:35:04,937 --> 01:35:07,385
Parker, wait, stop,

839
01:35:07,421 --> 01:35:09,792
These are people
you're about to...

840
01:35:09,826 --> 01:35:13,554
They're fly bitten savages
that live in a tree.

841
01:35:13,589 --> 01:35:15,203
Alright, look around.

842
01:35:15,238 --> 01:35:17,444
I don't know about you
but I see a lot of trees.

843
01:35:17,477 --> 01:35:19,327
They can move.

844
01:35:19,367 --> 01:35:21,572
Can you guys just please...
- There are families in there.

845
01:35:22,052 --> 01:35:24,818
There are children, babies...
Are you gonna kill children?

846
01:35:24,853 --> 01:35:27,586
You don't want that kind
of blood on your hands, believe me.

847
01:35:29,592 --> 01:35:31,755
Let me try to talk them out.

848
01:35:31,795 --> 01:35:34,160
They trust me.

849
01:35:36,686 --> 01:35:38,690
Calibrate the path.
We're going in right now.

850
01:35:38,892 --> 01:35:40,777
<i> Calibrating 3 and 4</i>

851
01:35:41,414 --> 01:35:44,316
<i>Run sequence
-Initiating 30 seconds</i>

852
01:35:48,513 --> 01:35:50,283
Listen to me,
you've got one hour.

853
01:35:50,317 --> 01:35:52,723
Unless you want your girlfriend in
there when the axe comes down

854
01:35:52,759 --> 01:35:56,533
you get them to evacuate.
One hour.

855
01:36:23,391 --> 01:36:25,396
Tell them they're gonna
be here soon.

856
01:36:27,401 --> 01:36:29,726
You have to leave,
or you're gonna die.

857
01:36:29,762 --> 01:36:32,693
Are you certain of this?

858
01:36:35,498 --> 01:36:37,905
They sent me here...

859
01:36:37,945 --> 01:36:40,194
to learn your ways.

860
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:44,559
So one day I could bring this message,
and that you would believe it.

861
01:36:46,443 --> 01:36:48,412
What are you saying Jake?

862
01:36:48,447 --> 01:36:51,134
You knew this would happen?

863
01:36:52,977 --> 01:36:54,825
Yes.

864
01:36:54,862 --> 01:36:57,791
At first, it was just orders.

865
01:36:58,670 --> 01:37:00,996
And then, everything changed.

866
01:37:01,032 --> 01:37:03,446
I fell in love.

867
01:37:03,483 --> 01:37:06,249
I fell in love with the forest.

868
01:37:06,283 --> 01:37:09,015
With the Omaticaya people.

869
01:37:09,815 --> 01:37:11,819
With you.

870
01:37:14,386 --> 01:37:17,512
I trusted you.
- Trust me now, please.

871
01:37:24,529 --> 01:37:26,994
You will never be
one of the people!

872
01:37:27,030 --> 01:37:29,461
He tried to stop them!

873
01:37:39,883 --> 01:37:43,250
You have to go,
they are coming!

874
01:38:19,573 --> 01:38:21,978
Run to the forest!
- They're coming!

875
01:38:23,463 --> 01:38:25,471
They want to destroy this place.

876
01:38:25,505 --> 01:38:27,592
Neytiri, you must go now.

877
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:33,684
Get to the forest!
Run!

878
01:38:35,608 --> 01:38:37,259
Run!

879
01:38:59,262 --> 01:39:01,632
Goddamn it, run!

880
01:39:09,045 --> 01:39:11,851
That is one big damn tree.

881
01:39:18,906 --> 01:39:20,756
Well, well, well ...

882
01:39:20,791 --> 01:39:23,878
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

883
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,289
Alright people, let's get this done.

884
01:39:27,324 --> 01:39:29,892
I want every gas round you
got right in the front door.

885
01:39:29,933 --> 01:39:32,535
Roger, CS-40's going hot.

886
01:39:32,572 --> 01:39:34,622
Fire.
- Firing.

887
01:39:45,366 --> 01:39:47,371
Bingo, good shooting ace.

888
01:39:54,987 --> 01:39:56,990
Sir, they've opened fire.

889
01:39:58,594 --> 01:40:01,160
You got to be kidding me.

890
01:40:12,909 --> 01:40:15,479
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

891
01:40:15,514 --> 01:40:18,520
Let's turn up the heat.
Switch incendiaries.

892
01:40:20,005 --> 01:40:22,009
Fire.

893
01:40:43,978 --> 01:40:46,704
And that's how you
scatter the roaches.

894
01:40:49,992 --> 01:40:51,996
Neytiri...

895
01:41:00,093 --> 01:41:02,740
We gotta move, he's gonna
blow the columns!

896
01:41:22,544 --> 01:41:24,549
Moat, no!

897
01:41:24,590 --> 01:41:27,073
If you are one of us...

898
01:41:27,597 --> 01:41:29,760
Help us.

899
01:41:36,816 --> 01:41:38,982
All call signs switch missiles.

900
01:41:38,786 --> 01:41:41,551
<i>Give me HE to the
base of the West columns.</i>

901
01:41:42,994 --> 01:41:44,877
This way!

902
01:41:50,088 --> 01:41:53,094
Yeah baby, get some!

903
01:41:55,017 --> 01:41:57,502
Bring it down.

904
01:42:03,594 --> 01:42:05,598
Come on Grace, move!

905
01:42:07,842 --> 01:42:09,846
Get down!

906
01:42:21,067 --> 01:42:23,437
Screw this.

907
01:42:23,472 --> 01:42:25,120
What the hell are you doing?

908
01:42:25,155 --> 01:42:28,562
I didn't sign up for this shit!

909
01:43:22,548 --> 01:43:24,471
Go! Go! Go!

910
01:45:06,269 --> 01:45:08,353
Good work people.

911
01:45:08,392 --> 01:45:10,477
First round's on me tonight.

912
01:45:10,512 --> 01:45:12,280
Let's boogie.

913
01:46:06,866 --> 01:46:08,871
Neytiri!

914
01:46:18,208 --> 01:46:20,954
I'm sorry.

915
01:46:20,989 --> 01:46:23,700
Get away!

916
01:46:24,741 --> 01:46:27,145
Get away from here!

917
01:46:28,227 --> 01:46:31,154
Never come back!

918
01:46:47,346 --> 01:46:49,307
Pull the plug.

919
01:46:49,343 --> 01:46:51,273
You can't do that!

920
01:47:10,429 --> 01:47:13,395
<i>I was a warrior who
dreamed he could bring peace.</i>

921
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:17,182
<i>Sooner or lather though...</i>

922
01:47:17,217 --> 01:47:19,648
<i>You always have to wake up.</i>

923
01:47:35,359 --> 01:47:38,084
You murderers!

924
01:48:24,733 --> 01:48:27,140
What's going on brother?
Long time no see.

925
01:48:29,383 --> 01:48:32,349
Personally I don't feel these
tree hugging traitors deserve steak.

926
01:48:32,388 --> 01:48:35,275
They got steak?
That's bullshit. Let me see that.

927
01:48:36,677 --> 01:48:39,161
Yeah, you know what that is.
Down.

928
01:48:39,201 --> 01:48:41,888
Trudy
- All the way down.

929
01:48:45,092 --> 01:48:47,899
Max!

930
01:48:56,315 --> 01:48:58,399
Trudy, fire up the ship.

931
01:48:59,441 --> 01:49:00,924
Here.

932
01:49:12,546 --> 01:49:14,671
Clear, come on.

933
01:49:14,706 --> 01:49:15,672
Here you go.

934
01:49:30,862 --> 01:49:32,466
Max, stay here.

935
01:49:32,505 --> 01:49:34,664
I need someone on
the inside I can trust.

936
01:49:34,694 --> 01:49:36,714
Okay, go.

937
01:49:49,619 --> 01:49:51,542
Clear.

938
01:49:52,824 --> 01:49:54,311
Come on baby.

939
01:49:54,348 --> 01:49:57,435
Colonel, sir.
I got a situation here.

940
01:50:00,759 --> 01:50:04,446
It's sector 1-6
Unauthorized engine start.

941
01:50:10,939 --> 01:50:13,345
Come on!

942
01:50:14,066 --> 01:50:16,551
Mask on!

943
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:23,203
I'm taking fire, let's go!

944
01:50:44,725 --> 01:50:46,850
Colonel!

945
01:50:58,752 --> 01:51:00,722
Crap.

946
01:51:00,757 --> 01:51:03,442
Everybody all right back there?
- Yeah baby.

947
01:51:03,482 --> 01:51:05,445
Norm, you good?
- Yeah.

948
01:51:06,487 --> 01:51:09,293
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

949
01:51:09,328 --> 01:51:11,942
Grace is hit.
- What?

950
01:51:11,979 --> 01:51:14,582
Get the trauma kit.
Keep the pressure on Grace.

951
01:51:14,617 --> 01:51:17,190
Trauma kit's forward,
on the bulk head.

952
01:51:17,225 --> 01:51:19,994
Hang on Grace.
- Doesn't matter.

953
01:51:20,597 --> 01:51:23,401
It's fine.

954
01:51:25,082 --> 01:51:28,290
Good to go?
- Take it up.

955
01:51:28,330 --> 01:51:30,334
Hold on.

956
01:51:34,943 --> 01:51:36,946
You're clear!

957
01:51:44,321 --> 01:51:47,367
Keep going north,
get us deep into the mountains.

958
01:51:47,402 --> 01:51:49,653
Copy that.

959
01:51:55,544 --> 01:51:57,266
Norm, you all good up there?

960
01:51:57,302 --> 01:51:59,792
<i>Yup, still here.</i>

961
01:52:00,874 --> 01:52:03,177
At least they can't
track us up here.

962
01:52:03,212 --> 01:52:05,448
Not this far into the vortex.

963
01:52:05,483 --> 01:52:07,566
It's strongest at the
Tree of Souls, right?

964
01:52:07,608 --> 01:52:09,950
Yeah.
- Good.

965
01:52:09,988 --> 01:52:12,295
Cause that's where we're going.

966
01:52:19,979 --> 01:52:20,882
Ouch!

967
01:52:24,919 --> 01:52:27,205
You big baby.

968
01:52:27,244 --> 01:52:29,414
Are we moving?

969
01:52:29,448 --> 01:52:31,854
I'm gonna get you
some help Grace.

970
01:52:32,255 --> 01:52:35,460
I'm a scientist, remember?

971
01:52:35,495 --> 01:52:38,511
I don't believe in fairy tales.

972
01:52:38,545 --> 01:52:42,755
The people can help you,
I know it.

973
01:52:44,357 --> 01:52:47,364
Why would they help us?

974
01:53:02,313 --> 01:53:05,999
<i>The people say,
Eywa will provide.</i>

975
01:53:07,282 --> 01:53:10,889
<i>But no home,
no hope...</i>

976
01:53:10,929 --> 01:53:13,695
<i>There was only one
place they could go.</i>

977
01:53:27,241 --> 01:53:31,248
Link's running.
What's the plan here Jake?

978
01:53:31,284 --> 01:53:33,733
There's no plan.

979
01:53:33,775 --> 01:53:36,138
Tsu'Tey is the chief now.

980
01:53:36,178 --> 01:53:38,943
He's not gonna let
you near that place.

981
01:53:38,984 --> 01:53:41,469
I've got to try.

982
01:53:43,472 --> 01:53:45,475
Launching.

983
01:54:06,197 --> 01:54:08,200
<i>Outcast...</i>

984
01:54:08,241 --> 01:54:10,605
<i>Betrayer...</i>

985
01:54:10,647 --> 01:54:12,609
<i>Alien...</i>

986
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:16,336
<i>I was in the place,
the eye does not see.</i>

987
01:54:27,438 --> 01:54:29,702
<i>I needed their help.</i>

988
01:54:29,738 --> 01:54:31,931
<i>and they needed mine.</i>

989
01:54:31,966 --> 01:54:34,252
<i>But to ever face them again...</i>

990
01:54:34,291 --> 01:54:37,056
<i>I was gonna have to take
it to a whole new level.</i>

991
01:54:45,072 --> 01:54:48,520
<i>Sometimes your whole life
boils down to one insane move.</i>

992
01:54:51,204 --> 01:54:53,489
There's something we gotta do.

993
01:54:53,528 --> 01:54:56,213
You're not going to like it.

994
01:55:05,433 --> 01:55:09,238
<i>The way I had it figured,
Turok is the baddest cat in the sky.</i>

995
01:55:09,273 --> 01:55:11,525
<i>Nothing attacks him.</i>

996
01:55:11,564 --> 01:55:13,212
Easy boy.

997
01:55:13,166 --> 01:55:15,768
<i>So why would he ever look up?</i>

998
01:55:15,803 --> 01:55:18,370
<i>That was just a theory.</i>

999
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:11,924
I see you.

1000
01:57:14,007 --> 01:57:16,930
I see you.

1001
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:26,942
I was afraid Jake.

1002
01:57:26,979 --> 01:57:29,548
For my people.

1003
01:57:31,551 --> 01:57:34,434
I'm not any more.

1004
01:57:54,782 --> 01:57:57,151
You are the leader.

1005
01:57:57,185 --> 01:57:59,589
And a great warrior.

1006
01:58:00,068 --> 01:58:02,392
I can't do this without you.

1007
01:58:08,879 --> 01:58:11,284
Toruk Makto.

1008
01:58:18,493 --> 01:58:21,417
I will fly with you.

1009
01:58:23,541 --> 01:58:26,344
My friend is dying.

1010
01:58:27,625 --> 01:58:29,829
Grace is dying.

1011
01:58:31,150 --> 01:58:33,834
I beg the help of Eywa.

1012
01:58:44,849 --> 01:58:47,052
Look where we are Grace.

1013
01:58:54,060 --> 01:58:57,065
I need to take some samples.

1014
01:59:19,694 --> 01:59:23,700
Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is...

1015
01:59:24,823 --> 01:59:27,306
In this body.

1016
01:59:28,908 --> 01:59:30,591
Is that possible.

1017
01:59:30,630 --> 01:59:35,717
She must pass through the
eye of Eywa, and return.

1018
01:59:36,438 --> 01:59:38,599
But Jake Sully...

1019
01:59:38,641 --> 01:59:41,404
She is very weak.

1020
01:59:42,046 --> 01:59:45,410
Hold on Grace.
They're gonna fix you up.

1021
02:00:41,807 --> 02:00:43,809
Jake...

1022
02:00:44,530 --> 02:00:46,613
Grace...

1023
02:00:47,614 --> 02:00:49,896
I'm with her Jake.

1024
02:00:51,499 --> 02:00:54,544
She's real.

1025
02:00:55,615 --> 02:00:57,470
Grace.

1026
02:00:57,776 --> 02:00:58,417
Grace.

1027
02:00:59,965 --> 02:01:01,200
What's happening?

1028
02:01:08,944 --> 02:01:09,486
Grace.

1029
02:01:10,645 --> 02:01:12,648
Grace...

1030
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:16,052
What's happening?

1031
02:01:21,939 --> 02:01:24,063
Did it work?

1032
02:01:28,749 --> 02:01:30,992
Her wounds were too great.

1033
02:01:31,552 --> 02:01:33,276
It was not enough time.

1034
02:01:34,476 --> 02:01:36,600
She is with Eywa now.

1035
02:02:10,003 --> 02:02:13,128
With your permission,
I will speak now.

1036
02:02:15,131 --> 02:02:17,454
You would honor me
by translating.

1037
02:02:24,664 --> 02:02:26,946
The sky people have
sent us a message...

1038
02:02:30,351 --> 02:02:32,834
That they can take
whatever they want.

1039
02:02:34,556 --> 02:02:36,841
And no one can stop them.

1040
02:02:39,965 --> 02:02:42,448
But we will send them a message.

1041
02:02:44,291 --> 02:02:46,693
You ride out as fast as
the wind can carry you.

1042
02:02:49,377 --> 02:02:51,900
We tell the other clans to come.

1043
02:02:55,586 --> 02:02:58,068
You tell that Turok Makto
calls to them.

1044
02:03:00,070 --> 02:03:01,993
You fly now!

1045
02:03:02,034 --> 02:03:03,956
With me!

1046
02:03:03,995 --> 02:03:07,000
My brothers, sisters...

1047
02:03:07,601 --> 02:03:10,083
And we will show the sky people.

1048
02:03:10,604 --> 02:03:13,130
That they can not take
whatever they want!

1049
02:03:14,009 --> 02:03:18,895
And that this,
this is our land!

1050
02:04:30,513 --> 02:04:32,997
<i>We rode out to the four winds...</i>

1051
02:04:34,839 --> 02:04:37,322
<i>To the horse clans of the plain...</i>

1052
02:04:41,529 --> 02:04:44,051
<i>To the Ikran people of
the eastern sea.</i>

1053
02:04:44,932 --> 02:04:47,936
<i>When Turok Makto
called them, they came.</i>

1054
02:05:28,910 --> 02:05:34,517
Everyone on this base, everyone of you is
fighting for survival, and that's a fact.

1055
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:39,004
There's aboriginal horde out there,
massing for an attack.

1056
02:05:42,288 --> 02:05:44,692
These orbital images tell me,

1057
02:05:44,931 --> 02:05:48,136
that the hostiles numbers have
gone from few hundred

1058
02:05:48,216 --> 02:05:51,021
to well over two
thousand in one day.

1059
02:05:51,342 --> 02:05:53,824
And more are pouring in.

1060
02:05:55,747 --> 02:05:58,310
In a weeks time, there
could be 20.000 of them.

1061
02:05:59,231 --> 02:06:02,317
At that point they will
overrun our perimeter.

1062
02:06:02,436 --> 02:06:04,959
That's not gonna happen.

1063
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:08,725
Our only security lies in
preemptive attack.

1064
02:06:09,125 --> 02:06:11,649
We will fight terror
with terror.

1065
02:06:15,854 --> 02:06:20,809
Now the hostiles believe that this
mountain stronghold of theirs is protected

1066
02:06:21,038 --> 02:06:24,867
by their Deity.

1067
02:06:25,267 --> 02:06:27,068
And when we destroy it...

1068
02:06:27,389 --> 02:06:30,193
We will blast a crater in their
racial memory so deep

1069
02:06:30,275 --> 02:06:33,157
that hey won't come within a 1000
clicks of this place ever again.

1070
02:06:33,397 --> 02:06:36,883
And that too, is a fact.

1071
02:06:49,099 --> 02:06:52,543
<i>Jake it's crazy here, full mobilization.
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.</i>

1072
02:06:52,584 --> 02:06:55,989
<i>They got these huge
palettes of mine explosives</i>

1073
02:06:56,108 --> 02:06:58,231
<i>for some shock
and awe campaign.</i>

1074
02:06:58,311 --> 02:07:00,395
Freakin daisy cutters.

1075
02:07:01,834 --> 02:07:04,398
<i>Quaritch has taken over, he's
rolling them and there's no stopping him.</i>

1076
02:07:04,439 --> 02:07:06,523
When?
- 06:00 tomorrow.

1077
02:07:06,643 --> 02:07:08,725
<i>I got to go.</i>

1078
02:07:10,727 --> 02:07:13,052
We're screwed.

1079
02:07:13,611 --> 02:07:17,336
And I was hoping for some sort of tactical
plan that didn't envolve martyrdom.

1080
02:07:19,621 --> 02:07:22,424
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

1081
02:07:25,948 --> 02:07:27,870
I have 15 clans out there.

1082
02:07:28,832 --> 02:07:30,754
That's over 2000 warriors.

1083
02:07:32,357 --> 02:07:33,376
We know these mountains.

1084
02:07:33,757 --> 02:07:35,223
We fly them,
You fly them.

1085
02:07:36,282 --> 02:07:37,644
They don't.

1086
02:07:37,963 --> 02:07:41,651
Their instruments won't work up here.
Missile tracking, won't work.

1087
02:07:42,450 --> 02:07:45,574
They'll have to fire a line of sight.
If they bring the fight to us...

1088
02:07:46,375 --> 02:07:48,697
then we have the
home field advantage.

1089
02:07:50,179 --> 02:07:53,264
You know he's gonna commit
that bomber staight to the Tree of Souls.

1090
02:07:53,784 --> 02:07:54,866
I know.

1091
02:07:54,988 --> 02:07:57,271
If they get to it, it's over.

1092
02:07:57,591 --> 02:08:01,396
That's their direct line to
Eywa, their ancestors.

1093
02:08:01,432 --> 02:08:03,563
It'll destroy them.

1094
02:08:03,598 --> 02:08:06,082
Then I guess we better stop them.

1095
02:08:21,703 --> 02:08:24,024
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

1096
02:08:26,430 --> 02:08:28,752
But if you're there...

1097
02:08:29,716 --> 02:08:32,037
I need to give you a heads up.

1098
02:08:33,719 --> 02:08:35,641
If Grace is with you...

1099
02:08:36,643 --> 02:08:39,167
Look into her memories.

1100
02:08:39,446 --> 02:08:41,971
See the world we come from.

1101
02:08:42,650 --> 02:08:44,852
There's no green there.

1102
02:08:45,976 --> 02:08:48,258
They killed their mother.

1103
02:08:48,780 --> 02:08:51,062
And they're gonna
do the same here.

1104
02:08:52,862 --> 02:08:55,349
More sky people are gonna come.

1105
02:08:55,588 --> 02:08:58,072
They're gonna come like
rain that never ends.

1106
02:08:59,753 --> 02:09:02,077
Unless we stop them.

1107
02:09:05,762 --> 02:09:08,086
You chose me for something.

1108
02:09:08,806 --> 02:09:10,969
I will stand and fight.

1109
02:09:11,690 --> 02:09:13,773
You know I will.

1110
02:09:15,774 --> 02:09:18,099
But I need a little help here.

1111
02:09:24,187 --> 02:09:27,310
Our Great Mother does
not take sides Jake.

1112
02:09:29,113 --> 02:09:32,197
She protects only the
balance of life.

1113
02:09:44,213 --> 02:09:46,537
It was worth a try.

1114
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,685
<i>This is group leader,
we're entering the flux vortex.</i>

1115
02:10:38,005 --> 02:10:40,009
<i>Switch to manual flight mode.</i>

1116
02:11:16,459 --> 02:11:18,539
This is papa dragon.

1117
02:11:18,581 --> 02:11:21,665
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

1118
02:11:28,992 --> 02:11:30,355
Suit team, go.

1119
02:11:30,595 --> 02:11:32,880
<i>Alright ladies, let's bring the pain.</i>

1120
02:12:06,243 --> 02:12:08,248
Eyes up, check that overhead.

1121
02:12:09,328 --> 02:12:11,452
Watch those thermal scans.

1122
02:12:11,731 --> 02:12:13,854
<i>All call signs,
papa has lead.</i>

1123
02:12:13,890 --> 02:12:15,937
<i>Pushing the target.</i>

1124
02:12:16,018 --> 02:12:18,139
<i>Escorts, be close on my shuttle.</i>

1125
02:12:22,545 --> 02:12:24,548
We are gonna lose
some paint in here.

1126
02:12:25,950 --> 02:12:27,952
<i>Gun crews keep
your head on a swivel.</i>

1127
02:12:28,754 --> 02:12:32,279
<i>Make no mistake people,
they're out there.</i>

1128
02:12:33,241 --> 02:12:36,565
Alright people, target in sight.
Range four clicks.

1129
02:12:37,246 --> 02:12:39,769
Valkirye 1-6, get your payload ready.

1130
02:12:42,173 --> 02:12:44,175
Push to the ramp!

1131
02:12:57,913 --> 02:13:00,998
Hold position, we got
movement out there.

1132
02:13:01,037 --> 02:13:02,799
<i>Hold position.</i>

1133
02:13:09,809 --> 02:13:12,414
Sir, ground has movement.

1134
02:13:14,335 --> 02:13:16,899
Fire in line!
- Targets closing.

1135
02:13:16,939 --> 02:13:18,821
Range 400 meters.

1136
02:13:19,221 --> 02:13:21,826
Can't you clean it up?
- No sir, it's the flux.

1137
02:13:50,264 --> 02:13:52,466
Brother, I'm gonna punch
a hole, you follow me through.

1138
02:14:34,724 --> 02:14:37,407
All aircrafts, weapons free.

1139
02:14:38,610 --> 02:14:40,532
Brake right, come around.

1140
02:14:52,466 --> 02:14:54,750
Break formation.
Engage all hostiles.

1141
02:15:42,814 --> 02:15:45,097
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1142
02:15:55,512 --> 02:15:57,514
Jake, Jake you copy?

1143
02:15:57,835 --> 02:16:00,037
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

1144
02:16:00,638 --> 02:16:02,241
Copy, get out of there.

1145
02:16:06,545 --> 02:16:08,570
That's him, get after him!

1146
02:16:24,869 --> 02:16:26,293
Take him out!

1147
02:16:30,441 --> 02:16:31,494
Oops.

1148
02:16:35,004 --> 02:16:37,008
Light her up!

1149
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:49,104
You're not the only
one with a gun bitch.

1150
02:16:49,424 --> 02:16:51,105
Keep her in your sights!

1151
02:16:57,834 --> 02:16:59,118
That's it!

1152
02:18:34,525 --> 02:18:37,047
Rogue 1 is hit!
I'm going in!

1153
02:18:37,728 --> 02:18:39,971
Sorry Jake.

1154
02:18:47,862 --> 02:18:49,865
Fire.

1155
02:19:07,089 --> 02:19:09,692
Tsu'Tey, brother do you read?

1156
02:19:12,376 --> 02:19:14,379
Rogue 1, you copy?

1157
02:19:16,021 --> 02:19:17,501
Trudy?

1158
02:19:28,236 --> 02:19:32,123
Time to target, 2 minutes.
- Valkyrie 1-6, you are clear in hot.

1159
02:19:32,242 --> 02:19:34,725
Copy dragon, we are
starting our bomb run.

1160
02:19:40,253 --> 02:19:42,856
Fire number one!

1161
02:19:42,937 --> 02:19:44,739
Number one armed!

1162
02:19:45,660 --> 02:19:46,863
Jake!

1163
02:19:48,624 --> 02:19:50,628
I read you!

1164
02:19:58,959 --> 02:20:01,041
<i>Neytiri.</i>

1165
02:20:01,561 --> 02:20:03,765
They are very close,
there are many.

1166
02:20:05,447 --> 02:20:07,534
Do not attack.

1167
02:20:07,570 --> 02:20:09,052
<i>Do you read me Neytiri?</i>

1168
02:20:11,975 --> 02:20:13,458
Do not attack!

1169
02:20:13,697 --> 02:20:16,982
<i>Fall back now, get out of there.
That's an order!</i>

1170
02:20:24,993 --> 02:20:26,796
Neytiri!

1171
02:20:28,397 --> 02:20:29,879
<i>I've got movement.</i>

1172
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:31,602
Hold position.

1173
02:20:32,002 --> 02:20:34,571
Something's coming.

1174
02:20:34,607 --> 02:20:36,607
We've got movement,
200 meters.

1175
02:20:36,643 --> 02:20:38,491
Get ready.

1176
02:21:01,922 --> 02:21:03,925
Get out of here!

1177
02:21:05,127 --> 02:21:07,132
Fall back!

1178
02:21:16,382 --> 02:21:17,463
Jake!

1179
02:21:18,064 --> 02:21:20,268
Eywa has heard you.

1180
02:21:26,074 --> 02:21:28,278
Eywa has heard you!

1181
02:22:18,464 --> 02:22:21,147
Sir, all escorts are
down or falling back.

1182
02:22:21,189 --> 02:22:23,352
Let's get this done.

1183
02:22:23,553 --> 02:22:26,636
<i>Valkirye 1-6, this is dragon,
press the target.</i>

1184
02:22:27,158 --> 02:22:30,162
Copy, pressing the target.
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1185
02:22:50,308 --> 02:22:52,791
On my mark,
2, 1, mark.

1186
02:22:52,832 --> 02:22:55,796
Drop!

1187
02:23:47,264 --> 02:23:49,268
It's Sully!

1188
02:24:02,285 --> 02:24:04,688
Masks on!
- Breach alarm!

1189
02:26:41,418 --> 02:26:43,981
Come on, come to papa.

1190
02:27:11,218 --> 02:27:13,541
Give it up Quaritch.

1191
02:27:15,945 --> 02:27:17,867
It's all over.

1192
02:27:18,748 --> 02:27:20,950
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

1193
02:27:21,232 --> 02:27:23,474
I kinda hoped you'd say that.

1194
02:28:19,710 --> 02:28:21,713
Come on!

1195
02:28:37,132 --> 02:28:41,139
Sully, how does it feel to
betray your own race?

1196
02:28:45,385 --> 02:28:47,867
You think you're
one of them?

1197
02:28:48,788 --> 02:28:51,473
Time to wake up.

1198
02:30:35,012 --> 02:30:37,014
Jake!

1199
02:30:49,511 --> 02:30:51,513
Jake...

1200
02:31:08,657 --> 02:31:10,659
Jake...

1201
02:31:26,082 --> 02:31:28,203
Jake! My Jake!

1202
02:32:09,739 --> 02:32:12,262
I see you.

1203
02:32:16,749 --> 02:32:19,432
I see you.

1204
02:32:29,565 --> 02:32:32,690
<i>The aliens went back
to their dying world.</i>

1205
02:32:34,693 --> 02:32:38,176
<i>Only a few were chosen to stay.</i>

1206
02:32:49,793 --> 02:32:53,318
<i>The time of Great Sorrow was ending.</i>

1207
02:32:54,399 --> 02:32:57,483
<i>Toruk Makto was no longer needed.</i>

1208
02:33:09,339 --> 02:33:14,226
<i>Well, I guess this is
my last video log.</i>

1209
02:33:15,146 --> 02:33:17,951
<i>Whatever happens tonight...</i>

1210
02:33:17,986 --> 02:33:20,242
<i>Either way, I'm not gonna</i>

1211
02:33:20,242 --> 02:33:24,359
<i>be coming back to this place.</i>

1212
02:33:26,361 --> 02:33:28,444
<i>Well I guess I better go.</i>

1213
02:33:31,169 --> 02:33:34,132
<i>I don't want to be late
for my own party.</i>

1214
02:33:37,537 --> 02:33:40,380
<i>It's my birthday after all.</i>

1215
02:33:42,463 --> 02:33:44,865
<i>This is Jake Sully signing off.</i>

1216
