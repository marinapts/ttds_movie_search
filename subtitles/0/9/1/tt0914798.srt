1
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,709
- Move!
- Move it!

2
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,795
Move!

3
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,115
Move!

4
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,435
Now!

5
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,007
It's me
home.

6
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,878
- Bye, Bruno!
- Bye, Bruno!

7
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,399
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Mum, what's going on?

8
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,390
- We're celebrating.
- Celebrating?

9
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,351
Your father's been given a promotion.

10
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,278
- That means a better job.
- I know what promotion is.

11
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,151
So we're having a little party
to celebrate.

12
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,475
He's still going to be a soldier though,
isn't he?

13
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,229
Yes, my lamb.
Yes, just a more important one now.

14
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,037
There's some even more exciting news,

15
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,436
but I think Dad wanted
to tell you about that himself.

16
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,236
- Moving? Where to?
- To the countryside.

17
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,032
That's miles away.
What about Karl and Leon and Martin?

18
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,513
Sweetheart, I know it's hard,

19
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,030
but we're all having to say goodbye
to our friends for the time being.

20
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,548
Anyway, we'll make new ones
where we're going. Won't we?

21
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,751
Of course you are.
You'll make lots of new friends.

22
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,475
Bruno, you can have your friends
around in the morning before we go.

23
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,990
Think of it as an adventure,
like in one of your books.

24
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,029
But this is the best house ever.

25
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,149
Well, you never know. The house
we're going to might be even better.

26
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,236
Dad says it's got a garden.

27
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,999
Look, the thing is, Bruno,
the thing about being a soldier,

28
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,112
is that life is not so much about choice,
it's more about duty,

29
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,197
so if your country needs
you to go somewhere, you go.

30
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,437
Now, of course, going somewhere else
is much easier

31
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,234
when you know that your family
are so delighted to go with you.

32
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,593
Bruno! You're getting bigger
every time I see you.

33
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,710
It's only been a week, Nathalie.

34
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,638
Well, perhaps it's me
that's getting smaller.

35
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,873
So, you two,

36
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,753
well, what do you think of all this?
Moving out of Berlin?

37
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,871
Well, Mummy and Daddy say
it's a good thing,

38
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,831
so I suppose it must be.

39
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,836
Children, be angels, will you?
Pass some food around.

40
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,838
<i>Heil</i> Hitler!

41
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,432
Congratulations.

42
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,910
- Doesn't he look wonderful?
- Absolutely.

43
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,955
I'm so proud of you, my boy.

44
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,713
Oh, dear. I sometimes wonder
if this is all down to me,

45
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,878
making you those costumes
for your little plays when you were tiny.

46
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,595
- You used to adore all that dressing up.
- Nathalie...

47
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,712
Does it still make you feel special,
Ralf dear?

48
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,113
The uniform and what it stands for?

49
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,789
Mother, it's a party.
Let's not spoil things.

50
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,236
Me, spoil things?

51
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,592
You should be careful.

52
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,712
Airing your views so publicly
could land you in trouble.

53
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,193
You know that.

54
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,237
So, how long are we losing you for,
my boy?

55
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,550
- Until the war is won, I would think.
- Well, not so long then.

56
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,508
Bruno!

57
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,911
All right, Bruno. Time to say goodbye.

58
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,231
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye!

59
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,509
"Time has come for me to sleep
Lord, I thank Thee for Thy keep

60
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,870
"Watch this night well over me
And teach me, Lord, to trust in Thee

61
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,276
"Care for children, sick and poor
Grant them, Lord, Thy blessing more

62
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,676
"And this I pray in Jesus' name
Care for my family just the same"

63
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,755
Amen.

64
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,599
Children, look. Look! Our new home.

65
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,149
I have some business to take care of.
I'll see you shortly.

66
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,236
Well, what do we think?

67
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,036
Come on. It's lovely.

68
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,436
You two choose your rooms.
I'll have Maria come

69
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,832
and help you unpack.

70
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,830
What do you think of it, Maria?
The new house.

71
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,671
It's not for me to say.

72
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,678
But it won't feel like home
until we make it feel like home, will it?

73
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,478
Is he already up?

74
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,919
Who was that?

75
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,520
One of your father's soldiers,
I suppose.

76
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,519
- He looked very serious.
- Well, they are, aren't they?

77
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,473
- Why are we whispering?
- I don't know.

78
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,075
- And play with who?
- The children over on the farm.

79
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,078
Farm? I didn't see a farm.
And that one, too.

80
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,395
You can only see it from my room.

81
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,677
And there are some children there?

82
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,473
- Yes, quite a few.
- That's good.

83
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,479
- So, I'll be able to play with them.
- I don't see why not.

84
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,308
I'll wait a little bit,
just to see what they're like,

85
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,557
- because they look a bit strange.
- The children do?

86
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,112
- Well, and the farmers.
- What sort of strange?

87
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,073
I'm sorry.

88
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,439
Vegetables.

89
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,869
There.

90
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,718
Bruno, have you unpacked everything?

91
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,309
Because I think you should
go back upstairs and finish off.

92
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,998
Thank you, ma'am.

93
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,149
Bruno.

94
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,790
- I told you they were strange.
- Who?

95
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,673
The farmers. They wear pyjamas.

96
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,079
Bruno, I was just
coming to look for you.

97
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,436
Well, thank you for that.
That was extremely useful.

98
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,870
- I'll be over to see you later.
- Of course, <i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

99
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,308
Come in.

100
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,398
Sit down, sit down.

101
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,431
Well, what do you think?

102
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,628
Oh, dear.

103
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,912
I want to go home.

104
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,388
You are home, Bruno.
Home is where the family is.

105
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,032
Isn't that right?

106
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,033
Bruno, you have to at least
give the place a chance.

107
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,718
I promise you,
it won't be long before you...

108
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,231
Why do the farmers wear pyjamas?
I can see them from my window.

109
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,072
The thing is, Bruno, those people...

110
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,752
Well, you see,
they're not really people at all.

111
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,433
Bruno, who told you it was a farm?

112
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,755
- Was it Maria?
- No.

113
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,677
It is a farm, isn't it?

114
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,275
Yes.

115
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,829
Is it to do with your new job?

116
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,553
All you need to know
about my work here, Bruno,

117
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,275
is that it's very important
to our country and to you.

118
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,349
We're working very hard
to make this world a better place

119
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,628
for you to grow up in.

120
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,638
But you're not a farmer.
You're a soldier.

121
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,831
Bruno, can you come and help me
finish sorting out in the kitchen?

122
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,429
I can still play with them, though?
The children.

123
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,589
I don't think so, Bruno. No.

124
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,030
Like you say, they're a bit strange.
A bit...

125
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,991
Well, they're different.

126
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,109
Don't worry, my darling.
We'll find you some new friends,

127
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,799
but they won't be the ones
from the farm.

128
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,309
Ralf, you promised.

129
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,715
- You said it was miles away.
- It is.

130
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,149
How was I to know he could see it
from the bedroom window?

131
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,714
There was one of them in our kitchen.

132
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,999
- Master Bruno, how are you today?
- Fed up.

133
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,193
You said the same thing
every day for two whole weeks.

134
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,152
- It's true.
- Well, you should be out playing.

135
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,272
- Playing with who?
- I don't know. Gretel?

136
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,236
- Well, you can make your own fun.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

137
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,474
One thing's for sure,

138
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,195
sitting around being miserable
won't make things any happier.

139
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,033
- Bruno, what are you doing?
- Exploring!

140
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,197
No! No, not in the back.
I told you, it's out of bounds.

141
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,118
- Explore at the front.
- But I've explored it all.

142
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,993
- Well, find something else to do.
- Like what?

143
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,837
Come back in now,
and we'll think of something.

144
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,071
So, children,
what are you doing today?

145
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,315
- Same as yesterday.
- And what was that?

146
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,591
- Same as the day before.
- Except you went exploring.

147
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,194
- I like exploring.
- Where did you go?

148
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,915
I wanted to look in the back garden,
but Mum wouldn't let me.

149
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,592
The back garden?

150
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,838
Well, God forbid.

151
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,836
I expect you'll be missing
those friends of yours.

152
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,472
I even miss school.

153
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,198
Well, I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

154
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,798
Anyway, you won't be missing it
for long.

155
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,230
- Really?
- I've arranged a tutor for you both.

156
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,673
A <i>Herr</i> Liszt
will be visiting twice a week.

157
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,073
So we're not going to school?

158
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,751
School's coming here?

159
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,155
On an old bicycle, I gather.

160
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,790
It's a bird without the...

161
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,156
Good morning, little man.
And how are you this morning?

162
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,838
- Can I ask you a favour?
- Well, you can ask.

163
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,674
Are there any spare tyres around?

164
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,109
An old one
from one of the trucks or something?

165
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,913
Well, the only spare tyre
I've seen around here

166
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,235
belongs to Lieutenant Meinberg.

167
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,116
- Well, is he using it?
- Yes, he's very attached to it.

168
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,673
Stop it. He doesn't understand.
He's only eight.

169
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,156
You're only 12,
so stop pretending you're any older.

170
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,918
What do you want a tyre for, anyway?

171
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,952
- I want to make a swing.
- A swing?

172
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,956
That does sound exciting.

173
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,995
You!

174
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,953
Here, now.

175
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,475
Move!

176
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,312
Take this boy to the outhouse
in the back garden.

177
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,191
There are some tyres in there.
He will select one.

178
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,391
You will carry it where he asks.
Do you understand?

179
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,273
Well, little man,
what are you waiting for?

180
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,872
How about this one?

181
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,072
Where's my mum?

182
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,193
She's out.

183
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,314
- When is she back?
- Soon, I expect.

184
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,112
But don't worry.

185
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,190
- But I might bleed to death.
- No, you won't.

186
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,471
- Will I need to go to hospital?
- No. It's only a small cut.

187
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,670
Come on. It's not that bad.

188
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,751
There, all better.

189
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,790
- What's your name?
- Pavel.

190
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,752
Now, you've got to sit still
for a few minutes

191
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,714
before you start
walking around on that again.

192
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,194
Will you tell my mum what happened?

193
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,993
I think she's going to see it for herself.

194
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,394
She'll probably take me to a doctor.

195
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,272
I don't think so.

196
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,512
- It could be worse than it looks.
- It isn't.

197
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,313
How would you know?
You're not a doctor.

198
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,074
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

199
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,238
You peel potatoes.

200
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,516
I practised as a doctor.

201
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,193
Before I...

202
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,992
Before I came here.

203
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,154
You couldn't have been much good
then, if you had to practise.

204
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,711
Now, what are you going to be
when you grow up?

205
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,718
I know. An explorer.

206
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,232
How do you know that?

207
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,237
Is it nice on the farm?

208
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,280
Bruno. Bruno, what happened to you?

209
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,949
I made a swing,
but I fell off it and cut my knee.

210
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,515
But Pavel here, he carried me in
and put a bandage on it.

211
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,277
- Go to your room.
- But Pavel says I...

212
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,515
Don't argue. Go to your room.

213
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,799
Thank you.

214
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,760
It's not fair, you having this view.

215
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,677
Well, I'm not swapping.

216
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,397
I think school's here.

217
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,235
No, I mean more recent history.

218
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,909
- Are you interested in current affairs?
- Yes, very.

219
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,589
So, you'll be aware of the situation

220
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,835
in which our great nation
presently finds itself.

221
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,198
Yes. I read newspapers whenever I can
and one of Father's men

222
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,196
keeps me up to date
on everything that's happening.

223
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,677
Good. And you, Bruno.
Have you been reading newspapers?

224
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,750
- Have you been reading anything?
- Books.

225
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,831
Good. What sort of books?

226
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,751
Adventure books, mainly.

227
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,715
You know, knights in shining armour,
exploring strange lands and stuff,

228
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,430
and silly princesses
always getting in the way.

229
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,952
Well, this is why I'm here to help.
You're how old now, Bruno? Eight?

230
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,631
Time to get your head
out of those fiction books

231
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,716
and start learning about fact.

232
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,309
Time, I think,
to turn your mind to the real world,

233
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,272
and I believe
this would be the perfect start.

234
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,719
Die, die!

235
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,396
Die, die.

236
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,949
Hello.

237
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,233
I'm exploring.

238
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,593
- What are you doing?
- We're... We're building a new hut.

239
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,719
Have you got lots of friends over there?

240
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,080
A few. But we fight a lot.

241
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,798
That's why I like being out here.
I can be on my own.

242
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,079
- I'm Bruno.
- Shmuel.

243
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,795
- Sorry?
- I'm Shmuel.

244
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,749
That's your name? Never heard
of anyone called that before.

245
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,030
I've never heard
of anyone called Bruno.

246
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,914
But Shmuel. No one's called Shmuel.

247
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,795
I live in the house, back there.

248
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,553
- Have you got any food on you?
- No.

249
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,393
Are you hungry?

250
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,872
How old are you?

251
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,755
- Eight.
- Me, too!

252
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,309
It's not fair,
me being stuck over here on my own,

253
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,079
while you're over there,
playing with friends all day.

254
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,953
- Playing?
- Well, that number.

255
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,550
- Isn't it a part of a game or something?
- It's just my number.

256
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,670
Everyone gets given
a different number.

257
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,196
Right. Then what happens?

258
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,714
- I have to go back now!
- Really?

259
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,909
Yeah.

260
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,118
It was nice to meet you, Shmuel.

261
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,356
And you, Bruno.

262
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,755
Bye.

263
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,191
Mum, I can't find my football.

264
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,390
Well, it'll be
in one of your cupboards, sweet.

265
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,237
It isn't. I've looked.

266
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,189
Can I have a piece of chocolate?

267
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,233
A piece. Yes.

268
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,034
Bruno?

269
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,871
- Have you looked in the cellar?
- The cellar?

270
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,278
For your football.

271
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,075
Damn.

272
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,311
- Gretel, I've just seen all your...
- All my what?

273
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,552
All your dolls, down in the cellar.

274
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,511
Dolls are for little girls.

275
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,199
It's not right to play with silly toys

276
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,869
while people are away
risking their lives for the Fatherland.

277
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,919
- "My people's density is my density."
- Destiny.

278
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,915
"lts struggles and its sorrows,
its joys and its miseries are mine.

279
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,475
"I must work and create
for the resurrection of my Fatherland.

280
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,034
"The history of my people
is great and glorious."

281
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,559
And it's 12:00.

282
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,552
- I'm sorry?
- Isn't that when we finish?

283
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,592
The termination of the lesson
is for the tutor to decide, Bruno,

284
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,473
not the pupil.
Now, will you please continue.

285
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,837
Bruno, there you are.

286
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,995
I'm just going into town for an hour.
Do you want to come?

287
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,310
You be careful on that thing.

288
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,794
Thank you.

289
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,236
Can I ask you something?

290
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,119
Why do you people
wear pyjamas all day?

291
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,951
- They're not pyjamas.
- Well, those.

292
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,718
We have to.
They took all our other clothes away.

293
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,557
- Who did?
- The soldiers.

294
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,238
The soldiers? Why?

295
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,753
I don't like soldiers. Do you?

296
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,637
I do, quite. My dad's a soldier,

297
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,437
but not the sort that takes
people's clothes away for no reason.

298
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,038
What sort, then?

299
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,399
Well, he's the important sort.

300
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,910
He's in charge of making
everything better for everyone.

301
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,508
- So is your dad a farmer?
- No, he's a watchmaker.

302
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,118
Or was. Most of the time now,
he just mends boots.

303
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,996
It's funny how grown-ups
can't make their minds up

304
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,032
about what they want to do.
It's like Pavel.

305
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,469
Do you know him? Lives over there.

306
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,469
He used to be a doctor,
but gave it all up to peel potatoes.

307
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,352
Can I ask you another question?

308
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,675
What do you burn in those chimneys?

309
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,269
I saw them going the other day.
Is it just lots of hay and stuff?

310
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,278
I don't know.
We're not allowed over there.

311
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,470
Mama says it's old clothes.

312
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,159
Well, whatever it is, it smells horrid.

313
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,436
I wish
you'd remembered the chocolate.

314
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,072
Yes, I'm sorry.

315
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,998
I know! Perhaps you can come
and have supper with us sometime.

316
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,554
I can't, can I? Because of this.

317
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,674
But that's to stop
the animals getting out, isn't it?

318
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,951
Animals?
No, it's to stop people getting out.

319
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,276
Are you not allowed out?

320
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,755
- Why? What have you done?
- I'm a Jew.

321
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,156
I think I should go now.

322
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,314
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- I'll try.

323
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,954
- Goodbye, then!
- Bye.

324
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,236
Little present, sweetheart.

325
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,278
Thank you, Mummy.

326
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,150
- Have you seen Bruno?
- Outside on his swing, I think.

327
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,709
Yes, Thursday's perfect.
I'll have a car come to collect you both.

328
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,990
Are Grandma and Grandpa coming?

329
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,397
Hey, did you smell
that horrible smell the other day?

330
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,273
- Coming from the chimneys.
- What sort of ill?

331
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,076
The day I fell off the swing.

332
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,154
- Did you smell it, Mum?
- Father.

333
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,793
Mum.

334
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,152
Let me speak to her.

335
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,077
Yes, she is. I can hear her.

336
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,994
Yes. We look forward to it. Goodbye.

337
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,430
- Is Grandma not coming?
- No.

338
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,316
She's poorly, apparently,
but Grandpa's coming.

339
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,390
- Did you smell it, Dad?
- What?

340
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,796
That horrid smell from the chimneys.
What is it?

341
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,630
I think they just burn rubbish
there sometimes.

342
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,352
- Look.
- What?

343
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,758
- Hey!
- Gretel.

344
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,079
Hey, that's not fair!

345
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,599
- Gretel.
- What?

346
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,712
It's only a game.

347
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,149
Ralf, this tutor you brought in,

348
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,949
does he usually teach children
as young as Gretel and Bruno?

349
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,112
I believe so. Why?

350
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,037
Well, do we know
what he's teaching them?

351
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,877
Gretel seems to have become so...

352
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,388
They're being taught what all children
are being taught at the moment.

353
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,432
They mustn't get left behind.

354
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,674
Come on.

355
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,152
Let's get to bed.

356
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,039
"The Jew slandered us
and incited our enemies.

357
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,389
"The Jew corrupted us
through bad books.

358
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,715
"He mocked
our literature and our music.

359
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,035
"Everywhere, his influence
was destructive,

360
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,913
"the eventual result of which
was our nation's collapse,

361
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,837
- "and then..."
- Yes, Bruno.

362
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,395
I don't understand.

363
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,352
A nation's collapse
is all down to this one man?

364
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,790
The Jew here
means the entire Jewish race.

365
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,751
If it had been just one man,

366
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,268
I'm sure something
would've been done about him.

367
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,392
There is such a thing as a nice Jew,
though, isn't there?

368
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,069
I think, Bruno,
if you ever found a nice Jew,

369
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,993
you would be
the best explorer in the world.

370
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,712
Continue, Gretel.

371
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,552
"The aim of the Jew
is to become the ruler of humanity.

372
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,114
<i>"The Jew is not creative,</i>
<i>but destructive.</i>

373
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,594
"He is the enemy of culture.

374
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,871
"Thousands of Germans
have been made poor by the Jew."

375
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,119
Master Bruno.

376
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,515
What are you doing? You've just
had your lunch, haven't you?

377
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,269
I was going for a walk,
and I thought I might get peckish.

378
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,039
But don't make a mess of your satchel.
Bring it here.

379
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,437
- I'll wrap it properly for you.
- No. It's none of your business.

380
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,152
Bruno, what is it?

381
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,315
What are you doing with your satchel?

382
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,956
<i>Herr</i> Liszt gave us some books.
I'm going out on the swing to read.

383
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,276
- Let me see.
- What?

384
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,914
- The books.
- No.

385
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,714
Bruno, I just want to see
what books <i>Herr</i> Liszt has given you.

386
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,956
- I told a lie.
- What?

387
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,678
I've just got

388
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,558
adventure books.

389
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,431
Go on. Off you go, then.

390
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,430
Now, Maria,
there's two extra for supper tonight.

391
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,629
The <i>Kommandant's</i> father will be here,

392
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,955
and I believe
Lieutenant Kotler is joining us.

393
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,955
Here.

394
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,558
What's the matter?

395
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,838
- Don't throw it back.
- What? Why not?

396
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,236
- It's dangerous.
- Dangerous?

397
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,236
It's just a ball. Come on.

398
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,631
Do you not like playing?

399
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,633
- Just not ball games?
- Not here.

400
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,309
- Tell me how the number game works.
- I told you, it's not a game.

401
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,316
We just all have numbers.

402
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,028
Shmuel!

403
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,231
Bruno! What are you doing?

404
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,917
My ball went over.
I was just getting it back.

405
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,073
They smell even worse
when they burn, don't they?

406
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,189
What?

407
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,038
But, surely you...

408
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,668
Elsa, I was sworn to secrecy.

409
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,756
- From your own wife.
- Yes.

410
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,878
I took an oath upon my life.
Do you understand?

411
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,160
Elsa, you believe in this, too.

412
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,835
- You want this country to be strong...
- No, Ralf, no! No, not that!

413
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,753
How can you...

414
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,392
- Because I'm a soldier.
- How can you...

415
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,113
- Soldiers fight wars.
- That isn't war!

416
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,958
It's a part of it! It's a vital part of it!

417
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,079
The Fatherland we all desire,
all of us, you included,

418
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,953
cannot be achieved
without work such as this!

419
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,674
- Elsa. Elsa.
- Get away from me! Get away from me!

420
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,999
Grandpa's here.

421
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,600
- I don't believe this.
- Grandpa's here.

422
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,070
We'll be through in a moment.

423
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,476
Who told you about this?

424
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,513
How's Grandma?

425
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,389
She's a bit under the weather,
I'm afraid.

426
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,399
It's a shame, she was so much
looking forward to seeing you.

427
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,796
- Perhaps next time, if she feels up to it.
- Absolutely.

428
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:09,797
You know, Ralf,
your mother really is sick.

429
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,075
She's been talking about this visit
for weeks.

430
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,475
Maybe that's what's made her sick.

431
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,590
So, your father tells me
that you've got a tutor.

432
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,870
Yes. He's nice.

433
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,153
But he won't let us read
any adventure books.

434
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,715
All we do is boring, old history.

435
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,310
Let me tell you something, young man.

436
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:40,558
If it wasn't for history, we wouldn't
all be sitting around this table.

437
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,160
The work your father is doing here,

438
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,997
history in the making.

439
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,789
When I was your age, history was
my favourite subject by miles,

440
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,110
which obviously
didn't please my father.

441
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,479
Why not?

442
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,398
Well, he was a professor of literature
at the university.

443
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,716
Really, does he still teach?

444
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,910
- I don't really know.
- You don't know?

445
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,236
We're not in touch, my father and I.
He left the country some time ago.

446
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,159
Really, when?

447
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,636
About four years ago,
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

448
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,232
But surely he can't be very old.
What is he, still in his 40s, late 40s?

449
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,558
Where did he go?

450
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,912
Lieutenant Kotler,

451
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,709
your father, the professor of literature,
where did he go?

452
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,118
I believe it was Switzerland,
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

453
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,669
How strange that he should choose
to leave the Fatherland

454
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,199
at the very moment it needed him most.

455
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,959
Just when we're all required
to play our part in the national revival.

456
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,319
More wine!

457
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,313
What reason did he give?
Was he tubercular?

458
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,712
Did he go there to take the air?

459
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,912
I'm afraid I really don't know,
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

460
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,871
You'd have to ask him.

461
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,559
Well, that would be rather difficult,
wouldn't it?

462
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,750
With him being in Switzerland.

463
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,668
Come on!

464
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,268
What's the matter with you tonight?

465
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,756
Yes, perhaps that was it.
Perhaps he was ill.

466
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,080
Unless, of course,
he had disagreements.

467
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,550
- I mean, with government policy.
- One hears of such men.

468
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,869
Disturbed, most of them,
or just plain cowards.

469
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,351
- Even so, all of them traitors.
- Absolutely right.

470
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,918
Presumably,
if that was the case with your father,

471
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,555
you will have informed your superiors,
as is your duty.

472
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,039
Lieutenant Kotler!

473
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,233
You cretin Jew! Filth!

474
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,039
Ralf!

475
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,669
Jew!

476
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,230
- But Dad just sat there.
- What did you expect him to do?

477
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,272
The Jew deserved it.

478
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,196
Can I ask you something
about the farm?

479
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,832
Bruno, you don't still think it's a farm,
do you?

480
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,552
It's a camp. What's called a work camp.

481
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,396
For Jews, obviously.

482
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,593
Just Jews?

483
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,189
Because they're the best workers?

484
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,636
They're not in there
because they're good, silly.

485
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,398
They're no good at anything.

486
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,158
They're in there because they're evil.

487
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,316
- They're the enemy.
- The enemy?

488
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,635
- But I thought we were fighting...
- They're evil, Bruno.

489
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,557
Evil, dangerous vermin.

490
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,833
They're the reason
we lost the Great War.

491
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,714
Haven't you been listening to anything
<i>Herr</i> Liszt has been telling us?

492
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,239
No. Not really.

493
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,270
Dad's not horrible, is he?
He's a good man.

494
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,074
- Of course, he is.
- But he's in charge of a horrible place.

495
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,075
It's only horrible for them, Bruno.

496
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,554
We should be proud of Dad,
now more than ever before.

497
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,068
He's making the country great again.

498
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,277
<i>Like you say, they're a bit strange.</i>
<i>A bit...</i>

499
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,355
<i>Well, they're different.</i>

500
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,231
<i>They're the enemy, Bruno.</i>

501
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,191
<i>Evil, dangerous vermin.</i>

502
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,232
<i>Well, you see,</i>
<i>they're not really people at all.</i>

503
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,590
What are you doing here?

504
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,679
They wanted someone with tiny fingers
to clean all these.

505
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,878
We're not supposed to be friends,
you and me.

506
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,878
We're meant to be enemies.
Did you know that?

507
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,238
Do you want some?

508
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,874
- What's your dad like?
- What's he like?

509
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,872
Is he a good man?

510
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,915
You've never thought he wasn't?

511
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,391
And you're proud of him?

512
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,631
Aren't you proud of yours?

513
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,791
Is it really horrible in the camp?

514
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,955
How dare you
talk to people in the house.

515
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,638
How dare you!

516
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,833
Are you eating?

517
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,396
Have you been stealing food?

518
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,715
- Answer me!
- No, sir. He gave it to me.

519
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,678
He's my friend.

520
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,635
What?

521
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,713
Little man,

522
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,556
do you know this Jew?

523
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,999
Do you know this Jew?

524
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,032
No, I just walked in,
and he was helping himself.

525
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,034
I've never seen him before in my life.

526
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,074
You, finish cleaning the glasses.

527
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,952
When I come back,
we'll have a little chat

528
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,709
about what happens to rats who steal.
Come away.

529
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,599
<i>New arrivals here are happy</i>
<i>to discover that life in the camp</i>

530
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,959
<i>is not all work.</i>

531
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,673
<i>And that there's</i>
<i>ample opportunity for leisure also.</i>

532
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,156
<i>At the end of their day</i>
<i>at the ironmongery</i>

533
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,873
<i>or the build or boot factory,</i>
<i>the workers can enjoy</i>

534
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,151
<i>the many forms of pastime</i>
<i>that the camp has to offer.</i>

535
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,639
<i>Organised sport is very popular.</i>

536
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,672
<i>Those that don't play</i>
<i>certainly enjoy watching.</i>

537
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,039
<i>At the end of the working day,</i>

538
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,389
<i>the centrally located caf</i>
<i>is the ideal place</i>

539
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,877
<i>for friends and families to join together</i>
<i>for a hearty and nutritious meal.</i>

540
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,559
<i>The children, in particular,</i>

541
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,234

542

544
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,509

<i>pottery, cookery, art and horticulture</i>

546

547
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,155
Splendid.

548
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,230
- Bravo. Excellent.
- Thank you.

549
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,512
Goodbye, little man.

550
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,197
Shmuel! Shmuel!

551
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,590
I don't understand.

552
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,029
I saw a film about the camp,

553
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,197
and it looked so nice.

554
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,196
I don't know why I did it.

555
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,273
Gretel and everyone
were saying all these things,

556
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,436
and that soldier's so scary.

557
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,995
Been coming here for days,
but you were never here.

558
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:11,716
I thought maybe
we weren't friends any more.

559
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:24,032
Shmuel, I'm really sorry for what I did.
We are still friends, aren't we?

560
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,516
Where's Kurt these days?
I haven't seen him for ages.

561
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,231
- Who's Kurt?
- Lieutenant Kotler.

562
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,390
He's been moved to the front.

563
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,471
It was felt that
his youth and enthusiasm

564
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,158
would be put to better use there.

565
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,236
<i>Herr Kommandant,</i> telephone.

566
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,509
In actual fact, Gretel, he was sent there

567
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,312
because he failed
to inform the authorities

568
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,669
of his father's
lack of loyalty to the Party.

569
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,517
Which was his duty, I might add.

570
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,596
- Which was his bad luck.
- Bad luck?

571
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,599
Well, bad luck that it was his father
who was disloyal, and not his mother.

572
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:30,279
One presumably
doesn't have to report one's mother.

573
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,597
- What?
- When will Pavel be back?

574
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,074
- Mum?
- Never, stupid.

575
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,989
It's Father. They've been bombed.

576
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,838
Grandmother's dead.

577
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,795
"...the victory
which You have obtained for us

578
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,070
"and for all who sleep in Him,

579
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,590
"keep us who are still in the body
in everlasting fellowship

580
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,870

581
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,275
"and with all that are around Thee

582
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,595

583
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:59,235

584
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,238
"ever one God, world without end.
Amen."

585
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,716
He can't have that on there.
She wouldn't have wanted it.

586
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,108
He does.

587
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,434
"Almighty God, who by the death of..."

588
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,879
<i>Have you ever been to a funeral?</i>

589
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,950
My grandma and grandpa both died
just after we got here,

590
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,230
but there weren't any funerals.

591
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,636
That one there to there.

592
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,955
They both died at the same time?

593
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,628
What of?

594
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,109
I don't know.

595
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,869
Papa said they must have caught
something on the way here.

596
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,992
They had to go to a hospital
as soon as we arrived.

597
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,031
We didn't see them again.

598
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,359
This is fun.

599
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:17,916
Wish we could do something
a bit more exciting, though.

600
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,076
- That one there to there.
- This one?

601
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,791
- This one?
- No, that one.

602
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:32,277
- This one to here?
- No, there!

603
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,311
- To here?
- No.

604
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,078
- Here?
- No.

605
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,560
- I don't want you to go away again.
- No. Neither do I.

606
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,716
You can't behave like this!

607
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:21,511
- You're questioning my behaviour?
- It can't continue!

608
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:24,109
I know.
I can't stand this any more, Ralf.

609
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,469
I can't stay here and be a part of this.

610
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,512
Don't you think there will be questions?

611
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,959
- Questions?
- Well, now, what does it say

612
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,516
about my ability to carry out my work
if I cannot control my own family?

613
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,393
- Work? Is that what you call it?
- Pull yourself together, woman.

614
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,158
Right. Just ignore it. Ignore it.

615
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,829
Ignore the fact
that the man I married is a monster!

616
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,680
Even your own mother
couldn't love you.

617
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,718
Are you happy here?

618
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,712
Yes. Very.

619
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,392
And you, Gretel?

620
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:12,234
Well, I was, but I do miss home.
I miss my friends.

621
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:17,670
Yes, I'm sure. And you, too, Bruno.
You must miss those friends of yours.

622
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,228
No. Not any more, really.

623
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:37,953
I suppose the real question is,
if the opportunity arose,

624
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,515
would you prefer
to live somewhere else?

625
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:45,314
- Back home?
- No. Not Berlin. Not yet.

626
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:50,715
Somewhere safe, say Aunt Lottie's
in Heidelberg, for example.

627
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,996
All of us? You as well?

628
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:58,231
No. That won't be possible just yet,
I'm afraid.

629
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,840
I must stay
and complete my work here.

630
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,635
See, at the moment,
your mother is finding it...

631
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:12,833
She just feels right now you need
to spend some time elsewhere.

632
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,632
Would you like that?

633
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:29,513
I'm afraid, Bruno, in life, we often
have to do things we don't want to do.

634
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,154
The important thing is
your mother does not feel

635
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,998
that this is an appropriate place for you
to be spending your childhood,

636
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,555
and the more I think about it, the more
I realise she's very probably right.

637
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,033
- But, Dad...
- No!

638
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,070
It's time for you to move away.

639
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,116
Is everything all right?

640
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,751
We can't find Papa.

641
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,360
He went on a different work duty
with some of the men,

642
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,470
and they haven't come back.

643
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,755
I've got some bad news, too.
I'm going away.

644
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,277
How long for this time?

645
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,076
That's why it's bad. It's forever, I think.

646
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:49,318
Mum says this is no place for children,
which is just stupid.

647
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,832
- When do you go?
- Tomorrow. After lunch.

648
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:58,510
So, I won't ever see you again?

649
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:04,239
Yes, you will. You can come on holiday
to Berlin if you like,

650
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:07,397
when everybody's getting on
with each other again.

651
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,833
I wish I could've helped you
find your dad.

652
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:18,716
I really want to make up
for letting you down like I did.

653
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,672
That would have done it, wouldn't it?
Helping you find your dad?

654
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,473
Would've been great.
Like a secret mission.

655
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,351
- I could dig under.
- What? With that?

656
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:36,473
- No, but I could bring something.
- You don't want to come over here.

657
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,909
Look.

658
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,397
- I could come through to your side.
- What's the point in that?

659
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,238
Your dad's not going to be over here,
is he?

660
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,594
But I'd stick out though, wouldn't I,
if I came through?

661
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,437
I don't look like you.

662
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,076
You could look like me, though.

663
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,395
If you dressed like me
and shaved your hair off.

664
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,476
I'm not shaving my hair off.

665
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,799
- You could cover it with a cap.
- My pyjamas are a different colour.

666
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,469
I could bring some.
There's a hut full of them,

667
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,080
thousands of them.
Would you do it, though?

668
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,270
- I want to do it.
- Would you dare do it, though?

669
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,834
- I want to help you find your dad.
- I've got to go.

670
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,156
Tomorrow, then?
I'll bring an extra-big sandwich.

671
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,316
And don't forget the pyjamas!

672
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:31,869
Bruno?

673
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,075
Mum, can I go and play on the swing?

674
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,199
- Bruno...
- It's my last chance.

675
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,351
All right. Go on then.

676
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:18,198
- I thought you weren't coming!
- I'm sorry. It wasn't easy to get away.

677
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:21,789
I'm not meant to be out here today.
You forgot the pyjamas!

678
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,592
- Did you bring the sandwich?
- Would I let you down?

679
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,674
Shmuel.

680
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,155
Here.

681
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,759
How do I look?

682
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,677
Right. Let's get going.

683
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,389
Bruno?

684
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,159
That's enough.

685
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,230
Let's go and find your dad.

686
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,554
Come on!

687
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,593
Master Bruno?

688
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,674
Shmuel.

689
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,633
- Can we go to the caf or something?
- Caf?

690
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,712
- Maybe I should go home.
- What about Papa?

691
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,949
Yeah.

692
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,236
We'll check our hut first.

693
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,474
Bruno?

694
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,748
Come on.

695
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,595
Papa?

696
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,955
Up! Up! Get up!

697
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,956
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

698
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,752
We go on marches sometimes.

699
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,711
Move! Up, up!

700
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,518
Move, move!

701
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,079
Bruno!

702
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,272
He must still be
outside somewhere, ma'am.

703
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,119
Bruno!

704
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:50,994
Bruno?

705
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,872
- Move!
- Quickly!

706
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,188
Get up!

707
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,352
Get up. You must!

708
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,919
Move them out!

709
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,275
...which means that
our weekly capabilities

710
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,833
would be almost tripled,

711
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:32,075
so, therefore,
by the end of the summer...

712
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,112
- Ralf.
- Elsa, I'm in a meeting.

713
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,272
Bruno's missing.

714
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,039
Come on!

715
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,038
Wait here!

716
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,719
Come on!

717
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:07,793
Move! Move!

718
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,992
Join the queue!

719
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,279
Come on, you!

720
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,473
Bruno!

721
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,628
Move it!

722
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:42,634
Go on.

723
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,508
Bruno!

724
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,550
It's all right. I think we're just waiting
in here until the rain stops.

725
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,953
Clothes off!

726
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,716
Where are we going?

727
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,951
No, it's just a shower.

728
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:19,839
A shower?

729
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:09,399
Open the gates! Open the gates!

730
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:13,955
Move!

731
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,716
Bruno!

732
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:46,440
