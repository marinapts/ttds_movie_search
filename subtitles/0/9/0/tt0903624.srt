<b>THE HOBBIT</b>

3
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,751
<i>Old Bilbo: My dear Frodo,</i>

4
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:18,182
<i>you asked me once if I had told you everything
there was to know about my adventures.</i>

5
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:20,830
<i>And well, I can honestly say
I've told you the truth...</i>

6
00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:25,383
<i>I may not have told you all of it. </i>

7
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:35,414
<i>I am old now, Frodo.</i>

8
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:41,145
<i>I am not the same hobbit I once was.</i>

9
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:49,908
<i>I think...It is time for you to know.
What really happened.</i>

10
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:56,142
<i>It began long ago.</i>

11
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:59,517
<i>In a land far away to the east.</i>

12
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:04,614
<i>The like of which,
You'll not find in the world..today.</i>

13
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:19,866
<i>There was a city of Dale.
It's market known far and wide.</i>

14
00:02:20,044 --> 00:02:26,162
<i>Full with the bounties of fine and veil..
Peaceful and Prosperous.</i>

15
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:34,040
<i>For this city lay before the doors..
...of the greatest kingdom in middle earth.</i>

16
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:39,645
<i>Erebor. Stronghold of Thrr.</i>

17
00:02:39,812 --> 00:02:45,461
<i>King under the mountain,
mightiest of the dwarf lords.</i>

18
00:02:45,627 --> 00:02:51,187
<i>Thrr ruled with utter surety.
Never doubting his house would endure.</i>

19
00:02:51,358 --> 00:02:56,995
<i>For his line lays secure
in the lifes of his son...and grandson.</i>

20
00:02:58,563 --> 00:03:02,019
<i>Ahh..Frodo..Erebor!</i>

21
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:08,379
<i>Built deep within the mountainance-
the beauty of this fortress city was fetching.</i>

22
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:10,868
<i>It's wealth lay in the earth..</i>

23
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:16,342
<i>In precious gems humed from rock.
nd in great seams of gold...</i>

24
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:19,461
<i>running like river through stone.</i>

25
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:25,866
<i>The skill of the dwarfs was unequaled.</i>

26
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:29,911
<i>Fashioning objects of great beauty.</i>

27
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,704
<i>Out of diamond, emerald,
ruby and sapphire.</i>

28
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,925
<i>Ever they delve deeper down into the dark...</i>

29
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:41,874
<i>and that is where they found it.</i>

30
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,715
<i>The heart of the mountain...</i>

31
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:54,628
<i>The Arkenstone!</i>

32
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,223
<i>Thrr named it 'The King's Jewel'.</i>

33
00:03:57,334 --> 00:04:02,186
<i>He took it as a sign,
A sign that his right to rule was divine.</i>

34
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:08,972
<i>All would pay homage to him.
Even the Elvenking..Thranduil.</i>

35
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:14,577
<i>But the years of peace and plenty
were not to last.</i>

36
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:22,086
<i>Slowly the days turn sour.
And the watchful eyes closed in.</i>

37
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:33,242
<i>Thrr's love of gold
has grown too fierce.</i>

38
00:04:35,346 --> 00:04:39,435
<i>A sickness had begun to grow within him.</i>

39
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:43,381
<i>It was a sickness of the mind.</i>

40
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:51,866
<i>And where sickness thrive,
Bad things would follow.</i>

41
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:06,023
<i>the first they heard was a noise like a
hurricane  coming down from the North.</i>

42
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:11,376
<i>the pines on the mountain creaked and crocked
in the hot dry wind. </i>

43
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:18,199
Balin, sound the alarm.

44
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:23,995
Do it now.
-What is it?

45
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,764
Dragon.
Dragon!!!

46
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:33,722
<i>it was a fire drake from the North.</i>

47
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:45,152
<i>Smaug...had come.</i>

48
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:15,648
<i>Such wanton death was dealth that day,</i>

49
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:19,710
<i>This city of men was nothing to Smaug.</i>

50
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:24,011
<i>His eyes.. were set on another price.</i>

51
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:34,226
<i>The Dragons covet gold,
with a dark and fierce desire.</i>

52
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:20,761
<i>Erebor, was lost.</i>

53
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:29,381
<i>The Dragon would guard his plunder,
as long as he lives.</i>

54
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:42,902
Run for your lives.
-Help us.

55
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:01,442
<i> Thranduil would not risk the lives of his kin
against the wrath of the Dragon.</i>

56
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:04,173
<i>No help came from the Elfs that day..</i>

57
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:07,491
<i>nor any day since.</i>

58
00:08:09,006 --> 00:08:14,948
<i>Robbed of their homeland,
the dwarves of Erebor wandered the wilderness.</i>

59
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:18,317
<i>A once mighty people,
brought low.</i>

60
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:26,875
<i> The young dwarf Prince took work
where he could find it. Labouring in the villages of men.</i>

61
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:32,306
<i>but always he remembered,
the mountains smoked beneath the moon..</i>

62
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:35,720
<i>The trees, like torches blazing bright.</i>

63
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:41,999
<i>For, he had seen the dragon's fire in the sky,
and city turned to ash.</i>

64
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:48,152
<i>But he never forgave and he never forgot. </i>

65
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:57,742
<i>That, my dear Frodo,
Is where I come in.</i>

66
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,324
<i>For quiet by chance and the will of a wizard... </i>

67
00:09:01,494 --> 00:09:05,750
<i> fate decided,
I would become part of the tale.</i>

68
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,510
<i>It began..well it began
as you might've expect. </i>

69
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:17,611
<i>In a hole in the ground,
there lived a hobbit.</i>

70
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:24,545
<i>Not a nasty, dirty, wethole..
full of warm and oozie smells.</i>

71
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,193
<i>This was a Hobbit-hole.</i>

72
00:09:27,364 --> 00:09:32,209
<i> That means, good food -
a warm heart</i>

73
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:36,047
<i> ...and all the comforts of home.</i>

74
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:12,301
Thank You.

75
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:17,100
What's this?
-That is private. Keep your sticky paws off.

76
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:20,724
It's not ready yet.

77
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:25,020
Not ready for what?
- Reading.

78
00:10:27,676 --> 00:10:32,767
What on earth are these?
- Replies to your party invitations.

79
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:36,904
Good gracious!
Is it today?

80
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:42,549
They all said they're coming, except for the Sackville-Baggins
who are demanding you ask them in person.

81
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,550
Are they indeed?

82
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:46,759
Over my dead body.

83
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:50,394
Probably, they'd find quite agreeable.
They seem to think their tunnel overflowing...

84
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:54,516
It was one small chest.
Hardly over flowing.

85
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:59,023
And it still smells of troll.
-What on earth are you doing?

86
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:04,079
Taking precautions.

87
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:07,410
You know.. I caught her making off
with our silverware once?

88
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:08,411
-Who?

89
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:11,959
Lobelia, bag old-Baggins.

90
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,467
All my spoons..stuffed in her pocket.

91
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:20,642
Huh! Dreadful woman.
Make sure you keep an eye on her. After, I'm...?

92
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,208
When I'm...

93
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,836
When you're what?

94
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:33,593
It's Nothing.
Nothing.

95
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:41,850
You know, some people are beginning to
wonder about you, uncle.

96
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:45,769
They think you're becoming 'odd'.
- odd?

97
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:51,077
Unsociable.
-Unsociable? Me? Nonsense!

98
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,943
Be a good lad and put that on the gate.

99
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:58,537
NO ADMITTENCE,
'except for party affairs'.

100
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:05,926
Do you think he'll come?
- Who?

101
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:06,927
Gandalff.

102
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,392
He would not miss a chance
to lit of his wish boppers.

103
00:12:11,393 --> 00:12:14,243
He'll give us quite a show.
You'll see.

104
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:15,891
I'm off.
- Off to where?

105
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:16,892
East Farthing Woods.

106
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:17,893
I'm going to surprise him.

107
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:22,258
Well, go on then.
You don't wanna be late.

108
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:29,699
<i>He doesn't approve of being late.</i>

109
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:35,262
<i>Not that I ever was.
In those days, I was always on time.</i>

110
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:39,834
<i>I was entirely respectable.</i>

111
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:46,032
<i>And nothing unexpected...
ever happened.</i>

112
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:54,555
<b>An Unexpected Journey</b>

113
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:09,073
60 Years Earlier...

114
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:12,495
Good Morning.
- What do you mean?

115
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:17,994
Wil je mij een goede morgen wensen, of is het
een goede morgen of ik dat nu wil of niet?

116
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:23,828
Or perhaps, you mean to say that,
you feel good on this perticular morning?

117
00:13:23,993 --> 00:13:27,913
Or are you simply stating that
this is a morning to be good?

118
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:31,326
All of them or one...
I suppose.

119
00:13:38,286 --> 00:13:41,745
Can I help you?
-That remains to be seen.

120
00:13:43,411 --> 00:13:47,496
I'm looking for someone
to share in an adventure.

121
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,136
An adventure?

122
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:59,705
No, I don't imagine anyone West of Bree,
would have much interest in an adventures.

123
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:04,620
Nasty, disturbing..uncomforable thing.

124
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,078
I'm getting late for dinner.

125
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:16,536
Good morning.

126
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:21,497
Do you think I should've lived to bit ' good morning '
by Belladonna Toek's son ...

127
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:26,914
as if i'm selling buttons up the door?
- I beg your pardon?

128
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:30,329
You've changed.
And not entirely for better, Bilbo Baggins.

129
00:14:30,497 --> 00:14:31,748
Im sorry, Do I know you?

130
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:32,749
-You know my name,

131
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,429
although you don't remember,
where i belong with.

132
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:39,457
I am Gandalf.
and Gandalf means ...

133
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:42,581
Me.

134
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:47,203
Not Gandalf, the wandering wizard..
who make such excellent fireworks?

135
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:50,955
Old toke who we use to have them
on midsummer eve.

136
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:56,710
I had no idea, you're still in business.
-And where else should I be?

137
00:15:00,956 --> 00:15:04,791
Well, I'm pleased to find
you remember something about me.

138
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:07,538
Even if it's only my Fireworks.

139
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:13,363
Well, that's decided!
It will be very good for you.

140
00:15:13,832 --> 00:15:17,748
And most amusing for me.
I shall inform the others.

141
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:21,246
Inform the who?
What? No...no.

142
00:15:21,414 --> 00:15:26,958
We do not want any adventures here.
Thank you...Not today ...

143
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:31,735
I suggest you try.. over the Hill
or across the water.

144
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:36,544
Good morning.

145
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:02,635
Dwalin...
At your service.

146
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:10,295
Bilbo Baggins.

147
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,522
Do we know each other?
-No.

148
00:17:13,674 --> 00:17:17,938
Which way, laddy?
It Is down here?

149
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:18,939
-Is what..down where?

150
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:23,841
Supper.
He said that there would be food.

151
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:28,312
Lots of it.
-He said? Who said?

152
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:41,293
Very good this. I
s there any more?

153
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,631
-What?

154
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:44,632
Ohh..yes..yes, huh.

155
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:54,954
Help yourself.

156
00:17:55,947 --> 00:18:01,573
It's just that...umm..
I wasn't expecting...company.

157
00:18:04,928 --> 00:18:07,697
That'll be the door.

158
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:15,403
Balin. At your service.
-Good Evening.

159
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:20,005
Yes, yes. It is.
Though, i think that it'll rain later.

160
00:18:21,155 --> 00:18:24,298
Am I late?
-late, for what?

161
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:29,987
Evening, brother.

162
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:36,267
By my beard! You're shorter and wider than
last we met.

163
00:18:36,268 --> 00:18:38,239
- Wider..not shorter.

164
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,818
Sharp enough for both of us.

165
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:57,489
Excuse me. Sorry, I hate to interrupt.
But the thing is...

166
00:18:57,665 --> 00:19:00,699
Have you eaten?
- It's not that i don't like visiters.

167
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,247
I llike visitors, as much as the next hobbit.

168
00:19:03,282 --> 00:19:07,038
But I do like to know them,
before they come..visiting.

169
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:10,603
What is this?
-I don't know. I just thought it'be cheese.

170
00:19:10,752 --> 00:19:14,343
It's gone blue.
-It's riddled with mold.

171
00:19:14,495 --> 00:19:18,283
Not in the slightest.
I don't mean to be blunt...

172
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,900
but I have to speak my mind.
I'm sorry.

173
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,709
Apology accepted.
Oh now fill it up, brother. Just don't stand.

174
00:19:34,646 --> 00:19:41,362
Fili and Kili, At your service.
-You must be Mr. Baggins.

175
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:43,258
No. You can't come in..
you've come to the wrong House.

176
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:47,291
Has it been cancelled?
-No one told us.

177
00:19:47,892 --> 00:19:50,358
Nothing has been canceled.
-That is a relief.

178
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:57,632
Be careful with this,
I just had them sharpened.

179
00:19:57,784 --> 00:20:03,203
It's nice. Did you do it yourself?
-No, it's been in the family for years.

180
00:20:03,238 --> 00:20:06,218
That's my mother's jewellery box.
Can you please don't do that.

181
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:10,543
Fili and Kili. C'mon give us a hand,
-Mr. Dwalin.

182
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:15,762
Better shove this in the hole, otherwise
we'll never get anyone in.

183
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:20,554
Anyone? How many more are there?
-How many more of it?

184
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:25,603
Oh no. There is nobody home!
Go away and bother somebody else!

185
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:30,101
There's far too many dwarfs in my dining room.

186
00:20:30,252 --> 00:20:33,621
This is some...budhead idea of a joke. ...

187
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:37,729
I'm becoming insane.
It is embarassing and no taste.

188
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:49,282
Gandalf.

189
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,170
Excuse me...Not my wine.
-Put that back. Put that back!

190
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,297
Not the jam, please. Excuse me...
Tad excessive.. Isn't it? Have you got a cheese knive?

191
00:20:58,448 --> 00:21:03,778
Cheese knive? He eats it by the block.
-No, that's grandpa Mungo's Chair.

192
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:08,103
Take it back. Take it back This is antique.
Not for sitting.

193
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:19,912
Excuse me, Mr. Gandalf,
Can I tempt you with a cup of Camomille?

194
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:24,470
Oh, No thank you Dori.
A little red wine, for me. I think.

195
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:35,569
Where are the tomatoes?
-Fili...Kili

196
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:38,977
Oin, Gloin, Dwalin, Balin.

197
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:42,003
Bifur, Bofur, Bombur.
Dori, Nori...

198
00:21:42,154 --> 00:21:45,034
-Ori.

199
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:50,424
Yes, you're quite right, Bifur.

200
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:54,596
We appear to be one dwarf short.
-He is late. Is all.

201
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:58,484
He traveled North.
To a meeting of our kin. He will come.

202
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:02,559
Mr. Gandalf, a little glass of red wine
as requested.

203
00:22:02,707 --> 00:22:07,531
It got a fruity bouquet.
-Cheers.

204
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:22,392
Catch.

205
00:22:34,515 --> 00:22:37,771
Who wants an ale?

206
00:23:03,952 --> 00:23:06,940
That is a doelli not a dish cloth.

207
00:23:06,974 --> 00:23:10,344
But it's full of holes.
- yeah, it's suppose to look like that.It's crochet.

208
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:19,688
Must i get these dwarfs!!!
-My dear Bilbo, what the haste is the matter?

209
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:23,173
What's the matter?
I'm surrounded by dwarfs.What are they doing here?

210
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:27,799
Oh they're quite a merry gathering,
You must get used to them.

211
00:23:27,998 --> 00:23:32,448
I don't want to get use to them!
the state of my kitchen, there's mud..troiling the carpet.

212
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,762
They've pillaged the pantry.
I'm not gonna tell you what they've done to the bathroom.

213
00:23:36,797 --> 00:23:40,124
They've all but destroyed the plumming.
I don't know what they're doing in my house?

214
00:23:40,383 --> 00:23:45,788
'cuse me, i'm sorry to interrupt,
but what should i do with my plate?

215
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:49,443
There you go Ori, give it to me.

216
00:23:53,935 --> 00:24:00,088
Excuse me! That is my mothers crockery.
It is more than 100 years old.

217
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,648
Can you not do that.
You'd blunt them.

218
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:10,127
OOo didn't you hear that lads?
He says we'd blunt 'em.

219
00:24:10,646 --> 00:24:15,481
<i> Bend the knives, bend the forks
Smash the bottles, burn the corks...</i>

220
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:08,181
He is here.

221
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:12,809
Gandalf,

222
00:25:14,795 --> 00:25:17,067
I thought, you said
this place would be easy to find.

223
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:20,732
I lost my way, twice.
I wouldn't 've found it at all.

224
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:22,953
Had it not been that mark on the door.

225
00:25:23,144 --> 00:25:25,951
Mark? There is no mark on that door.
It was painted a week ago.

226
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:28,815
There is a marker.
I put it there, myself.

227
00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:33,811
Bilbo Baggings, allow me to introduce
the leader of our company...

228
00:25:33,846 --> 00:25:37,608
Thorin Oakenshield

229
00:25:37,643 --> 00:25:41,370
So, this is the Hobbit.

230
00:25:43,015 --> 00:25:45,227
Tell me, Mr.Baggins..
have you done much fighting?

231
00:25:45,228 --> 00:25:46,228
Pardon me?
-Axe or sword?

232
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,155
What's your weapon of choice?

233
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,905
Well, I do have some skills at conquers.
If you must know.

234
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,597
But i fail to see,
why that's relevant.

235
00:25:56,632 --> 00:26:00,973
I thought that much.
He looks more like a grocer than a burgler.

236
00:26:06,386 --> 00:26:10,271
What news of the meeting in Ered Luin?
Will they all come?

237
00:26:10,306 --> 00:26:13,633
Aye, All dwarfs of all seven kingdoms.

238
00:26:13,668 --> 00:26:18,243
What's the dwarves of the Iron Hills Say?
Is they in with us?

239
00:26:20,142 --> 00:26:23,327
They will not come.

240
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:30,198
They say, this quest is ours,
and ours alone.

241
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:35,526
We're still on the quest?

242
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:40,284
Bilbo, my dear fella,
Let us have a little more light?

243
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:46,005
Far to the East,
over ranges and rivers ...

244
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,149
beyond woodlands and wastelands ...

245
00:26:50,184 --> 00:26:53,447
lies a single solitary peak.

246
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:58,926
The Lonely Mountain.

247
00:26:58,961 --> 00:27:05,743
Aye, Oin has read the portends,
and the portends say, it is time.

248
00:27:05,778 --> 00:27:10,202
Ravens has been seen flying back to the mountain,
as it was foretold.

249
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:14,636
When the birds Beorn
return to Erebor ...

250
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:18,370
The reign of the beast, will end.

251
00:27:19,687 --> 00:27:25,489
What beast?
-Well, that'd be a reference to Smaug- the terrible.

252
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:29,184
Chiefest and greatest calamity of our age.

253
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:34,440
Airborne fire breather. Teeth like razors
claws like meat hooks.

254
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:37,640
Extremely fond of precious metals.
-Yes, I know what a dragon is.

255
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:43,424
I'm not afraid. I'm up for it,
I'll give em a taste of dwafist iron right up their jackses.

256
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:47,695
Sit down.
-The task'd be difficult enough with an army behind us.

257
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:51,932
But we number just thirteen.
not thirteen of the best ...

258
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:58,146
Nor brightest.
-What you said?

259
00:27:58,181 --> 00:28:03,866
We may be few in number!
but we are fighters. All of us!

260
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:07,980
To the last dwarfs.
-And you forget, we've a wizard in our company..

261
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:10,653
Gandalf would've killed
hundreds of dragons in his time.

262
00:28:11,841 --> 00:28:14,363
No, I wouldn't say.
-How many then?

263
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:16,731
What?
-How many dragons you have killed?

264
00:28:18,252 --> 00:28:22,033
Go on, give us the number.

265
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:28,708
Enough.

266
00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:34,235
If we have read these signs,
Do you not think, others would've read em too?

267
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:42,203
Rumors have began to spread.
The dragon Smaug, hasn't been seen in 60 years.

268
00:28:43,845 --> 00:28:49,801
Eyes look East of the mountains.
Acessing..wondering...weight the risk-

269
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:53,881
Perhaps the vast wealth of our people
now lies unprotected.

270
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:57,927
Do we sit back,
while others claim what's rightfully our?

271
00:28:57,962 --> 00:29:01,509
Or do we seize this chance
to take back Erebor ?

272
00:29:03,543 --> 00:29:06,148
You forget the front gate is sealed.

273
00:29:06,183 --> 00:29:12,189
There is no way into the mountain.
-That my dear Balin, is not entirely true.

274
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:21,377
How came you by this?
-It was given to me by your father.

275
00:29:21,412 --> 00:29:26,065
Thrin..for safe keeping.

276
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,978
It is yours.

277
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:39,454
If there is a key, there must be a door.

278
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:44,503
This ruins speak of a hidden passage
to the lower hall .

279
00:29:44,538 --> 00:29:46,991
There's another way in.

280
00:29:46,992 --> 00:29:51,359
-But if we can find it
the dwarf doors are invisible and closed.

281
00:29:53,565 --> 00:29:58,902
The answer lies hidden somewhere in this map.
I do not have the skill to find em.

282
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,899
There are others in Middle-Earth
who can.

283
00:30:03,587 --> 00:30:09,716
The task I have in mind, will require
a great deal of stealth and no small amount of courage.

284
00:30:10,446 --> 00:30:15,299
But, if we are careful and clever,
I believe, It can be done.

285
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:19,011
That is why we need a burglar.
-Hmmm, and a good one.

286
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:23,849
An expert, I'd imagine.
-And are you?

287
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:30,270
Am i what?
-He said he is an expert. He hey,

288
00:30:30,438 --> 00:30:35,606
Me? No, I'm not a burglar.
I have never stole a thing in my life.

289
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:40,734
I'm afraid i have to agree with Mr. Baggins.
He is hardly a burgler material.

290
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:46,239
Aye, the wild is no place for gentle folk,
who can neither fight or fend themselves.

291
00:30:53,781 --> 00:31:00,326
Enough! If i say Bilbo Baggin is a burgler.
And a burgler he is.

292
00:31:01,469 --> 00:31:07,139
Hobbits are remarkably light on their feet.
In fact, they can past unseen by most if they choose.

293
00:31:07,307 --> 00:31:11,101
And while the Dragon
is accustomed to the smell of dwarves ...

294
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:17,562
the scent of hobbit is all but unknown him,
which gives us a distinct advantage.

295
00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:20,435
You asked me
to find the 14th member of this company,

296
00:31:20,604 --> 00:31:25,317
And I have chosen Mr. Baggins.
There's a lot more to him then appearance 've suggest.

297
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:29,733
And he's got a great deal to offer,
than any of you know.

298
00:31:29,903 --> 00:31:33,237
Including himself.

299
00:31:36,946 --> 00:31:41,286
You must trust me on this.

300
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:45,924
Very well,
we'll do it your way.

301
00:31:45,925 --> 00:31:46,925
No..no.
-Give him the contract.

302
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:51,745
It's just the usual.
Summery about pocket expenses.

303
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:55,582
Time required.
Remuneration, funeral arrangements..so forth.

304
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,541
-Funeral arrangements?

305
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,453
I can not guarantee his safety.
-Understood.

306
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:10,901
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.

307
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:16,210
Agreed.

308
00:32:16,245 --> 00:32:21,196
Total cash on delivery. Upto but not exceeding
one 14th total profit, if any.

309
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:23,401
Seems fair...

310
00:32:37,536 --> 00:32:39,386
Incineration?

311
00:32:39,387 --> 00:32:42,217
-Oh aye, they'd bite flesh off your bone
in a blink of an eye.

312
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,976
You're alright, laddy?
- Yeah, okay...

313
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:55,727
I fear that i might faint.
-Think  furnace with wings.

314
00:32:55,762 --> 00:33:00,138
I need air.
-A Flash of light. Sheering pain and poof!

315
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:02,351
You're nothing more than a pile of ash.

316
00:33:12,766 --> 00:33:18,388
I'll be alright, just let me sit quitely for a moment.
-You've been sitting quitely for far too long.

317
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:24,842
Tell me, when did doilys of
your mother's dishes become so important to you?

318
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:30,075
I remember a young hobbit,
who was always running in search of elves in the Woods.

319
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:37,369
stay out late and come home after dark,
trailing with muds and dweep and fireflies.

320
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:43,231
A young hobbit who would've liked nothing better than to
find out what was beyond the border of the Shire.

321
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:49,827
The world is not
in your books and maps.

322
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,507
It's out there.

323
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:55,365
I can't just go running off into the blue!

324
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,629
I am a Baggins, of Bag End!

325
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:01,388
You are also a Took.

326
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:07,659
Did you know that your great-great-great, great-uncle
"Bullroarer" Took was so large...

327
00:34:07,694 --> 00:34:09,995
he could ride a real horse?

328
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:16,350
In the Battle of Greenfields, he charged the goblin
ranks - he swung his club so hard...

329
00:34:16,385 --> 00:34:20,820
It knocked the goblin king's head clean off
and it sailed a hundred yards...

330
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:23,173
through the air,
and went down the rabbit hole.

331
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:27,924
And thus, the battle was won
and the game of golf invented at the same time.

332
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:37,630
I do believe you made that up.
-Well, all good stories deserve embellishment.

333
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:43,323
You'll have a tale or two to tell
of your own, when you come back.

334
00:34:46,842 --> 00:34:49,920
Can you promise that I will come back?

335
00:34:50,183 --> 00:34:57,010
No. And if you do,
you will not be the same.

336
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,976
That's what i thought.

337
00:35:01,983 --> 00:35:06,060
Sorry, Gandalf.
I can't sign this.

338
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:09,741
You've got the wrong hobbit.

339
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:20,662
It appears,
we have lost our burgler.

340
00:35:20,813 --> 00:35:24,926
Probably for the best.
The odds were always against us.

341
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:28,037
After all..What are we?

342
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:34,592
Merchants, miners,
tinkers and toy makers.

343
00:35:34,627 --> 00:35:41,298
Hardly the stuff of legend.
-There are a few warrior amongst us.

344
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,330
Old warrior.

345
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:47,954
I 'll take each and everyone of these dwarves
over an army of the iron hills .

346
00:35:49,001 --> 00:35:52,104
For when i call upon 'em, they answered.

347
00:35:52,254 --> 00:35:56,898
Loyalty, honor
and a willing heart.

348
00:35:57,984 --> 00:36:00,452
I cannot ask more than that?

349
00:36:00,604 --> 00:36:05,639
You don't have to do this.
You have a choice.

350
00:36:05,673 --> 00:36:08,522
You have done honourably,
by our people.

351
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:13,260
You have build a new life for us
in the blue mountains.

352
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:17,295
A life of peace and plenty.

353
00:36:18,596 --> 00:36:23,501
A life that is worth more
than all the gold in Erebor.

354
00:36:23,536 --> 00:36:28,626
From my father to my granfather,
This, has come to me.

355
00:36:30,469 --> 00:36:34,452
They dreamt of the day when the dwarves of Erebor
will reclaim their homeland.

356
00:36:36,172 --> 00:36:39,577
There is no choice, Balin.

357
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:43,211
Not for me.

358
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,017
Then, we are with you, laddie.

359
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:52,302
We will see it done.

360
00:37:12,804 --> 00:37:19,975
<i>Far over the misty mountains cold.</i>

361
00:37:20,965 --> 00:37:24,594
<i>To dungeons deep, </i>

362
00:37:24,858 --> 00:37:28,935
<i>and caverns old.</i>

363
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:38,244
<i>We must away, ere break of day,</i>

364
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:48,213
<i>To find our long forgotten gold.</i>

365
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:52,901
<i>The pines were roaring</i>

366
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:57,204
<i> on the height,</i>

367
00:37:57,352 --> 00:38:00,910
<i>The winds were moaning</i>

368
00:38:01,058 --> 00:38:05,321
<i> in the night.</i>

369
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:11,159
<i>The fire was red, </i>

370
00:38:11,311 --> 00:38:15,092
<i>it flaming spread;</i>

371
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:19,858
<i>The trees like torches</i>

372
00:38:19,893 --> 00:38:24,440
<i> blazed with light.</i>

373
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:27,769

374
00:39:03,226 --> 00:39:05,388
Hallo?

375
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,946
Mr. Bilbo, Where are you off to?
-Can't stop I'm already late.

376
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:39,844
Late, for what?
- I am going on an adventure.

377
00:40:56,558 --> 00:41:00,930
-Wait.

378
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:12,042
I signed it.

379
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,375
Everything appears to be in order.

380
00:41:25,514 --> 00:41:32,993
Welcome, Master Baggins,
to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.

381
00:41:37,465 --> 00:41:41,024
Give him a pony.
-No..no...no. That won't be necessary.

382
00:41:41,058 --> 00:41:45,658
I'm sure I can keep up, on foot.
I've done my share of walking holidays.

383
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:08,575
C'mon, Nori. Pay up.
- Thanks much.

384
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:10,561
What's that about?

385
00:42:11,018 --> 00:42:15,033
Oh, they took wagers.
On whether or not you'd turn up.

386
00:42:15,067 --> 00:42:17,784
Most of them bet
that you wouldn't.

387
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:21,503
And what did you think?

388
00:42:25,228 --> 00:42:30,205
My dear fella,
I never doubted you for a second.

389
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:38,773
Horsehair, I'm having a reaction.

390
00:42:40,865 --> 00:42:43,461
Wait.Wait.
Stop!

391
00:42:43,622 --> 00:42:47,265
We have to turn around.
-What on Earth is the matter?

392
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:52,283
I forgot my handkerchief.
-Here, use this.

393
00:42:56,713 --> 00:42:58,664
Move on.

394
00:43:05,495 --> 00:43:08,340
You'd have to manage
without pocket handkerchiefs ...

395
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:13,774
and a good many other things,
Bilbo Baggins.

396
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:20,464
You are born to the rolling hills
and the little rivers of the Shire.

397
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:24,491
But home, is now behind you.

398
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:27,907
The world is ahead.

399
00:44:07,597 --> 00:44:11,729
Hello girl...
who's a good girl?

400
00:44:15,076 --> 00:44:19,548
This is our little secret, Myrtle.
Tell no one.

401
00:44:24,316 --> 00:44:27,576
Wat was that?
- Orks.

402
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:33,933
Orks?
- Throat cutters, there'd be dozens of 'em out there.

403
00:44:34,044 --> 00:44:39,410
The low lands are crawling with them.
-They strike on wee small hours, when everyone is asleep.

404
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:42,631
Quick and quite. No screams,
just lots of blood.

405
00:44:47,188 --> 00:44:50,383
You think that is funny?

406
00:44:50,528 --> 00:44:52,916
You think,
a night raids by Orks is a joke?

407
00:44:53,808 --> 00:44:56,344
We didn't mean anything by it.

408
00:44:56,424 --> 00:45:01,189
No, you did't.
You know nothing of the world.

409
00:45:02,317 --> 00:45:04,661
Don't mind him, laddie.

410
00:45:04,824 --> 00:45:09,511
Thorin has more cause than most,
to hate Orcs.

411
00:45:14,194 --> 00:45:17,160
After the Dragon took the Lonely Mountain ...

412
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:22,848
King Thrr tried to reclaim
the ancient dwarf kingdom of Moria.

413
00:45:24,816 --> 00:45:28,284
But our enemy had got there first.

414
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:45,491
Moria had been taken by legions of Orcs ...

415
00:45:45,526 --> 00:45:50,193
lead by the most vile of all their race.

416
00:45:50,362 --> 00:45:53,499
Azog - the Defiler.

417
00:45:55,634 --> 00:46:00,652
The giant Gundabad Orc
had sworn ...

418
00:46:00,817 --> 00:46:04,357
To wipe out,
the line of Durin.

419
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:12,903
He began by beheading the king.

420
00:46:28,157 --> 00:46:33,046
Thrin, Thorins father,
was driven mad by grief.

421
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:38,442
He went missing, taken prisoner or killed.
We did not know.

422
00:46:39,237 --> 00:46:40,825
We were leader less.

423
00:46:41,623 --> 00:46:46,732
Defeat and death,
were upon us.

424
00:46:49,816 --> 00:46:54,165
That is when, I saw him.

425
00:46:56,256 --> 00:47:01,984
A young dwarfs Prince
facing down the pale ork.

426
00:47:06,796 --> 00:47:11,649
He stood alone
against this terrible foe.

427
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:25,445
His armor wrenth,
wielding nothing but an oaken branch as a shield.

428
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:43,718
Azog the Defiler learned that day...

429
00:47:43,884 --> 00:47:48,188
that the line of Durin will
not so easily broken.

430
00:48:16,287 --> 00:48:21,474
Our forces rallied
and drove the orcs back.

431
00:48:23,209 --> 00:48:27,433
Our enemy,
had been defeated.

432
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:34,326
But there was no feast.
No song.. that night.

433
00:48:34,794 --> 00:48:39,983
Our dead were beyond the count of grief.

434
00:48:40,943 --> 00:48:44,164
A few had survived.

435
00:48:50,978 --> 00:48:54,576
And I thought to myself then...

436
00:48:57,172 --> 00:49:01,309
There is one who I could follow.

437
00:49:03,655 --> 00:49:08,379
There is one,
I could call ' King '.

438
00:49:26,992 --> 00:49:29,769
And the pale ork ...

439
00:49:30,817 --> 00:49:36,505
What's happened to him?
-He slugged back into the hole, whence he came.

440
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:39,976
That filth died of his wounds long ago.

441
00:50:25,473 --> 00:50:30,232
Mr. Gandalf, can't you do something
about this deluge?

442
00:50:30,457 --> 00:50:36,733
It's raining, master dwarf.
And it will continue to rain, until the rain is done.

443
00:50:37,611 --> 00:50:41,498
If you wish to change the weather of the world,
You should find yourself another wizard.

444
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:44,681
Are there any?
-What?

445
00:50:44,682 --> 00:50:45,682
Other wizards?

446
00:50:45,683 --> 00:50:46,683
There were five of us.

447
00:50:47,396 --> 00:50:51,915
The greatest of our order
is Saruman the white.

448
00:50:52,085 --> 00:50:54,841
Then there are the two druidses.

449
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:59,651
And the other
i quite forgotten their names.

450
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:04,800
And who is the fifth?
- That would be, Radagast the Brown.

451
00:51:04,964 --> 00:51:08,685
Is he a great wizard
or Is he...more like you?

452
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:15,502
I think he is a very great wizard.
In his own way.

453
00:51:15,671 --> 00:51:20,315
He is a gentle soul, who prefers
the company of animals to others.

454
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:24,876
He keeps a watchful eye
over the vast forest land, to the East.

455
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,189
And a good thing too, for always evil
will look to find foothold in this world.

456
00:51:37,487 --> 00:51:41,310
Not good.
Not at all good.

457
00:52:05,692 --> 00:52:08,161
No, Sebastian.

458
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:13,842
Good gracious.

459
00:52:34,378 --> 00:52:37,558
Move back.
Give him some air! For goodness sake...

460
00:52:50,178 --> 00:52:53,202
I don't understand why it's not working.

461
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,662
As if it's witchcraft.

462
00:52:58,418 --> 00:53:01,330
Witchcraft ...

463
00:53:02,063 --> 00:53:06,078
Oh, but it is.

464
00:53:06,954 --> 00:53:12,851
A dark and powerful magic.

465
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:49,706
Where on this good earth
did does foul creatures come from?

466
00:54:51,133 --> 00:54:55,934
The old forest?
Show me.

467
00:55:28,645 --> 00:55:32,947
We camp here for the night.
Fili.. Kili, look after the ponies.

468
00:55:32,948 --> 00:55:35,478
Make sure you stay with them.

469
00:55:35,552 --> 00:55:39,508
Farmer and his family
must've lived here.

470
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:42,989
Oin, Gloin, get a fire going.

471
00:55:43,713 --> 00:55:46,569
I think it would be wiser,
to move on.

472
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:51,562
We could make to the hidden Valley drive.

473
00:55:51,725 --> 00:55:55,493
I told you, already.
I will not go near that place.

474
00:55:55,528 --> 00:56:00,029
Why not? The Elves can help us.
We could get food, rest... advice.

475
00:56:00,198 --> 00:56:02,199
I do not need their advice.

476
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:06,296
We have a map, that we cannot read.
Lord Elrond could help us.

477
00:56:06,331 --> 00:56:08,952
Help?

478
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,665
When the Dragons attacked, Erebor
what help came from the Elves?

479
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:19,125
Orcs plundered Moria
and desecrated our Sacred halls.

480
00:56:19,295 --> 00:56:23,088
The Elves looked on and did nothing.

481
00:56:23,253 --> 00:56:28,506
You ask me to seek out the very people
who betrayed my granfather, betrayed my father?

482
00:56:28,747 --> 00:56:30,828
You're neither of them.

483
00:56:30,829 --> 00:56:34,857
I did not give you that map and key
for you, to hold on to the past.

484
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,380
I did not know, nobody ought to keep.

485
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:45,883
Everything alright?
Gandalf, where are you going?

486
00:56:46,052 --> 00:56:49,589
To seek the company of the only one around here
who's got any sense.

487
00:56:49,624 --> 00:56:52,389
And who is that?
-Myself, Mr. Baggins.

488
00:56:52,558 --> 00:56:57,058
I've had enough of dwarfs for one day.

489
00:56:57,228 --> 00:57:02,769
C'mon, Bombur. We are hunger.
-Is he coming back?

490
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:11,402
He'd been a long time..Gandalf.
- He's a wizard. He does what he chooses.

491
00:57:11,569 --> 00:57:16,947
Here, do us a favor.
Take this to the lads.

492
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:38,876
What's the matter?
- We're suppose to be looking after the ponies.

493
00:57:39,045 --> 00:57:43,297
Only we've encountered a slight problem.
-We had 16.

494
00:57:43,467 --> 00:57:49,138
Now there is.. 14.

495
00:57:50,053 --> 00:57:54,514
Daisy and Bungo are missing.
-Well, that is not good.

496
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:58,098
And that is not good at all.
-Shouldn'd we tell Thorin?

497
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:02,343
Ahh no, let's not worry him.
As our official burglar

498
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:04,611
we thought,
you might want to look into it.

499
00:58:04,646 --> 00:58:09,399
Well, look something big
uprooted these trees.

500
00:58:09,568 --> 00:58:14,571
That was our thinking.
-Something very big and possibly quite dangerous.

501
00:58:15,652 --> 00:58:19,237
Hey, There is a light.

502
00:58:19,405 --> 00:58:22,616
Over Here.

503
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,783
Stay down.

504
00:58:29,702 --> 00:58:34,540
What is it?
- Trolls.

505
00:59:02,807 --> 00:59:07,521
We have to do something.
-Yes, you should.

506
00:59:07,686 --> 00:59:11,813
Mountain trolls are slow and stupid,
and you're so small they will never see you.

507
00:59:11,977 --> 00:59:13,980
It is perfectly safe.
We'll be right behind you.

508
00:59:14,148 --> 00:59:17,974
If you run into trouble, hoot twice like a bowl owl..
and once like a brawl owl.

509
00:59:18,009 --> 00:59:22,944
Twice like a bowl owl..once like a brawl owl..
Are you sure this is a good idea?

510
00:59:23,531 --> 00:59:27,947
Mutton yesterday.
Mutton today..and like.

511
00:59:28,116 --> 00:59:33,160
And it all look like mutton again tomorrow.
-quit your groaning.

512
00:59:33,329 --> 00:59:38,209
These ain't sheep.
These's fresh maine.

513
00:59:38,372 --> 00:59:43,291
I don't like horses. I never have...
not enough fat on 'em.

514
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:45,903
But better than that livery old farmer.

515
00:59:45,939 --> 00:59:51,296
All skin and bone he was.
I'm still thinkin' he's bit in me teeth.

516
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:56,758
That's lovely taste..a floater.
-Oh, does improve the flavour.

517
00:59:56,926 --> 01:00:02,556
Oh, more where that came from.
-Oh, no you don't.

518
01:00:04,682 --> 01:00:08,228
Sit down.

519
01:00:15,275 --> 01:00:21,293
You haven't kept these nags.
-But I like the stinky parts.

520
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,583
I said, Sit down.

521
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:29,669
I'm starving.
Are we gonna eat that horse or not?

522
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:33,866
Shut your Cakcom.
You eat what i give ya.

523
01:00:34,671 --> 01:00:38,255
Bert is the Cook
Everything tastes the same.

524
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:43,006
Everything tastes like chicken.
-Except the chicken. That taste like fish.

525
01:00:43,042 --> 01:00:48,596
I'm just saying
a little appreciatio would be nice.

526
01:00:49,636 --> 01:00:54,707
' Thank you Very much Bert'
' Lovely stew, Bert '. How hard is that?

527
01:00:56,975 --> 01:01:01,391
Just need a sprinkle of squirrel there .

528
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,642
That's my grog.

529
01:01:05,273 --> 01:01:08,191
Sorry.

530
01:01:11,193 --> 01:01:14,883
That is beautifully balanced.
That is.

531
01:01:15,715 --> 01:01:21,119
Let me know if it need any else.
Good, in'it?

532
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:26,671
That's how I cook.

533
01:01:33,953 --> 01:01:38,192
Me gags are rumbling.
I've got to snack something.

534
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:41,144
Flesh, I need flesh.

535
01:01:44,677 --> 01:01:48,367
Bert..Look what's come outta me otter.

536
01:01:48,512 --> 01:01:52,338
It 's got arms and legs and everything.
-What is it?

537
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:55,747
I don't know,
but i don't like the way it's wriggling.

538
01:01:58,987 --> 01:02:02,396
What are you then?
An oversized squirrel?

539
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,467
I'm a burglar. A Hobbit.
-A burglar hobbit?

540
01:02:06,634 --> 01:02:11,745
Can we cook him?
-We can try.

541
01:02:13,702 --> 01:02:18,688
He might be more than a mouthful,
not only skin and bone.

542
01:02:18,856 --> 01:02:24,634
There's more hobbit in this part.
More than enough for a pie.

543
01:02:25,546 --> 01:02:28,370
Get him.
- Its too quick.

544
01:02:29,327 --> 01:02:32,400
Oh you little,..
Gotcha.

545
01:02:32,567 --> 01:02:36,415
Are there anymore of you little fellas hiding
where you shouldn't?

546
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:37,416
No.

547
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:41,089
He is lying.
-I'm not.

548
01:02:41,253 --> 01:02:46,449
Hold his toes over  the fire,
Make him squeel.

549
01:02:50,314 --> 01:02:52,934
Drop him!
-You want...what?

550
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:57,505
I said, Drop him!

551
01:03:20,154 --> 01:03:23,772
Get 'em in their stand.

552
01:04:14,603 --> 01:04:17,387
Bilbo.
-No.

553
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:22,520
Lay down your arms,
or we will rip his off.

554
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,577
Don't bother cooking 'em?

555
01:04:40,744 --> 01:04:44,899
Let's just sit on him
and squas him into jelly.

556
01:04:45,063 --> 01:04:49,721
They must be sautd and grilled
with a sprigkle of Sage.

557
01:04:49,885 --> 01:04:52,961
That does sound quite nice.

558
01:04:56,203 --> 01:05:00,192
Never mind the seasoning.
We ain't got all night.

559
01:05:00,361 --> 01:05:06,587
Dawn ain't far away, let's get a move on.
I don't fancy being turned to stone.

560
01:05:08,921 --> 01:05:13,412
Wait, you are making a terrible mistake!

561
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:17,979
You can't reason with them. They are half-wits.
-Half-wits? What does that make us?

562
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:21,391
I meant with the...seasoning.

563
01:05:21,556 --> 01:05:26,009
What about the seasoning?
-Well, Have you smelled them?

564
01:05:26,044 --> 01:05:30,043
You're gonna need something stronger than Sage
before you plate this one up.

565
01:05:30,044 --> 01:05:33,963
Traitor.
-What do you know about cooking dwarfs?

566
01:05:33,999 --> 01:05:38,913
Shut up.
Let the flagger burglar hobbit talk.

567
01:05:39,078 --> 01:05:43,860
The secret to cooking dwarfs...

568
01:05:44,025 --> 01:05:48,437
C'mon...
-The secret is ...

569
01:05:50,674 --> 01:05:54,789
To skin them first.

570
01:05:54,956 --> 01:05:59,151
Tom, get me filleting knife.
-I will get you for this...

571
01:05:59,319 --> 01:06:03,641
I won't forget that.
-What a lot of rubbish.

572
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:09,209
I've eaten plenty wood man with skins on.
Scoffer marks with boots and all.

573
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:14,946
He is right.
There is nothing wrong with bit of raw dwarfs.

574
01:06:17,482 --> 01:06:22,940
Nice and crunchy.
-Not that one. He is infected.

575
01:06:23,676 --> 01:06:28,870
He what?
-He's got worms, in his tubes.

576
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:35,604
In fact, they all have. They're infested with parasites.
It's a terrible business.

577
01:06:35,769 --> 01:06:40,508
I would don't risk it. I really wouldn't.
-Parasites...did he said parasites?

578
01:06:40,672 --> 01:06:44,289
We have no parasites.

579
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:58,338
We are riddled.

580
01:06:58,501 --> 01:07:01,454
What would you have us do then?

581
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:06,774
Let them all go?
You think i don't know what you're upto?

582
01:07:06,937 --> 01:07:11,344
These little ferret
Is taking us for a fool.

583
01:07:11,513 --> 01:07:13,413
Ferrets?
-Fools?

584
01:07:13,424 --> 01:07:16,952
The dawn will take you all!

585
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:21,383
Who is that?
-No idea, can we eat him too?

586
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:49,816
Get your foot out of my mouth.

587
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:03,444
Where did you go to, if i may ask?
-to look ahead.

588
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:07,395
What brought you back?
-Looking behind.

589
01:08:07,563 --> 01:08:11,152
Nasty business.
-Still they're all in one piece.

590
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:12,857
No thanks to your burgler.

591
01:08:14,393 --> 01:08:16,745
He had to mask.
To bade for time.

592
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:24,561
They must've come down from Etinwoods.

593
01:08:24,595 --> 01:08:27,082
Since when did the mountain trolls
venture down far South?

594
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:29,973
They have not ages.

595
01:08:30,632 --> 01:08:34,498
Not since the darker power
ruled this land.

596
01:08:39,033 --> 01:08:43,517
They couldn't have moved in daylight.

597
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:48,001
There must be a cave nearby.

598
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:02,374
What a stench.
-It's a trollenhol.

599
01:09:02,409 --> 01:09:07,549
Be careful what you touch.

600
01:09:18,026 --> 01:09:21,102
Seems ashame, just to let 'em lay around.

601
01:09:21,612 --> 01:09:26,962
Anyone could take it.
-Agreed. Nori.

602
01:09:26,998 --> 01:09:29,635
Get a shovel.

603
01:09:45,302 --> 01:09:48,379
This sword are not made by any troll.

604
01:09:53,326 --> 01:09:57,772
Nor they're made by smiths among men.

605
01:10:02,342 --> 01:10:07,994
These are forged in Gondorlet,
by the High Elves in the first age.

606
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:13,022
You could not wish for a finer blade.

607
01:10:37,129 --> 01:10:43,167
We are making a long term deposit.
-Let's get out of this foul place.

608
01:10:43,269 --> 01:10:46,839
Come on, let's go.

609
01:11:09,944 --> 01:11:13,400
Here. This is about your size.

610
01:11:19,009 --> 01:11:23,656
I can't take this.
-The blade is of Elves make.

611
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:28,867
Which means, It glow blue
when Orcs and Goblins are near by.

612
01:11:29,813 --> 01:11:34,135
I've never used a sword in my life.
-And hope you never have to.

613
01:11:34,171 --> 01:11:37,752
But if you do, remember this:

614
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:42,575
<i>True courage is about knowing
when not to take a life ...</i>

615
01:11:43,317 --> 01:11:47,073
<i>but when to spare one.</i>

616
01:11:50,843 --> 01:11:55,406
Something's coming!
-Stay together.

617
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:59,953
Hurry there.
Arm you.

618
01:12:16,671 --> 01:12:21,518
Thieves. Fire.
Murder.

619
01:12:21,681 --> 01:12:24,125
Radagast.

620
01:12:24,671 --> 01:12:28,156
Radagast the Brown.

621
01:12:30,839 --> 01:12:35,828
What on earth are you doing here?
-I was looking for you, Gandalf. Something's wrong.

622
01:12:35,997 --> 01:12:39,479
Something's...terribly wrong.
-Yes?

623
01:12:44,112 --> 01:12:50,176
Just give me a minute.
Oh, I had a thought, now i've lost it.

624
01:12:50,342 --> 01:12:54,914
It's right there, on the tip of my tongue.

625
01:12:55,084 --> 01:12:59,988
It's not a thought all.
It is a little ...

626
01:13:00,577 --> 01:13:03,679
Stick Insect.

627
01:13:05,866 --> 01:13:11,778
The Green Wood is sick, Gandalf.
A darkness has fallen over it.

628
01:13:12,473 --> 01:13:17,005
Nothing grows anymore,
at least nothing good.

629
01:13:17,171 --> 01:13:21,899
The air is foul decay,
but the worst are the webs.

630
01:13:22,229 --> 01:13:25,907
Webs? What do you mean?
-Spiders, Gandalf.

631
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:30,929
Giant ones.
Some kind of spawn of... Ungoliant.

632
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:33,274
But, I'm not a wizard.

633
01:13:33,309 --> 01:13:38,414
I followed their trail...
They came from Dol Guldur.

634
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:46,688
Dol Guldur?
But the old fort is abandoned?

635
01:13:46,742 --> 01:13:50,390
No, Gandalf.

636
01:13:50,555 --> 01:13:52,767
It is not.

637
01:14:00,287 --> 01:14:07,104
A dark power dwells in there.
Such that I've never felt before.

638
01:14:08,435 --> 01:14:13,485
It is the shadow of an ancient horror.

639
01:14:18,816 --> 01:14:24,098
One that can summon the spirits...
of the dead.

640
01:14:40,746 --> 01:14:42,590
I saw him, Gandalf.

641
01:14:44,027 --> 01:14:49,491
Out of the darkness...
A Necromancer has come.

642
01:14:58,328 --> 01:15:00,952
Quickly.

643
01:15:02,989 --> 01:15:04,986
Wait for me.

644
01:15:17,906 --> 01:15:21,806
Sorry.
-Try this low tribute.

645
01:15:21,904 --> 01:15:24,320
It helps settle the nerves.

646
01:15:27,081 --> 01:15:29,456
Breathe out.

647
01:15:35,852 --> 01:15:40,339
Now... A necromancer?
Are you sure?

648
01:15:53,585 --> 01:15:59,056
That is not from the world of the living.

649
01:16:05,213 --> 01:16:11,017
Was that a wolf? Are wolves out there?
-Wolfs, No, that is not a wolf.

650
01:16:26,635 --> 01:16:29,827
Wargs Orcs. Which means Orc pack is not
far behind.

651
01:16:29,889 --> 01:16:31,401
Orc Pack?

652
01:16:31,454 --> 01:16:34,374
Who did you tell about your quest,
beyond your kin?

653
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:35,375
-No one.

654
01:16:35,198 --> 01:16:38,134
Who did you tell?
-No one, I swear.

655
01:16:38,722 --> 01:16:42,587
What in the name of Durin is going on?
-We are being hunted.

656
01:16:42,909 --> 01:16:44,619
We have to get out of here.

657
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:48,213
We can't, we have no ponies.
They bolted.

658
01:16:48,573 --> 01:16:50,345
I'll draw them off.

659
01:16:50,447 --> 01:16:53,495
These are Gundabad-Wargs.
They'll out run you.

660
01:16:53,602 --> 01:16:59,050
These are Rhosgobel rabbits.
I would like to see them try.

661
01:17:10,901 --> 01:17:13,230
Come and get me.

662
01:17:22,545 --> 01:17:24,064
Come on.

663
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:53,625
Stay together.

664
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:07,912
Ori, No. Go back.

665
01:18:10,871 --> 01:18:13,245
Come on, quick.

666
01:18:15,034 --> 01:18:17,175
Where are you leading us?

667
01:19:26,133 --> 01:19:28,710
Move...
-Run!!!!

668
01:19:45,303 --> 01:19:47,931
There they are.

669
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:51,261
This way.
Quickly.

670
01:20:02,213 --> 01:20:07,513
There is more coming.
-Kili?

671
01:20:11,543 --> 01:20:14,055
We are surrounded.

672
01:20:17,344 --> 01:20:20,870
Where is Gandalf?
-He has abandoned us.

673
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,212
Hold your ground.

674
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:38,017
Kili.

675
01:20:38,566 --> 01:20:42,621
This way you fools.
-Come on, move.

676
01:20:44,495 --> 01:20:47,700
Quickly, all of you.

677
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:51,180
Go..go...go.

678
01:21:01,226 --> 01:21:02,897
Nine, ten ...

679
01:21:04,513 --> 01:21:06,510
Kili.

680
01:21:45,768 --> 01:21:47,696
Elves.

681
01:21:50,563 --> 01:21:54,302
I can't see where the path leads.
Do we follow it or not?

682
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:55,987
Follow, of course.

683
01:21:59,605 --> 01:22:01,769
I think that would be wise.

684
01:22:59,339 --> 01:23:02,526
The Valley of Imladris.

685
01:23:03,256 --> 01:23:07,066
In common tongue
it's known by another name.

686
01:23:07,067 --> 01:23:09,880
<i>-Rivendell.</i>

687
01:23:12,173 --> 01:23:16,401
Here lies the last Holy House,
East of the sea.

688
01:23:18,251 --> 01:23:23,202
It was your plan, all along?
To seek refuge at our enemies.

689
01:23:23,731 --> 01:23:26,723
You have no enemies here,
Thorin Oakenshield.

690
01:23:26,947 --> 01:23:31,762
The only ill will to be found in this Valley,
Is that you bring to your self.

691
01:23:31,829 --> 01:23:36,201
Do you think the Elves,
will give our quest their blessing?

692
01:23:36,583 --> 01:23:38,362
They will try to stop us.

693
01:23:38,508 --> 01:23:42,605
Of course, they will. But we have questions
that need to be answered.

694
01:23:45,868 --> 01:23:50,343
If we are to be successful,
This'll need to be handled with tact and respect.

695
01:23:50,752 --> 01:23:53,888
And no small degree of charm.

696
01:23:54,461 --> 01:23:57,847
Which is why, you'll leave
the talking..to me.

697
01:24:54,762 --> 01:24:59,174
Mithrandir.
-Ahh, Lindir.

698
01:24:59,923 --> 01:25:01,525
Watch out.

699
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:06,832
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

700
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:10,851
My Lord Elrond is not there.
-Not here?

701
01:25:12,164 --> 01:25:14,652
Where is he?

702
01:25:25,895 --> 01:25:29,054
In formation. Connect the rows.

703
01:25:53,176 --> 01:25:56,158
Gandalf.
-Lord Elrond.

704
01:26:13,249 --> 01:26:17,036
Strange, for Orcs to come
so close to our borders.

705
01:26:17,557 --> 01:26:20,951
Something or Someone,
has drawn them near.

706
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:24,121
That may have been us.

707
01:26:28,758 --> 01:26:32,171
Welcome, Thorin, son of Thrain.

708
01:26:32,598 --> 01:26:38,079
I do not believe, we have met.
-You have your Grandfather's bearing.

709
01:26:38,483 --> 01:26:44,959
I knew Thror, when he ruled under the mountain.
-Indeed, he made no mention of you.

710
01:26:55,472 --> 01:27:00,020
What is he saying?
Does he offer us insults?

711
01:27:00,055 --> 01:27:04,569
No, master Gloin.
He's offering you food.

712
01:27:10,563 --> 01:27:14,806
Ah well, like this, lead on.

713
01:27:17,662 --> 01:27:22,365
Try it. Just a mouthful.
-I don't like green food.

714
01:27:23,121 --> 01:27:27,757
Where is the meat?
-Have they got any chips?

715
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:30,527
Kind of you to invite us.

716
01:27:30,621 --> 01:27:34,100
i'd have dressed for dinner.
-Oh, you're never.

717
01:27:54,655 --> 01:27:58,727
This is Orcrist, the Goblin Cleaver.

718
01:27:58,927 --> 01:28:03,422
A famous blade,
forged by the High Elves from the West.

719
01:28:04,008 --> 01:28:06,004
My King.

720
01:28:06,898 --> 01:28:11,426
May it serve you well.
And this is Glamdring.

721
01:28:12,413 --> 01:28:16,237
A ' foe -hammer '.
Sword of the King of Gondolin.

722
01:28:19,145 --> 01:28:20,716
I wouldn't bother, laddie.

723
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:24,402
Swords are named for the great deeds
they do in war.

724
01:28:24,435 --> 01:28:26,731
What do say,
my sword doesn't seen battle?

725
01:28:27,322 --> 01:28:33,038
I'm not actually sure, It Is a sword?
More of a letter opener really.

726
01:28:34,098 --> 01:28:35,757
How did you come by these?

727
01:28:35,812 --> 01:28:39,067
We found them in a trollenhol,
at the great Eastern road.

728
01:28:39,592 --> 01:28:42,675
Shortly before we were ambushed by Orcs.

729
01:28:43,066 --> 01:28:46,648
And what were you doing
on the great Eastern road?

730
01:28:48,266 --> 01:28:50,529
Our business is no for Elves.

731
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:55,871
For goodness sake, Thorin show him the map.
-It is the legacy of my people.

732
01:28:55,906 --> 01:28:59,623
It's mine to protect
as are it's secrets.

733
01:28:59,658 --> 01:29:05,445
Save me from the stubbornness of dwarves.
Your pride will be your downfall.

734
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:09,939
You stand here in the presence of one
of the few in Middle-Earth who can read that map.

735
01:29:10,475 --> 01:29:12,905
Show it to Lord Elrond.

736
01:29:19,836 --> 01:29:22,304
No, Thorin.

737
01:29:30,996 --> 01:29:32,581
Erebor.

738
01:29:33,746 --> 01:29:37,403
What is your interest in this map?

739
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:40,872
It's mainly academic.

740
01:29:40,936 --> 01:29:45,081
As you know, this sort of artifacts
sometime contains hidden texts.

741
01:29:51,003 --> 01:29:54,174
You still read ancient dwergs,
Do you not?

742
01:29:59,657 --> 01:30:01,614
Minas Ithil.

743
01:30:02,037 --> 01:30:06,154
Moon Runes.
-of course.

744
01:30:06,913 --> 01:30:08,908
An easy thing to miss.

745
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:12,218
In this case that is true.
Moon runes can only be read ...

746
01:30:12,253 --> 01:30:15,781
by the light of a moon of
the same shape and season ...

747
01:30:15,816 --> 01:30:18,101
the day on which they were written.

748
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:21,041
Can you read them?

749
01:30:24,913 --> 01:30:28,189
These runes are written
on a midsummer eve ...

750
01:30:28,295 --> 01:30:33,079
by the light of a cresent moon,
nearly 200 years ago.

751
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:37,023
It would seem that
you're meant to come to Rivendell.

752
01:30:37,232 --> 01:30:41,940
Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield.
The same moon shines upon us tonight.

753
01:31:01,588 --> 01:31:06,217
<i>' Stand by the grey stone,
When the thrush knocks ...</i>

754
01:31:06,364 --> 01:31:11,212
<i>and the setting sun with the last
light of Durin's day ...</i>

755
01:31:11,402 --> 01:31:15,886
<i>will shine on the keyhole '.
-Durin's day?</i>

756
01:31:15,921 --> 01:31:18,125
Which is the start of the dwarves
New year.

757
01:31:18,204 --> 01:31:21,011
When the last Moon of
Autumn in the first Sun of the winter ...

758
01:31:21,038 --> 01:31:23,682
appear in the sky together.
This is of news.

759
01:31:24,426 --> 01:31:27,637
Summer is passing.
Durin's day will soon be upon us.

760
01:31:27,718 --> 01:31:29,674
We still have time.
-Time for what?

761
01:31:29,727 --> 01:31:31,248
To find the entrance.

762
01:31:31,294 --> 01:31:35,039
We have to be standing at exactly
the right spot exactly the right time.

763
01:31:35,173 --> 01:31:39,540
Then and only then,
can the door be opened.

764
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:44,914
So this is your purpose, to enter the mountain?
-What of it?

765
01:31:45,317 --> 01:31:48,980
There are some,
who would not deem it wise.

766
01:31:50,002 --> 01:31:51,805
What do you mean?

767
01:31:52,586 --> 01:31:56,764
You're not the only guardian to stand
watch on Middle-Earth.

768
01:33:59,022 --> 01:34:01,293
Bombur.

769
01:34:07,128 --> 01:34:11,426
With or without our help,
these dwarves will march on the mountain.

770
01:34:11,703 --> 01:34:14,328
They are determined
to reclaim their homeland.

771
01:34:14,778 --> 01:34:17,210
I do not believe, Thorin
Oakenshield feels...

772
01:34:17,211 --> 01:34:19,644
that he is answerable to anyone.

773
01:34:19,728 --> 01:34:24,744
No, for that matter, am I.
-It is not me you must answer to.

774
01:34:36,695 --> 01:34:40,929
Lady Galadriel.
-Mithrandir.

775
01:35:00,061 --> 01:35:03,734
I had no idea
Lord Elrond has send for you.

776
01:35:04,057 --> 01:35:07,659
He didn't, I did.

777
01:35:15,991 --> 01:35:21,520
Saruman.
-You've been busy of late, my friend.

778
01:35:22,723 --> 01:35:24,743
Tell me, Gandalf ...

779
01:35:25,097 --> 01:35:30,821
Did you think, these plans and
schemes of yours would go unnoticed?

780
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:32,986
Unnoticed?

781
01:35:33,554 --> 01:35:37,708
No.I'm simply doing
what i feel to be right.

782
01:35:37,772 --> 01:35:41,403
The Dragon is long been your mind.

783
01:35:41,545 --> 01:35:46,456
That is true, My lady.
Smaug owes no allegiance to no one.

784
01:35:46,622 --> 01:35:52,442
But if he should side with the enemy,
A dragon can be used to terrible effect.

785
01:35:52,477 --> 01:35:57,246
What enemy?
Gandalf, The enemy is defeated.

786
01:35:57,594 --> 01:36:02,110
Sauron is vanquished.
He can never regain his full strength.

787
01:36:02,802 --> 01:36:08,260
Gandalf.
For 400 years, we've lived in peace.

788
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:11,397
A hard-won watchful peace.

789
01:36:11,568 --> 01:36:14,193
Are we at peace?

790
01:36:15,528 --> 01:36:20,747
Trolls have come down from the mountains
they are raiding villages and destroying farms.

791
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:25,315
Orcs have attacked us along the way.
-Hardly a prelude to war.

792
01:36:25,399 --> 01:36:29,799
That is we wouldn't meddle.
Looking for trouble when none exist.

793
01:36:30,058 --> 01:36:32,088
Let him speak.

794
01:36:32,592 --> 01:36:38,176
There is something at work
beyond the evil of Smaug.

795
01:36:38,343 --> 01:36:40,452
Something far more powerful.

796
01:36:41,654 --> 01:36:46,790
We can remain blind to it,
but it will not be ignoring us.

797
01:36:46,825 --> 01:36:53,703
A sickness rise among the green woods.
The woodsman who lives there now call it Mirkwood.

798
01:36:53,738 --> 01:36:55,773
And they say ...

799
01:36:56,538 --> 01:37:02,076
Well, don't stop now.
Tell us what the woodsman say.

800
01:37:02,253 --> 01:37:06,509
They speak of a necromancer ?
Dol Guldur.

801
01:37:06,544 --> 01:37:10,765
summoned the dead.
-That is absurd.

802
01:37:10,933 --> 01:37:13,282
There is no such power exists
in this world.

803
01:37:13,317 --> 01:37:18,127
This necromancer
is nothing more than a mortal than a mortal man.

804
01:37:18,294 --> 01:37:22,481
A conjurer, dabbling in black magic.
-And so I thought too.

805
01:37:22,516 --> 01:37:26,459
But Radagast has seen him.
-Radagast.

806
01:37:26,613 --> 01:37:32,082
Do not speak to me about Radagast the Brown.
He is a foolish fellow.

807
01:37:32,217 --> 01:37:36,508
He's odd, i grant you.
Lives a solitary life.

808
01:37:36,543 --> 01:37:40,799
Not that, it is his excessive
consumption of mushrooms.

809
01:37:40,970 --> 01:37:45,537
It addled his brain and yellowed his teeth...

810
01:37:45,572 --> 01:37:50,227
I warned You.
It is unbefitting ...

811
01:37:50,316 --> 01:37:52,610
You carry something.

812
01:37:54,041 --> 01:37:57,449
It came to you from Radagast.

813
01:37:57,662 --> 01:38:02,576
He found it in Dol Guldur.
-Yes.

814
01:38:03,969 --> 01:38:06,511
Show me.

815
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:18,444
What is that?

816
01:38:19,137 --> 01:38:21,898
A relic of Mordor.

817
01:38:32,253 --> 01:38:34,299
A Morgul blade.

818
01:38:34,401 --> 01:38:37,996
Made for the Witch-King of Angmar.

819
01:38:38,098 --> 01:38:40,576
And buried with him.

820
01:38:42,937 --> 01:38:45,092
When Angmar fell ...

821
01:38:45,127 --> 01:38:48,870
names the men of 't North
took his body ...

822
01:38:48,905 --> 01:38:52,308
and sealed in
the high mountains of Rhudaur.

823
01:38:52,414 --> 01:38:55,007
Deep within rock they buried him.

824
01:38:55,632 --> 01:39:01,072
In a tomb so dark
it would never to light.

825
01:39:01,107 --> 01:39:03,084
This is not possible.

826
01:39:03,971 --> 01:39:08,980
A powerful spells lies upon those tombs,
they cannot be opened.

827
01:39:09,015 --> 01:39:14,275
What proof do we have,this weapon
came from Angmars grave?

828
01:39:14,355 --> 01:39:18,062
I have none.
-Because there is none.

829
01:39:18,753 --> 01:39:21,369
Let's examine what we know.

830
01:39:21,485 --> 01:39:26,391
A single Orcs pack, dared
to cross the Breowning.

831
01:39:26,642 --> 01:39:29,994
A dagger from the bygone age
has been found.

832
01:39:30,349 --> 01:39:35,896
And a human sorcerer,
who calls himself necromancer ...

833
01:39:36,062 --> 01:39:39,846
has taken residence
in a ruined fortress.

834
01:39:40,421 --> 01:39:44,470
It is not very much afterall.

835
01:39:44,895 --> 01:39:49,862
But the question of these dwarfs
company however, troubles me deeply.

836
01:39:50,026 --> 01:39:55,540
I am not convinced, Gandalf.
I don't feel like condoning such a quest.

837
01:39:55,879 --> 01:39:59,863
If they'd come to me,
I might've spared them the disappoinments.

838
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:05,946
They're leaving?

839
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:09,181
Yes.

840
01:40:11,277 --> 01:40:14,102
-You knew?

841
01:40:18,271 --> 01:40:21,386
Er is niets anders te zeggen.

842
01:40:22,747 --> 01:40:27,327
My Lord Elrond.
the dwarves, they're gone.

843
01:40:33,036 --> 01:40:37,774
Be on your guard.
We're about to set on the edge of the wild .

844
01:40:38,067 --> 01:40:41,481
Balin. You know this path, lead on.
-okay.

845
01:40:47,435 --> 01:40:51,886
Master Baggins.
I suggest that you keep up.

846
01:41:05,514 --> 01:41:08,392
You will follow them?
-Yes.

847
01:41:08,519 --> 01:41:11,439
You're right to
help Thorin Oakenshield.

848
01:41:11,715 --> 01:41:18,330
But I fear, this quest has set in motion forces 
 we do not yet.. understand.

849
01:41:18,916 --> 01:41:23,020
The riddle of Morgul blade 
must be answered.

850
01:41:23,287 --> 01:41:28,536
Something moves in the shadows, unseen;
hidden from our sight. It'll not show itself...

851
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:33,754
Not yet.
But everyday, it grows in strength.

852
01:41:33,959 --> 01:41:35,947
You must to be careful.

853
01:41:40,643 --> 01:41:42,462
<i>Mithrandir.</i>

854
01:41:43,846 --> 01:41:49,344
Why the halfling?
-I do not know.

855
01:41:52,341 --> 01:41:58,419
Saruman believes that it is only great power..
that can hold the rule in check .

856
01:41:59,771 --> 01:42:02,299
But that's not what I found.

857
01:42:03,236 --> 01:42:07,551
I found that, it is the small things.

858
01:42:07,568 --> 01:42:12,982
Every day deeds of ordinary folk,
that keeps the darkness at bay.

859
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:17,197
Simple acts of kindness and love.

860
01:42:19,053 --> 01:42:21,549
Why Bilbo Baggins?

861
01:42:24,139 --> 01:42:26,538
Perhaps, it's because I'm afraid.

862
01:42:28,521 --> 01:42:30,531
It gives me courage.

863
01:42:35,758 --> 01:42:38,785
Do not be afraid, Mithrandir.

864
01:42:40,915 --> 01:42:43,322
You're not alone.

865
01:44:36,269 --> 01:44:41,553
We must find shelter.
-Watchout!

866
01:44:54,343 --> 01:44:58,247
This is not a thunderstorm.
This is Thunder Battle.

867
01:45:00,059 --> 01:45:01,902
Move!

868
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:11,351
Oh, blast me. The legends are true.
Giants.

869
01:45:11,386 --> 01:45:13,379
Stone Giants.

870
01:45:33,785 --> 01:45:36,473
Fili grab my hand.

871
01:46:54,489 --> 01:46:59,488
No.

872
01:47:06,721 --> 01:47:08,773
No. Fili.

873
01:47:15,487 --> 01:47:18,143
We're still alive!

874
01:47:18,463 --> 01:47:21,844
Where is Bilbo?
-Where is the Hobbit?

875
01:47:22,618 --> 01:47:24,385
There.

876
01:47:30,587 --> 01:47:32,591
Grab my hand. Bilbo

877
01:47:57,241 --> 01:47:59,657
I thought,
we have lost our burgler.

878
01:48:00,157 --> 01:48:03,167
He's been lost, 
ever since he left home.

879
01:48:03,267 --> 01:48:05,183
He should never have come.

880
01:48:05,705 --> 01:48:08,321
He has no place amongst us.

881
01:48:09,275 --> 01:48:11,110
Dwalin.

882
01:48:16,763 --> 01:48:22,511
It looks safe enought. 
Search in the back.

883
01:48:26,147 --> 01:48:28,415
There is nothing here.

884
01:48:29,831 --> 01:48:34,427
Alright then. Let's get a fire started.
-No, no fire, not in this place.

885
01:48:35,309 --> 01:48:39,269
Get some sleep.
We start at first light.

886
01:48:39,934 --> 01:48:43,617
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joins us.

887
01:48:43,809 --> 01:48:46,642
That was the plan.
-The plan has changed.

888
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:50,727
 Bofur, 
Take the first watch

889
01:50:04,654 --> 01:50:06,610
Where do you think you are going?

890
01:50:09,559 --> 01:50:11,128
Back to Rivendell.

891
01:50:13,194 --> 01:50:15,061
-No, you can't go back now.

892
01:50:15,062 --> 01:50:16,062
You're part of the company,
You are one of us.

893
01:50:17,581 --> 01:50:20,393
Not now, am I?

894
01:50:21,050 --> 01:50:24,395
Thorin said I should never have come.
He was right.

895
01:50:24,771 --> 01:50:28,563
You're a took' and i am a Baggins.
I don't know what i was thinking.

896
01:50:29,388 --> 01:50:34,083
I  never ran out my door.
-you are homesick..I understand.

897
01:50:34,238 --> 01:50:36,596
No, you don't. You don't understand.
None of you do.

898
01:50:36,698 --> 01:50:41,229
You are dwarfs.
You're used to tick to this life.

899
01:50:41,264 --> 01:50:44,682
Never sticking in one place,
Not belonging anywhere.

900
01:50:47,931 --> 01:50:50,977
I'm sorry, I don't ...

901
01:50:55,130 --> 01:50:57,529
You are right.

902
01:50:59,706 --> 01:51:02,355
We don't belong anywhere.

903
01:51:09,992 --> 01:51:12,882
I wish you all the luck in the world.

904
01:51:15,547 --> 01:51:17,711
I really do.

905
01:51:21,149 --> 01:51:23,323
What's that?

906
01:51:46,322 --> 01:51:48,698
Wake up.

907
01:52:23,551 --> 01:52:25,637
Take my hand.

908
01:52:52,414 --> 01:52:54,377
Get off me.

909
01:54:41,370 --> 01:54:46,378
Who would be so bold,
to come armed into my Kingdom?

910
01:54:47,052 --> 01:54:50,602
Spies? Thieves? Assasins?

911
01:54:50,809 --> 01:54:54,045
Dwarfs, your malenevolence.
-Dwarfs?

912
01:54:54,797 --> 01:55:00,712
We found them at the front torpish.
- Well, don't just stare 'em. Search them!

913
01:55:01,188 --> 01:55:04,334
Every crack, every crevice.

914
01:55:09,135 --> 01:55:14,519
What are you doing here, indeed?
Speak!

915
01:55:16,593 --> 01:55:22,099
Very well, if they wouldn't talk,
Let's make them squak.

916
01:55:22,260 --> 01:55:26,823
Bring up the mandler.
Bring up the bones breaker.

917
01:55:27,092 --> 01:55:30,183
Start with the youngest.
-Wait.

918
01:55:32,697 --> 01:55:37,722
Well, well..well,
Look who that is.

919
01:55:39,390 --> 01:55:42,941
Thorin, son of Thrain,
son of Thror.

920
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:46,744
King under the mountain.

921
01:55:48,442 --> 01:55:53,614
But I'm forgetting, you dont have a
Mountain, and you're not a King.

922
01:55:53,649 --> 01:55:58,343
Which makes you.. ' nobody '.
Really.

923
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:06,002
I know someone, 
who would pay a pretty price for your head.

924
01:56:06,791 --> 01:56:10,992
Just the head.
Nothing attached.

925
01:56:11,723 --> 01:56:15,733
Perhaps, you know of whom i speak.

926
01:56:15,943 --> 01:56:18,913
An old enemy of yours.

927
01:56:21,004 --> 01:56:26,145
A pale ork, that rides a white Warg.

928
01:56:26,931 --> 01:56:31,084
Azog The Defiler, was destroyed.

929
01:56:32,578 --> 01:56:35,112
He was slayed in battle, long ago.

930
01:56:35,232 --> 01:56:40,060
So you think his defiling days are done.
Do you?

931
01:56:41,285 --> 01:56:47,367
Send word to the pale orc.
Tell him, I have found his price.

932
01:57:37,046 --> 01:57:39,706
Gollem.

933
01:58:07,791 --> 01:58:10,520
Goblinses.

934
01:58:10,755 --> 01:58:15,828
Better than the old bones, Precious.
 Better than nothing.

935
01:58:43,446 --> 01:58:48,699
Too many of bones, precious.
Not enough flesh.

936
01:58:48,734 --> 01:58:54,958
Shut up. Cut the skin off.
Start with the head.

937
01:59:08,193 --> 01:59:14,872
<i>Rocks and stones are like old bones.
No flesh and meat.</i>

938
01:59:15,458 --> 01:59:21,072
<i>Cold as death and without precious,
 good to eat.</i>

939
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:05,887
Blessed, splashes.
Precious, that's a meaty mouthful.

940
02:00:07,534 --> 02:00:10,078
Gollem.

941
02:00:11,312 --> 02:00:15,813
Back up, stay back.
I'm warning you

942
02:00:15,919 --> 02:00:18,044
Don't come any closer.

943
02:00:19,403 --> 02:00:23,733
He's got an Elfish blade,
but it is not an elf.

944
02:00:24,959 --> 02:00:29,330
No, No elfs small.
What is it, precious.

945
02:00:30,329 --> 02:00:31,875
 What is it?

946
02:00:31,910 --> 02:00:37,475
My name is Bilbo Baggins.
-Bagingses?

947
02:00:38,941 --> 02:00:42,442
What is a Bagingses, precious?

948
02:00:42,871 --> 02:00:47,181
I am a hobbit from the Shire.

949
02:00:47,216 --> 02:00:52,826
We like Goblinses, bats
and fishes..but i haven't tried Hobbits before.

950
02:00:53,909 --> 02:00:58,321
Is it soft, is it juicy?
- Stop.

951
02:00:58,670 --> 02:01:03,572
Keep your distance.
I'll use this, if I have to.

952
02:01:04,041 --> 02:01:06,997
I don't want any trouble.
Do you understand?

953
02:01:07,329 --> 02:01:10,602
Show me the way to get out of here,
and i'll be on my way.

954
02:01:10,603 --> 02:01:11,603
Why? Is he lost?

955
02:01:12,721 --> 02:01:16,523
Yes, and I want to get 'unlost'
as soon as possible.

956
02:01:16,952 --> 02:01:21,678
We know safe passage for Hobbitses.
Safe path in the dark.

957
02:01:21,898 --> 02:01:24,178
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.

958
02:01:24,213 --> 02:01:29,835
I wasn't talking to you.

959
02:01:30,007 --> 02:01:34,755
I don't know what your game is, but ...
-Games!

960
02:01:34,864 --> 02:01:39,463
We love games, doesn't we, precious?
Does it like games?

961
02:01:39,633 --> 02:01:42,483
Does it like to play?

962
02:01:42,518 --> 02:01:44,552
Maybe...

963
02:01:45,890 --> 02:01:50,531
What has roots has nobody sees?

964
02:01:50,797 --> 02:01:55,779
Is taller than trees...
Up, up up it goes.

965
02:01:55,975 --> 02:01:58,752
And yet, never grows?

966
02:01:59,947 --> 02:02:02,635
The mountain.

967
02:02:03,851 --> 02:02:09,285
Let's have another one, huh.
Yeah, do it, do it...Ask us.

968
02:02:09,708 --> 02:02:13,089
No, no more riddles.

969
02:02:13,124 --> 02:02:16,470
Finish him off, finish him now.

970
02:02:17,850 --> 02:02:23,003
No, I want to play.

971
02:02:23,171 --> 02:02:28,999
I want to play.
I can see, you are very good at this.

972
02:02:29,927 --> 02:02:35,861
So, Why we don't we game up riddles.

973
02:02:36,181 --> 02:02:39,462
Just you and me.

974
02:02:40,322 --> 02:02:42,791
Just, just us.

975
02:02:42,826 --> 02:02:46,613
Yes, and if i win...

976
02:02:47,183 --> 02:02:50,084
then you show me the way out.

977
02:02:53,161 --> 02:02:56,207
And  if it loses?
What then?

978
02:02:56,242 --> 02:03:00,831
If it loses, precious,
then we eat it.

979
02:03:01,228 --> 02:03:05,113
If Baggins loses
we eat it all.

980
02:03:10,946 --> 02:03:13,402
Fair enough.

981
02:03:17,334 --> 02:03:19,982
But Baggins first.

982
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:28,074
<i>30 white horses on a Red Hill.</i>

983
02:03:28,689 --> 02:03:33,081
<i>First they chant, then they stomp,
and then they stand still.</i>

984
02:03:44,325 --> 02:03:47,574
Teeth?

985
02:03:48,470 --> 02:03:50,538
That's my precious.

986
02:03:50,705 --> 02:03:57,163
But we, we have nine.

987
02:04:00,038 --> 02:04:05,077
Our turn.
Voiceless, it cries.

988
02:04:05,490 --> 02:04:11,504
Wingless, fat less
Toothless, bites.

989
02:04:12,074 --> 02:04:15,409
Mouth missed, mutters.

990
02:04:18,167 --> 02:04:20,026
Just a minute,

991
02:04:21,933 --> 02:04:26,811
We loose, we loose,
Shut up.

992
02:04:33,088 --> 02:04:37,142
It's Wind. 
Of course it is.

993
02:04:37,881 --> 02:04:43,261
Very clever, hobbins is.
Very clever.

994
02:04:43,296 --> 02:04:48,287
A box without hinges, key or lid...

995
02:04:48,322 --> 02:04:52,752
Yet, golden treasure
 inside is hidden.

996
02:04:53,857 --> 02:04:55,899
No...

997
02:04:58,831 --> 02:05:02,592
Key. Money. Box.
-Well?

998
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:04,852
It's nasty.

999
02:05:08,217 --> 02:05:12,483
Give up?
--Give us a chance, precious. Give us a chance.

1000
02:05:25,353 --> 02:05:28,456
Eggsess.

1001
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:37,397
Fun, taught us to suck this. Yes!

1002
02:05:45,203 --> 02:05:48,246
We have a one for you.

1003
02:05:49,007 --> 02:05:53,314
All things, it devours.

1004
02:05:53,635 --> 02:05:58,352
Birds, bees,  trees, flowers.

1005
02:05:58,794 --> 02:06:02,883
Not iron, but still ...

1006
02:06:03,127 --> 02:06:06,847
grinds hard stones to mule.

1007
02:06:08,751 --> 02:06:14,413
Answer us.
-Give me a moment, please. I gave up a long while.

1008
02:06:16,833 --> 02:06:20,468
Please?
I don't know this one.

1009
02:06:20,565 --> 02:06:23,134
Is it tasty?

1010
02:06:24,038 --> 02:06:27,894
Is it scrumtious?

1011
02:06:28,634 --> 02:06:32,945
Is it crunchy?
-Let me think.

1012
02:06:38,188 --> 02:06:40,256
It's stuck.

1013
02:06:41,057 --> 02:06:45,516
Bagginses it's stuck.

1014
02:06:49,278 --> 02:06:51,637
Times up.

1015
02:06:54,649 --> 02:06:59,286
Time...time.
The answer is ' time '.

1016
02:07:01,551 --> 02:07:07,114
Actually, it wasn't that hard.
- Last question.

1017
02:07:08,682 --> 02:07:11,128
Last chance.

1018
02:07:14,727 --> 02:07:16,916
Ask us.

1019
02:07:17,931 --> 02:07:20,620
Ask us..
- Yes, yes. Alright.

1020
02:07:25,333 --> 02:07:29,434
What do I got in my Pocket?

1021
02:07:32,214 --> 02:07:34,746
That is not fair.

1022
02:07:35,006 --> 02:07:38,700
That is not fair.
It is against the rules.

1023
02:07:39,753 --> 02:07:45,210
Ask us another one.
-No, no..no. You said, ask me a question.

1024
02:07:45,275 --> 02:07:49,874
That is my question.
What do I've got in my Pocket?

1025
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:54,608
Must get gueses, must give us three.

1026
02:07:54,953 --> 02:07:57,183
Three gueses, very well.
Guess away.

1027
02:07:57,344 --> 02:08:00,385
Handses.
- -Wrong. Guess again.

1028
02:08:01,993 --> 02:08:06,978
Fish. Goblintanden?
Missed my chances, rat wings.

1029
02:08:08,495 --> 02:08:12,855
Knife. Oh shut Up.
-Wrong again. Last guess.

1030
02:08:12,890 --> 02:08:16,311
String or nothing.

1031
02:08:16,346 --> 02:08:20,195
Two guesses at once,
Wrong both times.

1032
02:08:22,727 --> 02:08:24,482
No...

1033
02:08:25,902 --> 02:08:30,000
I've won the game. 
You promised to show me the way out.

1034
02:08:30,498 --> 02:08:35,778
If we say so, Precious. 
If we say so.

1035
02:08:39,451 --> 02:08:44,307
What has you got in it's pockets?

1036
02:08:45,446 --> 02:08:49,696
That's no concern of yours.
You've lost.

1037
02:08:50,262 --> 02:08:51,968
Lost?

1038
02:08:53,979 --> 02:08:55,628
Lost?

1039
02:08:57,020 --> 02:08:59,153
Lost.

1040
02:09:04,955 --> 02:09:06,600
Where is it?

1041
02:09:07,958 --> 02:09:11,377
Where is it?
No.

1042
02:09:13,895 --> 02:09:16,732
Where is it?
No.

1043
02:09:19,554 --> 02:09:23,649
Lost.
Lost it, precious.

1044
02:09:23,820 --> 02:09:27,406
My precious is lost.

1045
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:34,431
What have you lost?
-Most of precious,

1046
02:09:35,553 --> 02:09:37,864
Gollem.

1047
02:09:51,218 --> 02:09:54,772
What has it got...

1048
02:09:54,942 --> 02:10:00,813
in it's nasty, little pockets?

1049
02:10:10,689 --> 02:10:12,717
He stole it.

1050
02:10:13,518 --> 02:10:16,472
He stole it.

1051
02:10:19,802 --> 02:10:21,987
He stole it.

1052
02:10:46,114 --> 02:10:50,803
I know that sword.
It is the Goblincleaver.

1053
02:10:50,863 --> 02:10:55,633
The Biter. The blade that sliced 
a thousand necks.

1054
02:10:55,668 --> 02:10:59,540
Blast them. Beat them.

1055
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:03,395
Kill them all.
Cut off his head.

1056
02:11:33,564 --> 02:11:37,589
Take up arms.

1057
02:11:39,076 --> 02:11:41,144
Fight.

1058
02:12:16,694 --> 02:12:19,879
Follow me, quick.

1059
02:12:22,356 --> 02:12:24,070
Run.

1060
02:12:31,986 --> 02:12:37,019
Give it to us.

1061
02:12:53,676 --> 02:12:55,873
It's ours.

1062
02:12:56,510 --> 02:12:59,641
It's ours.

1063
02:13:23,757 --> 02:13:26,092
Thief!

1064
02:13:27,715 --> 02:13:30,266
Baggins...

1065
02:14:42,802 --> 02:14:45,367
Cut the rope.

1066
02:15:07,759 --> 02:15:10,286
Quickly.

1067
02:15:23,266 --> 02:15:24,751
Go on.

1068
02:16:31,519 --> 02:16:34,745
You thought you could escape me?

1069
02:16:37,799 --> 02:16:40,349
What are you going to do now, Wizard?

1070
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:51,123
That will do it.

1071
02:17:25,966 --> 02:17:28,026
That could've been worst.

1072
02:17:30,864 --> 02:17:33,629
You've got to be joking.

1073
02:17:39,213 --> 02:17:40,803
Gandalf.

1074
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:49,680
There's too many, we can't fight 'em.
- Only one thing will save us, the lights.

1075
02:17:49,847 --> 02:17:53,031
Run. Here, on your feet.

1076
02:17:59,818 --> 02:18:04,462
Wait, my precious...
Wait.

1077
02:18:05,391 --> 02:18:08,445
Gollem.

1078
02:19:55,168 --> 02:19:59,321
Baggingses. Thiefs.

1079
02:19:59,518 --> 02:20:04,802
Curse it and crash it.
We hate it forever.

1080
02:20:16,935 --> 02:20:20,770
Five, six, seven, eight ...

1081
02:20:20,998 --> 02:20:25,329
Bifur and Bofur. That is ten.
And Fili and Kili. That is twelve.

1082
02:20:25,606 --> 02:20:28,407
And Bombur. That makes thirteen.

1083
02:20:29,147 --> 02:20:33,653
Where is Bilbo?
Where is our Hobbit?

1084
02:20:34,983 --> 02:20:36,720
Where is our Hobbit?

1085
02:20:38,096 --> 02:20:39,823
Curse the halfling.

1086
02:20:40,872 --> 02:20:44,250
I thought he was with Dori.
-Don't blame me.

1087
02:20:44,285 --> 02:20:48,981
Where did you last see him?
-I think i saw him slip away,

1088
02:20:49,102 --> 02:20:52,670
What happened exactly? Tell me.
-I'll tell you what happened.

1089
02:20:52,939 --> 02:20:56,038
Master Baggins saw his chance
and he took it.

1090
02:20:56,499 --> 02:20:59,661
He's thought nothing but his soft bed
 and warm house...

1091
02:20:59,761 --> 02:21:02,047
Since he first step out his door.

1092
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:07,328
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.
He is long gone.

1093
02:21:20,694 --> 02:21:22,542
No, he isn't.

1094
02:21:25,948 --> 02:21:30,805
Bilbo Baggins, I've never been so glad 
to see anyone in my life.

1095
02:21:33,010 --> 02:21:37,136
Bilbo, we've given you up .
-How in hell did you get past the goblins?

1096
02:21:37,275 --> 02:21:38,870
How indeed?

1097
02:21:47,398 --> 02:21:50,413
What does it matter?
He is back.

1098
02:21:51,872 --> 02:21:54,875
It matters.
I want to know.

1099
02:21:56,607 --> 02:21:58,859
Why did you come back?

1100
02:22:01,849 --> 02:22:05,709
I know you doubt me.
I know you always have.

1101
02:22:06,365 --> 02:22:11,708
And you're right, I often think of bag end.
I miss my books.

1102
02:22:12,765 --> 02:22:15,406
And my armchair and my garden.

1103
02:22:16,623 --> 02:22:19,971
See, that's where I belong.
That's home.

1104
02:22:22,063 --> 02:22:24,197
That is why I came back.

1105
02:22:26,586 --> 02:22:29,391
Cos, you don't have one.
A Home.

1106
02:22:30,102 --> 02:22:31,867
It was taken from you.

1107
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:38,077
But I will help you
take it back if I can.

1108
02:23:11,140 --> 02:23:16,690
Out of the frying pan...
-And into the fire...run!

1109
02:24:00,667 --> 02:24:04,728
Quick to the trees. All of you.
Climb up, Bilbo. Climb!

1110
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:18,324
They are coming!

1111
02:25:18,973 --> 02:25:20,757
Azog.

1112
02:27:33,127 --> 02:27:34,718
Fili.

1113
02:28:23,509 --> 02:28:27,341
Mr Gandalf. Help.

1114
02:30:02,847 --> 02:30:04,897
No.

1115
02:30:16,245 --> 02:30:18,509
Thorin.

1116
02:34:06,499 --> 02:34:08,815
Thorin?

1117
02:35:46,855 --> 02:35:52,553
The halfling?
-It's alright. Bilbo is here.

1118
02:35:53,163 --> 02:35:55,191
He is quite safe.

1119
02:36:04,430 --> 02:36:06,112
You.

1120
02:36:09,488 --> 02:36:13,384
What were you doing?
You know you could've got killed.

1121
02:36:16,066 --> 02:36:18,900
Did i not say that
you'd be a burden...

1122
02:36:19,182 --> 02:36:22,461
And you will not survive 
in the wild...

1123
02:36:23,092 --> 02:36:25,820
And you have no place amongst us?

1124
02:36:30,890 --> 02:36:34,513
And I have never been so wrong.
All my life.

1125
02:36:46,945 --> 02:36:51,340
I'm sorry that I doubted you.
-No, I would've doubted me too.

1126
02:36:51,730 --> 02:36:54,941
I'm not a hero or a Warrior.

1127
02:36:56,393 --> 02:36:59,307
Or even a burgler.

1128
02:37:17,435 --> 02:37:20,709
Is that what i think it is?

1129
02:37:35,272 --> 02:37:36,929
Erebor.

1130
02:37:37,997 --> 02:37:39,977
The lonely Mountain.

1131
02:37:40,043 --> 02:37:44,986
The last of the great dwarf kingdoms
of Middle-earth.

1132
02:37:47,094 --> 02:37:49,541
Our Home.

1133
02:37:53,333 --> 02:37:58,022
A raven.
The birds are returning to the mountain.

1134
02:38:01,611 --> 02:38:05,453
That, my dear Oin, is a thrush.

1135
02:38:06,260 --> 02:38:10,394
We will take it as a sign..
a good omen;

1136
02:38:10,429 --> 02:38:15,417
You are right.
I do believe, that the worst is behind us.

1137
02:38:19,898 --> 02:38:21,854
