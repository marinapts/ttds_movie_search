Mom, jewelry selection

5
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:47,109

the evening

6
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,719

13
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,683
you do whatever you want
on honeymoon

14
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,088
if you are opening beers then
send two here.

15
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,036
I don't even believe it. I'm getting married
I'm nervous

16
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,006
it feels like a dream

17
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,179
don't know where is sonal? even

19
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,720
I think papa returned from shop

20
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:09,631
they were all saying that papa has
decorated the shop like a bride

21
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:15,568
Mom was saying that she'll wear Saree
but she didn't change

22
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,808
I've given my mobile to Chintu
he should take photos.

23
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,346
I want to upload photos on Facebook

24
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,710
since Vijay returned from London
he looks handsome

25
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,851

31
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,296
everyone was asking.

32
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:14,067
It's not good for bride and groom
to meet before

33
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,135
I saw the tent guy when I was coming

42
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,654

435
01:36:58,145 --> 01:37:00,887
it was a very good shop I bought gifts
for everyone

436
01:37:28,042 --> 01:37:29,749
words of heart on wall

437
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:35,224
why do you paint all this?

438
01:37:51,899 --> 01:37:53,742
I want to do something

439
01:38:05,779 --> 01:38:10,250
Chada uncle told dad that I should
work in his company

440
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:14,666
I got 80 percent marks that's why
he's very impressed

441
01:38:15,122 --> 01:38:19,662
he told me to handle accounts in
his company

442
01:38:21,829 --> 01:38:26,539
what is dad saying

445
01:38:42,850 --> 01:38:45,660
Don't you trust me.

446
01:38:47,421 --> 01:38:48,456

447
01:39:20,054 --> 01:39:22,364
my business is also very good

448
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:26,365
my dad takes all his shop decisions
after asking me

449
01:39:26,527 --> 01:39:35,174
and I'm going to tell dad that he
should put seating outside to extend

450
01:41:31,718 --> 01:41:35,188
I think we're going the wrong way

451
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:42,631
now your name is Sikander

452
01:42:04,585 --> 01:42:06,724
I think we came to the wrong place

453
01:42:07,087 --> 01:42:09,795
Sikander wrong address

454
01:42:14,361 --> 01:42:16,307

455
01:42:30,677 --> 01:42:34,420
is this the address.
this is the place right?

456
01:42:59,239 --> 01:43:01,344
I need to give this parcel

467
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,206
VJ Lakshmi sent this for you

468
01:44:02,569 --> 01:44:04,344
my mom sent this

469
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:09,782
Vijay Lakshmi address she has
that's why you had to bring it

470
01:44:11,044 --> 01:44:16,392
I can't give her this address and if
she finds out that I work here

471
01:44:16,717 --> 01:44:19,357
she'll die

472
01:44:35,335 --> 01:44:40,648
we're seven sisters and my father
is dead

473
01:44:41,174 --> 01:44:46,089
I'm the son, I must earn money.
It's useless being sad

474
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,621
find some other job

475
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:52,829
this is very difficult job
I would if I could

476
01:44:52,986 --> 01:44:59,301
resection and I even studied commerce
but until I get a job.. this is what I do

477
01:45:00,027 --> 01:45:04,305
government say they will give all
the benefits and money is good

478
01:45:04,431 --> 01:45:08,106
and when money goes to home
it's just money

479
01:45:08,468 --> 01:45:11,108
with it one sister goes to school
two of them to college

480
01:45:11,271 --> 01:45:15,617
and one of them just got married
