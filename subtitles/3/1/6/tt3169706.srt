4

5
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:05,998
<i> But the union

<i>...Of unprecedented violence</i>

11
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,053
<i>and with</i>
<i>the strike now entering</i>
<i>its fourth month,</i>

12
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,489
<i>the government today insisted
that it will push ahead</i>

13
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:34,059
<i>with plans to close 20 pits</i>
<i>with the loss of</i>
<i>over 20,000 jobs,</i>

14
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,694
<i>an action that
Mr. scargill says</i>

15
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,362
<i>will destroy
entire communities.</i>

16
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:39,698
<i>You can
look back in 10 years</i>

17
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,437
<i>and you can say, "in 1984,
I was proud and privileged</i>

18
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,841
<i>"to be a party</i>
<i>to the greatest</i>
<i>struggle on earth."</i>

19
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:53,045
I left my number.
Just in case.

20
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:56,715
<i>Everything's at stake for me.
I'm 27 year old. Right?</i>

21
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,217
Maybe see you on the march,
then?

22
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,384
<i>I'm fighting for their</i>

23
00:01:59,386 --> 00:01:59,384

24
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,621
<i>We've used us savings up,
we've no money left.</i>

25
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,690
<i>All we've got now is us pride

26
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:07,025

on keeping that.</i>

27
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:09,561
<i>The prime minister today
defended her position.</i>

28
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,463
<i>I can't change my style.</i>

29
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,233
<i>It has to be a style
of firm leadership.</i>

30
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,535
<i>One isn't here to be a softie.</i>

31
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,104
<i>You're here to be a good,
firm leader.</i>

32
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,945
Hey, mark,
do you want to play ball?

33
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,046
Tomorrow, buddy.

34
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,815
Here you go, mark.

35
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:30,983
Great. Thanks.

36
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,385
I've spoken to the council
about your deviant parties.

37
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:36,121
There's no need to do that.
Just knock on the door,
we'd let you in.

38
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,090
They're sending a policeman.

39
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:39,391
Oh, I do hope so.

40
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,761
Mark.

41
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,596
Thanks.

42
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,098
<i>...The riot squad,</i>

43
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,433
<i>the helmeted policemen

44
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:51,436
<i>were deployed</i>
<i>after smoke bombs</i>
<i>were thrown.</i>

45
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:51,436
<i>The violence continued...</i>
Thanks, dad.

46
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:56,542
<i>At one stage,</i>
<i>the pickets nearly broke</i>
<i>through the police barricade.</i>

47
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,139
Two, four, six, eight!

48
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,441
Is that copper
really straight?

49
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:32,844
Two, four, six, eight!
Is that copper
really straight?

50
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,313
Two, four, six, eight!

51
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:36,615
Is that copper
really straight?

52
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:40,319
Two, four, six, eight!
Is that copper
really straight?

53
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:42,387
Two, four, six, eight!

54
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,129
Oi, grab hold of this,
will you, mate?

55
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,332
Oh, no, sorry.

56
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,400
Just for five minutes,
till me friends get here.
Come on.

57
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,303
It... it's just that I don't
really want to be too visible.

58
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,471
Is it your first pride?

59
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,872
Yeah,
first anything.

60
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,742
Yeah, well,
this is the best way.
You need to throw yourself in.

61
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,477
The thing is
is that I'm actually
from bromley.

62
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,013
Well, don't worry about that,
we're a broad church.

63
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,214
No, I mean,
it's the train.

64
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,682
It's further out
than people think and I...

65
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,051
Oi,
I've been dragging this thing
on me own

66
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,553
since marble arch.
What, are they buckets?

67
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,688
Surprised you have
to ask that question,
Mike, coming from accrington.

68
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,223
Mike, does anything
get rid of love bites?

69
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,158
No. Where's mark now?
Right,
listen up, everyone.

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,360
Where exactly
have you been?

71
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,362
I want everyone
to take a bucket
and start rattling.

72
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:24,896
This is for the miners.
Miners?

73
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,265
We agreed on a banner, mark.

74
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,699
It's a show of solidarity.

75
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,701
Who hates the miners?
Thatcher.

76
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:32,204
Who else? The police,
the public and
the tabloid press.

77
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:33,606
That sound familiar?
Surely, mark...

78
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,908
The only problem we've got
that they haven't
is Mary whitehouse.

79
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,076
And that can only
be a matter of time.

80
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,045
Mark...
I know, it's not been planned.

81
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,687
It's not been thought through
but it's a really
good idea, isn't it?

82
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,019
Isn't it?

83
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,221
What am I supposed
to do with this?

84
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:50,589
Give it to the lesbians.
They love a banner.

85
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:51,790
Oh, for God's sake.

86
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,393
Right, looks like you're
off the hook, mate. Good lad.

87
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:57,529
Whatever
mark says, we do it.
Don't ask me why.

88
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,178
Disgusting.
Yes.

89
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:26,058
We're collecting
for the miners
and their families, guys.

90
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,795
Gays and lesbians
support the miners
and their families.

91
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,931
I was wondering,
do you need a hand?

92
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,300
Well, well,
if it isn't bromley.

93
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,669
I mean, my last train
is actually not for ages.

94
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,338
Gays and lesbians
support the miners.

95
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,073
Gays and lesbians
support the miners.

96
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,741
Gays and lesbians
support the miners.

97
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,409
...support the miners.

98
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,844
Guys,
support the miners.

99
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,513
Gays and lesbians
support the miners.

100
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,415
- Collecting for the miners.
- Dig deep.

101
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,651
Support the miners.
Come on.

102
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,987
Support the miners!
Support the miners!

103
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,262
It's just a couple
of the lads
from college

104
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,131
and one of them
lives in chislehurst.

105
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,834
<i>So he can't be</i>
<i>too late, either.</i>
<i>I've got my key.</i>

106
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,469
Just mind yourself
on that last train.

107
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:12,270
There's weirdos and
all sorts on there.

108
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,640
Thanks, mum.

109
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:26,017
<i> It makes none,
but now you have gone</i>

110
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:30,622
<i> and you must be
looking very old tonight</i>

111
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:36,395
<i> the devil will find work
for idle hands to do</i>

112
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,335
<i> I stole and I lied and why?
Because you asked me to</i>

113
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:46,037
<i> but now you make me
feel so ashamed</i>

114
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,506
Oi, bromley.

115
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:48,874
Over here.

116
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,182
I'm hiding
from that girl.

117
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,483
Why?

118
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,286
She broke my heart
at a smiths concert.

119
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,556
I've never met
a lesbian before.

120
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,993
Really?
I've never met anyone
who irons their jeans.

121
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,631
I live at home.

122
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,865
No shit.

123
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,500
Is that where you got
that lovely broach?

124
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,004
That's embarrassing.

125
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,173
It's today.

126
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,307
What are you, 10?

127
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,776
I'm 20.

128
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,178
I wouldn't go
spreading that around.

129
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,047
You're illegal,
darling.

130
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,750
Sixteen for the breeders,
21 for the gays.

131
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,252
Did you learn
nothing on that march?

132
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,854
You're still a minor.

133
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,523
Jesus.

134
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,958
Victory to the minors.

135
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,460
Don't make a mess, okay?

136
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,929
They've counted it.

137
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:47,199
Well, come on,
you've collected
as much as anyone.

138
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,634
Stephanie.

139
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,203
Were you with Jeff
in the bell last night?

140
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:55,207
For fuck's sake.
It's a bruise, okay?
My neck is bruised.

141
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:00,312
No red wine
on the floor, please.
Ashtrays.

142
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,247
It was a pretty
good march today.

143
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,449
Not much in the way
of beatings or abuse.

144
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,618
Hardly any petrol bombs
or swastikas.

145
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,320
Is it me or are
the police getting soft?

146
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,023
It's funny.
They've stopped hanging

147
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,425
around outside
our clubs lately.

148
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,627
What's that about?

149
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,069
Do you think
they've finally got sick
of all that Donna summer?

150
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,065
No, never!

151
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:23,502
My guess is they
went somewhere else.

152
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,505
To pick on someone else.

153
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,908
My guess is that
while we're enjoying

154
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,278
a temporary reprieve,
they're here.

155
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,181
Giving these poor sods
the shit we usually get.

156
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:40,852
Now, these mining communities
are being bullied
just like we are.

157
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,454
Right?
Bullied by the police.

158
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,489
Bullied by the tabloids.
Bullied by the government.

159
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,657
Do any of them need a hug?

160
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:49,160
No. What they need is cash,
and they need it urgently.

161
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,363
Yeah, because the miners have
always come to our aid,
haven't they?

162
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,265
Are you fucking kidding me?

163
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,133
Why don't we talk about today?

164
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:59,971
Today, with only
a couple of buckets,
we raised nearly 200 quid.

165
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:03,041
Right,
think what we could achieve
if we really started trying.

166
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,476
I'm from durham.

167
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:06,344
Well, you know exactly
what we're
talking about, then.

168
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,480
I know those bastards
kicked the shit out of me

169
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,449
every morning on
my way to school

170
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,852
and every night
on my way home.

171
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,896
We are
proposing to meet
at least once a week.

172
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,731
And just to do
as many collections as we can.

173
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,100
Oh, and...
And we've got a name.

174
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,238
Lgsm.

175
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,874
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

176
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,075
It's not very catchy.

177
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,144
It's a support group, Steph,
not a skiffle band.

178
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,146
Right, come on.
Let's have a show
of hands, shall we?

179
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:42,981
Who's in?
Guys?

180
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,384
Come on, guys,
please.

181
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,186
Oh, come on, guys.

182
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,821
Is that it?

183
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,156
We've actually been
looking for things

184
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,091
that we could do together
as a... as a couple.

185
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,225
Well, this is perfect.

186
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,894
Youse can
feed the miners
and your relationship.

187
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,363
How many's that?
That's six.

188
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,365
It's better than five.
Not as good as seven.

189
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,900
Jonathan.

190
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,368
Oh, God.
Here come the gay libbers.

191
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,570
Brilliant party, geth.

192
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,105
I'm sure you could use
the back room here

193
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,740
if you're looking
for a base, that is.

194
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,443
We are... uh, we are.
That's amazing,
gethin, thank you.

195
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,111
Well,
what about me and Jonathan?

196
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,347
Or is it exclusively
for the under-25s?

197
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:17,082
Oh, no, of course not.
Everyone's welcome.

198
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,284
<i> touch me, baby,
tainted love </i>

199
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,852
are you sure
Jonathan's interested?

200
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,360
He's at a bit of a loose end
at the moment.

201
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:31,262
He just needs something
to occupy him. A project.

202
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,698
What about
bromley over there?

203
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,967
I've... I've just started
catering college.

204
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,404
Good.
Congratulations, all of you.

205
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:42,607
You're the founder members
of lesbians and gays
support the miners.

206
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,609
Terrific.
Let's bring down
the government.

207
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,116
Support for the miners.

208
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,417
Give generously.

209
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,486
Put your hand in your pockets
for the miners.

210
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,454
Lesbians and gays
support the miners!

211
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,457
<i>National union
of mine workers.</i>

212
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,559
Oh, hello.
I represent a group

213
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,962
called lesbians and gays
support the miners and...

214
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,832
Hello? Hello...

215
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,771
And there's
the desired consistency.

216
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:15,340
It's glossy and wobbly.

217
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,542
Glossy and wobbly.

218
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,650
Jonathan.

219
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,652
Why don't you go
out with them today?

220
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,953
Because I've got
better things to do

221
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,489
than run around
with a bunch of kids.

222
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,660
What happened to
gay lib, Jonathan?

223
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:38,329
I don't know.
What did happen to it?

224
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,366
Is that gethin's boyfriend?

225
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,335
Jonathan. He stabbed
susannah York
with an ice pick.

226
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,440
He's an actor.

227
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:49,607
Support the miners.

228
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,310
Lesbians and gays
support the miners, sir.

229
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,212
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

230
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,381
We've raised money
and we're looking for
a mining community to...

231
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,949
<i>Repeat the name
of the group, please?</i>

232
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,451
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

233
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,653
<i>Somebody will</i>
<i>call you back</i>
<i>in due course.</i>

234
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,556
Sure,
but you've said that before
and we...

235
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,861
They'll call back.

236
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,964
They will.

237
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,934
Mark, face it.

238
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,368
They're on strike.
They're busy.

239
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,970
They don't want
to take our money
because we're poofs.

240
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,972
And a dyke.
They'd rather starve.

241
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,807
Maybe we should just
hand the money
over anonymously.

242
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,342
I mean, we don't have to
say we're gay, do we?

243
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,410
No.

244
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,478
Well, at least then
we'd be helping.

245
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,012
No, this is a gay
and lesbian group

246
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,348
and we are unapologetic
about that.

247
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,050
Jesus, why are you even
wasting time with all this?

248
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,718
Mark.
They will call us back.

249
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,186
It has nothing to
do with the fact
that we're poofs.

250
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,888
And a dyke.
They will call us back.

251
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,490
End of meeting.

252
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,227
They're never
going to call us back.

253
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,628
Someone needs to go with him.

254
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,498
First rule of the group.

255
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,599
I'll go.

256
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:48,900
Thank you, Steph.

257
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:52,270
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

258
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,272
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

259
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,707
Pervert!

260
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,577
First rule of the group,
comrade.
Nobody collects alone.

261
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,280
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

262
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,050
Lesbians and gays support...

263
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,218
Gethin.

264
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,686
Gethin, come on.
You're supposed
to be a bookshop.

265
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,522
We don't have maps, mark.
It's a gay bookshop.

266
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,724
People ask for the poems
of Walt Whitman.

267
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:13,858
I hope there's
a good reason why

268
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:13,858
I've been abandoned
in the street?

269
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,595
Let me just get this right,
so we are going to
pick a mining town

270
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,064
completely at random
and just ring it,
is that the plan, is it, mark?

271
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,266
Yeah, the town hall,
the council.

272
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,400
What, it's as easy as that?

273
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,736
Why not?
We bypass the union
all together.

274
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,437
I think it's inspired.
So do I.

275
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,672
See? Even bromley agrees.

276
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:28,873
Right, here we go.

277
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,644
A-ha.
So, what do we want? Um...

278
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,212
Somewhere north...
Industrial?

279
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,747
Humberside. Is...
Is that a place?

280
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,082
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Give it to me.

281
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,618
If it's miners
you're looking for...

282
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,920
There. Wales.

283
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,154
Of course.

284
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,123
That's a big
fucking coalfield.

285
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,025
That's the brecon beacons.

286
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,764
That's a coalfield, there.
And that is.

287
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:54,165
All right,
and what are we
supposed to do?

288
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,767
Stick a bloody pin in it?
Do you know people, gethin?

289
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:58,069
No, I haven't been
back there in 16 years.

290
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,671
Why not?

291
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,406
Well,
let's just say there isn't

292
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,107
always a welcome
in the hillsides.

293
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,743
Shall I get you
the phone book?

294
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,313
Well, what's the worst
that can happen?

295
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,915
Oh, hello.
I represent a bunch of
screaming homosexuals.

296
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,350
May I inquire
about your communal baths?

297
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,352
What's that got to
do with a strike?

298
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,753
Nothing.
I'd just like to inquire.

299
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,960
All right, all right.
Thank you.
All right. Oi!

300
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:24,562
If we're going to do this,
we need to take it seriously.
Come here.

301
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,767
Right.

302
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,604
0-1-9...

303
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,043
What's the welsh for lesbian?

304
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,473
Hello?

305
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,442
Yes.

306
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,921
I see.

307
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,493
Yes!

308
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:31,496
<i> Solidarity forever</i>

00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:40,071
<i> solidarity forever </i>

311
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,773
it really didn't
occur to you to
get a description?

312
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,341
Well, she were off
the phone that fast.

313
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,276
Maybe we should
try and look
more obviously gay.

314
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,679
Achievable goals,
please, Jeff.

315
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,248
- Shut up. That's him.
- Are you sure?

316
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,916
Oh, my God,
he's coming towards us.

317
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,151
How did you know
it were him?

318
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,385
It's the same
as in a nightclub.

319
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,486
It's all in the eyes.

320
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,554
I'm dai Donovan.

321
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,222
From the dulais valley.
Right.

322
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,757
You must be mark.
Yes, hello.

323
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,825
Hiya. Mike.

324
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:01,893
Steph.

325
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:03,428
Hello.
Joe.

326
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,229
Jeff.
Dai.

327
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:09,767
So, lgsm.
What does that
stand for, then?

328
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,639
You get a garbled message
over the phone.

329
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,873
I thought the l
was for London.

330
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,377
London something.

331
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,913
I never dreamed for a moment
it was l for...

332
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:22,915
Hi.

333
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:28,720
This money you've raised,
it's all from gays
and lesbians?

334
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:31,189
Mostly, yeah.

335
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,493
Right. There we are.

336
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,894
This is just the beginning.
Oh?

337
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,997
Mmm-hmm.
We've got big plans.

338
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:43,167
Well, I'm not going to
pretend I'm not surprised.
You can see that.

339
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:47,138
Truth told,
you're the first gays
I've ever met in my life.

340
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,007
As far as you're aware.

341
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,275
That's true.

342
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,944
And you're the first miner
I've ever met.

343
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,246
Yeah.

344
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,152
Now, I... I want you
to do something for me.

345
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:04,589
I want you to go
back to your community
and convey my thanks.

346
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,290
My personal thanks.

347
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,292
And the thanks
of all the people of dulais.

348
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:11,029
Yeah,
of course we will.

349
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,196
- Won't we?
- Yeah.

350
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,265
Yeah, yeah.

351
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,334
Won't we, mark?

352
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,505
Who fancies a pint?

353
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,312
<i> I'm the shy boy,
you're the coy boy</i>

354
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:32,050
<i> and you know
we're homosapien, too... </i>

355
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,152
you can have five minutes.
Are you sure about this?

356
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,020
Dead sure.
Yeah, but for dai...

357
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,522
Oh, I'm all right, lad.

358
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:38,990
Trust me, dai,
if you can handle this,

359
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,825
it's going to make
a huge difference.

360
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,628
What's he going to do,
take his clothes off?

361
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,896
I'm just going
to say thank you.

362
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,964
Well, don't blame me
if you get bottled.

363
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:56,007
<i>Right, shut up, you fuckers.</i>

364
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,875
Ooh...

365
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:01,212
<i>Thank you. Right, listen.
Some of you know me.</i>

366
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:03,681
<i>My name is mark Ashton.</i>
Commie!

367
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,817
<i>I'm going to invite somebody
onto the stage now</i>

368
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:09,353
<i>who wants to talk to you</i>
<i>and I want you</i>
<i>to listen to him.</i>

369
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:14,258
<i>He comes from</i>
<i>the dulais valley</i>
<i>in South wales and he, um...</i>

370
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,861
<i>Well, he's a striking miner</i>

371
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:19,397
<i>and he has something
he wants to say to you.</i>

372
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,439
<i>I've had a...</i>

373
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:35,446
<i>I've had a lot</i>
<i>of new experiences</i>
<i>during this strike.</i>

374
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,715
<i>Um, speaking in public.</i>

375
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,851
<i>Standing on a picket line.</i>

376
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,087
<i>And now I'm in a...
A gay bar.</i>

377
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,256
Well, if you don't like it,
you can go home.

378
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,293
<i>As a matter of fact,
I do like it.</i>

379
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,895
Ooh.

380
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,396
<i>Beer's a bit expensive,
mind.</i>

381
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:57,568
<i>But really,
there's only one difference</i>

382
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,605
<i>between this and a bar
in South wales.</i>

383
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,874
<i>The women.</i>

384
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,043
<i>They're a lot more
feminine in here.</i>

385
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,684
<i>What I'd really like to say
to you tonight is thank you.</i>

386
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:19,457
<i>If you're one of the people</i>
<i>that's put money</i>
<i>in these buckets,</i>

387
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,827
<i>if you've supported lgsm,
then thank you,</i>

388
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:30,134
<i>because what you've given us</i>
<i>is more than money,</i>
<i>it's friendship.</i>

389
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:31,837
<i>And when you're in a battle</i>

390
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:38,309
<i>against an enemy</i>
<i>so much bigger,</i>
<i>so much stronger than you,</i>

391
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:42,180
<i>well,</i>
<i>to find out you had a friend</i>
<i>you never knew existed,</i>

392
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,817
<i>well, that's the best feeling
in the world.</i>

393
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,653
<i>So, thank you.</i>

394
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,999
<i> When two tribes go to war</i>

395
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:05,102
<i> a point is all
that you can score </i>

396
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,004
oh, my God.
I haven't even
finished this one.

397
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,227
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

398
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,945
Support the miners.

399
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,781
So you're the only girl?

400
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:19,517
That's right.
I'm the l in lgsm.

401
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,756
Good speech.

402
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,191
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

403
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,994
I've worked a few
tough crowds myself
over the years.

404
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,696
In politics?
In panto.

405
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:32,797
Oh, right.

406
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,232
Okay, lgsm,
over here, please.

407
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,800
That's something
else we could use.
What's that?

408
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,335
An official photographer.

409
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:39,637
Jesus, mark.
We don't even have
an official typewriter.

410
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:40,871
Nice and close, please.

411
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,039
I could do it.

412
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,307
I've got a camera.

413
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,009
It's a really good one.
I'd be happy to do it.

414
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,477
All right, bromley,
if you're sure.

415
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,912
Course he's sure.

416
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:51,182
Never let it
be said that lgsm
discouraged youth enterprise.

417
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:52,750
Right, then.
What are you going
to say, "cheese"?

418
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,585
Victory to the miners!

419
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,054
Victory to the miners!

420
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,100
Martin, come on.

421
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,403
Tell them you've run
a whole canteen before.

422
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:13,804
You're not just
packing food parcels.

423
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,206
Go.

424
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,607
And don't look
so bloody worried.

425
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,676
It's not
the first day of school.

426
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,526
What do they need
to come here for?
We sent them a thank-you note.

427
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,228
Every other support group
has been invited.

428
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,629
Every other support group was

429
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:39,964
approved by
the whole committee.

430
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,332
Oh, I see.

431
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,633
Dai had to make
a snap decision.

432
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,235
This is all my fault.

433
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:45,436
He was in London,
Maureen.

434
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:46,937
What would you have done?
Told them to keep their money?

435
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,205
I'll tell you exactly
what I would have done...

436
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:49,807
But they raised
the money.

437
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,375
All right,
I run a civil meeting here.

438
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:54,111
If you want to
scream and shout,
get on the pickets.

439
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:58,149
I don't have a problem
with what they are.

440
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,417
None of us do.

441
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:00,618
It's the men.

442
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,520
Well,
you bring a load of gays

443
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,488
into a working men's club,
you get trouble.

444
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,556
I'm sorry.

445
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,325
No other group
has raised as much money.

446
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,592
I'm not disputing that.

447
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:09,827
Or been so consistent.

448
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,463
Then why don't you
just invite them?

449
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,100
I'm sorry,
but everyone's saying
they don't have a problem.

450
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:19,337
Good, they've
raised the most money,
so invite them.

451
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,339
And who the bloody hell
are you?

452
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,076
- You did what?
- I know.

453
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:29,313
But hefina,
she's like the head honcho,
absolutely terrifying,

454
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,649
well, she obviously
can't stand this Maureen.

455
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:33,651
Kids, mind the fish fingers.

456
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,959
What's the matter?
You told me not to
sell myself short.

457
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,929
I'm not talking about that.
Gays and lesbians!

458
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:46,464
We're trying to
fit in here, sian.

459
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:47,531
What?

460
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,000
Volunteer, I said.
Run the canteen.

461
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,469
They didn't want me
on the canteen.

462
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:52,870
They wanted me
on the committee.

463
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,106
All right,
so keep your head down.
Do the paperwork.

464
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:57,041
Don't start
stirring it all up,

465
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,943
inviting a load of
gays and lesbians.

466
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,811
Oh, it's like that, is it?

467
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,246
You know,
I had you down
as many things

468
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,614
but prejudiced was
never one of them.

469
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,216
I'm not prejudiced.
No?

470
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:08,319
I'm a realist.
I know what small towns
are like, sian.

471
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:10,454
And I know exactly
how those lads
are going to react.

472
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:11,956
You think so?
I know so.

473
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:15,526
I'm standing on
a bloody picket
with them day after day.

474
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:19,697
It was a majority decision.
The committee decided.

475
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,699
Well, I hope you
and your bloody committee

476
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:25,102
can guarantee
their safety, sian,
I do, I really do.

477
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,310
All aboard the deviants bus.

478
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:36,347
No pushing,
no community singing.

479
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:40,818
And absolutely
no back-chatting the driver.

480
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,019
Right, where are we going?

481
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,120
Wales.

482
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,225
Fuck me.
Someone better roll me
a little spliffette.

483
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:51,862
What I'd like to know is
what bromley told
his mum and dad.

484
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,063
Yeah.

485
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,365
I just...
Oh, it's no big deal.

486
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:56,100
Come on.

487
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,369
I said that
I was doing so well at college

488
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:00,604
they were sending me
on a residential course.

489
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,440
Doing what?

490
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,543
Choux pastry.

491
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,447
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

492
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,516
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

493
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:15,186
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

494
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,639
Bit late in the day
for that, isn't it?

495
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,475
That's the fourth one
I've done.

496
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,610
Fast as I put them up,
they pull 'em down.

497
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:41,779
I'm running out of staples.

498
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:02,433
<i> Every woman is
a lesbian at heart</i>

499
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:05,669
<i> every woman is
a lesbian at heart... </i>

500
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,305
you can't possibly say
that every woman is a lesbian.

501
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:09,807
Why not?

502
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,041
'Cause they're not.

503
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,611
Esther rantzen
isn't a lesbian.
My mum's not a lesbian.

504
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:15,446
How do you know?

505
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:16,680
How do I know my mum's
not a lesbian?

506
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,250
What he's trying
to say is you can't

507
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:21,752
make grand,
sweeping generalizations.

508
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:23,554
It's not acceptable.

509
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:29,159
<i> Every woman is
a lesbian at heart</i>

510
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:32,863
<i> every woman is
a lesbian at heart</i>

511
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:36,000
<i> every woman is
a lesbian at heart</i>

512
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:39,937
<i> including Reggie's mum </i>

513
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,437
Look at the map.
We should have
turned left at that village.

514
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,919
How can
that be a village?
It doesn't have any vowels.

515
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,946
- Hang on a minute.
- Yes?

516
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,349
I think so.

517
00:26:58,351 --> 00:26:59,817
Are we here?

518
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,353
We're here.

519
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,193
Oh, my God.

520
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,763
Come on, let's go.

521
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,955
Right, then.

522
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,408
I guess we just...

523
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,310
I think I'm starting
to freak out slightly.

524
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,386
Dai, your gays have arrived.

525
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:21,965
Good to see you again.

526
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,200
Good to see you.

527
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,804
Hi, there. Welcome. Welcome.
Come on in, everybody.

528
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:28,926
Great to see you again.
Great to see you again. Hello.

529
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,275
Come on in.

530
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:34,378
Welcome, everybody.
This is my wife, Margaret.

531
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,713
Hello.
How are you?

532
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:39,183
This is Gail and sian,
who wrote to you.

533
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:42,453
This is hefina,
who chairs
the welfare committee.

534
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:46,690
This is Gwen,
and this is cliff,
our club secretary.

535
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:49,326
Um,
I'm going to officiate you.

536
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:50,661
Oh, good.

537
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,265
Hold that and
name here, please...

538
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,767
Mmm-hmm.

539
00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:00,838
And in the corresponding box,
the group or
organization you represent.

540
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,006
In this case...

541
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,475
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

542
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:05,943
Yep. Quite. Absolutely.

543
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:07,511
Thank you.

544
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:09,079
Thank you very much
for having us.

545
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,382
Now, I'm hoping you can
clear something up
for me about lesbians.

546
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,017
Not now, Gwen.
It's something I was told

547
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,319
in the covered market

548
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:17,521
and to be honest with you,
it did surprise me.

549
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:19,389
Let them get settled
in first, shall we?

550
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,325
Oh.

551
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,626
Now,
who's making the speech?

552
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,428
A... a speech?

553
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,829
It's no big deal.

554
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:28,098
One of you just
has to go up on stage
and say a few words.

555
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,466
Just so we know
who you are, like.

556
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:34,338
I'll tell the band to shut up
and we'll push you on.

557
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,373
And welcome, all of you.

558
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,910
To be honest,
I never thought you'd come.

559
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,491
Anybody else feel like
appointing themselves leader?

560
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,795
Didn't think so.

561
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:09,940
<i> Many Miles from home</i>

562
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:13,811
<i> but I'm walking, walking</i>

563
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:18,982
<i> walking for you</i>

564
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:23,887
<i> walking for you </i>

565
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,498
<i>now, then,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

566
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,968
<i>We're joined once again
by one of our support groups,</i>

567
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,904
<i>lesbians and gays
support the miners.</i>

568
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:47,177
<i>Will you welcome</i>
<i>their spokesman</i>
<i>onto the stage? Thank you.</i>

569
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,118
<i>Thank you, dai.</i>

570
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,088
<i>Thank you, um...
Falling leaves.</i>

571
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:03,627
<i>Actually, dai Donovan
made a speech at our local pub</i>

572
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:06,129
<i>and he's a pretty
tough act to follow,</i>

573
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:10,234
<i>so maybe now is the moment</i>
<i>for my musical tribute</i>
<i>to Judy garland.</i>

574
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,573
<i>Look, we raised this money
because we want to help you.</i>

575
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,176
<i>And that's it.</i>

576
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:23,280
<i>And we'll keep on</i>
<i>trying to help you</i>
<i>for as long as you want us to</i>

577
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:24,514
<i>because we've
been through</i>

578
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:26,316
<i>some of the same things
you've been through.</i>

579
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,490
<i>Listen,
if one in five people is gay,</i>

580
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,459
<i>then one in five miners
must be, too, right?</i>

581
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,930
<i>So that's at least</i>
<i>a fifth of you</i>
<i>who's pleased to see us.</i>

582
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:47,471
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you for</i>
<i>inviting us here.</i>

583
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,072
<i>Thanks.</i>

584
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,480
One, two, three, four...

585
00:31:56,482 --> 00:32:00,684
<i> Them falling leaves,
they say that summer's done</i>

586
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:04,755
<i> the wind and rains,
they say so too</i>

587
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:08,926
<i> but ain't no winter skies'll
ever shadow the sun</i>

588
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,894
<i> while I'm with you </i>

589
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:11,995
night, everybody.

590
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:13,063
Goodnight, dai.

591
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:27,411
There we are. All settled in.

592
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,015
It's teething problems, love.

593
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,284
Everything will be all right
once they start to mix.

594
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,300
I'm not talking
about running away.

595
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,570
I'm talking about
making a dignified exit.

596
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:54,972
Tomorrow before dawn?

597
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,306
We can't just waltz
into a town like this

598
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,607
and expect them
not to...

599
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,742
Slit our throats?

600
00:32:58,744 --> 00:32:59,810
Just be cautious.

601
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,144
I don't know
about anybody else

602
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,480
but I don't have
to travel to wales
to get my head kicked in.

603
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,248
I can very easily
get that at home.

604
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,984
Anyone who wants
to go should go.

605
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:09,052
But I came here to help.
Yeah, but they
don't want your help.

606
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:11,054
Well, they can tell
me that to my face.

607
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:12,990
Until that time,
I'm a member of lgsm

608
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:14,891
and I'm going to do
what I set out to do.

609
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:18,328
No hiding, no running away,
no apologies.

610
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,529
Me, too.

611
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:20,664
Yeah.

612
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:21,865
And me.

613
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,033
And me.

614
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,142
This is a welsh castle,
mind.

615
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:34,678
None of your Norman rubbish.

616
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:40,250
According to legend,
the maiden Sabrina
came here, see,

617
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:43,954
and became the goddess
of the river severn.

618
00:33:43,956 --> 00:33:45,589
How'd she manage that,
then, cliff?

619
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,791
By drowning.

620
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:51,028
"Sabrina fair
listen where thou art sitting

621
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,697
"under the glassie, cool,
translucent wave"

622
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,432
and so on.

623
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,201
I grew up
in northern Ireland.

624
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,670
I know all about what happens
when people don't
talk to each other.

625
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,806
That's why I've
never understood,

626
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:04,975
what's the point
of supporting gay rights

627
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:07,644
but nobody else's rights,
you know?

628
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,513
Or workers' rights
but not women's rights.

629
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:12,816
It's...
I don't know, illogical.

630
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:17,120
There's a lodge banner
down in the welfare,
over 100 years old.

631
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:19,489
We bring it out
for special occasions,
you know.

632
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,024
I'll show it to you one day.

633
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,959
It's a symbol, like this.

634
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:25,228
Right? Two hands.

635
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,131
That's what
the labor movement means.
Should mean.

636
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,233
You support me,
I support you.

637
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,469
Whoever you are.
Wherever you come from.

638
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,971
Shoulder to shoulder.
Hand to hand.

639
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,541
Dai!

640
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,378
There they go.

641
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,780
They're bringing them in
from London, from Bristol.
All over.

642
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,684
They're
pulling the lads in
for anything now.

643
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,152
Well,
they can't do that.

644
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:52,155
There's two from my street
in custody right now.
Lee and Carl.

645
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:54,091
Where's your humanity?

646
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:56,993
We're citizens
of this country, mind.
Citizens.

647
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:59,496
No, I mean,
they can't do that.

648
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:01,565
It's totally illegal.

649
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,568
A police officer has
the right to stop you

650
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,236
if, and that's
the important word here,

651
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:07,904
if he has
reasonable grounds
to believe

652
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:09,506
a crime is going
to be committed.

653
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:11,374
Now, you're absolutely
sure about this?

654
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,443
Police harassment, dear.
I could set it to music.

655
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,678
And if he does?

656
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,113
Then he must
formally charge you

657
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:17,514
within 24 hours
of that arrest.

658
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:19,349
But "reasonable grounds"
means concrete evidence

659
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:21,284
that can stand up
in court.

660
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,520
It doesn't mean
he doesn't like
the look of you.

661
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,589
That's the same
whether you're standing
on a picket line

662
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:28,859
or trolling down
clapham high street
in full drag.

663
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:30,927
Hefina,
tell Martin to mind the kids.

664
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:32,562
Where you going?

665
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,131
The police station.

666
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,466
She's finding her feet.

667
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,136
Right, gentlemen,
listen to me.

668
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:42,405
A police officer
only has the right
to detain a group of people...

669
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:44,641
You need evidence
to stand up in a court of law.

670
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,076
They need concrete evidence.

671
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:47,444
If you keep them
for longer than 24 hours...

672
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:49,746
No proof. No proof.

673
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:52,883
And I will not be
leaving this desk
until you do.

674
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,355
We've got all day,
so chop-chop.

675
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,092
Nobody said anything
about hiding who we are.

676
00:36:02,094 --> 00:36:04,427
Yes, they did. You.

677
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:06,830
I just think if everybody
takes it easy on the...

678
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,098
Flamboyance.

679
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,566
Then we're more
likely to fit in.

680
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:13,570
I'm sorry, just to be clear,
when you say flamboyance,
you mean gay?

681
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,505
And when you say everyone,
you mean me?

682
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,007
Jonathan.
Good.

683
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:20,343
It's just I haven't
spoken 1950s
in quite a while.

684
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,060
Over here, please.
We're packing parcels.

685
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,398
You'll stay for a pint?

686
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,766
No, you're all right, cliff.

687
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:45,802
Welfare's had
a change of atmosphere,
if you know what I mean.

688
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,170
I don't know what
you mean, Lee, no.

689
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:48,939
He means these faggots.
Oi.

690
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:50,507
If it wasn't for
those people over there,

691
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:51,675
you lot would
still be in the Nick.

692
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:52,842
What?
He's right.

693
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:54,678
They make me sick,
that's all I know, dai.

694
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,812
That's enough.

695
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:56,880
Physically sick.

696
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,886
- Gays?
- From London.

697
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,387
They were the ones, Carl.
They got you out.

698
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,822
I thought sian got us out.

699
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:08,758
They told her...
They told her what to say.

700
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,699
Carl.
It's you lot, is it?
The gays.

701
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,434
What's going on?

702
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:19,169
No, it's all right.
It's all right.

703
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:22,505
We're lgsm. Lesbians and gays
support the miners, yes.

704
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:24,608
My name's mark Ashton.

705
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,713
You'll have a pint,
will you, mark?

706
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:45,161
What I was told
about lesbians
really did shock me.

707
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:47,230
It can't be true,
can it?

708
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:49,199
You're all vegetarians?

709
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,836
Actually,
Zoe and I are both vegans.

710
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,779
So, you live together like,
you know, husband and wife.

711
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,581
But what I want to know is...

712
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,349
I know what
you're going to say.

713
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:09,619
Which one does
the housework?

714
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:14,024
Oh, well, that's...
That's not what I thought
you was going to say.

715
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:16,026
Are you joking?
Certainly not.

716
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:17,560
It's embarrassing
enough they spend

717
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,029
one night on
dai's floor, Maureen.

718
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:20,397
From here on in
the hosting committee's

719
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,731
going to bloody
well start hosting.

720
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:25,368
I'm sorry, not me.
I'm concerned about aids.

721
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,903
What?

722
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:30,807
It's not
a trivial matter, sian.
They've issued leaflets.

723
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,475
I don't mind
taking more, hefina.

724
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,412
Not the lesbians so much
because of their cuisine.

725
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:37,814
But I'll take an extra gay.

726
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,317
I tell you
something right now,
Maureen Barry,

727
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,820
if you get aids,
so help me God,
I'll nurse you myself.

728
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,922
Though how you're
going to get aids
from a couple of sleeping bags

729
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,224
in your extension,
I don't know.

730
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:49,459
Listen, it's fine.

731
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:52,295
No. I can take
another one
and so can cliff.

732
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,971
Think it's going to be
that easy, do you?

733
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,306
You just bulldoze
the whole village

734
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,674
into thinking
the same thing as you.

735
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,376
I don't need to
bulldoze anyone.

736
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:08,011
It's you who's
got the problem.

737
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:11,314
They're all in there
getting along perfectly well.

738
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,087
Oh, really?

739
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:34,804
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

740
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:37,140
I'm just talking to
kev about something.

741
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:38,508
You can talk to kev
any day of the week.

742
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,111
Get over there and find
a gay or a lesbian right now.

743
00:39:41,113 --> 00:39:45,148
Look, hefina,
I've shaken their hands.
I've bought them a pint, see?

744
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,416
I don't want to
labor the point, do I?

745
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:48,952
I might, you know,
give them
the wrong impression.

746
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:50,720
Right.
Oh, right.

747
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,656
Because you're so
bloody irresistible,
is that it, Carl Evans?

748
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:55,425
Listen to me.
I've seen you dancing

749
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:57,160
round my back yard
with no clothes on

750
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:58,695
since you were this high.

751
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:01,898
And I can tell you right now,
these gays have
thrown better away.

752
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,200
Now, move yourself. And you.

753

755
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:18,348
this is a first, this.

756
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,884
Men on the dance floor.

757
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:22,819
You can't be serious!

758
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,722
Welsh men don't dance,
do they, sian?

759
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:27,791
Never.
Can't move their hips.

760
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,729
Well, why don't we show them
what they're missing?

761

dance, dance, dance</i>

771
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:03,526
<i> ooh,

772
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:05,829
<i> shame, shame, shame</i>

773
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:10,066
<i> shame on you,
if you can't dance too</i>

774
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,734
oh, my God.
He's amazing!

775
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:16,272
<i> I say shame, shame, shame,
shame, shame, shame, shame</i>

776
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:19,275
<i> shame on you,
if you can't dance too</i>

777
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:20,978
come on! Come on!

778
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:25,582
<i> Don't stop the motions
if you get the notion</i>

779
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:29,986
<i> you can't stop the groove
'cause you just won't move</i>

780
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,255
<i> got my sunroof down</i>

781
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:33,957
<i> got my diamonds in the back</i>
whoo!

782
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,496
Whoo!

783
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:41,898
<i> Shame, shame, shame</i>

784
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,567
<i> shame on you</i>

785
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,804
<i> if you can't dance too</i>

786
00:41:47,806 --> 00:41:52,609

<i> shame on you,

790
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:10,627
<i> I say shame, shame, shame
shame, shame, shame, shame</i>

791
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:14,264
<i> shame on you,
if you can't dance too </i>

792
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,089
God, I miss disco.

793
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,902
Everyone back to mine
for a nightcap.

794
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,104
What? Go to bed, cliff.

795
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,006
I promise I'll do it, man.

796
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:59,809
For God's sake.
He always gets like this.

797
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:02,478
What did I
bloody say to you, eh?

798
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,880
Showing us up in
front of our guest.

799
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:07,150
Don't worry.
You're going to love it.

800
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:09,319
Cheers, mate.

801
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,321
Oi. What the hell
was that about?

802
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:13,189
He's going to give
him dance lessons.
Are you joking?

803
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,391
You'll start
prancing about like that?

804
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:18,161
Listen,
if you're going to spend
the rest of your life

805
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:20,263
standing at the bar
wishing you could
speak to Debbie Thomas,

806
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,564
that's fine by me.

807
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:23,866
I'm going to be
a woman magnet.

808
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:25,768
Where the bloody
hell did you get that?

809
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,346
I don't know
why you're so het up.

810
00:43:36,348 --> 00:43:37,780
They're going in the morning.

811
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,749
Well, this strike matters
to you two, does it?

812
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:41,284
Of course it does.

813
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:44,854
What do you
think people will say
when they hear about this?

814
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:47,423
We're being
backed up by perverts.

815
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,194
You want people
taking the piss, do you?

816
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:54,130
Scabs? Coppers?

817
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,798
Calling us
all sorts of names?

818
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,899
No.

819
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,470
I know one thing.

820
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:03,539
Your father would
never have stood for it.

821
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,649
That went well, considering.

822
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,484
Considering?

823
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:17,987
Sometimes people
can surprise you,
that's all I'm saying.

824
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,056
I never had
a problem with it, sian.

825
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:23,493
Well, I'm glad to hear it,
because this is Joe.

826
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,061
Bye.

827
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:27,797
And he's going to
be sleeping in our house.

828
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,466
How do?

829
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:31,668
Nice to meet you.

830
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,339
No need to do the full
Barry white, Martin.

831
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,741
He knows
you're heterosexual.

832
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,823
This is fine.

833
00:44:56,995 --> 00:44:58,194
I think we should
take him to the door.

834
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,662
No. Just here, please.

835
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:00,897
Just drop me here.

836
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:05,034
All right.
Oh, leave him alone.

837
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,335
Hang on a minute.

838
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,476
What is it?

839
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:14,610
Got to keep up
the fiction.

840
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:20,717
See you.

841
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,425
Mmm. Was it fun?

842
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:33,629
It was the best experience
of my entire life.

843
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:36,232
Making pastry?

844
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:12,668
You wanna start something,
you start it with me!

845
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,604
Lesbians
and gays support
the miners.

846
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:15,738
Thank you.

847
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:27,083
Let's keep
it moving, girls.

848
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:28,317
Just put it in.

849
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,024
Victory to the miners!

850
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:51,474
Lesbian and gays support
the miners.

851
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,309
Any donations, sir?

852
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:59,782
Don't worry about me freezing
to death in Brixton, will you?

853
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:01,450
Aren't you going
to ring your mum?

854
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:03,452
What for?
A long-distance
queer-bashing?

855
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:04,554
Hi.

856
00:47:04,556 --> 00:47:05,822
Here you are, love.

857
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:07,356
Why don't I pretend
to be your girlfriend?

858
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:10,426
That way you get an alibi
and I get to watch
<i>the sound of music.</i>

859
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:12,161
Come to ours, Steph.
Can I?

860
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,397
Yeah.
<i>Orphans of the storm.</i>

861
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,699
No queen's speech.
No Carols.

862
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:18,501
Oh, sounds like heaven.

863
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:19,702
Support the miners.

864
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:24,140
A very happy
Christmas to you, too.

865
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:26,309
<i>There is now a danger</i>

866
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:28,444
<i>that has become
a threat to us all.</i>

867
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:32,014
<i>It is a deadly disease
and there is no known cure.</i>

868
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:33,082
<i>- The virus can be...</i>
- That one for you...

869
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:37,620
<i>...passed during</i>
<i>sexual intercourse</i>
<i>with an infected person.</i>

Aids.

871
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:42,058
Anally injected
death sentence.

872
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,595
Will you switch that off,
please, Tony?

873
00:47:45,597 --> 00:47:47,630
<i>But it's spreading.</i>

874
00:47:47,632 --> 00:47:49,599
Thank you.
<i>So protect yourself.</i>

875
00:47:52,304 --> 00:47:53,203
Hello?

876
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:55,771
<i>Can I speak
to Jonathan, please?</i>

877
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:59,141
Uh, no, he's being creative
in the kitchen, I'm afraid.
Uh...

878
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:00,243
Take a message.

879
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:02,411
I just wanted to thank him
for his beautiful card.

880
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:03,946
Homemade, too.

881
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,150
My husband was particularly
impressed with it.

882
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:10,052
<i>I'll be sure to tell him.</i>

883
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,955
Is that a welsh accent
I can hear?

884
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:15,958
Uh, oh, maybe. The remnants.

885
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,695
I haven't been home
in a long time so...

886
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:20,963
<i>Well,
we're looking forward</i>

887
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:22,198
<i>to seeing them
all back here soon.</i>

888
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,033
And wish Jonathan
a happy Christmas

889
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:25,801
from all of us in dulais,
will you?

890
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:27,303
<i>Of course.
Of course I will.</i>

891
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:28,871
<i>Nadolig llawen</i> to you,

and shared out
as fast as possible, yeah?

907
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,714
What the bloody hell
am I doing?

908
00:49:44,716 --> 00:49:47,450
Right, come on, then,
you heard him.

909
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,253
There's noises
in the village.

910
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:53,122
Small voices.

911

Nothing we can't handle
but...

912
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:56,959
They want to go back?

913
00:49:56,961 --> 00:50:00,830
They've been told they'll save
the pits that go back first.

914
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:05,201
They won't but,
uh, desperate people,
they'll believe anything.

915
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,038
Tell him about the bus.

916

Our bus has broken down.

917
00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:14,577
And our gas
has been cut off, so...

00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,436
This is gethin.
Ah.

927
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:41,771
Hello.

928
00:50:41,773 --> 00:50:43,039
He's a little nervous.

929
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,373
Jonathan.

930
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:45,674
There's no need
to be nervous, boy.

931
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:47,543
With a good
welsh name like that?

932
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,078
Where are you from, then?

933
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,847
Rhyl, originally.

934
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,784
No. No way.

935
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,686
Listen here, see.

936
00:50:57,688 --> 00:51:00,222
We don't mind the gays
and the lesbians, that's fine.

937
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:03,025
But don't you dare
be bringing people
from north wales down here.

938
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,603
Stupid bugger.

939
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:22,678
That bus is a lifeline.
It takes them into the picket.

940
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,147
It takes the food parcels
to the remotest villages.

941
00:51:25,149 --> 00:51:27,183
Without it...

942
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:29,985
<i>All the fours, 44.</i>

943
00:51:29,987 --> 00:51:31,854
We need to start thinking
in larger chunks of money

944
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:33,889
because without it
they're going to fail,
it's as simple as that.

945
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:34,990
I'm sorry,
but when are you going

946
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:36,692
to address my question
about a women's group?

947
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:38,661
<i>Blind 70.</i>

948
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:40,362
Stella, this is important.

949
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:44,100
I know.
But this group has absolutely
no Democratic process.

950
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:46,001
What do you need
a women's group for, anyway?

951
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:47,603
<i>Thee and me, 23.</i>

952
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,171
To address the women's issues.

953
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:51,107
Singly and in
a safe environment.

954
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:53,876
What is unsafe
about this environment?

955
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:55,945
<i>Kelly's eye,
number one.</i>

956
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:57,913
I'm a woman, Mike.
Okay?

957
00:51:57,915 --> 00:52:00,783
I'm also a lesbian
and a feminist.

958
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:04,120
Listen, love, I don't care
if you're Arthur scargill.

959
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:06,021
Don't talk during the bingo.

960
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,526
<i>Tickety-boo, 62.</i>

961
00:52:13,898 --> 00:52:20,002
<i> Drink to me
only with thine eyes</i>

962
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:24,773
Thirty-six.

963
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,409
For God's sake,
leave him alone.

964
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:28,711
He's not a girls' world.

965
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:30,212
But we love him, mum.

966
00:52:31,616 --> 00:52:33,582
Okay. Design speed.

967
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:37,153
It's called
the great Atlantic fault.

968
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:41,657
And, uh,
and it starts here in Spain

969
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,792
and then it goes
under the bay of biscay

970
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,996
and then it comes
up in South wales.

971
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:51,634
And then it goes
under the Atlantic
for Miles and Miles and Miles

972
00:52:51,636 --> 00:52:55,237
and it comes up
again in Pennsylvania.

973
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:56,605
My father used
to talk about it.

974
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:58,307
And mine.

975
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:59,875
The dark artery.

976
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:01,377
That's it. Yeah, that's it.

977
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,513
And you could
take a miner

978
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:08,417
from wales or Spain
or America

979
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:11,854
and you could
show them that seam
and they would recognize it.

980
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:15,891
There's no other coal like it.
It's perfect. Pure.

981
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,999
I lost my younger
brother to that pit.

982
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:25,601
Thirty-six years old.

983
00:53:25,603 --> 00:53:30,072
But without it, these villages
are nothing, they're finished.

984
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,209
That's what I'd say

985
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:37,379
if I ever came face-to-face
with Margaret
fucking Thatcher.

986
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,516
That's what I'd tell her.

987
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,253
The pit and the people
are one and the same.

988
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:50,226
Yeah. Well...

989
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,232
Welcome home, son.
Thank you.

990
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:57,700
Mmm.

991
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,554
Listen to me, everyone.
I just want to say something.

992
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:19,788
Get your feet
off those seats.

993
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,027
- We've let you down.
- No.

994
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:27,029
No, we have.
We haven't collected enough.

995
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:30,199
We haven't raised
enough awareness.
We know that.

996
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:32,268
Now, it's not enough
to always be defending.

997
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:36,171
Sometimes you have to
attack to push forward,

998
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:38,274
and that's exactly
what we're going to do.

999
00:54:38,276 --> 00:54:41,377
When we get back to London,
and you have my word on this,

1000
00:54:41,379 --> 00:54:42,444
we are going to...

1001
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,914
We're going to do
something so spectacular.

1002
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:49,118
It'll be so incredible,

1003
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,353
so effective,
that the national coal board,

1004
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:52,721
I promise you this,

1005
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:55,291
will come crawling
on their hands and knees

1006
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,360
In full drag,

1007
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:03,365
to beg you for forgiveness.

1008
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:05,901
Now, victory!
Victory to the miners!

1009
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:13,242
Well done.
Whoo!

1010
00:55:13,244 --> 00:55:14,510
Victory to the miners!

1011
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:20,616
<i> As we come marching,
marching</i>

1012
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:24,953
<i> in the beauty of the day</i>

1013
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:29,391

1017
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:45,808

1018
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:51,880

Bread and roses!</i>

<i> we battle too for men</i>

1021
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:04,827

1026
00:56:20,478 --> 00:56:26,882

1027
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:36,558

1032

1033
00:56:56,147 --> 00:57:03,218
<i> yes,</i>
<i>it is bread we fight for</i>
<i>but we fight for roses too! </i>

1034
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:07,556
Go back to
where you came from!

1035
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:17,566
We've come to take
back our welfare.

1036
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:18,867
What are you talking about?

1037
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:20,102
From all your bloody queers.

1038
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,336
What the hell's going on?

1039
00:57:21,338 --> 00:57:22,704
There's normal
people who wanna

1040
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:24,006
drink in here as well,
you know?

1041
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:26,041
You listen to me.
Those people in
there are our guests.

1042
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:28,343
Yeah? Well,
they wanna watch themselves.

1043
00:57:28,345 --> 00:57:30,412
Leave it, Martin.
Come on, for God's sake, man.

1044
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:31,780
Come on, leave it.

1045
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,048
Come on, Martin.

1046
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:36,685
You so much as lay one finger
on anyone inside that hall,

1047
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:39,455
and so help me God,
I'll break your bloody arms
and legs for you.

1048
00:57:40,724 --> 00:57:41,924
Come on.
Come back in. Come on.

1049
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,663
Bent bastards!

1050
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:51,767
There you go.
I know it's freezing

1051
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:54,136
but at least
the beers will be cold.

1052
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:55,704
- You want a beer, anyone?
- Yeah, over here.

1053
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:57,439
I've got one,
thanks, dai.

1054
00:57:58,074 --> 00:57:59,741
Here you go, Alan.

1055
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:02,744
"Say not the struggle

1060
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,823
Oh,
that's more like it.

1061
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:23,732
<i> Maybe you want

1064
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:33,375
I'm Gary.
Oh.

1065
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,144
Hi.

1066
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:38,146
I want to
learn to dance.

1067
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:42,751
We need to make
something happen.

1068
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:44,786
Yeah, well,
we do now, yeah.

1069
00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:46,755
Something big. An event.

1070
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:50,692
Something bigger
than we've ever tried before.

1071
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,261
Why don't you come inside?
It's a fraction warmer.

1072
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:54,463
It's morale.
That's the thing.

1073
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:57,866
It's just as
important as money.
We need to keep them up, Mike.

1074
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,701
Because the minute
they start to feel
like a lost cause...

1075
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,403
I know. I know.

1076
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:15,817
And there's nothing worse
than a lost cause.

1077
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:20,222
<i> In my sleep</i>

1079
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,530
I'm in wales

1080

to be something that I'm not.

00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:34,736
I'm home. And I'm gay.

1082
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:36,004
And I'm welsh.

1083
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:37,773
That's right!

1084
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:41,076
Get him another beer
before he starts singing.

1085
00:59:42,313 --> 00:59:45,948
What I don't understand
is why you never
came back before.

1086
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:50,819
My mother.

1087
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,159
She couldn't accept me.

1088
00:59:57,161 --> 00:59:58,360
Not then, perhaps.

1089
00:59:58,362 --> 01:00:01,196
She's religious.

1090
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:03,732
She hasn't said
one word to me in 16 years.

1091
01:00:03,734 --> 01:00:05,734
And what about you?
What words have
you said to her?

1092
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:10,505
<i> It's gone away in yesterday</i>

1093
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:15,177
<i> now I find myself
on the mountainside</i>

1094
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,051
<i> where the rivers</i>
<i>change direction</i>
<i>across the great divide </i>

have you, love?

1096
01:00:25,422 --> 01:00:27,189
I'm a gobby
northern lesbian, Gwen.

1097
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:28,357
I tend to scare 'em off.

1098
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,426
Look.

1099
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:34,429
That's my William.

1100
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,965
Forty-four years
I had him with me

1101
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:40,068
and I wish you as many
with someone one day.

1102
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,937
And as happy.

1103
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,707
Jesus, I'm pissed.

1104
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:47,376
Alan, no!

1105
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:50,278
Give us a hand,
will you, Steph?

1106
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,281
He's thrown up again.
Margaret, I am so sorry.

1107
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:56,051
Alan pritchard,
so help me.

1108

"For many years now

1111
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:08,597
Margaret Donovan

1118
01:01:23,814 --> 01:01:25,647
Well, they want to see
what's going on up here.

1119
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:27,783
They'd have a field day.

1120

Why don't you
come over to dai's?

1121
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,597
Just for a minute.

1122
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:44,299
I think if you met
one or two of them...

1123
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:46,868
Have you seen this, cliff?
About the gays?

1124
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,804
I don't believe
what they say about us, Lee.

1125
01:01:48,806 --> 01:01:50,939
Why should I listen
to what they say about them?

1126
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:52,941
Get inside, you.
And shut up.

1127
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:58,313
You're a respected woman,
Maureen.

1128
01:01:58,315 --> 01:02:01,249
People follow you.
You could set an example.

1129
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,687
You're the backbone
of that committee.
You work hard.

1130
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:08,990
You've been both mother
and father to those boys.

1131
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:11,526
Sitting on your own
in the dark, Maureen?

1132
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:14,796
You wanna take that rod
out of your arse
for a minute.

1133
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:04,846
Good luck.

1134
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,319
Morning.

1135
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:12,754
Thanks.

1136
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:44,286
Hello?

1137
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:47,289
I'm in a phone box
so I'll have to be quick.

1138
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:50,559
I got a story
for your news desk.

1139
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:32,834
Hello, mum.

1140
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,249
Bye, bromley.

1141
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:50,919
See you.

1142
01:05:26,723 --> 01:05:28,643
Hello, sailors.

1143
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,359
Morning, ladies.

1144
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:36,765
Come on, maries.
What are
they going on about?

1145
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,133
...With your bum chum.

1146
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:42,938
- What's going on?
- Wait till you see this.

1147
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:46,174
Jesus.

1148
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:49,744

Unbelievable.

Who did this?

1159
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:19,574
It'll have to
go to a vote.

1160
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:21,643
But I'm warning you, we can do
without this kind of trouble.

1161
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:24,212
This isn't trouble,
it's mischief.
Jesus, man.

1162
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:26,147
We've had worse
than this before now.

1163
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,383
Every day they're
out collecting for us.

1164
01:06:28,385 --> 01:06:29,751
It's the men, dai.

1165
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:32,253
They've already
got their wives
supporting them, and now this.

1166
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:35,256
Gays. The whole country
laughing at us.

1167
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:37,459
It's about dignity.

1168
01:06:37,461 --> 01:06:39,661
It'll have to go to a vote.

1169
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,298
Right.

1170
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,568
They're calling
an emergency meeting.
A vote.

1171
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:49,571
Dai's speaking up
for us, of course,
but it's done a lot of damage.

1172
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:52,133
Yeah, but we're not going
to let a little thing
like this break...

1173
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:54,275
Down! Get down!

1174
01:06:54,277 --> 01:06:55,377
What's going on?

1175
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,092
Bastards!

1176
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:16,097
I don't care
about what they do,
but it's a distraction.

1177
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:18,099
It's distracting people
from the strike.

1178
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:19,801
And then
there's the children.

1179
01:07:19,803 --> 01:07:21,603
I mean,
what example is it
for kiddies

1180
01:07:21,605 --> 01:07:23,805
to have gays
and lesbians roaming around?

1181
01:07:23,807 --> 01:07:25,240
It's unnatural.

1182
01:07:25,242 --> 01:07:28,109
There used to be
a tradition in wales
of honoring your guests.

1183
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:29,310
Do you remember that,
ladies?

1184
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:31,346
Respect? Generosity?
Hefina...

1185
01:07:31,348 --> 01:07:32,714
There's only one
thing that's unnatural

1186
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,015
about this whole
bloody business.

1187
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:36,017
Betraying the community.

1188
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:38,186
And when I find out
who sold that story,
believe me,

1189
01:07:38,188 --> 01:07:41,356
they'll know
what it feels like
to be ashamed.

1190
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,029
What the hell are we doing?

1191
01:07:48,031 --> 01:07:49,397
Now, let's just get
this finished, mark.

1192
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:50,999
No, no, I mean,
what the hell are we doing?

1193
01:07:51,001 --> 01:07:53,401
They would never
have known we were here
if it wasn't for this article.

1194
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,070
So?
So they would
never have found us.

1195
01:07:55,072 --> 01:07:57,038
So, what are you saying, mark,
I should just
send them the bill?

1196
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,140
Do you know how many people
read this paper?

1197
01:07:59,142 --> 01:08:01,543
This is our chance
to do something spectacular.

1198
01:08:01,545 --> 01:08:02,911
We could never
drum up this kind

1199
01:08:02,913 --> 01:08:04,245
of publicity
in a million years.

1200
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:07,015
Mark, don't you
just think we ought to
hold back and regroup?

1201
01:08:07,017 --> 01:08:09,417
There isn't time to regroup.
This is a news item now.

1202
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:10,852
Today.
We have to take
advantage of that.

1203
01:08:10,854 --> 01:08:12,921
They called us perverts.
Bromley,

1204
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:15,557
it's time for
an important part
of your education.

1205
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:18,460
Hands up in this room
if you've ever been
called a name like that.

1206
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:23,898
Now, there is a long
and honorable tradition
in the gay community

1207
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:27,268
and it has stood
us in good stead
for a very long time.

1208
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,503
When somebody
calls you a name...

1209
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:29,571
Am I right about this,
Jonathan?

1210
01:08:29,573 --> 01:08:30,638
Dead right.

1211
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,041
You take it
and you own it.

1212

looking for bands to...

1219
01:08:52,395 --> 01:08:56,097
No, no. No, no, no,
I am in no way

1220
01:08:56,099 --> 01:08:58,259

Cool. Cheers.

1222
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:07,942
Oh, I can probably
get you some more,
next week if you want.

1223
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:09,777
He'll call.
Okay.

1230
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:29,764
They don't have to be gay,
that's the point.

01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,404
Reception.

1233
01:09:39,576 --> 01:09:41,409
It arrived about 10
minutes ago, Barry.

1234
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:45,480
Yeah, well, you could
come down and get it.

1235
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:48,850
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

1236
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:52,020
That's the number
for gay switchboard.

1237
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:55,790
You never know, one of them
might need it one day.

1238
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:57,125
We'll be back
in good time for the vote.

1239
01:09:57,127 --> 01:09:58,259
Right-o.

1240
01:09:58,261 --> 01:10:00,628
Any problems,
we can be reached
at the bookshop.

1241
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:01,863
You're
gonna miss this train.

1242
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:03,031
Rowena Roberts has had a baby.

1243
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:04,432
She needs an extra box.

1244
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:05,733
I can't hear you.

1245
01:10:05,735 --> 01:10:07,068
Rowena Roberts
has had a baby.

1246
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:09,837
Strange.
I can't... I can't...
I can't hear you.

1247
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:10,939
She needs an extra box.

1248
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,820
<i> Some love and pride</i>

1249
01:10:25,822 --> 01:10:31,059
<i> that's what my heart
yearns for now</i>

1250
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:32,961
<i> love and pride </i>

1251
01:10:32,963 --> 01:10:36,130
and the difference is
this is open to everyone.
Okay?

1252
01:10:36,132 --> 01:10:38,032
Gay, straight,
it doesn't matter.

1253
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:40,201
We want people
to come together
to show their support.

1254
01:10:40,203 --> 01:10:42,403
And why should
gay people like me
support the miners?

1255
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:45,473
Because miners dig for coal,
which produces power,

1256
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:48,176
which allows gay people
like you to dance
to bananarama

1257
01:10:48,178 --> 01:10:49,711
until 3:00 in the morning.

1258
01:10:49,713 --> 01:10:50,845
Next question?

1259
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:53,948
Are you all right?

1260
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:56,985
Yes, you. The cute one.

1261
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:00,588
I've never met a pop star.

1262
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,357
I have. Max boyce.

1263
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:04,559
He was playing swansea grand
the year our Jane was born.

1264
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:06,327
What's funny about that?

1265
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:10,064
You need to push the t-shirts
and the badges
as hard as you can.

1266
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:13,635
This is a fundraiser.
Make sure people
are buying stuff.

1267
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:17,405
Is he in charge?

1268
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:18,673
He's the
official photographer.

1269
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:28,249
We don't want it
to be all churchy.
Do you know what I mean?

1270
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:30,018
It's a christening.

1271
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:31,686
Yeah,
but the readings don't all

1272
01:11:31,688 --> 01:11:33,288
have to come from the Bible,
do they?

1273
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:35,590
You can have
all sorts of things
nowadays.

1274
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:37,692
It's more open.

1275
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:44,432
Meeting's tomorrow afternoon.
3:00 sharp.

1276
01:11:44,434 --> 01:11:45,733
We'll make it as long
as we leave early enough.

1277
01:11:45,735 --> 01:11:46,834
And the vote?

1278
01:11:46,836 --> 01:11:48,036
At the end.

1279
01:11:48,038 --> 01:11:49,470
Single question,

1280
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:52,407
can we continue
taking your support
in the light of recent events?

1281
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:53,675
"Recent events."
Mmm.

1282
01:11:53,677 --> 01:11:56,144
You won't have anything
to worry about,
I'm telling you.

1283
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:57,378
When they see
what you make out of this.

1284
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:58,546
If we make
anything out of this.

1285
01:11:58,548 --> 01:12:01,149
Are you joking, man?
You're already famous.

1286
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:02,817
Give it here.

1287
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,054
"Bronski beat are
to headline a benefit

1288
01:12:06,056 --> 01:12:07,722
"for the miners

1289
01:12:09,225 --> 01:12:11,492
"Pits and perverts

"by the London
lesbians' and gay men's
support the miners group."

1291
01:12:14,764 --> 01:12:15,897
Got the name wrong.

1292
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:18,466
"The event is
open to everyone,
gay or straight,

1293

a real festive occasion

1294

"with the mining communities."

01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,544
Five pounds for a t-shirt,
anyone?
Five pounds for a t-shirt.

1297
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:43,224
Don't dawdle, love.
Get indoors.

1298
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:44,559

1299

<i> Can you tell me why?</i>

1313
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:10,244
This is the first gay club
we've ever been to.

1314
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:12,947
Yeah? As a matter of fact,
we're not gay, either.

1315
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:15,049
Oh.

1316
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:16,451
We're miners.

1317
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:25,760
That's perfect.

1318
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:26,928
Hide me. Hide me.

1319
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:28,629
Hey. Why?

1320
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:33,801
If you see Steph,
perhaps you'd give her this?

1321
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:38,239
They want me to
join their breakaway group,

1322
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:40,241
lesbians against
pit closures.

1323
01:14:40,243 --> 01:14:41,609
Strictly women only.

1324
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:43,845
I don't think
I could trust myself,
do you?

1325
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,486
Are you going to
take my picture, then?

1326
01:14:51,488 --> 01:14:54,655

<i>Well, it's incredible</i>

<i>Gay and straight.</i>

1332

<i>Can you see what
we've done here?</i>

1333
01:15:19,616 --> 01:15:21,849
<i>By coming together,
all of us,</i>

1334
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,585
<i>by pledging our solidarity,</i>

<i>Back in our...</i>

1337
01:15:45,675 --> 01:15:48,876
<i>Back in our
miners' lodge, in wales,</i>

1338
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:52,280
<i>we have a banner.</i>

1339
01:15:52,282 --> 01:15:56,217
<i>And it's old, it's very old.
Maybe 100 years.</i>

1340
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:01,188
<i>And it's this,
two hands together.</i>

1341
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,759
<i>Joined like this.</i>

1342
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:08,829
<i>Well, I tell you now,</i>

1343
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:12,400
<i>you've worn our badge,
"coal not dole,"</i>

1344
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:17,438
<i>and when the time comes,
you have my word on this,</i>

1345
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,141
<i>we will wear yours.</i>

1346
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:22,410
<i>Shoulder to shoulder.</i>

1347
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:24,312
<i>Hand to hand.</i>

1348
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:32,353
Come on,
then, that's right.
We're off out for the night.

1349
01:16:32,355 --> 01:16:34,221
I hope you ladies
aren't going to let me down.

1350
01:16:34,223 --> 01:16:37,692
What?
We want to see everything!
Don't we?

1351
01:16:37,694 --> 01:16:38,960
What, everything?

1352
01:16:38,962 --> 01:16:40,194
Even the rubber scene.

1353
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,933
<i> You spin me right round,
baby</i>

1354

<i> right round

1358
01:16:55,778 --> 01:17:00,948
<i> I want your love</i>

1359
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:07,188
<i> I want your love </i>

1360
01:17:10,026 --> 01:17:12,093
Sorry, ladies.
This is a men-only venue.

1361
01:17:12,095 --> 01:17:14,695
Oh, don't be daft, love.
We've come all
the way from powys.

1362
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:19,634
Evening.

1363
01:17:19,636 --> 01:17:21,268
Hello.

1364

<i> Blue-eyed dressed

how'd you get into
that leotard, then?

1369
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,820
Um, talcum powder.

1370
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:40,988
What?

1371
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:43,591
Talcum powder.

1372
01:17:43,593 --> 01:17:47,161
Oh. Lily of the valley, I use.

1373
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:54,402
Mark?

1374
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:58,039
Oh, my God.
Mark Ashton.

1375
01:17:58,273 --> 01:17:59,540
Tim.

1376
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:03,210
Oh, this is insane.

1377
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:06,113
I'm bumping into
everybody tonight.

1378
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:07,648
How are you?

1379
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:12,053
You still changing
the world?

1380
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,689
- Bit by bit.
- Tim, come on.

1381
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,591
I haven't been home
in four days.

1382
01:18:17,593 --> 01:18:19,427
Haven't you?

1383
01:18:19,429 --> 01:18:21,395
I'm on a farewell tour.

1384

Where are you going?

1385
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:38,679
You are a beautiful man,
mark.

1386
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:42,683
I miss you.

1387
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:47,655
Please take care
of yourself. Okay?

1388
01:18:47,657 --> 01:18:48,956
Please.

1389
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:50,024
Come on.

1390
01:18:50,026 --> 01:18:51,092
Please take care.

1391
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:02,236
Come on,
then, girls.
That's enough.

1392
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:06,240
Back to ours.
Bedtime. Come on.

1393
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:08,709
I'm sorry.
Don't worry.

1394
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:10,077
You're lighter
than your husband.

1395
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,545
Mmm.

1396
01:19:11,547 --> 01:19:15,349
Do you know what I was
when I met Alan?

1397
01:19:15,351 --> 01:19:16,617
Drunk?

1398
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:19,086
Sixteen.

1399
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:22,156
Think that's ridiculous?

1400
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:25,760
I was pretty then.

1401
01:19:25,762 --> 01:19:27,094
You're pretty now.

1402
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:31,599
It all goes South,
doesn't it?

1403
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:35,236
Love. Looks.
Everything.

1404
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:36,804
That's cheery.

1405
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:38,672
Sod it.

1406
01:19:38,674 --> 01:19:41,509
I always thought sex was
for the men, really, anyway.

1407
01:19:41,511 --> 01:19:44,378
We just put up
with it, don't we?
Keep them quiet.

1408
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:45,846
Okay.

1409
01:19:45,848 --> 01:19:48,916
I will listen to
a certain amount
of drunken bollocks, Gail,

1410
01:19:48,918 --> 01:19:50,985
but sex is not
just for the men,

1411
01:19:50,987 --> 01:19:52,987
it's for the women, too.
Believe me.

1412
01:20:04,901 --> 01:20:06,934
Oh, yeah.

1413
01:20:06,936 --> 01:20:08,936
Gail, come on.

1414
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:21,315
No carpets.

1415
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:24,685
This is Laura Ashley.
I've seen it before.

1416
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:28,055
Where?
Cardiff.

1417
01:20:28,057 --> 01:20:29,557
What I
want to know is...

1418
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:32,159
What's this?

1419
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:36,163
Hefina, you put
that back immediately.

1420
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:37,832
That's nothing.

1421
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:39,400
Here,
look what else I've found.

1422
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:41,669
You never
went under his bed.

1423
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:48,409
When was the last time
you saw anything like that?

1424
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:50,177
Huh? When? When?

1425
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:58,185
Don't those women
ever sleep?

1426
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,359
Jesus, God,
that takes me back.

1427
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:55,876
Mum.

1428
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:21,101
So, what were
their names again, boys?

1429
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:22,736
Mine was Jess.

1430
01:22:22,738 --> 01:22:24,038
And mine was Carol.

1431
01:22:25,908 --> 01:22:27,207
Six
straight people asked me

1432
01:22:27,209 --> 01:22:28,442
if they could
join us last night.

1433
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:30,110
You're joking?
We should set
up another group.

1434
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:31,832
Straights supporting gays
supporting miners.

1435
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:42,356
Right, that's it,
we're off.

1436
01:22:42,358 --> 01:22:43,624
What about bromley?

1437
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:45,192
He's too late.
You've got
a meeting to get to.

1438
01:22:45,194 --> 01:22:46,593
The vote, remember?

1439
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:49,063
Okay.

1440
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:50,698
Surely you've got
his number, Steph?

1441
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,733
Nobody's got his number.
He still lives at home.

1442
01:22:52,735 --> 01:22:55,069
I'm sorry, but mark's right.
If we're going to
get there by 3:00...

1443
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:56,503
He's blown it.
Come on, let's go.

1444
01:22:56,505 --> 01:22:57,871
Oh. What a shame.

1445
01:22:57,873 --> 01:22:59,540
He was sucking face
till the lights came up.

1446
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:01,875
I wouldn't waste any time
feeling sorry for him.

1447
01:23:01,877 --> 01:23:04,011
Can I please
have an aspirin?

1448
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,518
<i>What the hell's this?</i>

1449
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,354
Plans change, cliff.
It's not my fault.

1450
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:50,190
No answer.

1451
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:51,291
They must be on their way.

1452
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:54,094
Okay.

1453
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:56,830
I can't speak in front
of all these people, cliff.

1454
01:23:56,832 --> 01:23:58,332
I can't.

1455
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:12,279
I know you think
you know what you want,
Joe, but you're so young.

1456
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:16,550
That's what the law's for,
to protect you.

1457
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:31,098
I didn't know
who I was at your age.

1458
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:38,739
It's such
a terrible life, Joe.

1459
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:42,943
It's lonely.

1460
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:46,080
Is that what you want?

1461
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:48,982
No family?

1462
01:24:49,884 --> 01:24:52,786
Hiding from people at work,
from everyone?

1463
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,222
Keeping secrets?

1464
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,767
Come here.

1465
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:09,837
Oh.

1466
01:25:09,839 --> 01:25:13,273
<i>So now cliff will speak
on behalf of the lgsm.</i>

1467
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:14,908
The floor's yours, cliff.

1468
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:25,085
Um... w...

1469
01:25:25,087 --> 01:25:28,122
Well,
what I want to say abo...

1470
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:32,526
About the gays and lesbians...

1471
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:34,294
Why don't you do
us a poem, cliff?

1472
01:25:35,931 --> 01:25:38,298
Poem! Poem! Poem!

1473
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,933
Poem! Poem! Poem!

1474
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:45,139
I want to propose that
this meeting is unlawful.

1475
01:25:45,141 --> 01:25:48,542
I want to propose
that this meeting
was brought forward unlawfully

1476
01:25:48,544 --> 01:25:49,977
and that most
of the people here

1477
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:52,045
aren't even
from this village.
All right.

1478
01:25:52,047 --> 01:25:54,882
All right.
Let's bring it
forward to the vote.

1479
01:25:59,955 --> 01:26:01,155
There we go.

1480
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:03,757
Two hours to spare.

1481
01:26:03,759 --> 01:26:07,761
Hefina heddon, you drive
like a bloody lunatic.

1482
01:26:07,763 --> 01:26:09,530
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1483
01:26:10,265 --> 01:26:11,632
Gwen, look after the gays.

1484
01:26:11,634 --> 01:26:12,900
Right-o.

1485
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:22,342
3:00.

1486
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:24,411
You can't dictate
when the committee sits.

1487
01:26:24,413 --> 01:26:25,846
You told us 3:00.

1488
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:27,281
And then we had to change it.

1489
01:26:27,283 --> 01:26:28,382
Bloody disgusting
way to behave.

1490
01:26:28,384 --> 01:26:29,449
If you weren't up in London...

1491
01:26:29,451 --> 01:26:31,418
It's invalid.
This whole decision
is invalid.

1492
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:32,586
We can fight it.

1493
01:26:32,588 --> 01:26:33,654
We've got one fight, dai.

1494
01:26:33,656 --> 01:26:34,821
The fucking strike.

1495
01:26:34,823 --> 01:26:36,924
Or have you
forgotten that, all of you?

1496
01:26:36,926 --> 01:26:39,026
Dancing around in London.

1497
01:26:39,028 --> 01:26:42,262
The trouble with those people
is they jump on the bandwagon.

1498
01:26:42,264 --> 01:26:43,997
- What?
- It's well known.

1499
01:26:43,999 --> 01:26:46,200
They pretend
they're backing you,
but what they're really doing

1500
01:26:46,202 --> 01:26:48,502
is pushing their own agenda.

1501
01:26:48,504 --> 01:26:49,636
Gay rights.

1502
01:26:49,638 --> 01:26:50,704
What?

1503
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,273
We've seen articles,
hefina.

1504
01:26:53,275 --> 01:26:55,709
Christ Jesus help me.

1505
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:58,879
You better shut her mouth
or I'm going to
do it permanently.

1506
01:27:00,282 --> 01:27:01,615
No, come on,
that's enough.

1507
01:27:01,617 --> 01:27:03,817
An official
letter will be sent.

1508
01:27:03,819 --> 01:27:06,320
I can't...
I can't listen to this.

1509
01:27:06,322 --> 01:27:08,155
To thank them
most sincerely.

1510
01:27:08,157 --> 01:27:12,392
But the vote was
we won't be accepting
their support any more.

1511
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:14,554
They're causing
us embarrassment,
dai, that's the thing.

1512
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:17,497
And we're not
strong enough, not now.

1513
01:27:17,499 --> 01:27:19,700
We're struggling
to survive as it is.

1514
01:27:19,702 --> 01:27:21,435
Oh, that reminds me.

1515
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:29,977
Courtesy of those people
and their agenda.

1516
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,447
Jesus Christ.

1517
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:37,150
I don't suppose you opened
your mouth, did you?

1518
01:27:37,152 --> 01:27:38,785
Didn't want to
rock the boat,
is that it?

1519
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:43,991
There's bloody thousands
here.

1520
01:27:50,231 --> 01:27:52,399
You think you've known
someone your whole life.

1521
01:27:52,401 --> 01:27:54,701
Turns out they're
a complete stranger.

1522
01:27:54,703 --> 01:27:57,204
I'd say the same
about you, cliff.

1523
01:27:57,206 --> 01:27:59,006
I'll tell you something.
If you think this is what

1524
01:27:59,008 --> 01:28:01,942
my brother would have wanted,
you're wrong.

1525
01:28:05,747 --> 01:28:09,683
We came to help
you win and if we're
not helping, we have to go.

1526
01:28:09,685 --> 01:28:11,518
This was all you.
No.

1527
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,587
It was.

1528
01:28:16,924 --> 01:28:19,026
All right.
Take my advice.

1529
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:22,496
Don't give it
all to the fight.

1530
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:25,032
Save some for home.

1531
01:28:26,567 --> 01:28:28,368
There's more to life,
you know?

1532
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,907
You girls have
opened my eyes.

1533
01:28:33,909 --> 01:28:36,877
I'm going to
extend my repertoire,
you'll see.

1534
01:28:36,879 --> 01:28:37,978
The vegan Delia Smith.

1535
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:42,849
Bye.

1536
01:28:42,851 --> 01:28:44,084
Bye.

1537
01:28:44,086 --> 01:28:45,152
Take care, now.

1538
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:11,345
It's a bloody travesty,
man.

1539
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:45,379
- I don't accept it.
- Gethin...

1540
01:29:45,381 --> 01:29:46,546
I don't.

1541
01:29:46,548 --> 01:29:49,149
They can't stop me
from collecting money.
How can they?

1542
01:29:49,151 --> 01:29:51,051
- Don't be crazy, gethin.
- Geth...

1543
01:29:52,787 --> 01:29:56,123
Somebody better tell
lesbians against pit closures.

1544
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:00,360
What now?

1545
01:30:00,362 --> 01:30:01,728
What do you mean?

1546
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,196
What are we doing?
Where are we going?
It's over, Mike.

1547
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:05,632
Were you not
paying attention?
We lost.

1548
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:08,168
And I don't know about you
but I'm pissing off.

1549
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:09,369
Where?
Anywhere.

1550
01:30:09,371 --> 01:30:11,171
I'm out of here.
What about the rest of us?

1551
01:30:11,173 --> 01:30:13,573
Do you think
it might be possible
that just for once

1552
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:15,075
you could make your
own decision, Mike?

1553
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:17,010
You what?
Do you think
that just for once

1554
01:30:17,012 --> 01:30:19,546
you could stop following me
around like a fucking spaniel

1555
01:30:19,548 --> 01:30:20,914
and let me have
a life of my own?

1556
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:23,950
Yeah.

1557
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,353
Yeah, I think I could
manage that, yeah.

1558
01:30:26,355 --> 01:30:28,989
Good. Piss off,
all of you.
Leave me alone.

1559
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:32,893
Oh, fu...

1560
01:30:37,266 --> 01:30:39,266
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

1561
01:30:40,868 --> 01:30:43,036
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

1562
01:30:43,038 --> 01:30:44,571
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

1563
01:30:44,573 --> 01:30:47,541
Never mind the miners.
There's gay people
dying every day.

1564
01:30:47,543 --> 01:30:50,143
That's what you should
be thinking about.

1565
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:52,312
Not the bloody miners.

1566
01:30:53,514 --> 01:30:54,581
Asshole.

1567
01:30:58,687 --> 01:30:59,753
Excuse me?

1568
01:31:03,224 --> 01:31:04,291
Excuse me?

1569
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,528
Excuse me.
I only want to talk to you.

1570
01:31:18,072 --> 01:31:20,106
<i>Now,</i>
<i>I tell you what we'll do,</i>
<i>let's come over here.</i>

1571
01:31:20,108 --> 01:31:22,042
<i>This is the key
you swapped it to.</i>

1572
01:31:22,044 --> 01:31:24,544
<i>Oh, well,
we'll leave that there...</i>

1573
01:31:24,546 --> 01:31:27,113
<i>Now,</i>
<i>just come over here, my son,</i>
<i>and get yourself a nice...</i>

1574
01:31:27,115 --> 01:31:28,482
Is Joe there, please?

1575
01:31:29,217 --> 01:31:31,117
No, I'm afraid he's out.

1576
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:33,753
Can you tell him
that his friend gethin's
in hospital?

1577
01:31:33,755 --> 01:31:35,589
It's very important.
He's, um...

1578
01:31:35,591 --> 01:31:38,792
He's in St. Thomas' hospital.
He's been beaten up.

1579
01:31:38,794 --> 01:31:40,160
Yes,
of course I'll tell him.

1580
01:31:40,162 --> 01:31:41,761
And will you
tell him that Steph

1581
01:31:41,763 --> 01:31:43,430
called round to
see how he was?

1582
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:48,034
Who was that?

1583
01:31:50,938 --> 01:31:54,007
Tina. She wants
a lift in the morning.

1584
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:57,577
You're back at the jobcentre
tomorrow, don't forget.

1585
01:32:03,317 --> 01:32:05,185
I should have...

1586
01:32:05,187 --> 01:32:07,187
I should have said more.

1587
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:11,691
I could have.
I could have spoken better.

1588
01:32:14,095 --> 01:32:16,963
If you're going to cut,
cut it straight.

1589
01:32:16,965 --> 01:32:18,198
Triangles.

1590
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:31,411
I'm gay.

1591
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:40,186
I know.

1592
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:46,526
I've known for a little
while now, cliff.

1593
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:50,230
Since the gays arrived?

1594
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:54,701
Well, I can't speak
for the rest of the village

1595
01:32:54,703 --> 01:32:57,871
but speaking for myself,
since about 1968.

1596
01:32:57,873 --> 01:33:00,206
Well...

1597
01:33:03,177 --> 01:33:04,244
Yeah.

1598
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:35,508
What's that?

1599
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:36,676
It's the new van.

1600
01:33:37,511 --> 01:33:39,079
About time, too.

1601
01:33:42,516 --> 01:33:43,683
What the hell's this?

1602
01:33:43,685 --> 01:33:44,751
New van.

1603
01:33:44,753 --> 01:33:47,187
Courtesy of our gay friends
down in London.

1604
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:48,622
I'm not getting in that.

1605
01:33:48,624 --> 01:33:50,056
Then you'll have to stay here.

1606
01:33:50,058 --> 01:33:51,291
In you get, lads.
Quick now.

1607
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:17,550
You a lesbian, are you, love?

1608
01:34:17,552 --> 01:34:21,354
That's right.
We're just off to swansea
now for a massive lez-off.

1609
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:43,109
<i>Britain's longest running
national strike is over.</i>

1610
01:34:43,111 --> 01:34:45,945
<i>Amongst scenes of
bitterness and anger,</i>

1611
01:34:45,947 --> 01:34:48,081
<i>num delegates
voted narrowly</i>

1612
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:50,183
<i>for an organized return
to work on Tuesday.</i>

1613
01:34:50,185 --> 01:34:53,286
<i>Tomorrow most of britain's</i>
<i>coal miners will</i>
<i>return to work.</i>

1614
01:34:53,288 --> 01:34:56,089
<i>They say they'll march back,
heads held high.</i>

1615
01:34:56,091 --> 01:34:58,758
<i>It's almost a year</i>
<i>to the very day</i>
<i>since they walked out</i>

1616
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,660
<i>and embarked on
a course of action which...</i>

1617
01:35:00,662 --> 01:35:03,263
Joe,
have you seen the news?

1618
01:35:03,265 --> 01:35:04,698
Thank God for that.

1619
01:35:06,934 --> 01:35:08,101
Joe?

1620
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:52,746
Bloody hell!

1621
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:28,014
Mark!
Where are you going?
I'm leaving.

1622
01:36:28,016 --> 01:36:31,251
I was trying to make myself
feel better and I failed.

1623
01:36:31,253 --> 01:36:32,919
I've been virtually
under house arrest.

1624
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:34,954
Stuck with my parents.

1625
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:36,156
I haven't seen anyone.

1626
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:37,290
I've tried ringing Steph
but she's always...

1627
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:38,691
Why don't you leave?

1628
01:36:38,693 --> 01:36:40,059
I did, last night.

1629
01:36:40,061 --> 01:36:41,528
I didn't even tell
them I was going.

1630
01:36:41,530 --> 01:36:43,630
That's not leaving,
it's running.

1631
01:36:43,632 --> 01:36:45,064
What are you going to do now?

1632
01:36:45,066 --> 01:36:46,266
Stay here.

1633
01:36:46,268 --> 01:36:47,400
And do what?

1634
01:36:47,402 --> 01:36:48,768
And get a job down the pit?

1635
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:51,738
That's all they need,
a trained pastry chef
with a camera.

1636
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:53,740
When are you going to
get some guts, huh?

1637
01:36:53,742 --> 01:36:55,275
You're a member
of lgsm, bromley.

1638
01:36:55,277 --> 01:36:57,110
So stop sneaking
out of your mammy's house

1639
01:36:57,112 --> 01:36:59,078
in the dead of night
and stand up for yourself.

1640
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,613
Have some pride.

1641
01:37:01,582 --> 01:37:03,349
Because life is short, okay?

1642
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:06,619
It's short.

1643
01:37:09,089 --> 01:37:10,156
Okay?

1644
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:44,424
What should I
tell the others?

1645
01:37:44,426 --> 01:37:47,160
Nothing. I wasn't here.

1646
01:37:51,765 --> 01:37:53,933
You're a mad bugger.

1647
01:37:53,935 --> 01:37:55,535
I'm taking you
home after that.

1648
01:37:55,537 --> 01:37:57,203
In the van.
No arguments.

1649
01:37:58,205 --> 01:38:00,440
Will you give this
to Jeff, please, Joe?

1650
01:38:01,108 --> 01:38:02,442
Of course I will.

1651
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:04,177
Come on.

1652
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:11,584
What about gethin?
Is he okay?

1653
01:38:12,152 --> 01:38:13,853
Gethin?

1654
01:38:13,855 --> 01:38:16,689
The last I heard
he was back on the ward.

1655
01:38:40,481 --> 01:38:41,881
I don't like meltis fruits.

1656
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:45,798
Well, then, maybe you won't
go through them quite so fast.

1657
01:38:48,722 --> 01:38:50,390
Help me out with these,
will you, bromley?

1658
01:38:55,864 --> 01:38:57,096
Stay in bed.

1659
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:02,502
Keep an eye on
Jonathan for me,
will you?

1660
01:39:02,504 --> 01:39:04,737
He needs to take
care of himself.

1661
01:39:04,739 --> 01:39:06,439
It's you
we're taking care of,
you daft sod.

1662
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:08,374
If you could just make sure
he's got some groceries in.

1663
01:39:08,376 --> 01:39:09,609
Gethin...

1664
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:10,810
He's HIV-positive, sian.

1665
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:20,586
He's not supposed to smoke.
And he needs to eat properly.

1666
01:39:26,226 --> 01:39:27,994
Please. For me.

1667
01:39:30,564 --> 01:39:32,198
Gethin.

1668
01:39:35,736 --> 01:39:36,936
Hello.

1669
01:39:40,041 --> 01:39:41,107
This is my mum.

1670
01:39:41,709 --> 01:39:42,809
Hello.

1671
01:39:42,811 --> 01:39:43,876
Come in.

1672
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:50,083
Back then, when they knew
even less about this thing,

1673
01:39:50,085 --> 01:39:52,885
they gave out numbers
with each diagnosis.

1674
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:56,189
One, two, three and so on.

1675
01:39:58,058 --> 01:40:00,493
Course, when they got
into the high thousands, it...

1676
01:40:11,572 --> 01:40:12,972
I'm number two.

1677
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:20,046
Nobody knows
what's keeping me alive.

1678
01:40:21,248 --> 01:40:22,982
I think it's the grass.

1679
01:40:27,821 --> 01:40:29,889
What are you
going to do now?

1680
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:32,759
Make you some soup.

1681
01:40:33,827 --> 01:40:36,029
Drive back to wales.

1682
01:40:36,031 --> 01:40:39,032
No, I mean with your life.

1683
01:40:39,034 --> 01:40:42,035
I'm a wife and mother, love.

1684
01:40:43,704 --> 01:40:45,705
My life goes
back to normal now.

1685
01:40:47,141 --> 01:40:48,708
Well, it shouldn't.

1686
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:52,945
You've a first-class mind.

1687
01:40:52,947 --> 01:40:56,282
You should do something.
Go to college.

1688
01:40:56,284 --> 01:40:59,118
Don't waste it, sian.

1689
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:02,688
There are young people
dying every day now.

1690
01:41:02,690 --> 01:41:03,956
Good people.

1691
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:07,060
Clever, promising.

1692
01:41:08,295 --> 01:41:09,429
Don't you dare waste it.

1693
01:41:16,504 --> 01:41:18,071
Oh, shit.

1694
01:41:33,821 --> 01:41:34,954
Excuse me.

1695
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:40,326
Sorry.

1696
01:41:48,035 --> 01:41:51,003
What the hell is this?
And where have you been?

1697
01:41:58,579 --> 01:42:01,047
Hello. You must be
Joe's mum. I'm sian.

1698
01:42:01,049 --> 01:42:03,683
Will you please
remove your van
from my property?

1699
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:07,220
I hope you appreciate him.

1700
01:42:07,222 --> 01:42:08,654
'Cause there's
a whole village
back in wales

1701
01:42:08,656 --> 01:42:09,989
who thinks he's a hero.

1702
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:23,903
Joe.

1703
01:42:23,905 --> 01:42:25,471
Mum,
he's done this on purpose.

1704
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:27,006
It's all right,
I'm leaving.

1705
01:42:28,108 --> 01:42:30,643
I hope one day
we can be friends again, mum.

1706
01:42:32,746 --> 01:42:34,647
Oi, you got something
to say to your sister?

1707
01:42:34,649 --> 01:42:38,718
I've got something
to say to you, Jason.
You're a dick.

1708
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:42,221
And Tina, that tight perm
doesn't suit you.
It never has.

1709
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:44,657
I'm sorry.

1710
01:42:50,264 --> 01:42:51,464
Joe.

1711
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:54,800
Joe.

1712
01:43:33,006 --> 01:43:34,240
You all right?

1713
01:43:41,014 --> 01:43:42,315
Cheers.

1714
01:43:43,651 --> 01:43:48,487
While you've been away,
I've been changing my act.
You watch.

1715
01:43:48,489 --> 01:43:52,725
Demure and accommodating,
that's me.

1716
01:43:52,727 --> 01:43:55,094
The lesbian lady di.

1717
01:43:58,632 --> 01:44:01,167
I think I'd find that
a tremendous disappointment.

1718
01:44:03,804 --> 01:44:05,805
I'm glad you
came back, bromley.

1719
01:44:05,807 --> 01:44:07,740
It wasn't
the same without you.

1720
01:44:09,743 --> 01:44:10,943
Thanks.

1721
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:19,785
I'm glad I came back, too.

1722
01:44:21,888 --> 01:44:25,258
If we were normal,
this is when we'd kiss.

1723
01:45:00,061 --> 01:45:01,727
There's the rest of it.
Thanks.

1724
01:45:03,398 --> 01:45:05,765
"Screw you, Thatcher"
or "fuck you"?

1725
01:45:05,767 --> 01:45:08,134
I can see the appeal of both.

1726
01:45:08,136 --> 01:45:11,003
Jonathan,
"screw" or "fuck"?

1727
01:45:11,005 --> 01:45:13,172
"Screw."
It's more visceral.

1728
01:45:14,241 --> 01:45:16,509
<i>Attention, attention!</i>

1729
01:45:18,078 --> 01:45:21,113
<i>We have reason to</i>
<i>believe that there are</i>
<i>known homosexualists</i>

1730
01:45:21,115 --> 01:45:24,116
<i>and a confirmed lesbo
inside these premises</i>

1731
01:45:24,118 --> 01:45:26,752
<i>and that they are armed
with sewing machines</i>

1732
01:45:26,754 --> 01:45:28,054
<i>and glitter.</i>

1733
01:45:31,124 --> 01:45:32,425
<i>A-ha.</i>

1734
01:45:32,427 --> 01:45:35,227
<i>Now that you have made
yourselves known to me,</i>

1735
01:45:35,229 --> 01:45:38,464
<i>I have a question</i>
<i>for the notorious</i>
<i>accrington sodomite</i>

1736
01:45:38,466 --> 01:45:39,832
<i>known as Mike Jackson.</i>

1737
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:41,133
Will you please put that down?

1738
01:45:41,135 --> 01:45:42,668
We have a very
good relationship
with our neighbors.

1739
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:44,503
<i>Mike.</i>

1740
01:45:46,808 --> 01:45:48,074
<i>Mike.</i>

1741
01:45:57,918 --> 01:45:59,885
<i>I behaved
like a prick before.</i>

1742
01:46:01,755 --> 01:46:04,090
<i>Do you forgive me?</i>

1743
01:46:05,425 --> 01:46:09,261
Just... just get up here
and sew something, will you?

1744
01:46:22,943 --> 01:46:24,443
There you go, bromley.

1745
01:46:26,847 --> 01:46:28,347
Happy Birthday.

1746
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:48,367
Thank you.

1747
01:46:50,637 --> 01:46:53,272
Right. Now, get to work.

1748
01:46:54,674 --> 01:46:56,714
And just for
future reference...

1749
01:46:58,645 --> 01:47:00,146
My name's Joe.

1750
01:47:00,148 --> 01:47:02,581
You tell 'em, bromley.

1751
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:06,552
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

1752
01:47:06,554 --> 01:47:09,255
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

1753
01:47:09,257 --> 01:47:13,926
Bromley! Bromley!
Bromley! Bromley!

1754
01:47:13,928 --> 01:47:16,562
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!
Bromley! Bromley!

1755
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:33,112
Oi, haven't you heard
about the miners, dearie?

1756
01:47:35,015 --> 01:47:36,315
They lost.

1757
01:47:39,419 --> 01:47:41,187
Have you heard?
No politics.
What?

1758
01:47:41,189 --> 01:47:43,122
Mark's over with
the steward now.
No politics?

1759
01:47:43,124 --> 01:47:44,590
No slogans.

1760
01:47:44,592 --> 01:47:45,792
We're a mardi gras,
apparently.

1761
01:47:49,029 --> 01:47:50,095
There was
a general feeling...
Amongst who?

1762
01:47:50,097 --> 01:47:51,630
Amongst the committee

1763
01:47:51,632 --> 01:47:53,265
that people have
become tired of politics
and that this year,

1764
01:47:53,267 --> 01:47:55,301
the tone should
be celebratory.

1765
01:47:55,303 --> 01:47:56,902
With affirmative slogans
and a positive atmosphere.

1766
01:47:56,904 --> 01:47:58,204
Horse shit.
If you insist on marching

1767
01:47:58,206 --> 01:47:59,572
with your banner,
you'll have to march

1768
01:47:59,574 --> 01:48:00,906
at the back with
the fringe groups.

1769
01:48:00,908 --> 01:48:02,875
Mate, we're lgsm.
We fought
alongside the miners.

1770
01:48:02,877 --> 01:48:04,877
Congratulations.
But now it's time
for a party.

1771
01:48:04,879 --> 01:48:06,912
What?
Bollocks.

1772
01:48:06,914 --> 01:48:08,881
<i>Complete and utter bollocks.</i>

1773
01:48:08,883 --> 01:48:10,216
What's lgsm's position?

1774
01:48:10,218 --> 01:48:11,450
We're going to march.

1775
01:48:11,452 --> 01:48:13,118
Yes,
but with banners or without?
With.

1776
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:15,087
With. This is
a fucking demonstration.

1777
01:48:15,089 --> 01:48:17,556
That's why we've decided
to lead the fringe groups
at the back.

1778
01:48:17,558 --> 01:48:18,891
Why would you be leading it?
Sorry?

1779
01:48:18,893 --> 01:48:20,459
I'm not getting
rid of the banner.
Listen...

1780
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:21,994
There's got to be
some kind of compromise.

1781
01:48:21,996 --> 01:48:23,062
Why?

1782
01:48:23,064 --> 01:48:24,463
Because that's the way
you get things done.

1783
01:48:24,465 --> 01:48:25,965
No, it fucking isn't.
Listen.

1784
01:48:25,967 --> 01:48:28,901
Why does everything
get so aggressive
with you lot?

1785
01:48:28,903 --> 01:48:30,669
Listen to me! Listen to me.

1786
01:48:30,671 --> 01:48:32,771
Whether we march
with banners or without,

1787
01:48:32,773 --> 01:48:35,508
the important thing
is that we march together,
all of us.

1788
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:37,943
That's what this whole thing
has been about
since the beginning

1789
01:48:37,945 --> 01:48:40,312
and that is absolutely
how it is going to end.

1790
01:48:40,314 --> 01:48:42,615
Together, us united.

1791
01:48:42,617 --> 01:48:43,749
Bloody hell.

1792
01:48:54,494 --> 01:48:56,061
Ah, yeah!

1793
01:48:56,063 --> 01:48:57,530
I can't believe you're here.

1794
01:48:57,532 --> 01:48:58,964
I can't believe
you're here.

1795
01:48:58,966 --> 01:49:00,332
All right?

1796
01:49:00,334 --> 01:49:04,003
Where are my lesbians?
Where are my lesbians?

1797
01:49:04,005 --> 01:49:05,538
Hi.
Hey.

1798
01:49:07,474 --> 01:49:09,508
Hi!

1799
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:13,946
These are all cucumber.
No butter.
Stork sb every one.

1800
01:49:13,948 --> 01:49:15,614
I can't believe you came.
Miners, see?

1801
01:49:15,616 --> 01:49:16,982
We love a bloody good march.

1802
01:49:16,984 --> 01:49:18,317
Right,
where do you want us?

1803
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:19,818
You lot.
I'll tell them.

1804
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:20,886
There's too many of you.

1805
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:22,254
What?

1806
01:49:22,256 --> 01:49:24,356
You'll have to
go to the front.
You'll have to lead.

1807
01:49:24,358 --> 01:49:26,358
We're not losing
our banners, mate.
What do you mean...

1808
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:27,426
What's he mean,
too many?

1809
01:49:27,428 --> 01:49:28,494
What's he on about?

1810
01:49:29,529 --> 01:49:31,030
I think he means them.

1811
01:49:46,413 --> 01:49:49,181
Caerphilly.

1812

1821
01:50:17,044 --> 01:50:20,713
The gays and lesbians
have been
absolutely magnificent,

1822
01:50:20,715 --> 01:50:22,114
there's no other word for it.

1823
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:23,449
You must have
found it a bit weird.

1824
01:50:23,451 --> 01:50:26,452
A load of gays and lesbians
descending on you like that?

1825
01:50:26,454 --> 01:50:29,154
Why on earth
would we have
found that weird?

1826
01:50:37,731 --> 01:50:39,098
<i>This way, guys.
We're at the front.</i>

1827
01:50:40,401 --> 01:50:43,402
<i>Come on, guys.
We're at the front. This way.</i>

1828
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:59,284
Not worried
about being too
visible this time?

1829
01:50:59,286 --> 01:51:00,452
Shut up and march.

1830
01:51:33,586 --> 01:51:36,522
<i> There is power in a factory</i>

1831

<i> power in the land</i>

1832

<i> power in the hand
of the worker</i>

1833
01:51:43,798 --> 01:51:46,098
<i> but it all
amounts to nothing</i>

1834

1838

<i> to trenches full of mud</i>

1841
01:52:09,457 --> 01:52:14,193
