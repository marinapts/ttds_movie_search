Wouldn't he?

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,918
He might agree to meet you,
if you came as a friend.

We're up against the clock here, girl,
so if there's nothing to talk about,

we'll just put you back
where we found you.

I was a child.
Saw Gerrera saved my life. He raised me.

But I have no idea where he is.

MON MOTHMA: Yes,
but Saw Gerrera is an extremist.

212
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,835
He's been fighting on his own
since he broke with the Rebellion.

213
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,591
His militancy has caused the Alliance

214
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,797
a great many problems.

215
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,279
We have no choice now but to try

216

and mend that broken trust.

What does this have to do with my father?

218
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,518
There's an Imperial defector
in Jedha. A pilot.

219
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,353
He's been held by Saw Gerrera.

220
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,433
He's claiming the Emperor
is creating a weapon

221
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,717
with the power to destroy entire planets.

222
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,189
The pilot says he was sent by your father.

223
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,555
MON MOTHMA: We need to stop
this weapon before it is finished.

224
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,555
Captain Andor's mission is to
authenticate the pilot's story.

225
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,200
And then, if possible, find your father.

226
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,635
It appears he is critical to the
development of this super weapon.

227
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,672
Given the gravity of the situation
and your history with Saw,

228
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,832
we're hoping that he will
help us locate your father

229
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,640
and return him
to the Senate for testimony.

I faced some bitter truths.

00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,033
I was told that soon enough

632
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,873
Krennic would have you as well.

633
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,150
As time went by...

634
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,277
I knew that you were either dead...

or so well hidden that
he would never find you.

636
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,279
I knew if I had refused to work,
if I took my own life...

637
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,591
it would only be a matter of time
before Krennic realized...

638
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,116
he no longer needed me
to complete the project.

639
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,715
So I did the one thing nobody expected.

640
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,876
I lied.

641
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,438
I learned to lie.

642
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,751

resigned to the sanctuary of his work.

644
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,633
I made myself indispensable...

645
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,879
and all the while, I laid
the groundwork of my revenge.

646

We call it the Death Star.

647
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,000
There is no better name...

648
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,591
and the day is coming soon
when it will be unleashed.

649
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,514
I've placed a weakness
deep within the system...

650
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,235
a flaw so small and powerful,
they will never find it.

651
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,470
But, Jyn...

652
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,356
Jyn, if you're listening, my beloved...

653
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,240
so much of my life has been wasted.

654
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,277
I try to think of you only
in the moments when I'm strong...

655
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,114
because the pain of
not having you with me...

656
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,239
your mother, our family.

657
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,437
The pain of that loss
is so overwhelming...

658
