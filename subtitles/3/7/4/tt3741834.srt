<i>HOBART, AUSTRALIA 1987</i>

3
00:45:41,055 --> 00:45:42,055
Thank you.

4
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:48,940
Saroo.

5
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:02,199
Hello, I'm Swarmina.

6
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,516
I'm John, this is Sue.

7
00:46:07,553 --> 00:46:08,553
Hello there.

8
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:13,042
Hello. Here
this is for you.

9
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,720
Good on the plane?
Hey, good?

10
00:46:21,355 --> 00:46:22,845
It's all right.

11
00:46:23,385 --> 00:46:24,875
She is...
Mommy and...

12
00:46:25,376 --> 00:46:26,432
Dad.

13
00:46:27,103 --> 00:46:29,442
And we are so
happy to meet you.

14
00:46:41,845 --> 00:46:43,344
A boat.

15
00:46:54,987 --> 00:46:55,987
Amazing

16
00:47:06,915 --> 00:47:08,479
This is where you live.

17
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,051
Down there,
that's the living room.

18
00:47:18,805 --> 00:47:20,670
Television.

19
00:47:22,657 --> 00:47:24,963
Do you know what a television is?

20
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:27,893
Pictures.

21
00:47:29,448 --> 00:47:31,339
Water.

22
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:43,974
You can open it.

23
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,059
Do you want me to cut it up for you?

24
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,270
Pepper

25
00:48:21,094 --> 00:48:22,934
What was that? Pepper.

26
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,303
Yes, pepper. That's right.

27
00:48:28,775 --> 00:48:32,006
Sauce. Sauce?

28
00:48:33,325 --> 00:48:34,365
Salt. Salt.

29
00:48:35,685 --> 00:48:37,005
Very good.

30
00:48:52,324 --> 00:48:53,324
Hi.

31
00:48:57,865 --> 00:49:00,476
So you've come a long way haven't you?

32
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:05,309
Little one.

33
00:49:07,835 --> 00:49:09,245
I'm sure it hasn't been easy.

34
00:49:10,705 --> 00:49:13,239
One day you will tell me all about it.

35
00:49:14,055 --> 00:49:17,258
You will tell me everything.
Who you are, everything.

36
00:49:19,195 --> 00:49:20,854
I'll always listen.

37
00:49:24,043 --> 00:49:25,043
Always.

38
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:48,624
Yes good.

39
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,753
Go easy on me, yeah? Yes.

40
00:49:55,012 --> 00:49:56,371
It's all right.

41
00:49:56,406 --> 00:49:59,307
Ready?

42
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:02,448
Here it comes!

43
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,349
How did you do that to me?

44
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:21,989
All right.

45
00:50:22,195 --> 00:50:25,021
Dad, Mom, Saroo...

46
00:50:26,215 --> 00:50:27,251
Mantosh.

47
00:50:27,252 --> 00:50:28,252
Yes.

48
00:50:30,935 --> 00:50:32,566
Hello again!

49
00:50:33,755 --> 00:50:36,680
Saroo, my goodness, look at you!

50
00:50:36,892 --> 00:50:37,892
Hi.

51
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:40,319
My gosh, we've been so excited!

52
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,871
This is Mantosh.

53
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:42,945
Hi!

54
00:50:43,226 --> 00:50:44,703
Hi, Mantosh.

55
00:50:44,738 --> 00:50:47,558
This is Saroo, I'm Sue...

56
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:51,663
This is Saroo, your brother.

57
00:50:51,698 --> 00:50:54,091
And John... Hello mate!

58
00:50:56,415 --> 00:50:58,743
Show Mantosh what you drew.

59
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:03,625
He did a picture - Yeah...

60
00:51:10,629 --> 00:51:13,714
It's been a long flight. Yes Yes Yes.

61
00:51:14,268 --> 00:51:15,600
You must be hungry.

62
00:51:15,675 --> 00:51:17,199
We're going to get something to eat.

63
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,235
Would you like to join us?

64
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:22,494
Ok that would be nice.

65
00:51:31,553 --> 00:51:33,911
John stop!

66
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:38,430
Stop, stop!

67
00:51:38,465 --> 00:51:39,765
Come on, John!
I know I know...

68
00:51:43,876 --> 00:51:46,817
It's okay. Just play with your toys.

69
00:51:46,852 --> 00:51:50,395
No, no, no,
do not hit me, my friend.

70
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:55,975
You're all right.

71
00:51:58,235 --> 00:52:00,315
It's all right.

72
00:52:00,775 --> 00:52:03,385
Come on, it's okay.

73
00:52:04,102 --> 00:52:09,502
Look, it's a boat.
It's better now.

74
00:52:42,365 --> 00:52:43,648
I'm okay.

75
00:53:01,295 --> 00:53:02,344
Hey!

76
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:17,719
I'm all right.

77
00:54:01,715 --> 00:54:05,616
We're going to miss you.
It's only Melbourne..

78
00:54:05,655 --> 00:54:08,285
It's across the water.

79
00:54:09,815 --> 00:54:11,294
Saroo...

80
00:54:11,795 --> 00:54:13,485
Our beautiful boy.

81
00:54:14,804 --> 00:54:17,561
May this bring you all
that you could wish for.

82
00:54:17,775 --> 00:54:20,253
And then some. Thanks Mom.

83
00:54:20,254 --> 00:54:21,341
Thanks Dad.

84
00:54:21,376 --> 00:54:23,671
From the moment you came into our lives...

85
00:54:23,672 --> 00:54:25,060
Mother. "No, no let me finish.

86
00:54:25,285 --> 00:54:27,704
From the moment you came into our lives,

87
00:54:28,185 --> 00:54:31,186
You were all that we
could have hoped for.

88
00:54:32,065 --> 00:54:35,975
More, more than we hoped for,
really.

89
00:54:36,875 --> 00:54:39,549
And, uh,
more work that's for sure.

90
00:54:40,655 --> 00:54:42,675
You've really embraced every opportunity.

91
00:54:43,145 --> 00:54:44,739
We're very proud of you, son.

92
00:54:46,195 --> 00:54:49,835
Very proud and very excited about
this next chapter in your life.

93
00:54:52,645 --> 00:54:54,342
Cheers! To success!

94
00:54:54,343 --> 00:54:57,356
Are you still waiting on someone?
Or can I take this plate away?

95
00:54:57,391 --> 00:54:59,822
Yes, you can take it. No, you can leave it.

96
00:54:59,823 --> 00:55:00,874
No, take it.

97
00:55:01,105 --> 00:55:03,561
I'd like to keep it.
Thanks.

98
00:55:10,575 --> 00:55:12,819
You don't really think
he'll turn up, do you?

99
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,561
No just leave it, son.

100
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:22,990
That's a nice one It's a good one,
it's local.

101
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,219
Mantosh?

102
00:56:01,615 --> 00:56:02,694
Yes...

103
00:56:02,925 --> 00:56:04,455
Sorry, I didn't make lunch.

104
00:56:06,795 --> 00:56:08,936
What's that course again?

105
00:56:09,335 --> 00:56:10,775
Hotel Management.

106
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,051
So you're going to
go and learn to what?

107
00:56:15,095 --> 00:56:17,115
Manage your hotel?

108
00:56:18,985 --> 00:56:20,175
Well, have fun.

109
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:23,345
Any bills you need to pay?

110
00:56:23,825 --> 00:56:25,385
You can give us a job when you come back.

111
00:56:25,386 --> 00:56:27,651
Please could you not do
anything wrong while...

112
00:56:27,652 --> 00:56:29,970
Yeah, yeah "That's going
to make mom more unhappy,

113
00:56:29,999 --> 00:56:31,175
than you're already doing.

114
00:56:35,115 --> 00:56:36,967
Why do you think I stay away?

115
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,864
<i>We see ourselves as United
Nations of hospitality schools</i>

116
00:56:59,899 --> 00:57:03,870
<i>And we like to think that we teach
a global and balanced perspective.</i>

117
00:57:04,734 --> 00:57:06,626
<i>You're here because you have a dream.</i>

118
00:57:06,945 --> 00:57:10,561
<i>We're here to help make
that dream a reality.</i>

119
00:57:28,935 --> 00:57:32,248
Yes and I saw firsthand how
the hospitality industry

120
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:35,971
can really bring infrastructure
to communities that need it.

121
00:57:36,055 --> 00:57:39,012
But I also saw, too,
a lot of the problems that they cause.

122
00:57:39,013 --> 00:57:42,522
Which is why the community
groups need to be involved

123
00:57:42,557 --> 00:57:44,666
Every step of the way and they
need to be taken seriously.

124
00:57:46,033 --> 00:57:47,423
And...

125
00:57:47,455 --> 00:57:51,134
And I guess I want to help facilitate that.
Give them a voice.

126
00:57:51,315 --> 00:57:52,375
Saroo.

127
00:57:54,045 --> 00:57:57,348
I want to run hotels that put
all the profit into my pocket.

128
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:59,963
Let's start with where you are from,
shall we?

129
00:57:59,964 --> 00:58:01,303
So born in Australia?

130
00:58:01,304 --> 00:58:02,579
Yeah No...uh

131
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,293
Calcutta.

132
00:58:04,425 --> 00:58:07,357
I've got family in Calcutta.
My cousins are quite mad.

133
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,385
Which part?

134
00:58:09,365 --> 00:58:12,117
I'm adopted, I'm not really Indian.

135
00:58:14,635 --> 00:58:16,792
But you like cricket tho, right?

136
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,461
Ah, you like cricket...

137
00:58:21,068 --> 00:58:23,033
You go for the Aussies or Indians?

138
00:58:23,034 --> 00:58:24,105
I like the Aussies, mate.

139
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,284
This is going to be interesting.

140
00:58:29,285 --> 00:58:30,849
Ok. Saroo...

141
00:58:31,557 --> 00:58:33,079
Why did you choose this course?

142
00:58:33,165 --> 00:58:35,105
What else do you want to get out of it?

143
00:59:21,465 --> 00:59:22,964
Hi!

144
00:59:22,965 --> 00:59:25,775
Welcome! Thanks for coming!

145
00:59:28,286 --> 00:59:29,286
Hi!

146
00:59:29,385 --> 00:59:31,675
Hi how are you?

147
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:34,164
Do you guys like Indian food?

148
00:59:35,635 --> 00:59:38,154
That's all we have...

149
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:41,420
It smells so good!
I've tried copying from someone.

150
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:53,694
Well, I say flashlight, what would you say?

151
00:59:53,729 --> 00:59:56,633
Lampo de poche.
Lampo de poche?

152
00:59:56,825 --> 00:59:58,965
Lampo de poche.
Flashlight is...

153
01:00:00,685 --> 01:00:02,097
Fine.
What do you say?

154
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,175
Torch.

155
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:04,631
If you want to eat with your hands,

156
01:00:04,632 --> 01:00:07,616
Use the naan like the spoon

157
01:00:07,651 --> 01:00:09,551
No, let's use the naan.

158
01:00:10,176 --> 01:00:11,545
And how do you say taxi?

159
01:00:12,205 --> 01:00:13,285
Taxi. Taxi.

160
01:00:13,755 --> 01:00:15,439
It is the same in every language.

161
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,972
You want a fork, Saroo?

162
01:00:19,432 --> 01:00:20,766
He's like my father.

163
01:00:22,895 --> 01:00:25,419
You want another beer? Yes please.

164
01:01:19,255 --> 01:01:20,543
Are you ok?

165
01:01:29,327 --> 01:01:30,666
Saroo?

166
01:01:35,415 --> 01:01:37,413
I'm not from Calcutta.

167
01:01:41,205 --> 01:01:42,275
I'm lost.

168
01:01:44,135 --> 01:01:46,690
Howrah station is enormous.
You must have been freaking out.

169
01:01:47,395 --> 01:01:51,176
I once went through there on a pilgrimage
to Puri and I missed my connection twice.

170
01:01:51,975 --> 01:01:53,634
You didn't speak Bengali?

171
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:55,385
I didn't even know it was called that.

172
01:01:56,315 --> 01:01:59,818
How long were you on the train?
A couple of days.

173
01:01:59,819 --> 01:02:00,829
A couple of days?

174
01:02:02,035 --> 01:02:04,081
Saroo, what was your hometown again?

175
01:02:04,082 --> 01:02:05,116
Ganestlay.

176
01:02:06,975 --> 01:02:10,026
I must have had it wrong
because it doesn't exist.

177
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:12,333
There must be something
else that you do remember.

178
01:02:16,085 --> 01:02:17,375
The platform...

179
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:21,121
I fell asleep on it. Next to the rain tank

180
01:02:21,156 --> 01:02:23,704
That was only a few stops from Ganestlay.

181
01:02:24,815 --> 01:02:27,402
There are thousands of
stations with rain tanks.

182
01:02:27,403 --> 01:02:29,422
Okay, that was a long time ago.

183
01:02:29,438 --> 01:02:31,578
Have you heard of this new program,
Google Earth?

184
01:02:32,095 --> 01:02:34,594
It's incredible.
You can find any place from anywhere.

185
01:02:34,595 --> 01:02:38,840
Listen to me, we can find out how
fast passenger trains went back then.

186
01:02:38,841 --> 01:02:42,540
We took that speed and multiplied by
the hours that you were on the train.

187
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:43,786
That's it.

188
01:02:43,925 --> 01:02:45,531
We create a search radius.

189
01:02:45,775 --> 01:02:48,305
And inside there you'll find
the stations with the rain tank.

190
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:51,732
Yes, but it can take a lifetime to
search all the stations in India.

191
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:53,950
Did I say all the stations?

192
01:02:53,985 --> 01:02:57,153
Ok even half... "Really, guys,
I don't want to talk about it"

193
01:02:59,365 --> 01:03:01,150
Did your parents try to find you?

194
01:03:01,245 --> 01:03:03,175
What? Of course they tried to find him.

195
01:03:03,615 --> 01:03:06,465
No I just mean maybe if they tried to
find him maybe they left a paper trail

196
01:03:07,085 --> 01:03:08,716
What paper trail?

197
01:03:09,315 --> 01:03:11,322
My mom couldn't read or write.

198
01:03:12,245 --> 01:03:13,675
What does she do?

199
01:03:14,045 --> 01:03:15,908
Labourer.
She carried rocks.

200
01:03:15,915 --> 01:03:16,955
Your mom?

201
01:03:22,955 --> 01:03:26,335
My mother died four years ago.

202
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,108
I'm sorry.

203
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,752
My dad is still so angry with her.

204
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,252
Not for getting sick obviously.

205
01:03:34,287 --> 01:03:36,425
Just for refusing chemo..

206
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,105
She just knew herself, you know?

207
01:03:40,305 --> 01:03:43,502
She knew what her terms were.
She knew how she wanted to live.

208
01:03:46,488 --> 01:03:48,549
Just couldn't accept that.
I guess.

209
01:03:52,249 --> 01:03:53,782
And how do you feel?

210
01:03:54,525 --> 01:03:56,614
I miss her.

211
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:02,687
What do you think of
Bharat's search radius idea?

212
01:04:11,854 --> 01:04:12,854
What is that?

213
01:04:15,225 --> 01:04:18,648
Is that your dance? Is that how you dance?

214
01:04:19,223 --> 01:04:20,223
Oh god!

215
01:06:44,197 --> 01:06:45,553
It's all right.

216
01:07:24,445 --> 01:07:26,429
You can't keep going on like this.

217
01:07:29,361 --> 01:07:30,727
Let me help you.

218
01:07:36,315 --> 01:07:38,041
Let's go for a run.

219
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:41,189
What?

220
01:07:47,435 --> 01:07:48,475
Lucy!

221
01:07:56,398 --> 01:07:57,398
Come on.

222
01:07:59,134 --> 01:08:00,134
Hold on.

223
01:08:00,335 --> 01:08:01,369
I've got a cramp.

224
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,041
I never show anybody this.

225
01:09:13,442 --> 01:09:15,043
They're beautiful.

226
01:09:16,244 --> 01:09:19,448
I do enjoy it. My little hobby.

227
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,617
Oh wow look at Mantosh! Uh huh.

228
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:25,535
I'm so glad he's coming tonight.

229
01:09:26,378 --> 01:09:28,378
Cheeky little thing.

230
01:09:28,523 --> 01:09:29,558
Pure energy.

231
01:09:31,526 --> 01:09:32,526
But incredible.

232
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:35,069
So sweet.

233
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:37,999
He's been hard to control but...

234
01:09:38,733 --> 01:09:41,934
he is very, very smart...very

235
01:09:42,504 --> 01:09:46,374
I mean, he could do anything if
he just learned to control it.

236
01:09:46,608 --> 01:09:47,909
With that energy he could do it all.

237
01:09:49,177 --> 01:09:51,012
Saroo is very protective of him.

238
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:56,918
I've been blessed.

239
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:02,790
Very blessed.

240
01:10:04,426 --> 01:10:07,562
Your mother showed me all
your old little trophies.

241
01:10:08,697 --> 01:10:09,697
Mom you didn't.

242
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,635
I had no idea you were so athletic.

243
01:10:13,735 --> 01:10:16,338
That's only half of them.
There's plenty more in the garage.

244
01:10:17,038 --> 01:10:18,406
Where are you going, mate?

245
01:10:21,209 --> 01:10:23,037
I can barely get him off the couch. Lucy...

246
01:10:29,985 --> 01:10:31,897
Why can't you just tell
them what you're doing?

247
01:10:31,932 --> 01:10:33,041
Don't.

248
01:10:34,556 --> 01:10:35,590
Tell us.

249
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:38,527
They will understand... What?

250
01:10:39,895 --> 01:10:40,895
Come on.

251
01:10:43,832 --> 01:10:45,167
Eat while it's hot.

252
01:10:47,636 --> 01:10:50,036
Are you hungry? Yeah.

253
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:53,140
What?

254
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:56,532
What have I missed?

255
01:10:56,745 --> 01:10:57,745
Nothing.

256
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:00,482
She looks upset.
She's not upset.

257
01:11:04,252 --> 01:11:05,861
Saroo knows everything.

258
01:11:06,555 --> 01:11:08,757
He's an expert.

259
01:11:09,791 --> 01:11:10,992
He's a manager.

260
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:13,953
Why are you here?

261
01:11:15,697 --> 01:11:17,409
He's here because he's your brother.

262
01:11:17,699 --> 01:11:18,755
No, he's not.

263
01:11:26,374 --> 01:11:28,643
We're different. Hey now, Saroo!

264
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:29,810
Saroo...

265
01:11:37,185 --> 01:11:38,185
All right.

266
01:11:42,991 --> 01:11:43,991
It's all right.

267
01:11:46,762 --> 01:11:47,762
Hey no, no...

268
01:11:51,366 --> 01:11:54,202
It's all right,
it's all right Please. Stop!

269
01:11:55,503 --> 01:11:56,605
Don't move.

270
01:12:00,675 --> 01:12:01,675
Nice work, mate.

271
01:12:15,891 --> 01:12:18,794
I hate what he's done to you.

272
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:53,994
I'm sorry.

273
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:13,315
Saroo!

274
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:16,151
Saroo.

275
01:13:17,819 --> 01:13:19,454
Saroo!

276
01:13:43,245 --> 01:13:44,245
Hey!

277
01:14:22,784 --> 01:14:23,919
Hey...

278
01:14:29,091 --> 01:14:30,158
Be with me.

279
01:14:34,496 --> 01:14:36,751
Stop please... Hey!

280
01:14:36,786 --> 01:14:38,638
Look at me.

281
01:14:41,503 --> 01:14:42,754
Look at me!

282
01:14:43,238 --> 01:14:44,673
Can this wait? Where are you?

283
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,875
Can this wait until we get home?

284
01:14:47,242 --> 01:14:48,825
Yeah? Home?

285
01:14:51,213 --> 01:14:52,213
What home?

286
01:14:52,948 --> 01:14:56,051
You mean where I'm alone in one room
and you're alone in the other room?

287
01:14:56,251 --> 01:14:57,251
Come on.

288
01:14:58,086 --> 01:14:59,086
Stop, Lucy.

289
01:15:01,022 --> 01:15:02,022
Come on.

290
01:15:02,591 --> 01:15:03,591
Please.

291
01:15:06,795 --> 01:15:07,795
Saroo!

292
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:10,134
You need to face reality!

293
01:15:11,733 --> 01:15:13,350
What do you mean? Reality?

294
01:15:15,003 --> 01:15:19,324
Do you have any idea what it's
like knowing that my real brother

295
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:22,511
And mother spend every day of
their lives looking for me?

296
01:15:25,347 --> 01:15:28,150
How every day my real
brother screams my name!

297
01:15:30,685 --> 01:15:33,054
Can you imagine the pain they
must be in not knowing where I am?

298
01:15:34,389 --> 01:15:37,675
25 years, Lucy. 25!

299
01:15:39,261 --> 01:15:41,630
Why didn't you tell me that?

300
01:15:42,063 --> 01:15:43,832
And we just wander about

301
01:15:44,533 --> 01:15:45,667
In our privileged lives.

302
01:15:48,703 --> 01:15:49,703
It makes me sick.

303
01:15:50,872 --> 01:15:52,140
I have to find them.

304
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:54,409
They need to know, ok?

305
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:56,411
I've never stopped you.

306
01:15:56,945 --> 01:15:58,113
I want to help.

307
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,681
I can't do this anymore.

308
01:16:00,715 --> 01:16:01,917
You deserve more.

309
01:16:02,784 --> 01:16:03,819
Don't you do that!

310
01:16:05,954 --> 01:16:08,757
Don't you dare do that!
This is on you not on me.

311
01:19:13,175 --> 01:19:14,843
<i>Saroo, are you there, mate?</i>

312
01:19:22,751 --> 01:19:24,786
<i>I meant to tell you
that I fixed the tiller.</i>

313
01:19:26,321 --> 01:19:28,500
<i>Now we can take her out.
We can head up the coast.</i>

314
01:19:32,828 --> 01:19:33,962
Saroo...

315
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:36,598
Mate, your mom is not well.

316
01:19:38,166 --> 01:19:40,735
We've lost track of
Mantosh, she misses him.

317
01:19:41,937 --> 01:19:43,271
You know how worried she gets...

318
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:54,082
We know you quit your job, mate.

319
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:57,018
She's worried about you, son.

320
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:40,695
I've been visiting her.

321
01:20:42,631 --> 01:20:46,276
Every night I walk those streets home.

322
01:20:47,803 --> 01:20:48,937
Home from the dam.

323
01:20:50,038 --> 01:20:51,206
Home from the station.

324
01:20:53,308 --> 01:20:54,308
I know now...

325
01:20:55,811 --> 01:20:57,379
Every single step of the way.

326
01:21:00,282 --> 01:21:01,483
And I imagine that I'll

327
01:21:03,985 --> 01:21:05,520
whisper in her ear

328
01:21:06,154 --> 01:21:08,223
"I'm here, it's all right."

329
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:12,159
What is she like?

330
01:21:14,362 --> 01:21:15,362
Beautiful.

331
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:22,170
How was New York?

332
01:21:22,904 --> 01:21:23,904
It's the same.

333
01:21:26,174 --> 01:21:27,309
So what brings you back?

334
01:21:29,211 --> 01:21:30,579
My funding came through.

335
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,880
That's great!

336
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:34,181
See!

337
01:21:34,883 --> 01:21:36,184
They know how good you are.

338
01:21:49,297 --> 01:21:50,297
I miss you.

339
01:21:53,168 --> 01:21:54,269
I saw your mom.

340
01:21:55,804 --> 01:21:56,938
She's not doing very well.

341
01:21:58,974 --> 01:22:01,676
I'm worried it would kill her
if she knew I was searching.

342
01:22:02,844 --> 01:22:04,179
You underestimate her.

343
01:22:05,147 --> 01:22:06,147
She needs you.

344
01:22:57,099 --> 01:22:58,166
What?

345
01:23:00,502 --> 01:23:03,205
What if you do find home
and there is no one there?

346
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:08,810
And you never stop? You
just keep searching?

347
01:23:11,146 --> 01:23:12,892
And you don't know what happens over time

348
01:23:14,649 --> 01:23:16,985
Change, the entire world has changed.

349
01:23:18,253 --> 01:23:19,588
I don't have a choice.

350
01:23:35,003 --> 01:23:36,471
Stay.

351
01:23:41,309 --> 01:23:42,309
I can't.

352
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,735
John heard Mantosh
is out on the boats

353
01:24:46,575 --> 01:24:48,043
Doing a lobster run.

354
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:56,785
He's due back tomorrow.

355
01:25:01,389 --> 01:25:04,092
So he'll be flush with cash
back on the hard stuff.

356
01:25:09,564 --> 01:25:11,299
I'm sorry you couldn't have your own kids.

357
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:16,271
What are you saying?

358
01:25:18,273 --> 01:25:19,273
We...

359
01:25:21,476 --> 01:25:23,278
We weren't blank pages, were we?

360
01:25:24,346 --> 01:25:25,714
Like your own would have been.

361
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:31,019
You weren't just adopting
us but our past as well.

362
01:25:33,755 --> 01:25:37,359
"I feel like we're killing you."
"I could have had kids."

363
01:25:40,562 --> 01:25:41,562
What?

364
01:25:41,763 --> 01:25:43,098
We chose not to have kids.

365
01:25:45,667 --> 01:25:47,235
We wanted the two of you.

366
01:25:48,703 --> 01:25:49,871
That's what we wanted.

367
01:25:51,139 --> 01:25:54,763
We wanted the two of you in our lives.

368
01:25:54,764 --> 01:25:56,415
That's what we chose.

369
01:26:04,686 --> 01:26:06,371
That's one of the reasons I fell in love

370
01:26:06,372 --> 01:26:07,372
With your father.

371
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:10,425
Because we both felt

372
01:26:12,127 --> 01:26:14,129
The world has enough people in it.

373
01:26:17,999 --> 01:26:20,935
Having a child is no guarantee
to make anything better

374
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:23,872
But take a child that has
suffered like the two of you

375
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:28,577
Give you a chance.

376
01:26:31,012 --> 01:26:32,180
That's something.

377
01:26:33,014 --> 01:26:35,183
I bet you never imagined
it being this hard.

378
01:26:35,584 --> 01:26:37,252
It's not a matter of hard

379
01:26:37,853 --> 01:26:39,054
It's not a matter...

380
01:26:43,859 --> 01:26:45,727
There's only one path for me.

381
01:26:46,595 --> 01:26:47,829
And that's how I think

382
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:51,466
That's how this happened because

383
01:26:54,803 --> 01:26:56,304
When I was 12

384
01:26:57,072 --> 01:26:58,306
I had a vision.

385
01:27:06,047 --> 01:27:09,584
Some people would say it
was a breakdown but it

386
01:27:12,888 --> 01:27:16,158
My dad was an alcoholic you know that

387
01:27:17,292 --> 01:27:19,528
He was not a good man.

388
01:27:20,695 --> 01:27:22,130
He was out of control

389
01:27:24,566 --> 01:27:28,336
I was standing out in back of our house
I was looking out across this field

390
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:33,875
And I just wanted the
earth to swallow me up.

391
01:27:35,977 --> 01:27:37,078
And I...

392
01:27:43,285 --> 01:27:46,822
I felt an electric current
that was like a shock,

393
01:27:46,988 --> 01:27:48,957
A jolt through my whole body.

394
01:27:50,125 --> 01:27:51,259
And then I saw...

395
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:53,161
A brown-skinned child

396
01:27:53,829 --> 01:27:55,130
Across that field.

397
01:28:00,735 --> 01:28:02,604
And he was standing beside me.

398
01:28:03,004 --> 01:28:07,500
He was right there and I
could feel it so strongly.

399
01:28:10,245 --> 01:28:13,949
And for the first time in my
life I felt something good...

400
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:17,327
I felt good.

401
01:28:19,387 --> 01:28:22,124
And I knew it was guiding me.

402
01:28:22,257 --> 01:28:25,160
And I knew I'd be fine.

403
01:28:28,163 --> 01:28:31,600
It was... at that moment
I could see my future

404
01:28:31,733 --> 01:28:32,733
Right there.

405
01:28:34,202 --> 01:28:38,140
Because I always believed that I
could get this family together.

406
01:28:39,174 --> 01:28:40,174
And now...

407
01:28:41,276 --> 01:28:42,577
I don't know.

408
01:28:43,411 --> 01:28:44,411
Where

409
01:28:44,813 --> 01:28:47,449
Mother... What's happening?
I don't understand

410
01:28:52,854 --> 01:28:54,956
You don't talk to me anymore

411
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,501
I need you, Saroo.

412
01:29:46,007 --> 01:29:47,007
Mantosh!

413
01:29:57,552 --> 01:29:59,421
Sorry for what I said at dinner.

414
01:35:40,195 --> 01:35:41,930
Ganesh Talai...

415
01:35:44,132 --> 01:35:46,234
Ganesh Talai.

416
01:35:48,904 --> 01:35:49,904
Ganestlay!

417
01:37:14,723 --> 01:37:15,891
I found home!

418
01:37:31,239 --> 01:37:32,274
Please wait for me.

419
01:37:37,145 --> 01:37:38,280
I'm here.

420
01:37:46,154 --> 01:37:48,023
So this is where you've been

421
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:52,127
I did not want you to feel
that I was ungrateful.

422
01:37:55,397 --> 01:37:57,566
There wasn't a day I
didn't want to tell you.

423
01:38:01,570 --> 01:38:03,238
Saroo.

424
01:38:05,273 --> 01:38:06,875
I really hope she's there.

425
01:38:10,946 --> 01:38:13,448
She needs to see how beautiful you are!

426
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:14,656
Hi, I used to live here.

427
01:42:17,426 --> 01:42:18,693
I...used to...

428
01:42:20,395 --> 01:42:21,395
Can I help you?

429
01:42:25,934 --> 01:42:27,736
That's me. I'm Saroo.

430
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:29,270
I used to live here.

431
01:42:29,905 --> 01:42:31,873
You lived here?
Yes yeah I used to live here.

432
01:42:32,641 --> 01:42:36,578
I'm looking for Guddu, Kamla, Shekila.

433
01:42:37,012 --> 01:42:38,012
My mom.

434
01:43:12,547 --> 01:43:13,547
Come.

435
01:43:14,049 --> 01:43:15,049
Come with!

436
01:43:15,517 --> 01:43:16,651
Come with me.

437
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:18,119
Just come.

438
01:44:54,917 --> 01:44:55,917
Mom.

439
01:44:56,952 --> 01:44:58,019
Saroo?

440
01:45:01,123 --> 01:45:02,123
Saroo...

441
01:45:27,282 --> 01:45:28,282
I'm sorry.

442
01:45:29,785 --> 01:45:30,944
I am so sorry.

443
01:45:46,982 --> 01:45:48,141
Yes, the watermelons!

444
01:45:49,172 --> 01:45:51,523
Tarabuja! Yes, tarabuja!

445
01:46:12,961 --> 01:46:13,961
Guddu?

446
01:46:15,063 --> 01:46:16,063
Where is Guddu?

447
01:46:19,601 --> 01:46:20,601
Where is he?

448
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:27,843
Guddu is no more.

449
01:46:28,677 --> 01:46:30,378
He is with God.

450
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:23,230
Shekila.

451
01:47:23,799 --> 01:47:24,799
Shekila?

452
01:47:26,435 --> 01:47:27,435
Shekila?

453
01:47:28,336 --> 01:47:30,135
And your brother.

454
01:47:32,174 --> 01:47:33,341
It's me, Saroo.

455
01:48:31,633 --> 01:48:32,708
<i>Hello mother.</i>

456
01:48:33,502 --> 01:48:35,003
<i>I know you'll be sound asleep.</i>

457
01:48:35,737 --> 01:48:37,472
<i>I just want to say that I'm safe.</i>

458
01:48:39,141 --> 01:48:41,476
<i>I'm safe and the questions
have been answered.</i>

459
01:48:43,745 --> 01:48:45,147
<i>There are no more dead-ends.</i>

460
01:48:47,315 --> 01:48:48,583
<i>I found my mother.</i>

461
01:48:49,117 --> 01:48:51,052
<i>She thanks you both for raising me.</i>

462
01:48:52,687 --> 01:48:54,423
<i>She understands that you are my family.</i>

463
01:48:55,590 --> 01:49:00,280
<i>She's happy just knowing I'm alive.</i>

464
01:49:02,831 --> 01:49:05,567
<i>I found her,
but that does not change who you are.</i>

465
01:49:07,269 --> 01:49:08,270
<i>I love you mom...</i>

466
01:49:08,837 --> 01:49:09,971
<i>So much.</i>

467
01:49:10,939 --> 01:49:11,939
<i>And you, Dad.</i>

468
01:49:13,141 --> 01:49:14,590
<i>And Mantosh.</i>

469
01:50:45,667 --> 01:50:46,667
Saroo!
