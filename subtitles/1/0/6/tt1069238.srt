00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,116
<i>Winters didn't feel this cold...</i>

4
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,413
<i>when I was a child.</i>

5
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:02,950
<i>It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.</i>

6
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:09,791
<i>Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.</i>

7
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,816
Please, this way.

8
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,947
Coming in.

9
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,463
My condolences.

10
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,435
We are here to assist you with encoffining.

11
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,601
May I light up the incense?

12
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,468
Yes.

13
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,269
Thank you for coming.

14
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,069
Looks like she's still alive.

15
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,074
Probably charcoal-burning suicide.

16
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,678
How can you tell?

17
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,410
The body is undamaged.

18
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,617
This is what happens when someone is discovered immediately after death in a cold car.

19
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,725
What a waste, she's beautiful.

20
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,361
Do you want to try?

21
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,568
Yes.

22
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:59,832
For the deceased's peaceful departure,

23
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,570
I will now commence the rite of encoffinment.

24
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,550
Everyone, please see her off from up close.

25
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,238
I will now begin the cleansing.

26
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,067
It has the thing.

27
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:46,837
What thing?

28
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,071
The <i>thing</i>.

29
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,304
What thing?

30
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,542
You know, the thing...

31
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,291
Err... May I have a word with you?

32
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,899
Yes, what is it?

33
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,334
After the cleansing,

34
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,131
we apply makeup on the deceased...

35
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:51,040
We have different makeups for male and female...

36
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,407
Oh... please wait.

37
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,308
Yes.

38
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,780
Sis, which makeup do you want for Tomeo?

39
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,417
Men's or girl's?

40
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,148
Come on, which one?

41
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,987
If I gave birth to a girl from the start,

42
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,331
this would've never happened...

43
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,963
But thanks to <i>someone's</i> seed...

44
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,673
Girl's is fine then?

45
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:22,531
Yep.

46
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,175
Female's, please.

47
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,640
Yes.

48
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,523
Tomeo...

49
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
"Okuribito"

50
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
DEPARTURES

51
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,083
Not many in the audience again today.

52
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,424
Yeah, they should put more effort into advertising.

53
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,493
I know!

54
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,664
Let's make a homepage for the orchestra.

55
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,098
My wife's a web designer.

56
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,431
I'll make her do it for free.

57
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,834
What do you think?

58
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,104
More importantly, are <i>you</i> going to be fine?

59
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,540
About what?

60
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:13,406
Next, the next.

61
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:14,711
Next what?

62
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,047
You spent so much money on that, gotta start looking for the next one.

63
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:22,845
Good performance again, everyone.

64
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,684
Good work everyone.

65
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,152
Although the seats were empty...

66
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,658
I think your performances were great.

67
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,027
Um... actually...

68
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,298
today...

69
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,972
the owner of this orchestra, Mr. Sonezaki...

70
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,373
has something to tell you,

71
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,478
so please give him your attention.

72
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,457
You're... disbanded.

73
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:13,772
See ya.

74
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,903
<i>I finally became an orchestra member.</i>

75
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:25,249
<i>But it became a past memory in a flash.</i>

76
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,414
<i>This cello is innocent.</i>

77
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,289
<i>Only because it was bought by a loser like me,</i>

78
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,889
<i>it lost its job.</i>

79
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,593
<i>In many ways...</i>

80
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,430
<i>this cello was too heavy for me.</i>

81
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,272
Thank you very much.

82
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,600
Please cook it immediately.

83
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:49,502
Yes.

84
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,734
Good bye.

85
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,137
I'm home.

86
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,245
Welcome back.

87
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,278
She gave me an octopus.

88
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,952
I just happened to see our neighbor.

89
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,385
They just caught it this morning.

90
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,925
What's wrong?

91
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,121
Disbanded.

92
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,460
What is?

93
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,699
My orchestra.

94
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,639
I see...

95
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,339
You just have to find the next one.

96
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,680
There won't be a next one.

97
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,991
Someone with my skill level can only go so far...

98
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,921
and there's the debt for this cello.

99
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,366
How much?

100
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,472
Don't worry, if it's just around $10,000...

101
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,943
I can pay it back with my job.

102
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,373
$180,000.

103
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,842
$1... $180,000?

104
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,011
Pros all spend that much...

105
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,178
it's relatively cheap.

106
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,690
Why did you hide it from me?

107
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,324
I knew you'd be against it.

108
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,303
Why didn't you tell me...

109
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,863
about something so important?

110
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,199
I'm sorry.

111
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,844
I'll make dinner.

112
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,095
<i>"All the cities around the world are our new homes.</i>

113
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:57,063
<i>Let's live together on a musical tour."</i>

114
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,438
<i>Those were the words of my marriage proposal.</i>

115
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,174
<i>But the reality is harsh.</i>

116
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:11,279
<i>No, I should've realized the limit to my talent a lot sooner.</i>

117
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:18,787
What happened?

118
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,555
This octopus is alive!

119
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,229
You're right. It's alive.

120
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,361
Hey, Dai...

121
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,258
what should we do?

122
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:35,169
Don't get caught again.

123
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,147
Huh?

124
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,310
I think I'll quit.

125
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,882
Quit what?

126
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,316
Cello.

127
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,951
What will you do then?

128
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,190
Go back to the countryside... in Yamagata.

129
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,862
I vote yes!

130
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,135
Huh?

131
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:41,930
You don't mind?

132
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,673
Well, the house your mom left you...

133
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,507
we don't need to pay rent, right?

134
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,978
But you really don't mind?

135
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,148
Yes.

136
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,052
This is a wonderful instrument.

137
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,492
<i>I thought it was the greatest turning point of my life,</i>

138
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:09,333
<i>but for some reason, I felt relieved the instant I let go of the cello.</i>

139
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,795
<i>As if I was suddenly released</i>

140
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,706
<i>from being tied up.</i>

141
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,667
<i>What I believed to be my dream...</i>

142
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,539
<i>was probably not my real dream.</i>

143
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,391
<i>The only thing my mother left me,</i>

144
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,197
<i>when she died two years ago.</i>

145
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,706
<i>I've been told my father ran the cafe at first,</i>

146
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,938
<i>but I have almost no recollection of it.</i>

147
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,213
<i>After he left home for another woman,<i>

148
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,480
<i>my mother ran this small cafe,</i>

149
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,282
<i>and raised me alone.</i>

150
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,990
Meal's ready.

151
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,857
Okay.

152
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,935
I thought you would hate the countryside more.

153
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,939
No, it's kind of refreshing.

154
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,176
I don't know if it's because of the water here, but the rice tastes better too.

155
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,279
Really?

156
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,273
Oh, maybe I'll start a shop.

157
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,716
What will you sell?

158
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:41,823
This is it!

159
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,162
This, this one!

160
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,589
No age limit, high salary?

161
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,663
In addition, short actual working time?

162
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,659
As a full-time employee!

163
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,737
"NK Agent"? What kind of company is that?

164
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,606
"A job that helps out journeys."

165
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,270
A travel agency?

166
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,444
Oh, maybe tour guide?

167
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,943
It says "no experience necessary".

168
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,641
I'll go ask for details.

169
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:06,985
Yeah.

170
00:18:29,737 --> 00:18:31,306
This is it.

171
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,216
Excuse me.

172
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,387
Is this "NK Agent"?

173
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,456
Yes...

174
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,459
I'm Kobayashi, I called earlier.

175
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,825
Oh, you're here for the interview!

176
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,265
The boss will be back soon, sit here.

177
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,070
Yes, thank you.

178
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,273
I...

179
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,978
was against it when the boss wanted to post the ad in the newspaper.

180
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,216
Oh...

181
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,719
It's extremely hard to attract people into this industry.

182
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:26,095
Um... what does this company do?

183
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,096
What? You came without knowing anything?

184
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,428
It said to help out with journeys...

185
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,938
Uh... that's not what you do?

186
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,287
Boss, he's here for the interview.

187
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,783
Nice to meet you, I'm Kobayashi.
I called you this morning.

188
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,825
Oh, it's you.

189
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,757
You seem more energetic than on the phone.

190
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,127
Thank you.

191
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,299
See? It was a good idea.
Pour some tea.

192
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,165
Yes.

193
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,870
I brought my resume just in case.

194
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,272
Okay, sit down.

195
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,504
Thank you.

196
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,147
Can you put in lots of hours here?

197
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,053
Huh? Uh... yes.

198
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,056
You're hired.

199
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,749
Eh?

200
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,588
What's your name again?

201
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,161
It's Kobayashi Daigo.

202
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,593
Order his business cards right away.

203
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:33,761
Got it.

204
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,095
W... wait...

205
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,102
We haven't discussed anything... salaries and other things...

206
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,330
Oh, right.

207
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,431
Let's start with one hand.

208
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:44,934
"One hand"?

209
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,611
$500?

210
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,214
$5000.

211
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:52,779
$5000?!

212
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:54,277
Too little?

213
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,181
Not at all, I can get that much?

214
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,016
I don't mind paying you in cash, daily.

215
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:01,057
No, wait, what kind of work will I...?

216
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,461
Let's see...

217
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,599
As my assistant at first.

218
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,800
Exactly what...?

219
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:13,864
To be exact...

220
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:15,905
encoffining.

221
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,534
<i>Encoffining</i>?

222
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,874
A job that places the corpse into the coffin.

223
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,277
It's starting to bloom!

224
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,576
Corpse as in dead people?

225
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,081
You ask funny questions.

226
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:38,959
No, uh, um...

227
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,157
The job posting said helping out journeys.

228
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,759
I assumed it was a travel agency...

229
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,266
Oh, this is a misprint.

230
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,406
Misprint?

231
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:52,037
Not "helping out journeys", it's...

232
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,178
"Helping out peaceful departure".

233
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,482
Departure?

234
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,113
So "NK" stands for "NouKan" (Encoffining).

235
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:09,450
Anyway, it must be some kind of fate.
Just give it a try.

236
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,721
You can quit if it doesn't suit you.

237
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,461
This is for today.

238
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,698
No, I can't...

239
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,767
Don't worry!

240
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,165
No...

241
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,283
I'm back.

242
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,651
Welcome back.

243
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,223
Here.

244
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:46,688
Where did you get this?

245
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,523
You said you wanted to eat sukiyaki from here, right?

246
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,401
Yonezawa-beef?

247
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,538
The highest-grade sirloin.

248
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,334
Wow! Was it expensive?

249
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,569
I got paid in advance.

250
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,577
You got the job?

251
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,138
Kind of, yes.

252
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,644
Great! Let's celebrate today.

253
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:05,807
Sure.

254
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,642
So, what kind of job was it?

255
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,445
Tour guide after all?

256
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,247
Not really...

257
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,488
Sales?

258
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,185
What's the matter?

259
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,997
It wasn't a travel agency.

260
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,765
Oh? What was it?

261
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,631
Ceremonial event-related...

262
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,434
Like a wedding hall?

263
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,232
Yeah.

264
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:33,074
They might make you play the cello again!

265
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,348
I'll make sukiyaki right away.

266
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,281
Okay.

267
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:44,244
This is great! Looks tasty.

268
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,929
I don't think I'll come back that late.

269
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:01,701
Get going.

270
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,704
Bye.

271
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,399
Morning.

272
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,903
Hello.

273
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,437
Use the boss' table until the new one arrives.

274
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,444
Your business cards are ready.

275
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,682
No misprints.

276
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,033
Are these that uncommon?

277
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,701
This is my first time seeing a real one.

278
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:11,670
First time?

279
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,538
Yes.

280
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:16,074
My grandparents passed away before I've grown up,

281
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,614
and my mother passed away while I was abroad.

282
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,574
She was already in her grave when I got back.

283
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,943
What about your father?

284
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,784
He left home for another woman when I was 6.

285
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,953
Your mother must have been lonely.

286
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,165
But...

287
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,477
I wonder if someone like me who has never even seen a dead body before...

288
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,307
can really do this job?

289
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,244
You'll get used to it!

290
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,851
To dead bodies?

291
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:56,849
Yeah.

292
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,350
The weather is nice lately, so we're not very busy...

293
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,489
but change of season...

294
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,160
Do you need help?

295
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,593
...will be very busy for us.

296
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,032
Where does work come from?

297
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,330
Funeral homes.

298
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:14,928
Funeral homes?

299
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,673
Yes. Encoffining...

300
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,175
used to be done by family members.

301
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,145
Eventually it was passed to funeral homes,

302
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:27,173
then companies like ours appeared.

303
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:31,449
In short, it's a super-niche industry.

304
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,720
It's pretty heavy.

305
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,955
There are many kinds of coffins.

306
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,128
$500, $1000, $3000.

307
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,032
They differ by that much?

308
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:47,136
The left one is plywood, the next one has metal fittings and carvings on both sides.

309
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:50,302
And the most expensive one is solid cypress wood.

310
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,843
Oh, the difference is in material and decoration.

311
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,777
Yes, they all burn the same way.

312
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,576
Same ashes.

313
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:02,216
The last shopping of your life is done by others.

314
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,387
Kind of ironic.

315
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:04,317
Right.

316
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,890
Yes, this is NK Agent.

317
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,060
Yes, he's here.

318
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,162
Yes, Minato Theater?

319
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,929
Immediately? Okay.

320
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,704
Is that the boss?

321
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,830
A job.

322
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,570
A job?

323
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,387
Are you from NK?

324
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,659
Yes.

325
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:15,655
He's here.

326
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:18,456
Oh, there he is.

327
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,802
He's a newcomer to our company...

328
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:27,597
Kobayashi.

329
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,673
...his name is Kobayashi, the model for today.

330
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:30,739
Good luck everyone.

331
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:31,838
Model?

332
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,775
We're going to film right after you finish changing.

333
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,110
Thank you for your cooperation.

334
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,151
Get changed and makeup over there.

335
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,248
Makeup?

336
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:44,384
Yes.

337
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:47,491
Boss...

338
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,050
Don't worry. Go ahead.

339
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,355
Okay.

340
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,530
[ Encoffining Manual ]

341
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,667
...first apply cotton stuffing and cleansing.

342
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:06,366

343
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,769
The model is coming out!

344
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,390
Not bad.

345
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,020
Um... who's going to see this video?

346
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,596
Don't worry,

347
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:31,435
it's a corporate DVD, so nobody will see it.

348
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,469
In encoffining,

349
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,306
we first perform cotton stuffing and cleansing.

350
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:51,113
Cleansing symbolizes the ridding of this world's fatigue, pain, and lust...

351
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:56,950
and also symbolizes the first bath for a new birth.

352
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,567
Traditionally, a washtub was used for cleansing,

353
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,564
but for sanitary reasons,

354
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:10,432
nowadays, we use sterilized cloths...

355
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,165
to wipe...

356
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,339
the body.

357
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:25,953
Clothing ritual is performed to maintain the dignity of the deceased.

358
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:30,150
Making sure the deceased's skin cannot be seen by the relatives...

359
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,287
we perform it with utmost care.

360
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,599
After the preparation,

361
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:48,538
we shave the face before applying makeup.

362
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,782
Males in particular experience shrinking of muscle and dry skin,

363
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,948
it seems as if they have a long mustache,

364
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,653
so we shave them thoroughly.

365
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:09,587
The skin of the dead gets damaged easier than you might think.

366
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:13,832
Sometimes the skin peels off just by touch.

367
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:16,640
Therefore,

368
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:23,039
we perform it with caution and care...

369
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:24,772
Ow!

370
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:25,678
What the...

371
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,748
Ow, ow!!

372
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:28,074
Uh, oh.

373
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:31,986
Ow, it hurts, it hurts!

374
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,019
Uh, oh...

375
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,997
Ow, ow!

376
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,995
Don't worry, don't worry.

377
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,529
It's not so bad.

378
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,470
Welcome home.

379
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:52,541
I'm home.

380
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,212
What is it?

381
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,787
What happened to your face?

382
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,947
My boss pushed me while I was shaving.

383
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:11,023
You were shaving at work?

384
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:12,527
Yeah.

385
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:16,065
You only use electric shavers at home...

386
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,699
I had no choice, the boss ordered me to do it.

387
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,903
Don't worry, it's not so bad.

388
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,536
Weird company.

389
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:25,998
No kidding.

390
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:26,906
Weird...

391
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:27,908
weird company.

392
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:39,152
<i>The first job came without a warning.</i>

393
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,221
Um...

394
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,257
what should I do?

395
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,332
For today...

396
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,669
you just have to watch.

397
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,768
Okay.

398
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,239
But man...

399
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,776
we hit a bad one.

400
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,342
Huh? What do you mean?

401
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:07,910
Never mind.

402
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,481
Well, you'll see.

403
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,681
Don't scare me like that!

404
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,265
Thank you for waiting.

405
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,960
Thanks for coming.

406
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,361
Where is the body?

407
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:32,367
An old lady living by herself... dead for two weeks.

408
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,537
The body is badly deteriorated. Be careful.

409
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:36,945
See you later.

410
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:41,974
Who is he?

411
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:46,688
From the funeral home.
Our employer.

412
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,957
Let's get started.

413
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:58,635
It stinks!

414
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,462
Ugh.

415
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:23,452
This way.

416
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:24,322
Eh?

417
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,700
Help out a little.

418
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,099
Yes.

419
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:53,585
Hold her feet.

420
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:57,486
Her feet!

421
00:34:58,963 --> 00:34:59,822
Yes.

422
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,935
You said I only have to watch...

423
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,640
Slowly... gently...

424
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,046
Come on, hold them!

425
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:18,979
Yes.

426
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:34,724
Wait, wait...

427
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,240
You can go home for today.

428
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:02,320
It was a bit too intense for the first job.

429
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:25,113
Really? Let's go today.
- Yeah sure!

430
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,457
Hey, did you eat something weird?

431
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:38,356
No.

432
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,793
Something smells.

433
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,022
Must be your scarf!

434
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,860
No way!

435
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,138
That guy wearing black, he smells!

436
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:06,956
Ah! It's still here!

437
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,544
Leave it over there.

438
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:29,743
Yes.

439
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:34,708
$3.

440
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,476
Okay. Thanks.

441
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,318
Towels for $1.

442
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:39,346
Okay.

443
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,421
You can get a lot of money for this place right now.

444
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,628
I refuse to quit.

445
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,596
Leave already.

446
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,135
I just want the best for you.

447
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,704
You talk just like a civil servant!

448
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:31,969
I'm not so old that you need to worry about me!

449
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,370
Right? Shiori?

450
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,904
Can I come for the big bath again?

451
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,811
Yes, of course!

452
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,542
For you,

453
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:45,713
grandma will work hard!

454
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:47,883
Daigo...

455
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:49,458
Yamashita.

456
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,760
When did you come back? You could've at least contacted me!

457
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,626
Sorry, I've been busy.

458
00:38:56,867 --> 00:39:01,827
Oh! You're Dai from Kobayashi's cafe.

459
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,696
Yes, it's been a long time.

460
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,834
It sure has been!

461
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,804
I hear you have an amazing job!

462
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,413
Huh? Well... yes...

463
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,513
What is that instrument called?

464
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,850
Cello, that monster-sized violin.

465
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,958
Right, cello!

466
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,624
He's a great man.

467
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:27,992
He plays an instrument called cello in Tokyo!

468
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,326
Wow!

469
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,768
If only my son was as talented as he is!

470
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,464
Mom...

471
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:42,212
Sorry, we're having a little argument here.
Next time...

472
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:43,313
Sure, next time.

473
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,141
Bring your wife here next time.

474
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,181
You're married, right?

475
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,114
Yes.

476
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,550
This place is very peaceful without this fool.

477
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,919
Which fool gave birth to this fool?

478
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,026
Anyway, I have no intention of selling this place!

479
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,129
Oh, I got it!

480
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:00,622
Did you figure it out?

481
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:04,031
Yes, I finally figured it out.

482
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:33,987
Something happen at work?

483
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:35,929
No.

484
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:38,832
Let's eat!

485
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:39,993
Yeah.

486
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,099
Let's eat...

487
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,210
Our neighbor gave it to me.

488
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:47,901
Oh.

489
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:51,139
It was just slaughtered this morning, so it's really fresh!

490
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,273
She said we can even eat it raw!

491
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,427
Maybe we should wait a little longer.

492
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:12,928
Hey...

493
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,531
Are you ok?

494
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,771
Are you alright?

495
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,553
What's wrong?

496
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:52,268
What's wrong?

497
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,761
Dai, you're acting strange...

498
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:22,263
Hey, come on, Dai...

499
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,807
Hey, you're embarrassing me.

500
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,936
Not here...

501
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,478
Dai?

502
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,328
Hey, wait...

503
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:49,900
Mika...

504
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:53,702
Mika...

505
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,224
<i>What exactly...</i>

506
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,155
<i>am I being tested for?</i>

507
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:25,062
<i>Is this my punishment for not seeing my mother off?</i>

508
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,004
<i>What will happen to me?</i>

509
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:39,074
<i>Strangely, thinking about it made me want to play the cello.</i>

510
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:46,281
<i>I simply wanted to play the cello while reminiscing my past.</i>

511
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:50,119
It's so small...

512
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,243
Salmons?

513
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:39,175
Ah, yes.

514
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:47,651
They're right by the rocks... over there.

515
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:52,291
Oh! Go for it!

516
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:01,569
It's kind of sad... to climb only to die.

517
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,500
Why work so hard if you're going to die anyway?

518
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,109
I'm sure they want to go back...

519
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:14,415
to their birthplace.

520
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:51,449
Let's go for lunch. Lunch.

521
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:57,916
It's an order from your boss.

522
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,831
Is this a coincidence?

523
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:04,824
Huh?

524
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:07,030
That you happened to pass through here.

525
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,034
It's fate.

526
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,274
There's no such thing...

527
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,911
This is your god-given job.

528
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,346
Don't be ridiculous!

529
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:38,490
I'm sorry, sorry, I apologize.

530
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,267
They're angry!

531
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,571
Come on, Mr. Sasaki!

532
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,704
Sorry.

533
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,043
You're late.

534
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:59,219
It's 5 minutes past already!

535
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,618
I apologize.

536
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:04,289
You people make a living from the dead.

537
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:05,316
Brother...

538
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,121
Hurry up, damn it.

539
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,324
I sincerely apologize.

540
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,751
Is there a lipstick your wife liked to use?

541
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,596
What?

542
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,210
<i>To revive a cold body,</i>

543
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,349
<i>and grant eternal beauty.</i>

544
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:59,684
<i>It was calm and precise.</i>

545
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:03,395
<i>And more than anything, it was filled with affection.</i>

546
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:09,593
<i>To be present at the last farewell, and send off the deceased.</i>

547
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:16,939
<i>It was tranquil, and every action seemed elegant.</i>

548
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,611
Thank you very much.

549
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,331
Please allow me to close the lid.

550
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:55,948
Naomi...

551
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,268
Naomi...

552
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:36,859
Excuse me...

553
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,789
I'm sorry about earlier today.

554
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:45,127
No, it's our fault.

555
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:49,203
Please take these.

556
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:51,638
Thank you.

557
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,743
That was...

558
00:56:55,945 --> 00:57:00,209
the most beautiful she's ever been.

559
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,020
Thank you so much.

560
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:46,551
It's nothing.

561
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,454
Welcome.

562
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,328
Good evening.

563
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,331
Good evening.

564
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:34,041
Ah! Don't tell me...

565
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,111
Yes, she's my wife.

566
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:38,406
Wow!

567
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:39,845
Nice to meet you.

568
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,076
You've caught a pretty one!

569
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:45,449
It's not a big deal!

570
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:51,319
Take your time and warm up.

571
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,122
Yes, thank you.

572
00:58:58,067 --> 00:58:59,193
Good evening.

573
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,164
Oh, hello.

574
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:07,435
Do you always come here?

575
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:10,740
I've been coming here for more than 50 years.

576
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,943
Oh! Maybe I've seen you before...

577
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,784
Hot baths like this are pretty nice too.

578
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,517
They use groundwater heated by firewood.

579
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,359
The water feels soft.

580
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:31,655
That's why it doesn't sting even though it's hot.

581
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:33,969
I see.

582
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:37,464
It's the best bath house in Japan!

583
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:38,335
Right.

584
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,612
See you again, Tsuyako.

585
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:49,243
Thank you, come again.

586
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:56,149
Would you like me to help?

587
00:59:56,693 --> 01:00:00,026
It's bad karma to get help from the customer!

588
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,999
You do everything by yourself?

589
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:15,905
Yes, my husband died a long time ago.

590
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,444
My son who works at a government office

591
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:21,183
tells me I should sell this place so they can build a condo here...

592
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:24,547
but my current customers would be in a fix.

593
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,919
As long as I'm still healthy...

594
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,787
Come on, you're still young.

595
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,390
Give him your support.

596
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,554
What?

597
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:38,863
Dai is too kind.

598
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,367
He keeps everything to himself.

599
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,206
When his parents split up too...

600
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:48,706
He never cried in front of his mother.

601
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:54,310
He cried when he was alone in the bath.

602
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:59,885
So hard his shoulders shook from crying.

603
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:06,317
He's like that sometimes. Please be understanding.

604
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:09,954
Yes.

605
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,738
How's the water today?

606
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:21,303
Hmm... so-so.

607
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,843
Oh, shush!

608
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:25,410
That's great. It looks good on you.

609
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,513
It's all white!

610
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:38,260
It's going to get cold starting tomorrow!
Give it to me.

611
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:39,656
Thanks.

612
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,623
Hey, wanna go for a drink?

613
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,859
Oh, right! I know a nice bar.

614
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,663
Really? Let's go!

615
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:48,935
(With dialect) "Let's go".

616
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:49,968
Let's go?

617
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:51,731
Let's go.

618
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:52,898
Let's go!

619
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,486
It's good!

620
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,991
It's been a long time since we've drunk together like this.

621
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:19,466
It's like a scene from an enka (traditional Japanese song).

622
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:34,377
Your mother listened to this kind of music?

623
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,741
They must all be my father's.

624
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:39,880
Oh, right.

625
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:43,553
It started out as your father's cafe.

626
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:47,455
I don't even want to think about him.

627
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,065
Actually, I don't even remember his face.

628
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,834
Don't you want to see him?

629
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:56,064
Nope.

630
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:03,841
But... if I did...

631
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:05,536
If you met him?

632
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,740
I'd knock him out.

633
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,155
It's my father's favorite.

634
01:04:06,374 --> 01:04:08,640
I think...

635
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:16,304
your mom loved your dad the whole time.

636
01:04:20,821 --> 01:04:22,481
No way.

637
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:26,425
Otherwise she would've thrown out all the records.

638
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:31,291
She wouldn't have sorted them.

639
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:01,325
Yes?

640
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:04,126
<i>I want you to go right away.</i>

641
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,462
What? Now?

642
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:10,368
Yes, someone hung himself in the Star Hotel by the station.

643
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:13,837
What about the boss?

644
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:18,310
He just left for another client.

645
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:21,310
Please go by yourself today.
Okay?

646
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,319
Okay.

647
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:09,932
Have a good day.

648
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:11,192
Thanks.

649
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:31,449
Good morning.

650
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:34,078
Morning. Thanks for last night.

651
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:39,717
The police officer was impressed.
Because of your young age.

652
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,796
I gave it everything I've got.

653
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,263
I see.

654
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,629
It's really cold today.

655
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:48,600
Yeah.

656
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:52,768
Here.

657
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,500
Thank you.

658
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:56,907
Bloodyshot eyes! Didn't get any sleep?

659
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:01,105
This job is mentally draining.

660
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:09,758
How did you end up in this job, Ms. Uemura?

661
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:13,792
Thanks for the tea.

662
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:18,096
A lot happened when I was young.

663
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:20,634
I couldn't stay over there...

664
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:22,000
Where?

665
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:23,731
Hokkaido.

666
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,943
None of my past jobs lasted.

667
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:33,008
I just happened to end up in a cafe in this town.

668
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:39,552
But the owner had a cerebral hemorrhage...

669
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:42,118
and died all of a sudden!

670
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:47,926
Then, our boss came...

671
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:54,625
That was when I witnessed encoffining for the first time.

672
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:59,437
Made me think...

673
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:02,569
when I die, I want this person to do it for me.

674
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:08,506
He's completely different from others.

675
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:13,880
That's how I ended up here.

676
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:20,217
Fate plays funny tricks on people.

677
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,997
Never know what'll happen.

678
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:26,500
You're right.

679
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:29,161
Tastes great.

680
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:37,876
Hey, Yamashita.

681
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,142
Is he a friend of yours?

682
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:45,110
Good afternoon.

683
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:45,811
Good afternoon.

684
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,582
You don't have to greet him.

685
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:49,758
Honey...

686
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:52,254
Go on. I'll catch up.

687
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:02,030
There's a rumor going around.

688
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:03,701
About what?

689
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:09,841
It's none of my business, but find a proper job!

690
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:17,917
Let's go. Come.

691
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,028
I'm home.

692
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,210
Mika?

693
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:52,787
Mika...

694
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:57,917
What's wrong?

695
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:07,932
<i>...make sure the relatives cannot see the cotton stuffing taking place...</i>

696
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:11,906
<i>At times, we may need to stuff the anus as well.</i>

697
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,043
<i>Roll up the cotton like this, and...</i>

698
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:23,916
<i>push in all the way inside the anus to prevent an outflow of body fluid.</i>

699
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,750
What's this?

700
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,361
You looked through my desk without my permission?

701
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:38,295
That's not the issue.

702
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:43,532
I just happened to be a model for this...

703
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:46,937
I found out about your job too.

704
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:54,312
So... what?

705
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:01,448
Why didn't you tell me?

706
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:03,017
You would've been against it...

707
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:06,719
Of course! Doing this kind of job...

708
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:09,797
aren't you ashamed of it?

709
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,028
Why should I be?

710
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:17,296
Because I touch dead people everyday?

711
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:21,841
I just want you to have a normal job.

712
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:23,308
What's normal?

713
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,875
Everyone dies.

714
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:29,312
I'll eventually die, and so will you.

715
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:32,175
Death itself is normal.

716
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:36,151
I don't care about the philosophy of it!
Just quit the job now.

717
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:38,784
Please.

718
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:51,102
I've never complained until now.

719
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:55,040
When you wanted to quit the cello...

720
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,476
and when you said you wanted to come back to the countryside...

721
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:01,708
I followed you with a smile.

722
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:09,382
Of course, I was actually sad.

723
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:14,220
But...

724
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,796
because I love you...

725
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,864
So please...

726
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:28,341
just this once,

727
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,279
do what I ask.

728
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:45,817
And if I said no?

729
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,966
Can you work in this job for rest of your life?

730
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:13,981
I'm going back to my parent's home.

731
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,020
Come and get me after you quit your job.

732
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,025
Mika...

733
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:18,626
Don't touch me!

734
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:20,361
Filthy!

735
01:14:08,606 --> 01:14:09,630
It's wrong.

736
01:14:11,843 --> 01:14:12,707
Huh?

737
01:14:14,012 --> 01:14:17,607
My daughter didn't look like this.

738
01:14:20,819 --> 01:14:23,283
Her hair color is wrong...

739
01:14:24,889 --> 01:14:26,220
it's all wrong!

740
01:14:26,791 --> 01:14:28,622
<i>That's</i> how she look like!

741
01:14:30,362 --> 01:14:31,688
What are you doing?!

742
01:14:34,232 --> 01:14:35,790
It's all wrong.

743
01:14:38,436 --> 01:14:39,664
Redo it.

744
01:14:41,506 --> 01:14:42,468
Yes.

745
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:46,237
Why are you saying this now?

746
01:14:47,712 --> 01:14:50,107
This only happened...

747
01:14:50,482 --> 01:14:53,378
because you didn't raise her properly!

748
01:14:57,622 --> 01:14:59,647
You don't have to say it like that.

749
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,190
What did you say?

750
01:15:01,626 --> 01:15:06,189
You also never paid any attention to her.

751
01:15:06,297 --> 01:15:07,821
Who the hell do you think you are?

752
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:11,635
<i>You</i> got her on the damn bike,

753
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:15,069
and <i>you</i> ended up surviving!
Aren't you ashamed?

754
01:15:15,206 --> 01:15:15,929
Stop.

755
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:18,335
Stop, stop.

756
01:15:20,378 --> 01:15:21,345
It's you!

757
01:15:23,581 --> 01:15:24,805
Leave.

758
01:15:26,251 --> 01:15:29,550
It doesn't change the fact that it's your fault Miyuki died.

759
01:15:32,323 --> 01:15:35,952
Can you make up for it?

760
01:15:36,694 --> 01:15:37,490
Huh?

761
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:43,826
Can you take that guy's job for rest of your life and make up for it?

762
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:46,500
Huh?

763
01:15:48,139 --> 01:15:49,470
I'm sorry.

764
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:53,809
I'm sorry!

765
01:15:57,415 --> 01:16:00,475
The boss will be sad to hear that.

766
01:16:02,854 --> 01:16:03,445
What?

767
01:16:03,588 --> 01:16:05,715
He really liked you.

768
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:07,921
He did?

769
01:16:08,059 --> 01:16:11,222
Yeah! You're our first ever employee!

770
01:16:12,297 --> 01:16:14,822
The interview was very simple despite that.

771
01:16:14,966 --> 01:16:16,991
He always acts on his instincts!

772
01:16:17,335 --> 01:16:19,765
He said he felt something in you.

773
01:16:22,807 --> 01:16:24,502
But still...

774
01:16:26,311 --> 01:16:30,179
Sorry, but please talk to him in person if you want to quit.

775
01:16:30,949 --> 01:16:32,348
He's upstairs.

776
01:16:59,644 --> 01:17:00,872
Excuse me.

777
01:17:04,282 --> 01:17:05,306
Come on in.

778
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:06,578
Okay.

779
01:17:20,431 --> 01:17:21,762
What have you been eating?

780
01:17:23,334 --> 01:17:24,062
What?

781
01:17:26,504 --> 01:17:29,234
Your wife hasn't come back yet, right?

782
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:31,336
Yes...

783
01:17:33,711 --> 01:17:34,803
Eat here.

784
01:17:35,647 --> 01:17:37,581
It's probably better than your wife's cooking.

785
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:46,757
Let's eat.

786
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:53,197
What's this?

787
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:55,360
Blowfish milt.

788
01:17:56,634 --> 01:17:58,625
It's best grilled, with salt.

789
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:23,427
That's my wife.

790
01:18:24,963 --> 01:18:29,332
Passed away 9 years ago.

791
01:18:35,707 --> 01:18:38,740
All married couples are eventually separated by a death,

792
01:18:40,445 --> 01:18:42,374
but it's tough being the one left behind.

793
01:18:49,921 --> 01:18:54,017
I dressed her up, and sent her away.

794
01:19:00,865 --> 01:19:02,555
My very first client.

795
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:10,166
I've been working in this business ever since.

796
01:19:13,311 --> 01:19:14,739
This too...

797
01:19:21,052 --> 01:19:24,954
This is a corpse too.

798
01:19:31,963 --> 01:19:35,496
The living eat the living to live.
Right?

799
01:19:37,402 --> 01:19:39,092
These plants are an exception.

800
01:19:46,477 --> 01:19:48,977
You have to eat if you don't want to die.

801
01:19:50,281 --> 01:19:53,410
If you're going to eat, might as well taste good.

802
01:20:11,636 --> 01:20:12,595
Tasty, isn't it?

803
01:20:13,871 --> 01:20:15,299
It sure is.

804
01:20:15,707 --> 01:20:19,837
Yeah it is... sadly.

805
01:20:38,963 --> 01:20:42,364
<i>It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.</i>

806
01:20:43,201 --> 01:20:47,390
<i>Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.</i>

807
01:20:51,809 --> 01:20:56,712
<i>Will I really be able to make a living with this job?</i>

808
01:21:03,554 --> 01:21:04,612
Do you want to try?

809
01:21:09,127 --> 01:21:09,957
Yes.

810
01:22:18,529 --> 01:22:21,191
Slowly, lower from the head.

811
01:22:34,512 --> 01:22:35,536
Tomeo...

812
01:22:48,593 --> 01:22:50,083
Good bye.

813
01:22:55,032 --> 01:22:56,761
Thank you.

814
01:22:59,604 --> 01:23:05,133
We've been doing nothing but argue since Tomeo started dressing up like that...

815
01:23:06,444 --> 01:23:09,641
I haven't looked straight into his face for a long time.

816
01:23:10,548 --> 01:23:14,416
But... seeing him smile made me think...

817
01:23:15,453 --> 01:23:18,854
ah... he really is my child.

818
01:23:20,391 --> 01:23:22,416
Even if he looks like a girl...

819
01:23:22,994 --> 01:23:27,021
he really is my child!

820
01:23:33,137 --> 01:23:37,130
Thank you so much!

821
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,992
Tastes great!

822
01:24:24,555 --> 01:24:25,813
Is it tasty?

823
01:24:28,893 --> 01:24:30,355
...Sadly.

824
01:24:35,932 --> 01:24:38,062
Did you bring the cello?

825
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:41,631
Really? I want to hear!

826
01:24:42,039 --> 01:24:43,267
I'll play a little bit.

827
01:24:48,579 --> 01:24:51,104
It's my first time listening to a cello live.

828
01:24:51,882 --> 01:24:53,816
You were in an orchestra too, right?

829
01:24:53,951 --> 01:24:55,942
Yes, but it went out of business right away.

830
01:24:56,087 --> 01:24:57,679
How long have you been playing?

831
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:00,048
Ever since I was in kindergarten.

832
01:25:00,191 --> 01:25:02,091
Wow, for that long?

833
01:25:02,226 --> 01:25:04,786
This is also a children's cello...

834
01:25:05,529 --> 01:25:08,157
my father forced me to learn to play this.

835
01:25:08,332 --> 01:25:09,626
Your father had a fine taste.

836
01:25:09,667 --> 01:25:11,464
He's the worst father ever.

837
01:25:12,003 --> 01:25:14,233
He ran a small cafe,

838
01:25:14,372 --> 01:25:16,704
but he ran away with a waitress, never came back.

839
01:25:16,841 --> 01:25:18,468
He really was the worst father ever.

840
01:25:19,176 --> 01:25:21,041
I wonder what he's doing now.

841
01:25:21,512 --> 01:25:24,072
Who knows, probably already dead.

842
01:25:28,953 --> 01:25:31,581
Well, what should I play?

843
01:25:32,857 --> 01:25:34,791
Let's see...

844
01:25:34,925 --> 01:25:36,415
something Christmassy.

845
01:25:37,194 --> 01:25:37,990
Yeah.

846
01:25:41,365 --> 01:25:45,267
Uh... will different religions bother you?

847
01:25:45,403 --> 01:25:46,768
Don't worry.

848
01:25:47,138 --> 01:25:49,572
Buddhism, Christian, Islam, Hindu...

849
01:25:49,707 --> 01:25:51,204
we handle all religions here.

850
01:25:52,777 --> 01:25:54,005
Then,

851
01:25:55,112 --> 01:25:58,013
for the Holy Night...

852
01:27:30,541 --> 01:27:32,771
<i>Yes, this is NK Agent.</i>

853
01:27:33,210 --> 01:27:35,269
<i>Thank you always for your business.</i>

854
01:27:36,514 --> 01:27:37,674
<i>Yes, tomorrow.</i>

855
01:27:38,349 --> 01:27:39,873
<i>The name of the deceased is...</i>

856
01:27:40,217 --> 01:27:43,118
I will now prepare for her last journey.

857
01:27:43,521 --> 01:27:46,684
Gently cover her toes...

858
01:27:46,824 --> 01:27:47,722
Um...

859
01:27:50,561 --> 01:27:53,858
My grandma said she wanted to wear loose socks.

860
01:27:55,598 --> 01:27:56,566
Okay.

861
01:28:01,238 --> 01:28:02,034
Grandma,

862
01:28:05,176 --> 01:28:07,406
bye-bye.

863
01:28:08,179 --> 01:28:10,647
Thank you for everything, grandma.

864
01:28:17,888 --> 01:28:19,913
...in the name of Jesus Christ...

865
01:28:20,191 --> 01:28:22,989
Amen.

866
01:29:07,838 --> 01:29:10,102
Boss has aged a lot!

867
01:30:30,187 --> 01:30:33,247
Thank you, honey.

868
01:31:34,618 --> 01:31:35,676
Mika!

869
01:31:39,757 --> 01:31:42,123
You haven't been cleaning this place?

870
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:44,456
Occasionally.

871
01:31:44,762 --> 01:31:47,697
You're lying, you haven't even cleaned once.

872
01:31:49,433 --> 01:31:50,798
I cleaned twice.

873
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:55,097
That's not "occasionally".

874
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:03,141
You're a mess without me, as I thought.

875
01:32:08,919 --> 01:32:10,384
I have something to report too.

876
01:32:11,488 --> 01:32:12,484
What is it?

877
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:18,287
I'm pregnant.

878
01:32:21,432 --> 01:32:22,831
Wow...

879
01:32:23,934 --> 01:32:25,631
I'm going to be a father?

880
01:32:34,478 --> 01:32:38,574
So please start getting your life together.

881
01:32:42,519 --> 01:32:46,683
Can you proudly tell your child about your job?

882
01:32:50,127 --> 01:32:53,125
I'm sure it'll lead to bullying.

883
01:32:54,465 --> 01:32:58,394
I don't care about money. Let's just live happily together.

884
01:33:11,515 --> 01:33:13,949
Yes, hello?

885
01:33:14,551 --> 01:33:16,917
What? Now?

886
01:33:19,056 --> 01:33:20,154
What?!

887
01:33:22,759 --> 01:33:26,087
Okay. I'll be there right away.

888
01:33:30,501 --> 01:33:33,902
You're going to work at a time like this?

889
01:33:36,039 --> 01:33:37,701
Lady at the bath house...

890
01:33:39,009 --> 01:33:40,435
passed away.

891
01:34:09,406 --> 01:34:11,169
She's my wife, Mika.

892
01:34:20,717 --> 01:34:23,542
She collapsed while carrying firewood...

893
01:34:24,821 --> 01:34:27,016
and passed away.

894
01:34:29,092 --> 01:34:31,592
She was working 'til the very end.

895
01:34:32,162 --> 01:34:35,063
It'll be lonely around here,

896
01:34:35,566 --> 01:34:38,034
without this bath house.

897
01:37:40,417 --> 01:37:43,909
Please wipe her face one by one,

898
01:37:44,087 --> 01:37:47,113
and bid her farewell one last time.

899
01:38:32,235 --> 01:38:33,629
Mom...

900
01:39:05,335 --> 01:39:06,700
Mother...

901
01:40:15,839 --> 01:40:17,101
Shiori.

902
01:40:19,543 --> 01:40:21,841
This is good-bye to your grandma.

903
01:40:24,147 --> 01:40:25,671
Mother...

904
01:40:37,394 --> 01:40:38,952
Thank you for everything.

905
01:40:52,943 --> 01:40:54,706
This is where you work?

906
01:41:01,885 --> 01:41:05,878
Everyone, please see her off with a prayer.

907
01:41:19,569 --> 01:41:22,766
Please allow me to close the 'window'.

908
01:41:38,488 --> 01:41:39,985
Thank you...

909
01:41:41,958 --> 01:41:43,750
see you again.

910
01:42:37,947 --> 01:42:41,110
Can I witness the last moment of my mother?

911
01:42:46,656 --> 01:42:48,123
Thank you.

912
01:42:54,330 --> 01:43:00,462
I guess people get a hunch about these things.

913
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:09,601
Last winter, the two of us had a little Christmas party.

914
01:43:11,915 --> 01:43:15,805
I didn't expect her to celebrate it at this age.

915
01:43:16,653 --> 01:43:17,717
But...

916
01:43:18,521 --> 01:43:21,319
she said she wanted to have one no matter what.

917
01:43:22,726 --> 01:43:27,493
We bought a small cake, lit up the candles...

918
01:43:28,932 --> 01:43:31,230
and celebrated together.

919
01:43:33,937 --> 01:43:37,304
Then, out of the blue...

920
01:43:38,708 --> 01:43:43,008
she asked me to help her with the firewood.

921
01:43:46,249 --> 01:43:50,310
This must have been what she meant.

922
01:43:51,888 --> 01:43:57,918
I'm good at burning things.

923
01:44:05,635 --> 01:44:11,505
Working here for a long time makes me think...

924
01:44:13,610 --> 01:44:18,377
that death... is a gateway.

925
01:44:20,583 --> 01:44:25,213
Death doesn't mean the end,

926
01:44:26,756 --> 01:44:31,723
but leaving the present, heading for the next stage.

927
01:44:33,730 --> 01:44:37,161
Truly a gateway.

928
01:44:39,402 --> 01:44:43,394
As a gatekeeper,

929
01:44:44,908 --> 01:44:48,036
I've seen off many people.

930
01:44:52,649 --> 01:44:54,316
"Have a nice trip,

931
01:44:55,919 --> 01:45:01,221
see you again", I would say...

932
01:45:27,817 --> 01:45:29,250
Mom...

933
01:45:31,454 --> 01:45:34,252
I'm sorry, mom...

934
01:45:37,727 --> 01:45:40,252
I'm sorry, mom.

935
01:45:45,768 --> 01:45:48,828
I'm sorry.

936
01:45:51,241 --> 01:45:52,503
Mom...

937
01:45:57,547 --> 01:46:01,108
I'm sorry, mom.

938
01:46:32,348 --> 01:46:33,645
What are you doing?

939
01:46:35,285 --> 01:46:36,377
This is it!

940
01:46:48,765 --> 01:46:49,693
Here.

941
01:46:51,768 --> 01:46:52,698
What?

942
01:46:56,539 --> 01:46:57,628
Stone-letter.

943
01:46:57,907 --> 01:46:58,771
"Stone-letter"?

944
01:47:00,944 --> 01:47:02,302
In the ancient times,

945
01:47:02,946 --> 01:47:05,710
before humans invented writing...

946
01:47:06,416 --> 01:47:08,816
they searched for the stone that resembled their feelings,

947
01:47:08,952 --> 01:47:10,544
and gave it to another person.

948
01:47:11,421 --> 01:47:14,254
The person who received the stone,

949
01:47:14,524 --> 01:47:17,117
read the other person's feelings by the weight and texture.

950
01:47:17,193 --> 01:47:22,130
For example, smooth texture symbolizing a peaceful mind,

951
01:47:23,132 --> 01:47:26,465
and rough texture symbolizing a concern for others.

952
01:47:43,252 --> 01:47:44,412
Thank you.

953
01:47:45,688 --> 01:47:47,116
What did you feel?

954
01:47:49,025 --> 01:47:50,053
It's a secret.

955
01:47:54,163 --> 01:47:56,021
That's a wonderful story.

956
01:47:56,599 --> 01:47:58,366
Who did you hear it from?

957
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:01,637
My old man.

958
01:48:05,174 --> 01:48:08,837
Does that mean... that big stone too?

959
01:48:09,545 --> 01:48:12,241
Yes, I got it from my father.

960
01:48:15,551 --> 01:48:17,280
I never knew.

961
01:48:17,987 --> 01:48:21,218
"Let's give each other stone-letters every year", he said...

962
01:48:21,357 --> 01:48:23,518
yet that was the only time.

963
01:48:23,993 --> 01:48:25,626
Such a lousy father!

964
01:48:52,822 --> 01:48:56,053
Can you play everyday for the unborn baby?

965
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:57,056
Sure.

966
01:49:11,507 --> 01:49:14,476
What a nice weather.

967
01:49:28,691 --> 01:49:29,858
Good afternoon.

968
01:49:31,694 --> 01:49:33,685
Is this the Kobayashi residence?

969
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:35,062
Yes.

970
01:49:35,631 --> 01:49:37,496
A telegram for Ms. Kazuko.

971
01:49:38,267 --> 01:49:38,995
What...?

972
01:49:39,969 --> 01:49:42,836
Is she no longer here?

973
01:49:43,272 --> 01:49:49,108
No, uh... my mother-in-law passed away two years ago.

974
01:49:49,979 --> 01:49:53,608
Really? Oh...

975
01:49:54,050 --> 01:49:55,278
Excuse me, can I see it?

976
01:49:55,551 --> 01:49:56,575
You're not supposed to...

977
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:07,139
[ Kobayashi Hideki. Time of death: 7:30 of the 18th,
please come and collect his body... ]

978
01:50:16,139 --> 01:50:18,073
I'm back, sorry for taking so long.

979
01:50:18,241 --> 01:50:20,334
Daigo, you forgot to take your cell phone.

980
01:50:20,476 --> 01:50:24,469
What? Oh... it's back home.
Sorry.

981
01:50:28,618 --> 01:50:30,518
Father passed away.

982
01:50:30,653 --> 01:50:31,651
Whose?

983
01:50:32,755 --> 01:50:33,979
Yours.

984
01:50:37,326 --> 01:50:39,385
What do you mean?

985
01:50:40,496 --> 01:50:44,728
... is what they told me when I called the Yurahama Fishing Association.

986
01:50:46,202 --> 01:50:49,968
Our address was in his belongings.

987
01:50:52,208 --> 01:50:54,768
But I don't even know him...

988
01:50:56,112 --> 01:50:58,080
I haven't seen him in more than 30 years!

989
01:50:58,814 --> 01:51:01,305
And the person he ran away with can take care of him.

990
01:51:02,885 --> 01:51:05,183
It seems he was alone the whole time.

991
01:51:09,492 --> 01:51:11,858
He'll be cremated tomorrow morning.

992
01:51:12,495 --> 01:51:16,158
It seems his body is in their assembly hall.

993
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:27,841
Anyway, we're no longer legally related...

994
01:51:28,711 --> 01:51:30,440
tell them I can't sign the documents.

995
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:32,138
Thanks.

996
01:51:32,315 --> 01:51:33,072
Dai...

997
01:51:37,587 --> 01:51:38,884
Please go for him.

998
01:51:39,388 --> 01:51:40,855
Don't worry about it.

999
01:51:41,691 --> 01:51:43,659
Please, I'm begging you.

1000
01:51:52,335 --> 01:51:53,729
I...

1001
01:51:56,339 --> 01:51:59,206
abandoned my son in Hokkaido.

1002
01:52:01,577 --> 01:52:02,805
He was 6 years old.

1003
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:09,179
I fell in love with someone...

1004
01:52:10,953 --> 01:52:13,148
"Mommy, mommy"...

1005
01:52:14,557 --> 01:52:16,530
he cried, but...

1006
01:52:18,628 --> 01:52:22,860
I shook off his small arm, and left home.

1007
01:52:33,909 --> 01:52:35,574
Your son...

1008
01:52:38,447 --> 01:52:41,382
Of course I want to see him, but... I can't.

1009
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:45,244
Why not?

1010
01:52:47,056 --> 01:52:49,483
Just go see him if you want to.

1011
01:53:02,104 --> 01:53:04,595
Do all parents who've abandoned their child act like that?

1012
01:53:08,411 --> 01:53:10,311
Then you're all too irresponsible!

1013
01:53:25,127 --> 01:53:26,719
Please, go for him.

1014
01:53:27,096 --> 01:53:29,326
Go and see his last appearance.

1015
01:53:46,549 --> 01:53:47,607
Dai...

1016
01:54:29,024 --> 01:54:30,191
Boss...

1017
01:54:47,243 --> 01:54:48,341
Hey...

1018
01:54:53,182 --> 01:54:54,581
Take one you like.

1019
01:55:01,090 --> 01:55:02,182
Go ahead.

1020
01:55:25,448 --> 01:55:28,542
He was already dead when I showed up this morning.

1021
01:55:29,952 --> 01:55:31,579
I was surprised.

1022
01:55:32,888 --> 01:55:34,856
I don't know where he came from,

1023
01:55:35,724 --> 01:55:38,056
but he came to this town by himself.

1024
01:55:38,894 --> 01:55:43,126
He worked very hard at the port.

1025
01:55:43,999 --> 01:55:48,060
So I let him live in this shack.

1026
01:55:48,637 --> 01:55:50,036
I see...

1027
01:55:54,276 --> 01:55:57,439
He was a quiet man...

1028
01:56:00,249 --> 01:56:05,710
I'm glad someone from his family showed up.

1029
01:56:10,759 --> 01:56:13,626
People from the funeral home will be here soon.

1030
01:56:14,263 --> 01:56:15,127
Okay.

1031
01:56:37,853 --> 01:56:42,081
He's your father.

1032
01:56:46,862 --> 01:56:48,829
I'm ashamed to admit...

1033
01:56:50,733 --> 01:56:52,698
I don't recognize...

1034
01:56:55,237 --> 01:56:57,302
his face.

1035
01:56:58,974 --> 01:57:00,771
That he looked like this...

1036
01:57:02,978 --> 01:57:05,109
It doesn't even ring a bell.

1037
01:57:24,533 --> 01:57:28,469
What was this man's life?

1038
01:57:31,874 --> 01:57:34,108
He lived for 70-odd years...

1039
01:57:35,077 --> 01:57:37,837
Only to leave a cardboard box behind.

1040
01:57:41,617 --> 01:57:42,875
He's here.

1041
01:57:45,087 --> 01:57:45,978
Thanks.

1042
01:57:47,089 --> 01:57:49,057
Excuse us.

1043
01:57:49,792 --> 01:57:51,225
Excuse us.

1044
01:57:56,599 --> 01:57:58,061
Can I take him now?

1045
01:58:16,585 --> 01:58:18,075
Let's just toss him in.

1046
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:19,187
Yeah.

1047
01:58:20,689 --> 01:58:21,651
Um...

1048
01:58:22,191 --> 01:58:23,021
Yes?

1049
01:58:24,059 --> 01:58:25,788
May I?

1050
01:58:25,995 --> 01:58:28,691
No, we can do it.

1051
01:58:28,831 --> 01:58:32,597
Just give him a drink after we place him into the coffin.

1052
01:58:32,835 --> 01:58:33,802
Ready...

1053
01:58:37,573 --> 01:58:38,870
What are you doing?

1054
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:43,036
My husband is...

1055
01:58:43,779 --> 01:58:46,303
an encoffiner.

1056
02:03:53,989 --> 02:03:55,383
Father...

1057
02:04:00,529 --> 02:04:02,060
He's my father.

1058
02:04:19,114 --> 02:04:20,308
Father...

1059
02:06:02,439 --> 02:06:07,439
