1
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,999
Mumbai, 2006

2
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,447
Jamal Malik is one question away
from winning 20 million rupees.

3
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:25,119
How did he do it?

4
00:01:25,154 --> 00:01:27,008
A: He cheated

5
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:28,616
B: He's lucky

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,668
C: He's a genius

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,178
D: It is written

8
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,965
Good evening!

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,275
Welcome to "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"!

10
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:51,000
Are you ready?

11
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:53,765
Yes.

12
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,000
Please give a big round of applause
to a very first contestant of the night

13
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:03,557
Jamal Malik from our very own Mumbay!

14
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:07,213
Hello, let's play.

15
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,730
Smile, you'll be fine.

16
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:21,965
Name.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,388
Motherchud, name!

18
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:29,165
Jamal Malik.

19
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,393
You have a name. Good. Stop crying.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

21
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:42,965
So, Jamal...

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,608
tell me something about yourself.

23
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:52,000
I work in a call-center

24
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:54,517
in Juhu. - Good.

25
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:56,965
A phone basher..

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And what type of call-center should that be?

27
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:01,824
XL5 mobile phones.

28
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:03,732
So you are the one who calls me up

29
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:06,211
every single day of my life
with special offers, huh?

30
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:10,000
No, actually I am an assistant.

31
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:14,965
An assistant phone basher?

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And what does an assistant
phone basher do exactly?

33
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:23,517
I get tea for people and...

34
00:03:23,552 --> 00:03:27,276
Chaiwalla. A chaiwalla.

35
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:30,965
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,126
Jamal Malik, chaiwalla from Mumbay,

37
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:37,123
let's play "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"!

38
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:48,965
So, has he confessed yet?

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,965
Except his name I could not get
anything of him.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You have been here the whole bloody
night, Srinivas. What have you been doing?

41
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,965
He's a tough guy.

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
A little electricity will
loosen his tongue, give him.

43
00:04:01,035 --> 00:04:02,206
Yes sir.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So, were you wired up?

45
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:16,965
Mobile phone or a pager?

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Or coughing accomplice in the audience?

47
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:25,274
Or microchip under your skin, huh?

48
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,565
The chip is not here.

49
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:35,591
Not here? Ok, leave it.

50
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:39,696
It's hot, and my wife is giving me hell.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,340
I've got a desk full of murderers, rapists,

52
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:48,609
extortionists, bomb bandits, and you.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,628
So why don't you save us both a lot of time

54
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:59,116
and tell me how you cheated.

55
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:20,017
I'm done sir.

56
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:23,217
Now listen.

57
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,748
Hello!

58
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:32,048
He's is unconscious,
chutiya. What good is that?

59
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:34,726
How many times have I told
you, you should once...

60
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:37,051
I'm sorry sir.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Now we'll have Amnesty International here

62
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:43,000
peeing in their pants about human rights.

63
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:43,965
Sir I was thinking...

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Get him down, tidy him up please.
For God's sake!

65
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:53,965
Sir, what if he did know whe answers?

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Professors, doctors, lawyers,
general knowledge-wallas

67
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:59,000
never get beyond 60000 rupees.

68
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:00,965
He's on 10 million.

69
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What can a slumdog possibly know?

70
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:14,035
The answers.

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,500
I knew the answers.

72
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:25,767
Slumdog Millionaire.

73
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,451
Jamal, catch it!

74
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,591
Jamal, it's yours!

75
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,146
How did you manage to drop
a sitter like that, damn it?

76
00:06:43,181 --> 00:06:45,757
Private ka-land!

77
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:49,769
Catch him!

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,527
The dogs are coming! Run!

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,559
If the planes won't kill you, we will!

80
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:06,224
Hey brother!

81
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:37,330
Sorry!

82
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,577
I'm very sorry.

83
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:54,059
Oh shit, it's Mum.

84
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:55,504
You want me to wallop you to death, huh?

85
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:59,948
Brother, leave these two to me.

86
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,488
Come on.

87
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:08,001
Athos.

88
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,236
The Three Musketeers.

89
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:19,040
Repeat it!
"You have sent for me, Sir?" said Athos.

90
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,509
Ah, here come our very own musketeers.

91
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,115
Thank you for gracing us all
with your presence.

92
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,170
Porthos!

93
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:31,835
Well, open it, Salim.

94
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,331
Stop doing that and open the book, Jamal.

95
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:39,249
Athos?

96
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:01,226
So... Mr. Malik

97
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,548
the man who knows all the answers.

98
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:07,966
Talk.

99
00:10:09,637 --> 00:10:11,150
Talk!

100
00:10:16,274 --> 00:10:20,231
So Jamal, are you ready for the
first question, for 1000 rupees?

101
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:22,965
Yes.

102
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Not bad money to sit on a chair

103
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:25,965
and answer a question.

104
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Better than making tea, no?

105
00:10:29,035 --> 00:10:30,965
No. Yes. No.

106
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,500
No? Yes? No? Is that your final answer?

107
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:40,000
So remember. You have three lifelines.

108
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:44,000
Ask the audience, fifty-fifty

109
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:45,965
and call a friend.

110
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,859
So the first question, for 1000 rupees,
here we go.

111
00:10:50,035 --> 00:10:56,857
Who was the star in the 1973
hit-film "Zanjeer"?

112
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:08,692
I'm in trouble, here...

113
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,999
Here... Money. Take the money...

114
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Get out of there, Jamal.
Prakash wants a big one.

115
00:11:23,035 --> 00:11:25,999
Not finished.

116
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,132
Stop your time-pass boys. This is urgent...

117
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:30,326
It's a shy one...

118
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:33,119
and since when there is
a time limit on a crap?

119
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,965
This is borderline kid. Get a move on...

120
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Since there was a customer waiting,
that's when Jamal!

121
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:43,000
Give me the money back!
Give! I'll go elsewhere.

122
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,965
Bloody idiot.

123
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You just lost me a bloody customer.

124
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:52,965
Amitabh's helicopter!

125
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,235
That's Amitabh's helicopter!

126
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:55,705
Amitabh!

127
00:11:57,922 --> 00:12:00,420
Amitabh Bachchan!

128
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,280
Salim, open it!

129
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:00,654
Amitabh Bachchan!

130
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,877
My Amitabh sir!

131
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:21,237
Move, move! Out of the way!

132
00:13:21,272 --> 00:13:23,783
Please wait, I am coming for you!

133
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,846
Amitabh sir, please give me your autograph

134
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,940
You've got it now have you?
Amitabh's autograph?

135
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,661
That was my autograph!

136
00:14:35,696 --> 00:14:37,710
Amitabh gave it to me!

137
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,519
I'll never get another!

138
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,034
He offered a good price, so I sold it.

139
00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:45,330
But it was mine...

140
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,965
A, Amitabh Bachchan.

141
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,986
Guess what, you're right.
You just won 1,000 rupees.

142
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:58,481
You don't have to be a genius.

143
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:01,075
I knew it was Amitabh Bachchan.

144
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,503
Like I said, you do not have to be a genius.

145
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:10,906
He's the most famous man in India.

146
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,067
A picture of three lions, as seen
on the national emblem of India.

147
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:20,438
What is written underneath?

148
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:24,043
A: The truth alone triumphs

149
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,262
B: Lies alone triumph

150
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,122
C: Fashion alone triumphs

151
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:34,531
D: Money alone triumphs

152
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:41,465
What do you think, Jamal?

153
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,910
The most famous phrase of our country.

154
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:48,450
Do you like to call a friend?

155
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:50,965
Ask the audience.

156
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,965
Who'd put him out of his
misery, ladies and gentlemen?

157
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
My five-year old daughter
can answer that question,

158
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:58,387
but you couldn't.

159
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,221
That's strange for a millionaire genius.

160
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:03,486
What happened?

161
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Your accomplice sneaked out for a piss?

162
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:09,965
The inspector is asking something.

163
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,132
How much is panipuri at
Dharisha store on Chowpatty?

164
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,339
What?

165
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,830
Panipuri. One plate. How much?

166
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:21,034
- 10 rupees.
- Wrong.

167
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:22,021
15 since Diwali.

168
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,634
Who stole Constable Varmy's bicycle

169
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:29,347
outside Santa Cruz station last Thursday?

170
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:32,406
You know who that was?

171
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Everyone in Juhu knows that.

172
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,855
Even five year olds.

173
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,953
Congratulations, Jamal.
You just won 4,000 rupees.

174
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:52,285
A 16 thousand rupees.

175
00:16:54,552 --> 00:16:57,978
Religion. Interesting.

176
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,716
In depictions of God Rama he is

177
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:05,369
famously holding what in his right hand?

178
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,012
Run!

179
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:00,557
Salim, Jamal! Run!

180
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,086
They're Muslims, get them!

181
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:04,711
Get a move on! Come with us!

182
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:16,850
Hey, get lost!

183
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:20,322
Are you deaf? I said piss off!

184
00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:26,866
Come with us.

185
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,540
I wake up every morning wishing I did
not know the answer to that question.

186
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:51,000
If it wasn't for Rama and Allah...

187
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:54,524
I would still have a mother.

188
00:20:03,865 --> 00:20:05,649
A bow and arrow.

189
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:07,326
Final answer?

190
00:20:09,863 --> 00:20:11,055
Final answer.

191
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,168
Computer, please check answer D.

192
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,250
You just won 16000 rupees.

193
00:20:26,138 --> 00:20:28,357
Well done, my friend.

194
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,123
Time for commercial break.
Don't go away now.

195
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:36,965
You got lucky, huh?

196
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,261
If I were you I'd take the money and run.

197
00:20:40,035 --> 00:20:42,065
You're not going to the next one.

198
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:17,499
Piss off!

199
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,690
She'll have the security guard on us!

200
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:21,099
Let her in.

201
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,462
She could be the third musketeer.

202
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,891
I'm the elder in this family now,
and I say, she's not coming in, okay?

203
00:21:32,035 --> 00:21:32,999
In any case...

204
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,039
We don't even know the name
of the third bloody musketeer.

205
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,538
Salim?

206
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:16,707
Come over here.

207
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,911
Where's your mother?

208
00:22:34,035 --> 00:22:35,930
Your father?

209
00:22:39,656 --> 00:22:41,150
I'm Jamal.

210
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:43,480
This is my brother Salim.

211
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:46,892
I'm Latika.

212
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,909
You can sleep here if you want.

213
00:22:57,035 --> 00:22:58,987
Thank you Jamal.

214
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,144
Welcome back to "Who
Wants To Be A Milionaire?"

215
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:21,000
Our contestant, Jamal Malik,
call-center assistant from Mumbay,

216
00:23:21,035 --> 00:23:22,577
is on 16 thousand rupees,

217
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:26,322
and has already used only one
lifeline, ask the audience.

218
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:31,638
So my friend, you're into serious money.

219
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:34,794
Shall we play?

220
00:23:35,035 --> 00:23:36,515
Yes.

221
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The song "Darshan Do Ghanshyam" was
written by which famous Indian poet?

222
00:23:47,035 --> 00:23:49,517
A: Surdas

223
00:23:49,552 --> 00:23:51,776
B: Tulsidas

224
00:23:51,811 --> 00:23:53,608
C: Mira Bai

225
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:56,312
D: Kabir

226
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,948
It's hot, huh?

227
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,252
The way he's taking care of
us, he must be a good man.

228
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:55,999
Must be a bloody saint

229
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,275
We're not allowed to talk to the others.

230
00:25:58,276 --> 00:25:59,999
Why?

231
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,417
If we get seconds, then
he really must be a saint.

232
00:26:24,035 --> 00:26:26,902
Very good, Arvind. Very good.

233
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:42,634
Laughing at me. I'll kill you.

234
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:45,051
Hey, get off her.

235
00:26:45,452 --> 00:26:47,460
Don't touch me!

236
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:49,030
You fat bastard!

237
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:52,967
You big tree!

238
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,430
Punnoose, I think you've found your dog.

239
00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:12,556
Okay, time to go. Get to work.

240
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,607
Think you're here for a picnic?

241
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,868
What do you think this is, a holiday?

242
00:27:29,035 --> 00:27:31,791
And what are you laughing at?

243
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:37,165
Give me that.

244
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:42,803
Shut up!

245
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:44,263
Brother Salim.

246
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:46,676
What's up little brother, you got a problem?

247
00:27:46,677 --> 00:27:48,675
Hey take her. She's yours today.

248
00:27:48,676 --> 00:27:50,063
I don't want her.

249
00:27:50,064 --> 00:27:53,207
Take her. It's for your own
good. Babies earn double.

250
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,535
She said she doesn't want her.

251
00:27:55,536 --> 00:27:56,512
Shut it Jamal!

252
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:00,339
Take her now or i'll drop her.

253
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:08,310
Keep her crying, and you'll earn triple.

254
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,638
Come on! Get to work!

255
00:28:38,035 --> 00:28:41,783
We'll use the hottest ones.

256
00:29:35,645 --> 00:29:40,657
Chillies on his willy!

257
00:29:46,932 --> 00:29:48,532
I'll get you back!

258
00:29:50,276 --> 00:29:52,150
Go back to sleep all of you!

259
00:30:17,035 --> 00:30:20,419
Very good. I am happy.

260
00:30:21,217 --> 00:30:24,541
He's ready. - I'm ready as well.

261
00:30:40,035 --> 00:30:41,846
Come on, move the lamp.

262
00:31:26,035 --> 00:31:27,815
Okay.

263
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,714
Bring Jamal over.

264
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,517
Listen, kid. It's decision time.

265
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,193
You want the life of a slumdog
or the life of a man, huh?

266
00:32:01,228 --> 00:32:04,999
A real man. A gunfighter.

267
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,164
Your destiny is in your hands, brother.

268
00:32:09,035 --> 00:32:12,939
You can be like me or...

269
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:16,390
Understand?

270
00:32:20,394 --> 00:32:21,611
I understand.

271
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,934
Go. Get Jamal.

272
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,249
I just need Maman to like my
singing, and we're in the money.

273
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,999
Big money, Latika.

274
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,497
And then what? Can we stop begging?

275
00:32:44,498 --> 00:32:46,913
Begging? Are you kidding?

276
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:49,337
We'll live in a big house on Harbour Road.

277
00:32:49,338 --> 00:32:52,385
You, me and Salim. The Three Musketeers.

278
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:54,230
Harbour Road. Really?

279
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:55,524
Yes.

280
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
In the moonlight...

281
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:00,965
You and me.

282
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,972
You'll dance with me won't you?

283
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,683
I hope you sing better than you dance.

284
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:18,706
It's my turn. - Sing well.

285
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,257
So this is it huh, brother?

286
00:33:30,986 --> 00:33:33,389
The good life here we come.

287
00:33:35,035 --> 00:33:36,943
Athos.

288
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,960
Porthos?

289
00:33:41,872 --> 00:33:43,714
When I say

290
00:34:00,404 --> 00:34:02,000
It's time to get professional.

291
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:03,965
What? Really?

292
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,860
First, let me hear that song...

293
00:34:08,035 --> 00:34:10,888
Darshan to Ghanshyam.

294
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,323
That's my favourite.

295
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:21,335
Fifty rupees.

296
00:34:24,753 --> 00:34:26,730
Now I'm a professional, what can I do?

297
00:34:27,322 --> 00:34:28,513
Cheeky little bugger.

298
00:34:31,164 --> 00:34:32,974
Here you go.

299
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:56,559
Jamal, go. Run!

300
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,689
Hold on! Catch them!

301
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,833
Get the torches! Get them!

302
00:35:29,035 --> 00:35:31,071
Latika, run!

303
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,811
Come on, Latika! Grab his hand!

304
00:36:23,252 --> 00:36:25,314
What happened, what happened?

305
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,829
She let go!

306
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,034
We've got to go back,
brother. We've got to go.

307
00:36:38,035 --> 00:36:40,034
Go back and we're dead.

308
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:41,999
Have you gone mad?

309
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,789
He was going to take your eyes out!

310
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,571
With a spoon.

311
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,384
Don't worry about her. She'll be fine.

312
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:04,861
She always is.

313
00:37:20,035 --> 00:37:23,583
Surdas.

314
00:37:29,776 --> 00:37:32,426
Surdas?

315
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,915
Surdas is the final answer?

316
00:37:40,035 --> 00:37:42,189
Yes.

317
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,277
Guess what, you're right!

318
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,240
Blind singers earn double you know that?

319
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,356
What happened to a girl?
They blinded her too?

320
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,812
They had other plans.

321
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,345
Well it took me a long time to find out.

322
00:38:35,035 --> 00:38:36,965
Got to let it go.

323
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:41,035
Come on.

324
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,894
Where? - I'm starving.

325
00:40:01,535 --> 00:40:03,035
Get up!

326
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,535
So is it your Dad's train then?

327
00:41:29,035 --> 00:41:32,768
Is this heaven?

328
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,255
You are not dead, Jamal.

329
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:41,051
What is it?

330
00:41:41,052 --> 00:41:43,236
Some hotel huh?

331
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,938
The Taj Mahal is considered the
finest example of modern architecture.

332
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:58,734
...was completed around 1648 using
the labour force of 20'000 workers.

333
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:04,644
In 1980 it became a UNESCO
World Heritage Site and was cited...

334
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:19,070
Official tour guide.

335
00:42:19,105 --> 00:42:21,272
Please take off your shoes

336
00:42:39,035 --> 00:42:41,775
Please, please.

337
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:43,299
What time is the next tour?

338
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,825
We are on tight schedule.

339
00:42:45,826 --> 00:42:47,437
We have to see the Red
Fort this afternoon.

340
00:42:47,438 --> 00:42:48,999
VISITORS ARE REQUESTED TO COLLECT RECEIPT

341
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,899
No, I... - Please, would it be possibl
to show us up round now?

342
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:58,882
Obviously we understand that it
costs more for just the two of us.

343
00:42:58,883 --> 00:43:01,459
But of course madam!

344
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:03,473
Please follow me.

345
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,965
The Taj Mahal was built by Emperor Khurrama

346
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,500
for his wife Mumtaz, who was the
maximum beautiful woman in the world.

347
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:19,000
Then when she died, the emperor
decided to build this five-star hotel,

348
00:43:19,035 --> 00:43:21,965
for everyone who would
like to visit her tomb.

349
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,000
But he died in 1587 before any of the
rooms were built, or any of the lifts.

350
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
But this swimming pool as you can see was
completed on schedule in top class fashion.

351
00:43:36,035 --> 00:43:38,965
Is says nothing of this in the guide book.

352
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
The guide book was written by a bunch
of lazy good-for-nothing Indian beggars.

353
00:43:47,035 --> 00:43:52,000
And this lady and gentlemen
is the burial place of Mumtaz.

354
00:43:52,035 --> 00:43:54,965
How did she die?

355
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,500
A road traffic accident. - Really?

356
00:43:57,535 --> 00:43:59,965
Maximum pile-up.

357
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,965
I thought she died in childbirth.

358
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Exactly sir. She was on the way
to hospital when it happened.

359
00:44:15,035 --> 00:44:17,847
Ready?

360
00:44:18,934 --> 00:44:20,343
Smile.

361
00:44:27,477 --> 00:44:30,568
Shoes! American brands!

362
00:44:52,035 --> 00:44:55,593
Smile.

363
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
This, Mr David, is the biggest
Dhobi Ghat in the whole of India.

364
00:45:13,035 --> 00:45:14,965
That's amazing.

365
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Come on, take a real good look at this.

366
00:45:18,035 --> 00:45:20,965
They say that every man in Uttar Pradesh

367
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
is wearing a kurta that has been
at least washed once out here.

368
00:45:33,371 --> 00:45:38,242
Move it around! Pit-stop's god
speed! Schumacher got style!

369
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,508
There are the cows or are those
buffalos... What are those over there?

370
00:45:52,035 --> 00:45:53,965
Oh, shit.

371
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,965
What the hell happened here?

372
00:46:04,035 --> 00:46:05,965
Ok. Hold it!

373
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
You've got the insurance don't you?

374
00:46:08,395 --> 00:46:09,155
Are you ok?

375
00:46:09,618 --> 00:46:12,196
You wanted to see a bit
of real India? Here it is!

376
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,975
Well, here is a bit of
the real America, son.

377
00:46:17,548 --> 00:46:19,000
Money.

378
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:20,635
Oh, yes, yes! Jesus...

379
00:46:24,011 --> 00:46:24,932
Here.

380
00:48:08,848 --> 00:48:12,000
On an american 100 dollar bill

381
00:48:12,001 --> 00:48:16,125
there's a portrait of
which american statesman?

382
00:48:17,035 --> 00:48:20,051
A: George Washington

383
00:48:20,052 --> 00:48:23,560
B: Franklin Roosevelt

384
00:48:23,561 --> 00:48:27,083
C: Benjamin Franklin

385
00:48:27,084 --> 00:48:30,480
D: Abraham Lincoln

386
00:48:33,942 --> 00:48:38,465
Pay or play, Jamal?

387
00:48:39,035 --> 00:48:41,835
You decide.

388
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Oh god he's looking at the
camera. He hasn't got a clue.

389
00:48:46,035 --> 00:48:49,017
This is gonna be a walk away. Stand by.

390
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:52,000
No, he's gonna play with him first.

391
00:48:52,035 --> 00:48:53,965
Jamal?

392
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,150
Get a lot of 100 dollar bills
in your in your line of work?

393
00:48:59,185 --> 00:49:02,965
A minimum tip for my services.

394
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Oh, now I know why my
cellphone bills are so high.

395
00:49:06,035 --> 00:49:10,000
They tip the chaiwalla
with 100 dollar bills.

396
00:49:10,035 --> 00:49:12,517
It's C. Benjamin Franklin.

397
00:49:12,552 --> 00:49:14,965
You're gonna play, huh?

398
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I think I've just had, hadn't I?

399
00:49:17,035 --> 00:49:19,017
So you exactly have C, right?

400
00:49:19,052 --> 00:49:21,000
Who's on 1,000 rupee note?

401
00:49:21,035 --> 00:49:23,495
I don't know.

402
00:49:24,052 --> 00:49:25,604
You don't know?

403
00:49:27,315 --> 00:49:28,725
Ghandi is he.

404
00:49:29,692 --> 00:49:31,821
Oh, I have heard of him.

405
00:49:35,035 --> 00:49:35,965
Don't get clever

406
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
or I'll get the electricity out again.

407
00:49:39,035 --> 00:49:40,965
Look.

408
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
They didn't ask me that
question. I don't know why.

409
00:49:45,035 --> 00:49:46,965
Ask them.

410
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It's funny, you don't seem
like you're interested in money.

411
00:49:53,035 --> 00:49:56,107
By the fact you have...

412
00:49:56,337 --> 00:50:00,518
one million rupees!

413
00:50:03,947 --> 00:50:07,203
Explain the 100 dollar bill.

414
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,346
Bombay had turned name to Mumbay.

415
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:16,854
Why don't you understand?

416
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,965
A girl lived here. As tall as me perhaps.

417
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,019
Her name was Latika.
Don't know anyone of that name.

418
00:51:24,464 --> 00:51:28,590
Two chicken burgers, two
fries, one diet cola, one coke!

419
00:51:28,591 --> 00:51:30,351
One mineral water!

420
00:51:33,035 --> 00:51:34,978
Shimla.

421
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,500
I'm going to Chowpatty, ok? Wanna come?

422
00:51:40,535 --> 00:51:45,000
For god's sake, you've got some disease?

423
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,517
You're forcing back to this shithole.

424
00:51:47,552 --> 00:51:50,000
We leave our friends, a good life,

425
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:52,017
lots of money. For this?!

426
00:51:52,052 --> 00:51:53,965
We came back to find her.

427
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,500
You did. I don't give a shit about her.

428
00:51:57,535 --> 00:52:01,000
Plenty of pussy in Bombay for Salim.

429
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:01,965
Oh yes!

430
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
You should come back to
the Cages on Saturday night,

431
00:52:05,035 --> 00:52:09,000
instead of ghost searching
for your lost love.

432
00:52:09,035 --> 00:52:11,517
I'm going to Chowpatty.

433
00:52:11,552 --> 00:52:13,965
I'm going to Chowpatty!

434
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
There are 19 million
people in this city, Jamal.

435
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:21,000
Forget about her.

436
00:52:21,035 --> 00:52:24,489
She's a "stree" (= yound Indian female dancer)

437
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:45,040
Greetings, Sir.

438
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:48,988
Blessings be unto those
who do good for others.

439
00:52:58,035 --> 00:53:00,517
Dollars. How much?

440
00:53:00,518 --> 00:53:03,534
100. - So you take me for a fool.

441
00:53:03,535 --> 00:53:06,940
Honestly. I swear on my mothers soul.

442
00:53:06,941 --> 00:53:13,440
What's on this note? Whose picture is it?

443
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:15,965
There's an old man...

444
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
He's bald on top with long
hair on the sides, like a girl.

445
00:53:20,035 --> 00:53:22,229
Benjamin Franklin.

446
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,034
So you're a big guy now, Jamal.

447
00:53:32,035 --> 00:53:34,517
I'm happy for you.

448
00:53:34,552 --> 00:53:36,965
I'm sorry...

449
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
You got saved my friend. I wasn't so lucky.

450
00:53:40,035 --> 00:53:42,517
That's the only difference.

451
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,776
Arvind, I'm trying to find...

452
00:53:44,811 --> 00:53:47,000
You owe Maman. Stay away.

453
00:53:47,035 --> 00:53:49,460
He never forgets.

454
00:53:49,461 --> 00:53:51,983
I owe Latika.

455
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,965
She's alive isn't she?

456
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,809
More than alive. She's on Pila
street. They call her Cherry.

457
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:04,880
Thanks.

458
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,198
I'll be singing at your funeral.

459
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,786
So, is it her or not?

460
00:55:44,035 --> 00:55:46,550
She's sexy, man!

461
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,965
Who is this? - Jamal?

462
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I'll get the bags.
- Who are you? What do you want?

463
00:55:57,035 --> 00:56:00,000
You stupid boys! - Pack it in! Put that.

464
00:56:00,035 --> 00:56:02,035
How did you find me?

465
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,265
Take the cash. Come on!

466
00:56:08,266 --> 00:56:10,017
We got it. Let's go!

467
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,789
Shit.

468
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,031
Look who we have here!

469
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:20,245
Hello again.

470
00:56:20,687 --> 00:56:25,281
Jamal, Salim.

471
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,048
I never forget a face.

472
00:56:29,035 --> 00:56:29,965
Have a nose

473
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,319
especially one that I own.

474
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,000
You really thought you could just
walk in and take my prize away?

475
00:56:42,035 --> 00:56:44,730
Latika, come.

476
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,771
Have you any idea how much
this little virgin is worth?

477
00:56:55,172 --> 00:56:58,109
Please continue, Master-Ji. - Ok, sir.

478
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:00,468
Get them out of here! - No!

479
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,939
Move! Get over there!

480
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,500
Let's not be foolish, Salim.

481
00:57:15,535 --> 00:57:20,000
Heavy, isn't it? Give it to me.

482
00:57:20,035 --> 00:57:25,517
On your knees! Down!

483
00:57:25,552 --> 00:57:31,000
Both of you! Down!

484
00:57:31,035 --> 00:57:33,965
Money!

485
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,557
You can have money, here.

486
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:45,544
Look.

487
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Take it. Go, disappear with your friend.
And we'll forget all about this, ok?

488
00:57:53,035 --> 00:57:57,551
Maman never forgets. Isn't that right?

489
00:57:57,552 --> 00:58:01,844
Oh, Maman can make an exception, huh?

490
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,832
I can't take that risk Maman. Sorry.

491
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,624
Let's go.

492
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,834
Stay! - Jamal!

493
00:58:28,085 --> 00:58:31,016
Let's go! Let's go!

494
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,374
Who invented the revolver?

495
00:58:48,035 --> 00:58:50,965
Samuel Colt.

496
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,500
Final answer?

497
00:58:53,535 --> 00:58:55,965
Final answer.

498
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Jamal Malik, you're on a dream run.

499
00:59:01,035 --> 00:59:06,000
My heart says you're gonna win more.

500
00:59:06,035 --> 00:59:13,035
Computer, please check answer A.

501
00:59:17,035 --> 00:59:18,965
I was right.

502
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
The chaiwalla has done it again.

503
00:59:24,503 --> 00:59:26,136
Incredible!

504
00:59:45,552 --> 00:59:47,820
Reception!

505
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Stay there. Look away.

506
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I'll know if you're looking.

507
01:00:16,035 --> 01:00:17,965
No i'm not.

508
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,687
Is Salim still there?

509
01:00:28,035 --> 01:00:30,556
Where is Salim?

510
01:00:32,552 --> 01:00:34,664
I don't know.

511
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,806
You're a sweet boy, Jamal.

512
01:01:31,961 --> 01:01:34,449
I'm looking for Javed.

513
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:37,461
Motherchud! He's not looking for you.

514
01:01:41,035 --> 01:01:43,965
I killed Maman,

515
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
and I'll kill you too.

516
01:01:50,035 --> 01:01:52,343
Easy.

517
01:01:52,344 --> 01:01:54,358
Did you really kill him?

518
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,307
Good. My enemy's enemy is a friend.

519
01:02:07,035 --> 01:02:09,697
Come here, my friend.

520
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,901
I've been looking for someone like you.

521
01:02:25,035 --> 01:02:29,000
You came back for me.

522
01:02:29,035 --> 01:02:33,065
Of course.

523
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,965
I thought you'd forgotten.

524
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I never forgot. Not for one moment.

525
01:02:41,035 --> 01:02:45,000
I knew I'd find you in the end.

526
01:02:45,035 --> 01:02:49,000
It's our destiny.

527
01:02:49,035 --> 01:02:51,957
Destiny?

528
01:02:52,522 --> 01:02:54,237
Thank you.

529
01:03:17,035 --> 01:03:19,965
Come.

530
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
No, brother. You had a lot to drink.

531
01:03:22,035 --> 01:03:26,000
I am the elder. I am the boss.

532
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:29,000
For once you do as I say.

533
01:03:29,035 --> 01:03:31,965
Now get out!

534
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Come on, I saved your life, didn't I?

535
01:03:34,035 --> 01:03:38,063
Salim, please...

536
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,698
I'll kill you!

537
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I am number one now.

538
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:03,509
Salim! Open!

539
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,965
Shut up!

540
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,965
The man with the Colt 45 says shut up!

541
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Go now or gun master will
shoot you right between the eyes.

542
01:04:14,035 --> 01:04:16,965
Don't think you want.

543
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I'm giving you five seconds.

544
01:04:20,035 --> 01:04:23,517
One.

545
01:04:23,552 --> 01:04:26,965
Two.

546
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,321
Go, Jamal.

547
01:04:35,035 --> 01:04:36,529
Ciao.

548
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
So, did you see them again?

549
01:05:01,035 --> 01:05:04,000
I wouldn't be here if I had.

550
01:05:04,035 --> 01:05:08,517
Was she pretty?

551
01:05:08,552 --> 01:05:11,974
I guess not.

552
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,344
The most beautiful woman in the world.

553
01:05:15,345 --> 01:05:17,057
You mean of the beach of the slum.

554
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:34,267
Well well... the slumdog barks.

555
01:05:35,035 --> 01:05:35,965
Money and women.

556
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
The reasons for make most mistakes in life.

557
01:05:40,035 --> 01:05:44,594
Looks like you've mixed up both.

558
01:05:44,629 --> 01:05:48,776
Srinivas, you need the exersice.

559
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:52,034
Go and get me something to eat.

560
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:54,502
Yes sir.

561
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:56,143
And chai.

562
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,657
Idiot, Srinivas.

563
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,965
You puzzled me slumdog.

564
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Admitting murder and fraud

565
01:06:22,035 --> 01:06:27,000
is not exactly clever thinking.

566
01:06:27,035 --> 01:06:31,965
Now why would you do that?

567
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,000
When somebody asks me a
question I tell them the answer.

568
01:06:43,035 --> 01:06:49,000
So, how did you manage to get on the show?

569
01:06:49,035 --> 01:06:52,017
Okay everyone, listen up.

570
01:06:52,052 --> 01:06:55,000
It's been a big week for UK.

571
01:06:55,035 --> 01:06:57,965
Kat is back.

572
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,616
But she is already back. Bardi... Jamal?

573
01:07:02,617 --> 01:07:07,000
Oh, well, she did come back, then she
went away when Alfie split up with her.

574
01:07:07,035 --> 01:07:11,000
And now she's back again, but it
looks as if Alfie still fancies more...

575
01:07:11,035 --> 01:07:12,965
Thank you, Jamal.

576
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,729
Bardi, keep up. The
chaiwalla knows more than you.

577
01:07:16,764 --> 01:07:20,458
Anyway, there's also the
festival in Edinburgh.

578
01:07:20,459 --> 01:07:22,150
Anybody knows Edinburgh, Edinburgh?

579
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Kilts, castles, haggis. Ben Navis.

580
01:07:28,035 --> 01:07:29,965
Good, yes?

581
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Inspector Taggart, whiskey, Sean Connery.

582
01:07:34,035 --> 01:07:37,101
Good, and "lochs". Their word for lakes.

583
01:07:37,341 --> 01:07:38,734
No filming.

584
01:07:45,035 --> 01:07:47,965
Jamal, come here.

585
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I'm on "Millionaire" duty today.

586
01:07:50,035 --> 01:07:51,261
Dave!

587
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:54,488
Please, just for five minutes. - I can't.

588
01:07:55,368 --> 01:07:56,103
Sit here.

589
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:59,470
If the boss comes just pretend you're
on a call doing an upgrade for...

590
01:07:59,471 --> 01:08:01,397
..."Friends and Family", I know. - Yeah.

591
01:08:01,398 --> 01:08:03,548
Two minutes.

592
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,710
"Who wants to be a millionaire?"

593
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:12,768
Dial this number now!

594
01:08:17,348 --> 01:08:19,101
Hello. Hello!

595
01:08:20,126 --> 01:08:24,150
I would like to be a contestant of
"Who wants to be a millionaire?"

596
01:08:25,035 --> 01:08:27,965
Bloody bastard. I never get it.

597
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
You have to dial, when Prem says "if".

598
01:08:31,035 --> 01:08:32,517
That's when they open the lines.

599
01:08:32,552 --> 01:08:33,965
How the hell do you know that?

600
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
That's what Anjum in Technical
says. He put a system in.

601
01:08:38,035 --> 01:08:43,017
Hello? Hello? Anybody there, for god's sake?

602
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:48,526
Hello? Dear god will somebody talk to me?

603
01:08:48,561 --> 01:08:53,965
Hello, Mrs MacKintosh from Kin.. gussie.

604
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It's Kingussie, love. Pronounced: "Kee-nu-ssi".

605
01:08:58,035 --> 01:09:00,965
So where are you from? Abroad i bet?

606
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Just down the road from
your house, Mrs. MacKintosh.

607
01:09:05,035 --> 01:09:06,970
Next to the "loch".

608
01:09:06,971 --> 01:09:09,699
Ok, which "loch"?

609
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:16,034
"Loch" Big... "loch" Ben... "Loch" Big Ben.

610
01:09:16,035 --> 01:09:18,505
Next door to Sean Connery's flat.

611
01:09:18,506 --> 01:09:20,907
Look. I'd like to your supervisor, son?

612
01:09:21,425 --> 01:09:23,106
Disconnected.

613
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,000
What name do you require?

614
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Search complete. 26,283 results found.

615
01:09:57,035 --> 01:10:03,035
15 results found.

616
01:10:09,035 --> 01:10:10,517
Yes?

617
01:10:10,552 --> 01:10:11,965
Salim?

618
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Who is this? Do you know what time is this?

619
01:10:24,035 --> 01:10:31,035
Hello?

620
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,965
Who is this?

621
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,965
I'm calling from XL5 Communications sir.

622
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,000
As a valued customer, we are offering you
a free upgrade with our "Friends and...

623
01:10:55,035 --> 01:10:56,965
...family"

624
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Jamal? Is that you, brother?

625
01:11:02,035 --> 01:11:03,965
Where are you?

626
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I thought you were dead or something.

627
01:11:07,035 --> 01:11:08,965
Listen, we had to go Jamal.

628
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Maman's guys... they
were searching the hotel.

629
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:17,000
Jamal? Say something, please!

630
01:11:17,035 --> 01:11:19,965
Hello, Salim.

631
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Cambridge Circus is not in Cambridge.

632
01:11:23,035 --> 01:11:24,965
Can I ask why?

633
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Too obvious. There's definitely
an Oxford Circus in London

634
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:32,000
There's a rowing race
between Oxford and Cambridge,

635
01:11:32,035 --> 01:11:35,000
so ther's probably a
Cambridge Circus too, no?

636
01:11:35,035 --> 01:11:37,965
I'll go for D. London.

637
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Computer, please check answer D.

638
01:11:51,035 --> 01:11:58,035
Jamal Malik, you are absolutely right.

639
01:12:04,035 --> 01:12:07,000
It's getting hot in here.

640
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:08,000
Are you nervous?

641
01:12:08,035 --> 01:12:10,965
What?

642
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,965
Am I nervous?

643
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
It's you who's in the hot seat, my friend.

644
01:12:16,035 --> 01:12:18,965
Oh yes, sorry.

645
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
He's got prey on the run.

646
01:12:21,035 --> 01:12:22,965
Finally.

647
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,965
A few hours ago

648
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,500
you were giving chai for the phone wallas.

649
01:12:28,535 --> 01:12:32,000
And now you're richer
than they will ever be.

650
01:12:32,035 --> 01:12:34,965
What a player!

651
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Ladies and gentlemen, what a player!

652
01:13:20,035 --> 01:13:23,965
Jamal?

653
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:31,000
God is good, Bhai. God is good.

654
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Maman's guys were out for
us. We just had to escape.

655
01:13:46,035 --> 01:13:48,378
- Liar.
- I left a message for you at work.

656
01:13:48,379 --> 01:13:49,735
We waited for weeks for you.

657
01:13:49,736 --> 01:13:53,607
- There was no message.
- Bhai. I definitely left a message.

658
01:13:53,608 --> 01:13:57,824
There was no message! There was no message!!

659
01:14:02,064 --> 01:14:04,148
I will never forgive you.

660
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:10,725
I know.

661
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:23,000
That used to be our slum.
Can you believe that, huh?

662
01:14:23,035 --> 01:14:28,000
We used to live right there man.

663
01:14:28,035 --> 01:14:30,965
Now it's all business.

664
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
India is at the center of the world now. Bhai.

665
01:14:35,035 --> 01:14:36,965
And I...

666
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I am at the center of the center.

667
01:14:43,035 --> 01:14:47,965
This is all Javed heights.

668
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Javed Khan? The gangster from our slum?

669
01:14:52,035 --> 01:14:52,965
You work for him?

670
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Come on. Who else would save
us from Maman's guys, huh?

671
01:14:57,035 --> 01:15:00,977
What do you do for him?

672
01:15:01,035 --> 01:15:05,332
Anything he asks.

673
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:16,000
He's coming. You need
to go now. Take my card.

674
01:15:16,035 --> 01:15:16,965
What for?

675
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
You think them gonna let you
out of my sight again, huh?

676
01:15:20,035 --> 01:15:22,000
You stay with me my younger brother.

677
01:15:22,035 --> 01:15:26,965
Now go. My place.

678
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Salim! Where is Latika?

679
01:15:29,035 --> 01:15:30,381
Still?

680
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
She's gone brother. Long gone.

681
01:15:37,035 --> 01:15:42,485
Now go. Go to my place.

682
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,350
You get there. I'll be right there.

683
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,535
Oh Lord forgive me. I
know that I have sinned.

684
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:31,383
Oh Lord forgive me. I
know that I have sinned.

685
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,334
I am your new cook from the
agency. Thousands apologies!

686
01:17:29,335 --> 01:17:32,000
I'm so late for the mensa!

687
01:17:32,035 --> 01:17:34,505
Just a minute.

688
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,999
Excuse me. Excuse me.

689
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,965
There's nothing about any cook.

690
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
There's a dishwasher being delivered.
Do you know anything about that?

691
01:18:00,035 --> 01:18:03,792
I... I'm your dishwasher.

692
01:19:12,035 --> 01:19:16,257
Look at you.

693
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,282
I've found you.

694
01:19:35,759 --> 01:19:37,257
Your face.

695
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
You've hurt your eye.

696
01:19:39,035 --> 01:19:41,068
Why are you here?

697
01:19:43,035 --> 01:19:45,261
To see you.

698
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,614
You see me, now what?

699
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Why does everyone love this program?

700
01:20:04,035 --> 01:20:08,000
This is a chance to escape, isn't it?

701
01:20:08,035 --> 01:20:12,000
Walk into another life.

702
01:20:12,035 --> 01:20:17,965
Oh, god.

703
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Javed will kill you. Here.

704
01:20:20,035 --> 01:20:21,965
Javed?

705
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,484
You are with him?

706
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,965
First, you want a dishwasher,

707
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
now you want this fucking cook, huh?

708
01:20:39,392 --> 01:20:40,233
He's just... - Shut up!

709
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,965
The cricket is on

710
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,425
and why you watch this shit tv?

711
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:52,965
At least I am a millionaire.

712
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,269
Come on, I am hungry. Make me a sandwich.

713
01:21:28,035 --> 01:21:30,000
Come away with me.

714
01:21:30,035 --> 01:21:33,965
Away? Where?

715
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,908
And live out what?

716
01:21:40,035 --> 01:21:44,965
Love.

717
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Come away with me. Now.

718
01:22:02,858 --> 01:22:04,851
Salim will help us.

719
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,858
Salim? You still believe in Salim?

720
01:22:13,842 --> 01:22:17,142
Jamal, I'll be gone soon anyway.

721
01:22:17,177 --> 01:22:20,008
We're getting out of Bombay.

722
01:22:21,035 --> 01:22:22,965
Where?

723
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,077
You think he'd tell me?

724
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:27,946
No! No! No!

725
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,482
What is this shit?

726
01:22:51,483 --> 01:22:55,323
Get out! Get out!

727
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:05,965
Go, before he kills us both.

728
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
You want to do something for me?
- Anything.

729
01:23:09,035 --> 01:23:11,000
Then forget me.

730
01:23:11,035 --> 01:23:12,965
What? No.

731
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I will wait. The VT station.
5 o'clock, every day until you come.

732
01:23:23,035 --> 01:23:25,965
I love you.

733
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:33,000
So what? It's too late, Jamal. Now go.

734
01:23:41,035 --> 01:23:41,965
So Jamal.

735
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Which cricketer has scored the most
first class centuries in history?

736
01:23:47,035 --> 01:23:49,017
A:Sachin Tendulkar

737
01:23:49,052 --> 01:23:51,526
B:Ricky Ponting

738
01:23:51,561 --> 01:23:55,280
C:Michael Slater

739
01:23:55,315 --> 01:23:58,965
D:Jack Hobbs

740
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:04,000
But remember, if you answer wrong

741
01:24:04,035 --> 01:24:09,000
you lose everything, just like this.

742
01:24:09,035 --> 01:24:16,035
So do you want to do this?

743
01:24:36,223 --> 01:24:40,800
Dreams of so many...

744
01:24:40,801 --> 01:24:42,474
on the floor.

745
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Time for commercial break ladies and gentlemen

746
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:33,000
I know, I know. I can't stand the tension either.

747
01:27:33,035 --> 01:27:37,035
We'll be right back.

748
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Guy from the slums becomes
a millionaire overnight.

749
01:27:50,035 --> 01:27:55,000
You know who's the only other
person who's done that?

750
01:27:55,035 --> 01:27:56,965
Me.

751
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,965
I know what it feels like.

752
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,965
I know what you're being through.

753
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I'm not going to become a millionaire.

754
01:28:07,035 --> 01:28:10,017
I don't know the answer.

755
01:28:10,052 --> 01:28:12,526
You said that before, yeah...

756
01:28:12,561 --> 01:28:14,965
Really, this time I don't.

757
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Come on, you can't take the money and run now.

758
01:28:21,035 --> 01:28:24,017
You are on the edge of history kid.

759
01:28:24,052 --> 01:28:27,526
I don't see what else I can do.

760
01:28:27,561 --> 01:28:30,965
Maybe it's written my friend.

761
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I just have some kind of gut
feeling, you're gonna win this.

762
01:28:36,035 --> 01:28:43,035
Trust me, Jamal.

763
01:28:54,552 --> 01:29:01,552
You're gonna win.

764
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,878
Standby, everyone. We are on line in 30...

765
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:21,516
Yeah, he's gone. I'm just giving...

766
01:29:23,813 --> 01:29:25,149
Go fast.

767
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,970
20 seconds!

768
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Do the right thing and in approximately 3 minutes

769
01:29:35,035 --> 01:29:38,395
you'll be as famous as me.

770
01:29:38,396 --> 01:29:39,965
10 seconds!

771
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,000
And as rich as me. Almost.

772
01:29:45,035 --> 01:29:47,965
5 seconds! 4... 3...

773
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,332
From rags to raja. It's your destiny.

774
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:57,837
We are on. Applause and music please!

775
01:30:08,466 --> 01:30:11,965
Welcome back to "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"!

776
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:18,000
In the chair tonight is Jamal
Malik, as if we don't know.

777
01:30:18,035 --> 01:30:21,517
For 10 million rupees.

778
01:30:21,552 --> 01:30:24,965
To question once again.

779
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Which cricketer has scored the most
first class centuries in history?

780
01:30:33,035 --> 01:30:35,000
No it isn't Sachin Tendulkar.

781
01:30:35,035 --> 01:30:36,965
That's a start.

782
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:44,000
So it could be Ricky Ponting,
Jack Hobbs or Michael Slater.

783
01:30:44,035 --> 01:30:47,000
I'll use a lifeline. Fifty-fifty.

784
01:30:47,035 --> 01:30:48,965
ok.

785
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Computer, take away the two wrong answers please.

786
01:30:55,035 --> 01:30:58,017
Well, you were right about Sachin Tendulkar.

787
01:30:58,052 --> 01:31:01,000
That leaves your fifty-fifty choice, Jamal.

788
01:31:01,035 --> 01:31:05,000
B: Ricky Ponting or D: Jack Hobbs.

789
01:31:05,035 --> 01:31:08,965
What do you think?

790
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Decision time. For 10 million rupees.

791
01:31:15,035 --> 01:31:18,251
B: Ricky Ponting

792
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,870
or D: Jack Hobbs.

793
01:31:35,035 --> 01:31:37,748
D.

794
01:31:42,650 --> 01:31:45,005
Not B?

795
01:31:46,127 --> 01:31:50,969
The Ricky Ponting, the
Australian great cricketer?

796
01:31:52,035 --> 01:31:56,000
D, Jack Hobbs.

797
01:31:56,035 --> 01:32:00,965
You know?

798
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,000
So it could be B, Ricky Ponting?

799
01:32:04,035 --> 01:32:08,517
Or D, Jack Hobbs.

800
01:32:08,552 --> 01:32:12,965
The final answer, D.

801
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Computer, please check answer D.

802
01:32:17,035 --> 01:32:22,629
Answer D.

803
01:32:32,869 --> 01:32:39,221
With 197 first class centuries, the answer is...

804
01:32:41,035 --> 01:32:46,842
D, Jack Hobbs!

805
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,030
Jamal Malik! Millionaire!

806
01:32:55,173 --> 01:33:02,173
Do the dance! Come on!

807
01:33:04,246 --> 01:33:07,097
Well done! Well done.

808
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Are you ready for the final question?

809
01:33:35,035 --> 01:33:41,965
For 20 million rupees.

810
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:49,000
No. But maybe it's written.

811
01:33:49,035 --> 01:33:51,965
Maybe.

812
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:58,500
Okay. The final question! On who wants to be a...

813
01:33:58,535 --> 01:34:05,000
What a show ladies and gentlemen! What a show!

814
01:34:05,035 --> 01:34:05,965
Join us tomorrow night to see,

815
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:13,000
if Jamal Malik has made the biggest mistake
of his life on just one answer. Biggest one.

816
01:34:14,035 --> 01:34:21,017
This way.

817
01:34:21,052 --> 01:34:27,965
Great show.

818
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,802
See you tomorrow ok.

819
01:34:29,803 --> 01:34:33,696
Be on time. Bye.

820
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:45,914
What's going on?

821
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,797
He's a cheat. - How do you know he's cheating?

822
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
I fed him the wrong answer, and
he never should call it right.

823
01:35:01,035 --> 01:35:03,965
You gave him an answer?

824
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Not exactly. Well that
doesn't matter. That's my show!

825
01:35:10,035 --> 01:35:13,623
My fucking show!

826
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,500
It is a bizarrely plausible, and yet...

827
01:35:27,535 --> 01:35:32,000
Because I'm a slumdog, a chaiwalla,

828
01:35:32,035 --> 01:35:33,517
I'm a liar right?

829
01:35:33,552 --> 01:35:34,965
Most of you are.

830
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:40,000
But you are not a liar,
Mr Malik. That's for sure.

831
01:35:40,035 --> 01:35:45,000
You are too truthful.

832
01:35:45,035 --> 01:35:49,965
We're done.

833
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I don't know where they've taken her.

834
01:35:59,035 --> 01:36:06,035
Latika.

835
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I went on the show, because
I thought she'd be watching.

836
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Jamal Malik, an uneducated 18 year
old boy from the slums of Mumbay,

837
01:36:32,035 --> 01:36:35,965
won one draw by fair means. What a player!

838
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,965
And the crowd around me
bears an even bigger question:

839
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Will he be back tonight to play
for another 20 million rupees?

840
01:37:19,035 --> 01:37:25,000
Hey give me a kiss.

841
01:37:25,035 --> 01:37:31,965
Go girls!

842
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,291
Yes, I couldn't hear a thing in there.

843
01:37:35,601 --> 01:37:38,028
You've got to get us back into town.

844
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
As if it wasn't enough drama in a
contestant reaching the final question,

845
01:37:49,035 --> 01:37:54,000
Jamal Malik was last night
arrested on suspicion of fraud.

846
01:37:54,035 --> 01:38:01,035
That guy... Clever.

847
01:38:03,035 --> 01:38:05,953
Crazy "chudge".

848
01:38:12,035 --> 01:38:14,517
Here, go.

849
01:38:14,552 --> 01:38:16,965
But...

850
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Just drive. There won't be another chance.

851
01:38:26,035 --> 01:38:32,965
He will kill you.

852
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I'll take care of him.

853
01:38:40,035 --> 01:38:47,035
Salim, I can't.

854
01:38:47,552 --> 01:38:54,552
You have to.

855
01:38:54,811 --> 01:38:56,684
The code... take well out of this.

856
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Evil what I've done please forgive me.

857
01:39:17,035 --> 01:39:22,039
Have a good life.

858
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:57,000
You're back on the show.

859
01:40:22,035 --> 01:40:28,529
Come on!

860
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,965
Jamal? The millionaire?

861
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:52,000
The multi-millionaire? The one with all the cash?

862
01:40:52,035 --> 01:40:58,000
Go son, go with my blessing and win it all.

863
01:40:58,035 --> 01:41:02,965
We love you Jamal!

864
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,965
The nation's gripped with millionaire fever.

865
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,000
As Jamal Malik, an uneducated
boy from the Juhu slum in Mumbay,

866
01:41:10,035 --> 01:41:13,333
won a staggering 10 million rupee

867
01:41:13,368 --> 01:41:15,843
on a television show "Who
wants to be a millionaire",

868
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:24,000
and estimated 90 million
people watching us tonight

869
01:41:50,001 --> 01:41:51,001
to see if he will make a one
stage further to 20 million rupees.

870
01:41:51,036 --> 01:41:53,000
Where is everyone? Get back in there!

871
01:41:53,035 --> 01:41:59,000
Get back to work!

872
01:41:59,035 --> 01:42:02,995
Chaiwalla?

873
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Welcome back to "Who wants to be a millionaire".

874
01:42:27,035 --> 01:42:28,965
I can safetly say that tonight

875
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,965
is the biggest night of both our lives.

876
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Jamal Malik, the call
assistant worker from Mumbay,

877
01:42:36,035 --> 01:42:37,965
has already won 10 million.

878
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,965
He can walk away with that in his pocket

879
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
or make the biggest gamble in television history.

880
01:42:43,035 --> 01:42:44,965
to go for the final question

881
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:50,000
and a staggering 20 million rupees.

882
01:42:50,035 --> 01:42:55,000
Are you ready for that question?

883
01:42:55,035 --> 01:42:57,077
Yes. - Jamal!

884
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:13,330
Big reader you, Jamal?

885
01:43:15,298 --> 01:43:17,268
I can read.

886
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,965
Lucky.

887
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:27,000
In Alexandre Dumas' book,
the "The Three Musketeers",

888
01:43:27,035 --> 01:43:33,000
two of the musketeers are
called Athos and Porthos.

889
01:43:33,035 --> 01:43:37,000
What was the name of the third Musketeer?

890
01:43:37,035 --> 01:43:39,965
A: Aramis

891
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,000
B: Cardinal Richelieu

892
01:43:44,035 --> 01:43:46,235
C: D'Artagnan

893
01:43:46,939 --> 01:43:49,389
D: Planchet

894
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,965
She could be the third musketeer.

895
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Final question for 20 million
rupees, and he is smiling.

896
01:44:00,035 --> 01:44:03,517
I guess you know the answer.

897
01:44:03,552 --> 01:44:07,000
Do you believe it, I don't.

898
01:44:07,035 --> 01:44:09,965
You don't?

899
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,000
So you take the 10 million and walk?

900
01:44:15,035 --> 01:44:21,183
No. I'll play.

901
01:44:21,218 --> 01:44:22,965
Let remind you, Jamal.

902
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,000
If you get the answer wrong,

903
01:44:26,035 --> 01:44:28,965
you lose everything.

904
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:33,000
10 million rupees, Jamal.

905
01:44:33,035 --> 01:44:36,965
It's a fortune.

906
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,500
I'd like to phone a friend.

907
01:44:40,535 --> 01:44:43,965
You're going to the wire.

908
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:51,000
The final lifeline. Here we go.

909
01:44:55,035 --> 01:44:57,498
It's ringing!

910
01:44:59,552 --> 01:45:04,452
Who is it?

911
01:45:04,487 --> 01:45:09,399
That's my brother's number, but...

912
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:16,000
The kind of brother, who go for a
walk on a 20 million rupee question?

913
01:45:16,035 --> 01:45:23,035
It's the only number I know.

914
01:45:45,161 --> 01:45:48,701
You are on your own, Jamal.

915
01:45:51,035 --> 01:45:56,965
Hello?

916
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,965
Hello, Jamal?

917
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I'm guessing that isn't your brother.

918
01:46:05,035 --> 01:46:06,965
This is...

919
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
My name is Latika.

920
01:46:08,035 --> 01:46:09,965
Okay, Latika.

921
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:15,000
You want to hear the question one more
time? And let's be clear about this.

922
01:46:15,035 --> 01:46:21,000
20 million rupees right on your
answer, you have 30 seconds.

923
01:46:21,035 --> 01:46:28,000
Jamal, please read out
the question to Latika now.

924
01:46:28,035 --> 01:46:30,965
It is really you? - Yes.

925
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,965
The question, Jamal. The question!

926
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,500
In Alexandre Dumas' book,
the "The Three Musketeers",

927
01:46:37,535 --> 01:46:40,000
two of the musketeers are
called Athos and Porthos.

928
01:46:40,035 --> 01:46:41,965
What was the name of the third Musketeer?

929
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Was it A: Aramis, B: Cardinal Richelieu,
C: D'Artagnan or D: Planchet?

930
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:51,017
15 seconds!

931
01:46:51,052 --> 01:46:53,026
Where are you?

932
01:46:53,061 --> 01:46:55,030
I am safe.

933
01:46:55,065 --> 01:46:56,965
10 seconds!

934
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:02,965
Latika, what do you think?

935
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:09,000
I don't know. I've never known.

936
01:47:09,035 --> 01:47:16,035
Jamal, God bless...

937
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,009
You really are on your own now, Jamal.

938
01:47:25,010 --> 01:47:30,994
Your final answer for 20 million rupees.

939
01:47:41,035 --> 01:47:44,965
A.

940
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,965
A, because?

941
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,010
Just... because.

942
01:47:51,723 --> 01:47:53,066
Hey, Salim!

943
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,965
Final answer?

944
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:06,758
Yes, final answer. A, Aramis.

945
01:48:06,759 --> 01:48:13,725
Computer, please check answer A.

946
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Jamal Malik, call center assistant from Mumbay,

947
01:48:22,035 --> 01:48:24,965
chaiwalla,

948
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,965
for two draws 20 million rupees

949
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:35,000
you were asked who the third musketeer
was in a novel by Alexander Dumas.

950
01:48:35,035 --> 01:48:41,965
You answered A, Aramis.

951
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Which is. I have to tell you.

952
01:48:45,035 --> 01:48:52,035
The right answer!

953
01:49:12,035 --> 01:49:19,017
Jamal Malik!

954
01:49:19,052 --> 01:49:26,052
God is great.

955
01:49:28,504 --> 01:49:31,724
What a night!

956
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,965
I knew you'd be watching.

957
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I thought we'd be together only in death.

958
01:52:53,035 --> 01:52:58,000
This is our destiny.

959
01:52:58,035 --> 01:53:05,035
Kiss me.

960
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:15,000
D: it is written

961
01:53:17,035 --> 01:53:23,035
