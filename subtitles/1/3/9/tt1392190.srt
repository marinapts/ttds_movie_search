1
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,552
My name is Max.

2
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:26,439
My world is fire and blood.

3
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:37,796
Water Wars!! Water Wars!

4
00:00:38,798 --> 00:00:40,898
Once, I was a cop.

5
00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:44,221
A road warrior searching
for a righteous cause.

6
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,479
As the world fell...

7
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:01,019
each of us in our own way was broken.

8
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,160
It was hard to know who was more crazy.

9
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,820
Me...

10
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,640
Or everyone else.

11
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:14,581
Hello?

12
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:18,521
Where are you?

13
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,418
Where are you Max?

14
00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:28,743
Here they come again.

15
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:32,567
Worming their way into the
black matter of my brain.

16
00:01:33,216 --> 00:01:35,402
<i>Help us Max! /
You promised to help us!</i>

17
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,284
I tell myself...

18
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:43,424
they cannot touch me.

19
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,141
They are long dead.

20
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:46,112
I am the one...

21
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:49,452
who runs from both
the living AND the dead.

22
00:02:50,693 --> 00:02:52,593
Hunted by scavengers...

23
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:56,545
Haunted by those I could not protect.

24
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,371
So I exist in this wasteland...

25
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:17,316
A man, reduced to a single instinct:

26
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
Survive.

27
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,348
<i>Blood group O negative, high octane.
Universal donor.</i>

28
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:40,206
Max?

29
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:42,246
Is that you?

30
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:47,102
Help us!

31
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:49,426
Max Where are you?!

32
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:07,066
Max Where are you?!

33
00:05:07,216 --> 00:05:08,216
Save me.

34
00:05:09,484 --> 00:05:10,484
He made us die!

35
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:13,379
He made us die!

36
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:14,838
He made us die!

37
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:37,884
Tune!

Hooked On!

Today we're headed to Gas Town!

46
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:47,769
Gas Town!

47
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:51,086
Today we haulin' Aqua Cola.

48
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:52,715

Today we carry fruits and vegetables! /
Fruits and vegetables!

And today we carry mother's milk!

51
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,673
Mother's Milk!

Joe! Joe! Joe! Immortan Joe!

53
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:52,274
Give it up, for the Immortan Joe!!!

54
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,408
Once again, we send off my
War Rig to bring back...

55
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:07,013
guzzoline from Gas Town...

56
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:09,946
and bullets from the Bullet Farm!

57
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:14,301
Once again, I salute
to my Imperator...

58
00:08:14,523 --> 00:08:16,115
Furiosa!

59
00:08:16,323 --> 00:08:17,434
And I salute...

60
00:08:17,435 --> 00:08:20,141
my half-life War Boys...

61
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:22,714
who will ride with me, eternal...

62
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:25,707
on the highways of Valhalla.

63
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:28,035
V8! V8! V8! V8!

64
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:30,936
I AM YOUR REDEEMER!

65
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:33,557
It is by my hand...

66
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,728
you will rise from the ashes...

67
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:38,085
of this world!

68
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:48,566
It's coming. Get ready.

69
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:52,694
Yes. Yes. The water comes.

70
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:51,459
Do not, my friends...

71
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:53,818
become addicted to water.

72
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:55,635
It will take hold of you...

73
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,852
and you will resent, it's absence.

74
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:25,126
Get out!

75
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,130
Get rid of them all!

76
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,307

Get out!

79
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,663
Signal Gas Town.
Convoy's on it's way.

80
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,917
I got a War Boy
running on empty.

81
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,191
Hook-up that full-life.

82
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:20,529
Hey, careful!!
He's a universal donor.

83
00:12:18,014 --> 00:12:19,909
Boss, we're not going to Gas Town?

84
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:23,856
Bullet Farm?

85
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:27,863
We're heading east!

86
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:31,752
I'll pass it down the line.

87
00:12:32,781 --> 00:12:34,076
New orders!

88
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:35,883
Thunder up! Thunder up!

89
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:38,035
This is not a supply run!!

90
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:39,682
Go! Go!

91
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:42,202
What is this? What's going on??/
We're heading east.

92
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:44,893
Why? /
I don't know, that's the orders.

93
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:31,796

You know about this?

95
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:10,049
You're produce ain't going to Gas Town.

96
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:21,519
She's gone off road...

97
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:23,816
into hostile territory.

98
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,038
Why would she do that Dad?

99
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:30,982
Lemme see! Lemme see!! I Rictus!

100
00:13:31,355 --> 00:13:33,102
I wanna see!! I Rictus.

101
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,999
Go see what's agitating DAD!!

102
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:04,659
Splendid?!

103

Angharad?!!

104
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:12,148
OUR BABIES WILL NOT BE WARLORDS.

105
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:14,591
WHO KILLED THE WORLD?

106
00:14:17,302 --> 00:14:18,304
Where are they?

107
00:14:18,454 --> 00:14:20,270
They are not your property!!

108
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:21,428
Miss Giddy!!

109
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,395
You cannot own a human being.
<i>WE ARE NOT THINGS.</i>

110
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:26,620
Sooner or later someone pushes back!

111
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:28,997
WHERE IS SHE TAKING THEM?!!!

112
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:32,105
She didn't take them.
They begged her to go!

113
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:35,027
Where is she taking them?

114
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:36,903
A long way from you!!!

115
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:04,413
What's happened?

116
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:07,716
Slit!

117
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:09,972
What's going on? Slit!! I Treason!

118
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:12,940
Betrayal! An Imperator gone rogue.

119
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:14,716
Imperator? Who?

120
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:17,701
Furiosa! She took a lot of stuff
from Immortan Joe.

121
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:19,165
What stuff?

122
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,243
Breeders! His prized Breeders!!

123
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:23,876
He wants them back!
Not a hand laid on 'em.

124
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,019
By my deeds I honor him.

125

V8! V8! V8!

127

That's my wheel!! I I'm driving!

128
00:15:48,222 --> 00:15:50,702
You're my lancer. /
I just promoted myself!!!

129
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:52,650
Not today. Today is my day!

130
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:55,554
Look at you. If you can't stand up,
you can't do war!!

131
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:57,041
He's right, son.

132
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,522
I'm not staying here dying a sloth!!

133
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:01,437
You're already a corpse.

134
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,822
I just need a little top-up. /
There's no time!!!

135
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:05,597
We take my Blood Bag.

136
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:07,772
We'll take my Blood Bag
and string him to the lancer's perch.

137
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:09,896
It's got a muzzle on it. It's a
raging feral!! I That's right!

138
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:12,910
High-octane crazy blood filling me up.

139
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:19,590
If I'm gonna die...

140
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:22,629
I'm gonna die historic
on the Fury Road!

141
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:31,236
Yeah! Yeah!!

142
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:34,484
Organic, hitch up his Blood Bag.

143
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:35,996
Right-o.

144
00:16:45,786 --> 00:16:47,602
What else can they take from me?

145
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,103
They have my blood.
Now it's my car!

146
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:29,147
Immortan!

147
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:31,900
Immortan Joe!

148
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:36,127
He looked at me!

149
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:39,670
He looked right at me! /
He was staring at your Blood Bag!

150
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,351
He turned his head! He looked
me straight in the eye!!

151
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,654
He was scanning the horizon!

152
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:46,147
No.

153
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:47,698
I am awaited!

154
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:50,302
I am awaited in Valhalla!!!!

155
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,791
FUCK!!!!!

156
00:17:57,422 --> 00:17:58,481
Immortan!

157
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,017
Look! Hey look!!

158
00:18:22,455 --> 00:18:23,455
Look!!

159
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:29,296
Boss!

160
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,881
We got vehicles from the Citadel.
They're firing flares.

161
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,274
They want reinforcements from
Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.

162
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:37,677
What is this??

163
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,928
Backup? Decoy??

164
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:41,912
It's a detour.

165
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:42,054
Eyes right!

166
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:19,453
Buzzards!!!

167
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:22,648
Buzzards right!! Eyes on! Eyes on!!

168
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:56,762
Should we turn around and
run 'em into our backup?

169
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:33,297
No! We're good.

170
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:36,248
We fang it!!

171
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,817
Thunder up! Here we go!!

172
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,619
Prepare the shooter!

173
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:15,875
Morsov!

174
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:33,984
War!

175
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:43,673
Ready!

176
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:30,419
She's ours Slit! She's ours!!

177
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:32,972
First, we get the buzzards off her back!

178
00:21:39,136 --> 00:21:40,151
Ready to throw!

179
00:21:44,076 --> 00:21:45,315
That's my head!!!

180
00:22:20,685 --> 00:22:22,492
Get up! You can do it!

181
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,813
Morsov!

182
00:22:30,605 --> 00:22:32,414
Morsov! I No!

183
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:33,910
WITNESS ME!!!

184
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:35,399
Witness! I Witness!!!

185
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:15,278
Witness!!! I Witness!

186
00:22:50,263 --> 00:22:52,000
Mediocre Morsov!!

187
00:22:52,358 --> 00:22:53,781
Mediocre!!!!

188
00:23:27,643 --> 00:23:28,840
Get me in!

189
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,090
They are coming!

190
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,977
We can't breathe down there!!

191
00:23:54,482 --> 00:23:55,865
Stay outta sight!!

192
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:57,115
NOW!!!

193
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:10,477
Back!

194
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,814
What happened?!

195
00:24:12,815 --> 00:24:14,415
Hydraulics! Hydraulics!!

196
00:24:42,827 --> 00:24:46,324
Now we bring home the booty.

197
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:13,621
She thinks she can lose us Dad!

198
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:15,613
She thinks we're stupid.

199
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,204
She thinks she can lose us
in there!

200
00:25:37,073 --> 00:25:38,073
Fang it!

201
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:40,188
FANG IT!!!

202
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,090
Why can't you stop?

203
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:51,156
You! Outta the way! Out of the way!!!

204
00:25:51,286 --> 00:25:52,447
What have you done?!

205
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:53,735
What have you done?!

206
00:26:16,103 --> 00:26:19,032
We need a counterweight.
Get the Blood Bag toward the back.

207
00:26:29,185 --> 00:26:31,553
Burn them! Burn them!

208
00:26:57,274 --> 00:26:58,274
Hey there!

209
00:26:58,378 --> 00:26:59,610
Say bye bye to the neck!

210
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:28,764
We're going in Slit!

211
00:28:04,622 --> 00:28:07,021
Come on! We almost got it!

212
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:18,231
Come on! Hold!

213
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:48,106
Oh what a day!
WHAT A LOVELY DAY!!

214
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:09,029
I'm the man...

215
00:29:09,678 --> 00:29:10,806
who grabbed the sun...

216
00:29:13,716 --> 00:29:15,365
riding to Valhalla!!!!

217
00:29:18,447 --> 00:29:19,862
Witness me Blood Bag!!

218
00:29:24,238 --> 00:29:25,456
Witness!!!

219
00:29:49,316 --> 00:29:51,662
I live, I die, I live again!!

220
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:35,911
We're not going back.

221
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,599
Water.

222
00:35:01,595 --> 00:35:02,595
You.

223
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:20,499
Angharad, is that just the wind...

224
00:35:20,627 --> 00:35:22,465
or a furious fixation?

225
00:36:52,195 --> 00:36:53,276
I got it!

226
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:37,650
Glory me Blood Bag!
We snagged her alive.

227
00:37:37,886 --> 00:37:40,090
He's gonna shred her.
Shred Her!!

228
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:41,787
Bolt cutters.

229
00:37:42,457 --> 00:37:43,548
Chain.

230
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:46,331
Hey, hey, HEY!!

231
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,893
Ohh look at them.

232
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,417
So shiny! So chrome.

233
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:56,360
He's gonna be so grateful!

234
00:37:57,284 --> 00:37:58,587
We could ask for anything.

235
00:37:59,893 --> 00:38:01,357
I want to drive the War Rig.

236
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:04,508
What will you ask for? /
That's MY Jacket!!

237
00:38:05,612 --> 00:38:06,612
Sure.

238
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,172
I mean, you could ask for
more than a jacket.

239
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:10,534
We're going to the Green Place.

240
00:37:53,085 --> 00:37:55,442
We're going to the Green Place
of Many Mothers.

241
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:48,737
How does it feel?

242
00:38:48,937 --> 00:38:50,056
It hurts!

243
00:38:50,343 --> 00:38:52,063
Out here everything hurts.

244
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:55,679
You wanna get through this?

245
00:38:59,456 --> 00:39:00,512
Do as I say.

246
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:07,640
Now pick up what you can and run.

247
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,602
Filth!

248
00:39:50,285 --> 00:39:51,645
Kill switches.

249
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:54,734
I set the sequence myself.

250
00:39:55,174 --> 00:39:56,910
This Rig goes nowhere without me.

251
00:40:00,836 --> 00:40:02,013
You can get in.

252
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,797
Not without them.

253
00:40:13,422 --> 00:40:14,422
So we wait.

254
00:40:23,312 --> 00:40:25,733
You're relying on the gratitude
of a very bad man.

255
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:29,575
You've already damaged one of his wives.
How grateful do you think he's gonna be?

256
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,286
You're sitting on 2000 horsepower
of Nitro-boosted war machine.

257
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:42,564
I think you've got a five minute headstart.

258
00:40:50,843 --> 00:40:52,410
You want that thing off your face?!

259
00:41:05,387 --> 00:41:06,387
Let's go!

260
00:41:50,904 --> 00:41:54,256
Of all the legs you had to shoot,
that one was attached to his favorite.

261
00:42:03,012 --> 00:42:05,012
You don't have to do it
just because he tells you.

262
00:42:38,118 --> 00:42:40,679
What choice does she have? /
He's not gonna hurt us. He needs us.

263
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:41,715
Why? I To bargain.

264
00:42:42,131 --> 00:42:42,995
He'll hurt us alright.

265
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,851
Do you think he's coming
to the Green Place?

266
00:42:45,026 --> 00:42:48,049
He's a crazy lunatic who
likes to eat schlanger!

267
00:43:14,756 --> 00:43:15,837
Ahh stay outta there.

268
00:43:16,123 --> 00:43:17,204
Behind you.

269
00:43:22,245 --> 00:43:23,358
Gas Town Boys.

270
00:43:25,222 --> 00:43:26,790
Don't damage the goods.

271
00:43:33,781 --> 00:43:35,148
What do you see?

272
00:43:37,567 --> 00:43:38,876
Big rigs...

273
00:43:40,939 --> 00:43:41,947
Polecats...

274
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:43,872
Flamers...

275
00:43:45,651 --> 00:43:48,178
and there's the People Eater himself!

276
00:43:49,565 --> 00:43:51,224
Coming to count the cost.

277
00:44:07,352 --> 00:44:08,626
We dragging something out back!

278
00:44:09,697 --> 00:44:11,107
I think it's the fuel pod.

279
00:44:11,853 --> 00:44:12,900
No. NO!

280
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:15,262
I'll go.

281
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,710
Bitch! You traitored him!

282
00:45:45,545 --> 00:45:46,891
No unnecessary killing!!

283
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,907
This War Boy wants me dead!! /
We agreed!!

284
00:45:49,649 --> 00:45:51,364
He's kamakrazee!!

285
00:45:51,901 --> 00:45:53,870
He just a kid at the end of his half-life!!

286
00:45:53,871 --> 00:45:56,010
No! I live,
I die, I live again!!

287
00:45:56,929 --> 00:45:58,247
Hold him! I Tie him up!

288
00:45:58,495 --> 00:45:59,546
Throw him out!

289
00:45:59,941 --> 00:46:00,954
Throw him!

290
00:46:02,363 --> 00:46:03,816
You got more friends.

291
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:07,562
Bullet Farmer.

292
00:46:08,008 --> 00:46:10,008
They're coming from the Bullet Farm. /
Yeah?

293
00:46:11,054 --> 00:46:12,802
It's over. You can't defy him!

294
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:14,434
Just watch us mate!

295
00:46:14,518 --> 00:46:17,518
He is the one who grabbed the sun. /
Look how slick he's fooled you War Boy!

296
00:46:17,717 --> 00:46:18,831
He's a lying old man.

297
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,601
By his hand we'll all be lifted up!

298
00:46:20,731 --> 00:46:23,075
That's why we have
his logo seared on our backs!

299
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,224
"Breeding stock!"
"Battle fodder!"

300
00:46:25,362 --> 00:46:26,457
No, I am awaited!!

301
00:46:26,608 --> 00:46:28,257
You're an old man's battle fodder.

302
00:46:28,409 --> 00:46:29,903
Killing everyone and everything!!

303
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,007
We are not to blame.

304
00:46:31,062 --> 00:46:32,650
Then who killed the world?!!

305
00:47:00,803 --> 00:47:02,858
I made a deal up ahead.
Safe passage.

306
00:47:03,591 --> 00:47:05,220
I don't know if it's still any good.

307
00:47:06,128 --> 00:47:07,344
Get back in the hold.

308
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:08,756
Keep the hatch open.

309
00:47:16,057 --> 00:47:17,104
I need you here.

310
00:47:19,732 --> 00:47:21,111
You may have to drive the rig.

311
00:47:26,648 --> 00:47:27,658
You.

312
00:47:28,668 --> 00:47:29,685
You stay.

313
00:47:30,842 --> 00:47:31,951
You stay there.

314
00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:37,803
Whatever you do,
you can't be seen.

315
00:47:38,382 --> 00:47:39,903
I'm supposed to be alone.

316
00:47:40,336 --> 00:47:41,683
That was the deal.

317
00:47:48,489 --> 00:47:49,575
Down here.

318
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:11,355
Hey.

319
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:13,524
What's your name?

320
00:48:15,456 --> 00:48:16,849
What do I call you?

321
00:48:17,847 --> 00:48:18,972
Does it matter?

322
00:48:21,351 --> 00:48:22,351
Fine.

323
00:48:22,898 --> 00:48:24,205
When I yell "Fool"...

324
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:26,516
you drive outta here
as fast as you can.

325
00:48:28,301 --> 00:48:29,827
This is the sequence:

326
00:48:29,828 --> 00:48:32,120
One. One. Two.

327
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:33,585
One.

328
00:48:34,063 --> 00:48:36,563
Red. Black. Go.

329
00:48:37,517 --> 00:48:38,547
You have it?

330
00:50:04,203 --> 00:50:05,281
It's all here!

331
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,487
3000 gallons of guzzoline,
just like you asked!

332
00:50:13,853 --> 00:50:15,259
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.

333
00:50:17,513 --> 00:50:18,810
You drop the rocks.

334
00:50:27,696 --> 00:50:28,733
You said:

335
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:30,621
"A few vehicles in pursuit.

336
00:50:31,103 --> 00:50:32,170
Maybe."

337
00:50:32,706 --> 00:50:34,785
We count three war parties!!!

338
00:50:35,964 --> 00:50:38,195
Yeah well I got unlucky.

339
00:50:38,196 --> 00:50:39,320
Let's do this!

340
00:51:05,551 --> 00:51:06,773
FOOL!!!!!

341
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,410
That's our fuel!!!

342
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:05,994
Open the way for Ripsaw!

343
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:22,476
Once I'm over...

344
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,820
clear the rocks
and lead everyone through.

345
00:52:24,821 --> 00:52:25,842
Immortan!

346
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:28,355
Immortan Joe!

347
00:52:28,356 --> 00:52:31,749
I got a War Boy!
Say's he was on the War Rig.

348
00:52:34,226 --> 00:52:36,030
You! Climb aboard!

349
00:52:38,471 --> 00:52:39,509
Hey! HEY!

350
00:52:40,676 --> 00:52:41,867
I got his boot!

351
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:43,885
I got the Blood Bag's boot!!

352
00:52:44,765 --> 00:52:45,950
Take me!

353
00:52:46,511 --> 00:52:47,819
I've got his boot!!!

354
00:52:49,974 --> 00:52:52,455
All of this for a family squabble.

355
00:52:53,321 --> 00:52:54,984
Healthy babies.

356
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:04,051
Reload the clip.

357
00:55:04,747 --> 00:55:06,640
I can't.

358
00:55:12,277 --> 00:55:13,420
Gun!!!

359
00:55:15,321 --> 00:55:16,921
Give me the gun!! /
It's not loaded yet!!

360
00:55:16,926 --> 00:55:17,926
Now!

361
00:55:17,955 --> 00:55:18,955
We had a deal!

362
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:08,635
Rictus!

363
00:56:09,424 --> 00:56:10,512
The wives!

364
00:56:10,925 --> 00:56:11,994
No more flames!!

365
00:56:18,744 --> 00:56:19,932
Splendid!

366
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:21,681
Splendid!

367
00:56:22,247 --> 00:56:23,604
That's my child!

368
00:56:23,669 --> 00:56:24,787
MY PROPERTY!!!!

369
00:56:27,661 --> 00:56:28,661
Immorta...

370
00:56:38,035 --> 00:56:41,855
Immortan. If I get on the rig,
there's a way inside.

371
00:56:42,223 --> 00:56:43,979
What is your name? I It's Nux.

372
00:56:44,508 --> 00:56:46,779
I'll pike her in the spine.
Keep her breathing for ya!!

373
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:47,970
No.

374
00:56:48,213 --> 00:56:49,793
Put a bullet in her skull.

375
00:56:50,094 --> 00:56:52,724
Stop the rig. Return my property...

376
00:56:53,272 --> 00:56:54,661
and I myself...

377
00:56:55,127 --> 00:56:58,549
will carry you to the Gates of Valhalla!

378
00:56:59,364 --> 00:57:00,520
Am I awaited?

379
00:57:01,369 --> 00:57:02,824
You will ride eternal...

380
00:57:03,141 --> 00:57:05,093
shiny and chrome.

381
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,960
Rictus!

382
00:57:08,813 --> 00:57:10,209
Help him aboard!

383
00:57:12,082 --> 00:57:13,163
Ready?

384
00:57:13,887 --> 00:57:14,890
Here we go!

385
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,457
Mediocre!

386
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:59,620
Schlanger!

387
00:58:19,865 --> 00:58:20,865
Look out!

388
00:58:24,276 --> 00:58:25,343
Angharad!

389
00:58:25,738 --> 00:58:26,738
Look out!!!

390
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:50,061
NO!!! I Angharad!!!

391
00:59:05,165 --> 00:59:07,309
Stop!! Turn the rig around!!

392
00:59:08,343 --> 00:59:09,684
Go back for her!!!

393
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:11,862
No.

394
00:59:12,227 --> 00:59:13,709
Tell him to turn the rig around!!

395
00:59:13,914 --> 00:59:14,930
Did you see it?

396
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:17,320
She went under the wheels.

397
00:59:17,504 --> 00:59:19,003
Did you SEE it?!

398
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:22,355
She went under the wheels!

399
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:24,782
We keep moving!

400
00:59:24,874 --> 00:59:26,225
NO!! I WE KEEP MOVING!!

401
00:59:26,727 --> 00:59:28,603
He doesn't know what he's talking about!

402
00:59:29,225 --> 00:59:31,187
Whatever happens,
we're going to the Green Place!

403
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:33,744
What stupid Green Place!
We don't even know where it is!

404
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:48,936
Are you alright? GO ON! GO ON!!!

405
01:00:27,016 --> 01:00:28,071
Cheedo!

406
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:30,022
Cheedo, don't be stupid.

407
01:00:30,516 --> 01:00:31,516
Stop!

408
01:00:31,521 --> 01:00:32,956
He'll forgive us.
I know he will.

409
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:34,190
There's no going back!

410
01:00:34,561 --> 01:00:36,339
We were his treasures! I Cheedo!

411
01:00:36,589 --> 01:00:39,438
We were protected!
He gave us a life of luxury!

412
01:00:39,575 --> 01:00:41,350
What's wrong with that? /
We are not things!!

413
01:00:42,422 --> 01:00:43,422
No!

414
01:00:44,813 --> 01:00:46,275
Cheedo, we are not things!

415
01:00:46,445 --> 01:00:48,926
We are not THINGS. /
I don't want to hear that again!

416
01:00:49,056 --> 01:00:50,316
They were her words!

417
01:00:50,622 --> 01:00:51,721
And now she's dead!

418
01:00:53,279 --> 01:00:56,199
Wring your hands and tear your hair,
but you're not going back there.

419
01:00:56,555 --> 01:00:58,219
You're not going back to him.

420
01:00:58,846 --> 01:00:59,846
Angharad!

421
01:00:59,863 --> 01:01:01,421
Come on!

422
01:01:10,304 --> 01:01:11,304
So um...

423
01:01:13,106 --> 01:01:14,456
where is this...

424
01:01:16,107 --> 01:01:17,644
this Green Place?

425
01:01:18,829 --> 01:01:20,961
It's a long night's run, heading east.

426
01:01:23,495 --> 01:01:24,752
We need inventory.

427
01:01:24,906 --> 01:01:27,214
I want you to match every
gun with it's bullets.

428
01:01:31,216 --> 01:01:32,986
I'm gonna go down and do some repairs.

429
01:01:33,076 --> 01:01:34,499
We need someone down the back.

430
01:01:34,662 --> 01:01:35,662
I'll go.

431
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:36,529
No.

432
01:01:36,685 --> 01:01:38,282
I want you to stay together.

433
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,244
I can do it.

434
01:02:13,441 --> 01:02:14,503
What are you doing here?

435
01:02:15,935 --> 01:02:17,241
He saw it.

436
01:02:17,924 --> 01:02:19,313
He saw it all.

437
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,127
My own blood bag driving
the rig that killed her.

438
01:02:31,112 --> 01:02:32,224
Stop doing that.

439
01:02:35,926 --> 01:02:36,927
Stop.

440
01:02:47,046 --> 01:02:49,613
Three times the gates were open to me.

441
01:02:50,206 --> 01:02:51,206
What gates?

442
01:02:51,888 --> 01:02:53,425
I was awaited in Valhalla.

443
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,408
They were calling my name.

444
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:59,801
I should be walking with the Immortan.
Feasting with the heroes of all time.

445
01:03:03,941 --> 01:03:06,310
I'd say it was your
manifest destiny not to.

446
01:03:08,135 --> 01:03:10,756
I thought I was being
spared for something great.

447
01:03:10,857 --> 01:03:14,410
I got to... drive a pursuit vehicle.

448
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:18,493
For a while even Larry and Barry
stop chewing on my windpipe.

449
01:03:18,682 --> 01:03:20,241
Who're Larry and Barry?

450
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,672
My mates.

451
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:24,453
Larry and Barry.

452
01:03:26,572 --> 01:03:28,986
If they don't get me,
the Night Fevers will.

453
01:03:54,558 --> 01:03:58,385
We only got four for big boy here,
so he's all but useless.

454
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:00,044
But...

455
01:04:00,274 --> 01:04:04,005
we can squirt off this little pinky
about 29 times.

456
01:04:06,656 --> 01:04:08,727
Angharad used to call it Anti-seed.

457
01:04:09,464 --> 01:04:11,908
Plant one and watch the thing die.

458
01:05:46,824 --> 01:05:50,189
We are down 30000 units of gasoline...

459
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,497
19 canisters of nitro...

460
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:54,021
12 assault bikes...

461
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:55,804
7 pursuit vehicles.

462
01:05:56,206 --> 01:05:57,294
My deficit mounts.

463
01:05:57,389 --> 01:05:58,524
And now, sir...

464
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:01,675
you, have us stuck in a quagmire!

465
01:06:02,368 --> 01:06:03,368
Hey Joe!

466
01:06:04,372 --> 01:06:05,449
Boss!

467
01:06:07,522 --> 01:06:09,586
Your girl is breathing her last!

468
01:06:10,312 --> 01:06:12,324
What about the child?

469
01:06:21,518 --> 01:06:22,929
Are you coming Brother?!

470
01:06:23,153 --> 01:06:24,259
Wait!

471
01:06:25,487 --> 01:06:27,131
It's gone awful quiet in there.

472
01:06:27,273 --> 01:06:28,534
Take it out!

473
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:29,930
Get it Out!!!

474
01:06:32,896 --> 01:06:35,031
Come on! I've been called to the torture!

475
01:06:35,759 --> 01:06:36,840
Patience!

476
01:06:38,565 --> 01:06:40,955
Oh you stay here with your grief daddy!

477
01:06:41,356 --> 01:06:44,556
I'll fetch 'em for ya. /
Be careful! Protect the assets!!

478
01:06:47,271 --> 01:06:49,358
Just one angry shot!...

479
01:06:49,989 --> 01:06:52,074
for Furiosa.

480
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:53,075
Hut!

481
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:01,877
Crying shame.

482
01:07:05,376 --> 01:07:06,376
Another month...

483
01:07:07,087 --> 01:07:08,948
could've been a viable human!

484
01:07:09,366 --> 01:07:10,504
Was it a male?

485
01:07:11,018 --> 01:07:12,329
A-One Alpha Prime.

486
01:07:15,695 --> 01:07:16,787
Hey Rictus!

487
01:07:18,289 --> 01:07:19,726
You lost a baby brother!

488
01:07:22,522 --> 01:07:24,044
Perfect in every way.

489
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,503
I had a baby brother!!

490
01:07:29,057 --> 01:07:30,876
I had a little baby brother!!!

491
01:07:31,093 --> 01:07:32,826
And he was perfect!!

492
01:07:33,252 --> 01:07:34,831
Perfect in every way!!!

493
01:08:05,856 --> 01:08:06,856
Come on.

494
01:08:16,355 --> 01:08:17,915
You wouldn't wanna shoot the wives sir.

495
01:07:57,382 --> 01:07:58,982
He wants to help!

496
01:08:32,402 --> 01:08:33,228
Who?!

497
01:08:33,389 --> 01:08:34,742
The War Boy!!

498
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:38,147
Where did he come from?! /
I thought we threw him off the rig!!

499
01:08:42,478 --> 01:08:44,432
There is high ground,
just beyond that thing!

500
01:08:44,584 --> 01:08:45,664
He means the tree.

501
01:08:45,995 --> 01:08:48,907
Yeah. Tree!

502
01:08:48,908 --> 01:08:49,908
Leave him to me!

503
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:53,474
Say, anyone notice that bright light?
Approaching gunfire?

504
01:08:54,268 --> 01:08:56,333
Get out. /
I can do this. I know this machine.

505
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:57,978
He does. He's a Revhead.

506
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:04,820
You got two left!

507
01:09:11,157 --> 01:09:12,221
On him.

508
01:09:29,929 --> 01:09:31,384
Don't breathe.

509
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:37,230
Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!

510
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:38,842
War Boy!!

511
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:41,590
I'll use the winch! Around the tree thing.

512
01:09:42,405 --> 01:09:43,706
Take this.

513
01:09:43,827 --> 01:09:45,617
Let's get the engine plates.

514
01:09:47,103 --> 01:09:48,242
You drive the rig!

515
01:09:48,243 --> 01:09:50,069
Hold the flare! /
I am holding the flare!!

516
01:09:50,829 --> 01:09:53,005
Closer! /
It's right in front of your eyes!!

517
01:10:05,572 --> 01:10:07,270
Hut! HUTTT!!!!

518
01:10:13,757 --> 01:10:14,757
Blood Bag!

519
01:10:21,431 --> 01:10:23,567
I am the scales of justice!

520
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:26,424
Conductor of the choir of death!

521
01:10:31,095 --> 01:10:32,512
Sing for the flock!!

522
01:10:35,694 --> 01:10:39,084
Sing Brother! Sing!! SINGGGG!!!!

523
01:10:40,031 --> 01:10:42,147
Don't they know they're shooting at us?!

524
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:57,394
Guns reload!!!

525
01:12:07,817 --> 01:12:09,939
I never thought I would do
something as shiny as that!

526
01:12:10,531 --> 01:12:11,761
How're the engines?

527
01:12:12,678 --> 01:12:14,107
Very hot and real thirsty.

528
01:12:18,997 --> 01:12:23,211
Hey. You need to take the rig
half a click down the track.

529
01:12:24,187 --> 01:12:26,678
What if you're not back
by the time the engines are cooled?

530
01:12:29,225 --> 01:12:30,776
Well you keep moving!

531
01:12:40,443 --> 01:12:42,184
What do you suppose he's gonna do?

532
01:12:43,333 --> 01:12:44,822
Retaliate first.

533
01:12:48,555 --> 01:12:49,627
Let's go!

534
01:14:09,276 --> 01:14:10,322
Are you hurt?

535
01:14:12,112 --> 01:14:13,112
You're bleeding.

536
01:14:14,089 --> 01:14:15,422
That's not his blood.

537
01:14:17,258 --> 01:14:18,258
What is this?

538
01:14:19,448 --> 01:14:20,524
It's Mother's Milk.

539
01:15:03,346 --> 01:15:04,347
It's okay.

540
01:15:04,865 --> 01:15:05,865
Sleep.

541
01:15:06,729 --> 01:15:08,209
Get some rest.

542
01:15:18,773 --> 01:15:21,195
How do you know this place even exists?

543
01:15:24,051 --> 01:15:25,355
I was born there.

544
01:15:27,808 --> 01:15:28,822
Why'd you leave?

545
01:15:29,319 --> 01:15:30,343
I didn't.

546
01:15:31,886 --> 01:15:33,760
I was taken as a child.

547
01:15:35,704 --> 01:15:36,720
Stolen.

548
01:15:42,935 --> 01:15:44,375
You've done this before?

549
01:15:45,215 --> 01:15:46,820
Many times.

550
01:15:47,753 --> 01:15:49,562
Now that I drive a War Rig...

551
01:15:51,535 --> 01:15:53,680
this is the best shot
I'll ever have.

552
01:15:54,823 --> 01:15:55,882
And them?

553
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:59,439
They are looking for hope.

554
01:16:00,498 --> 01:16:01,515
What about you?

555
01:16:07,179 --> 01:16:08,617
Redemption.

556
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,383
Hey. What's that?

557
01:17:06,951 --> 01:17:09,429
I remember something like that.

558
01:17:21,481 --> 01:17:22,703
Help me!

559
01:17:25,852 --> 01:17:27,303
HELP ME!!!!

560
01:17:31,221 --> 01:17:32,363
Please, help me!

561
01:17:32,616 --> 01:17:33,707
Please!

562
01:17:34,344 --> 01:17:35,691
That's bait.

563
01:17:37,216 --> 01:17:38,424
Stay in the Rig.

564
01:17:43,853 --> 01:17:46,586
Hurry! Please, hurry up!
They will be back!

565
01:17:48,089 --> 01:17:50,131
I'm one of the Vuvalini!

566
01:17:51,561 --> 01:17:53,184
From the Many Mothers!

567
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,834
My initiate mother was Katie Concannon!

568
01:17:59,223 --> 01:18:01,631
I am the daughter of Mary Jo Bassa.

569
01:18:03,223 --> 01:18:05,569
My clan was Swaddle Dog!

570
01:18:52,992 --> 01:18:54,232
It's me.

571
01:19:02,392 --> 01:19:04,188
There's something in the eyes.

572
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,516
Perhaps she is Jo Bassa's child.

573
01:19:11,939 --> 01:19:13,688
This is our Furiosa.

574
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,595
How long has it been?

575
01:19:19,299 --> 01:19:20,526
Seven thousand days.

576
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:23,068
Plus the ones I don't remember.

577
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:25,830
Furiosa.

578
01:19:27,154 --> 01:19:28,775
What happened to your mother?

579
01:19:30,321 --> 01:19:31,540
She died.

580
01:19:32,515 --> 01:19:33,883
On the 3rd day.

581
01:19:41,096 --> 01:19:42,195
From where did you come?

582
01:19:42,765 --> 01:19:46,437
The West. Citadel.
Beyond the mountains.

583
01:19:50,936 --> 01:19:52,751
The men. Who are they?

584
01:19:53,137 --> 01:19:54,470
They're reliable.

585
01:19:54,853 --> 01:19:56,342
They helped us get here.

586
01:20:08,499 --> 01:20:10,447
Where did you find
such creatures?

587
01:20:13,218 --> 01:20:14,218
So soft.

588
01:20:15,154 --> 01:20:17,419
This one has all her teeth!

589
01:20:25,751 --> 01:20:27,563
I can't wait for them to see it.

590
01:20:28,505 --> 01:20:29,528
See?

591
01:20:30,637 --> 01:20:31,827
See what?

592
01:20:32,502 --> 01:20:33,502
Home.

593
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:38,883
The Green Place.

594
01:20:39,136 --> 01:20:41,275
But if you came from the West...

595
01:20:42,368 --> 01:20:43,881
you passed it.

596
01:20:45,384 --> 01:20:46,626
The crows.

597
01:20:47,013 --> 01:20:49,332
The creepy place with all the crows.

598
01:20:50,662 --> 01:20:52,043
The soil. I We had to get out.

599
01:20:52,188 --> 01:20:54,075
We had no water. /
And water was filth.

600
01:20:54,215 --> 01:20:55,866
It was sour.

601
01:20:55,999 --> 01:20:57,412
Then the crows came.

602
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:59,379
We couldn't grow anything.

603
01:20:59,736 --> 01:21:01,007
Where are the others?

604
01:21:01,364 --> 01:21:02,364
What others?

605
01:21:02,412 --> 01:21:03,441
The Many Mothers.

606
01:21:03,969 --> 01:21:07,201
We're the only ones left.

607
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:06,947
Look.

608
01:22:10,228 --> 01:22:12,291
That's what you'd call a satellite.

609
01:22:13,209 --> 01:22:15,196
Miss Giddy told us about those.

610
01:22:15,843 --> 01:22:18,685
They used to bounce messages
across the Earth.

611
01:22:19,476 --> 01:22:23,647
Shows. Everyone in the old world
had a show.

612
01:22:26,076 --> 01:22:28,360
Do you think there's still
somebody out there?

613
01:22:29,455 --> 01:22:30,928
Sending shows?

614
01:22:31,509 --> 01:22:33,600
Who knows?

615
01:22:34,057 --> 01:22:35,830
Those are the Plains of Silence.

616
01:22:38,895 --> 01:22:43,178
Stay right where you are little Joey.
Kinda lost it's novelty out here.

617
01:22:43,403 --> 01:22:44,894
You having a baby?

618
01:22:45,954 --> 01:22:47,349
Warlord Junior.

619
01:22:47,842 --> 01:22:48,887
Gonna be so ugly.

620
01:22:49,651 --> 01:22:51,078
It could be a girl.

621
01:22:52,868 --> 01:22:54,458
You killed people with that do ya?

622
01:22:54,983 --> 01:22:56,834
Killed everyone I met out here.

623
01:22:57,182 --> 01:22:59,445
Headshots. All. Snap!
Right in the medulla.

624
01:22:59,673 --> 01:23:01,638
I thought you girls were above all that.

625
01:23:06,007 --> 01:23:07,283
Come here.

626
01:23:15,285 --> 01:23:16,286
Take a peek in.

627
01:23:17,307 --> 01:23:18,348
Seeds!

628
01:23:19,425 --> 01:23:20,872
These are from home.

629
01:23:20,937 --> 01:23:23,228
Heirlooms. The real thing!

630
01:23:23,806 --> 01:23:25,662
I plant one every chance I get.

631
01:23:26,193 --> 01:23:27,193
Where?

632
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:30,135
So far nothings took.
Earth's too sour.

633
01:23:30,726 --> 01:23:32,348
Ohh so many different kinds.

634
01:23:32,722 --> 01:23:34,490
Trees, flowers, fruit.

635
01:23:35,745 --> 01:23:37,713
Back then everyone had their fill!

636
01:23:38,387 --> 01:23:40,726
Back then, there was no
need to snap anybody!

637
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:58,159
Can I talk to you?

638
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,173
I've talked with the others.

639
01:24:26,169 --> 01:24:29,289
We're never going to have a better chance
to make it across the salt.

640
01:24:31,539 --> 01:24:35,632
If we leave the rig here, and load the
motorcycles up with as much as we can...

641
01:24:35,773 --> 01:24:38,081
we can be able to ride for 160 days.

642
01:24:41,135 --> 01:24:42,906
One of those bikes is yours.

643
01:24:44,137 --> 01:24:45,348
Fully loaded.

644
01:24:48,113 --> 01:24:50,622
You're more than welcome to come with us.

645
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,457
N..No, I make my own way.

646
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:04,894
You know, hope is a mistake.

647
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:14,863
If you can't fix what's broken, you'll...

648
01:25:17,512 --> 01:25:18,987
You'll go insane.

649
01:25:35,484 --> 01:25:36,793
Where are you, Max?

650
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:40,100
Where are you?

651
01:25:41,884 --> 01:25:43,822
Help us.
You promised to help us.

652
01:25:54,353 --> 01:25:56,453
Come on Pa! Let's go!

653
01:26:28,661 --> 01:26:29,661
Alright.

654
01:26:30,781 --> 01:26:32,960
THIS, is your way home.

655
01:26:36,563 --> 01:26:37,642
We go back?

656
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:41,602
Back? I Yeah.

657
01:26:41,997 --> 01:26:43,628
I thought you weren't insane anymore.

658
01:26:43,717 --> 01:26:45,062
What are they saying?

659
01:26:45,247 --> 01:26:47,499
He wants to go back from where they came.

660
01:26:47,767 --> 01:26:48,767
The Citadel.

661
01:26:49,818 --> 01:26:51,327
What's there to find at the Citadel??

662
01:26:51,816 --> 01:26:52,956
Green.

663
01:26:53,487 --> 01:26:54,800
And water!

664
01:26:56,221 --> 01:26:59,847
There is a ridiculous amounts of
clear water. And a lot of crops.

665
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:02,052
It's got everything you need.
As long as you're not afraid of heights.

666
01:27:02,626 --> 01:27:03,933
Where does the water come from?

667
01:27:03,979 --> 01:27:05,659
He pumps it out from deep under the earth.

668
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:07,976
Calls it 'Aqua Cola',
and claims it all for himself.

669
01:27:08,368 --> 01:27:10,550
And because he owns it,
he owns all of us.

670
01:27:10,651 --> 01:27:11,844
I don't like him already.

671
01:27:11,997 --> 01:27:14,384
It'll take two weeks just to
scale a wall of mountains.

672
01:27:14,763 --> 01:27:15,763
No.

673
01:27:15,822 --> 01:27:18,341
I suggest we go back the same way we came.

674
01:27:20,223 --> 01:27:21,556
Through the canyon.

675
01:27:22,972 --> 01:27:26,675
It's open. We know that. Right?
He brought all his war parties through!

676
01:27:27,212 --> 01:27:30,639
So, we take the War Rig and we charge
it right through the middle of 'em.

677
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:33,275
We can decouple the tank at the pass...

678
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,126
shut it off behind us.

679
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,416
Ka-Boom!!

680
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:41,873
And how exactly do we take the Citadel?

681
01:27:42,539 --> 01:27:44,190
Assuming we're still alive by then?

682
01:27:44,596 --> 01:27:47,108
If we can block the pass,
it'll be easy.

683
01:27:47,415 --> 01:27:50,911
All that's left are his War Pups,
and War Boys too sick to fight.

684
01:27:51,865 --> 01:27:53,493
And we'll be with Nux.

685
01:27:54,225 --> 01:27:55,348
He's a War Boy.

686
01:27:55,396 --> 01:27:56,436
He'll be bringing us home.

687
01:27:56,675 --> 01:27:58,515
Bringing back what's
stolen, as he's meant to.

688
01:28:01,896 --> 01:28:02,896
Yeah.

689
01:28:03,752 --> 01:28:05,395
Feels like hope.

690
01:28:06,769 --> 01:28:09,656
I like this plan.
We can start again!

691
01:28:10,465 --> 01:28:11,976
Just like the old days!

692
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:14,863
Look.

693
01:28:15,578 --> 01:28:17,428
It will be a hard day.

694
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:20,787
But I guarantee you 160
days riding that way...

695
01:28:23,283 --> 01:28:25,139
there's nothing but salt.

696
01:28:27,738 --> 01:28:30,443
At least that way, y'know
we might be able to...

697
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:34,218
together...

698
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:36,915
come across some kind of redemption.

699
01:29:07,677 --> 01:29:08,758
War Rig!

700
01:29:09,461 --> 01:29:11,068
It's the War Rig!

701
01:29:21,309 --> 01:29:22,309
That's them.

702
01:29:22,676 --> 01:29:23,962
Why're they going back?

703
01:29:24,521 --> 01:29:26,013
Do they wish to surrender?

704
01:29:27,081 --> 01:29:28,321
They're heading for the canyon.

705
01:29:30,204 --> 01:29:33,017
They're going back, to the Citadel!!!

706
01:29:33,607 --> 01:29:35,019
They know it's undefended!!

707
01:29:35,048 --> 01:29:36,265
Bollocks!

708
01:29:39,453 --> 01:29:41,224
What are you doing? I Praying.

709
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:15,474
To whom?

710
01:30:15,559 --> 01:30:17,025
Anyone that's listening.

711
01:30:41,221 --> 01:30:42,637
Here we go girls!

712
01:30:45,316 --> 01:30:46,333
That's mine!!

713
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:53,083
They'll try to get in front of us!
Spike our wheels!!

714
01:31:00,174 --> 01:31:01,174
Don't blow my engines!

715
01:31:01,675 --> 01:31:02,915
Gonna nudge 'em. Just a little.

716
01:30:43,943 --> 01:30:46,762
You filth!! You traitored him?!

717
01:31:43,911 --> 01:31:44,911
Go.

718
01:32:11,174 --> 01:32:13,964
Gotta back off! Engine one is gone!

719
01:32:14,099 --> 01:32:15,177
Two's about to blow!

720
01:32:15,453 --> 01:32:16,453
Great!

721
01:32:17,053 --> 01:32:18,069
Are you a Black Thumb?

722
01:32:19,032 --> 01:32:20,473
Alright, engine one. Now!

723
01:32:20,638 --> 01:32:22,146
You and me. 5th wheel.

724
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:23,959
We'll unhook the tank.

725
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:38,181
One man, one bullet.

726
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:56,704
I can't see. I Maadi.

727
01:32:56,898 --> 01:32:58,039
I can't see.

728
01:33:37,597 --> 01:33:38,597
Hey!

729
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:40,420
They've got spears and plows!

730
01:33:40,868 --> 01:33:42,095
They're holding us back!

731
01:33:53,145 --> 01:33:55,496
Leave three bolts. Three.

732
01:35:13,396 --> 01:35:14,473
Hey, you!

733
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:31,777
Are you okay?!

734
01:35:34,721 --> 01:35:36,109
I think she's hurt!

735
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:01,020
Hey!

736
01:36:27,135 --> 01:36:28,135
NO!!!

737
01:36:38,058 --> 01:36:40,424
Hey! Stay with me!

738
01:36:41,131 --> 01:36:42,661
<i>Stay with me. </i> / Stay with me!

739
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,316
Hey! Are you there?

740
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,570
VALHALLA!!!!!

741
01:38:31,421 --> 01:38:32,421
Hey!

742
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:01,268
Engine one's good.

743
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:02,770
For now.

744
01:39:51,177 --> 01:39:53,776
She's hurt!!!
She's hurt real bad!!

745
01:41:23,587 --> 01:41:24,732
Do you hear that?

746
01:41:25,828 --> 01:41:27,266
We're gonna see two airborne V8s!

747
01:41:29,044 --> 01:41:30,372
I'm gonna need you to drive.

748
01:41:32,933 --> 01:41:34,388
I'll get him out of our way.

749
01:42:41,596 --> 01:42:42,661
Rictus!

750
01:42:43,559 --> 01:42:44,836
Take me!

751
01:42:58,377 --> 01:42:59,749
Cheedo! What are you doing?

752
01:42:59,939 --> 01:43:01,014
Good girl.

753
01:43:05,262 --> 01:43:06,263
Come here! I NO!!!!

754
01:43:11,429 --> 01:43:12,429
Big Boy.

755
01:43:18,856 --> 01:43:20,440
Here! Here!!

756
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:15,466
Remember me?!!

757
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,040
He's dead!

758
01:44:38,809 --> 01:44:39,859
He's dead!

759
01:44:58,734 --> 01:45:01,881
When you're across safe, I'll
jam the throttle and follow you!

760
01:45:02,545 --> 01:45:03,545
Come on!

761
01:45:04,841 --> 01:45:07,315
Hurry! We're nearly at the pass.

762
01:45:54,892 --> 01:45:56,439
W I t n e s s M e!!

763
01:46:02,996 --> 01:46:04,078
Rictus!

764
01:46:59,641 --> 01:47:01,184
Why's she making that noise?

765
01:47:01,636 --> 01:47:03,542
She's pumping air into her chest cavity.

766
01:47:04,044 --> 01:47:05,431
She's collapsing her lungs...

767
01:47:05,817 --> 01:47:07,535
one breath at a time.

768
01:47:13,465 --> 01:47:14,465
I know.

769
01:47:17,578 --> 01:47:18,864
I'm so sorry!

770
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:22,928
I know. I know!

771
01:47:24,227 --> 01:47:25,530
Hold.

772
01:47:26,378 --> 01:47:27,486
Okay.

773
01:47:27,916 --> 01:47:30,277
Put there. Press firmly.

774
01:47:30,664 --> 01:47:31,664
Hey!

775
01:47:32,170 --> 01:47:32,917
Hey!!

776
01:47:08,714 --> 01:47:09,755
Home!

777
01:47:47,722 --> 01:47:49,887
No. No! No, no! No!!

778
01:47:50,170 --> 01:47:51,916
She's exsanguinated.

779
01:47:51,917 --> 01:47:52,917
Drained all her blood!!

780
01:47:21,457 --> 01:47:22,457
Hold this.

781
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:26,430
Needle.

782
01:48:00,493 --> 01:48:01,493
Come on!

783
01:48:02,807 --> 01:48:03,807
Take this!

784
01:48:06,537 --> 01:48:07,552
Keep her awake.

785
01:48:08,271 --> 01:48:09,494
Furiosa!!

786
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:15,331
Okay!

787
01:48:16,125 --> 01:48:17,125
That's it.

788
01:48:18,153 --> 01:48:19,883
Hold it up!

789
01:48:21,746 --> 01:48:22,746
Okay.

790
01:48:23,261 --> 01:48:24,261
Sorry.

791
01:48:26,391 --> 01:48:28,557
There you go. Okay!

792
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:42,432
Max.

793
01:48:43,632 --> 01:48:45,250
My name is Max!

794
01:48:54,123 --> 01:48:55,599
That's my name.

795
01:49:37,445 --> 01:49:38,445
Brake!

796
01:49:44,114 --> 01:49:45,114
Reveal yourself!

797
01:50:04,287 --> 01:50:05,496
He's got something.

798
01:50:12,816 --> 01:50:13,817
It's Immortan Joe!

799
01:50:13,921 --> 01:50:15,763
IMMORTAN JOE IS DEAD!!!

800
01:50:43,323 --> 01:50:44,323
Furiosa!

801
01:50:44,673 --> 01:50:45,751
Furiosa!

802
01:50:49,565 --> 01:50:50,626
Furiosa!

803
01:50:51,155 --> 01:50:52,420
She's back!

804
01:50:52,927 --> 01:50:55,437
Let them up!!

805
01:50:55,534 --> 01:50:59,296
Let them up!!!

806
01:51:02,602 --> 01:51:03,734
Let them up!!!!

807
01:51:03,839 --> 01:51:05,498
LET THEM UP!!!!!

808
01:52:54,238 --> 01:52:55,787
'Where must we go...

809
01:52:56,111 --> 01:53:01,989
we who wander this wasteland
in search of our better selves?'

810
01:53:02,013 --> 01:53:05,990
The First History Man.
