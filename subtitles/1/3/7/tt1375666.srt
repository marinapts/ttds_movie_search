Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.

310
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:23,820
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself, if you know what I mean.

311
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,958
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.

Genuine inspiration, right?

00:26:28,561 --> 00:26:31,894
Now, in a dream,
our mind continuously does this.

314
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:36,695
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

315
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:40,270
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.

316
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,170
That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.

317
00:26:43,343 --> 00:26:45,709
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.

In a dream, you can cheat architecture

And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.

Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

...his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.

Were you going under on your own?

No, no, I was just, uh, running
some experiments.

An elegant solution

- No, it was, uh...

It was Mal's, actually. This...

639
00:48:44,996 --> 00:48:48,762
This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.

How are the mazes coming along?

643

Each level relates to the part

No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

Why is that so important?

In case one of us brings in
our projections.

650

We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

You mean in case you bring Mal in.

You can't keep her out, can you?

- Right.

then she knows it.

Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.

- No. No, they don't.

You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

658
00:49:43,922 --> 00:49:45,856
No one said it's getting worse.

That's all I care about right now.

Why can't you go home?

661
00:49:56,401 --> 00:49:58,426
Because they think I killed her.

662
00:50:01,673 --> 00:50:03,937
- Thank you.
- For what?

663
00:50:04,142 --> 00:50:06,406
For not asking whether I did.

664
00:50:06,578 --> 00:50:08,739
"I will split up my father's empire."

665
00:50:08,913 --> 00:50:13,111
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

666
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:16,082
...which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

667
00:50:16,254 --> 00:50:19,781
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

668
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:23,724
We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.

00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,329
How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?

670
00:50:26,498 --> 00:50:30,093
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...

671
00:50:30,268 --> 00:50:32,998
...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?

672
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:36,766
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

673
00:50:36,941 --> 00:50:40,399
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

674
00:50:40,812 --> 00:50:44,509
We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

675
00:50:44,682 --> 00:50:48,448
We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this.

676
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,451
All right, well, try this. Um...

677
00:50:50,622 --> 00:50:55,355
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps."

678
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,818
That might work.

679
00:50:56,995 --> 00:51:00,158
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might."

his relationship with his father...

...and say, "I will not follow
in my father's footsteps."

687
00:51:20,552 --> 00:51:25,216
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."

688
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:28,723
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

we just raise the stakes.

Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

That means each and every one of us

No, he never gave me any combination.

She just wouldn't admit it.

She was possessed by an idea.

This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

...that in order to get back home...

- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...

1074
01:18:23,212 --> 01:18:26,204
...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

01:18:26,382 --> 01:18:28,077
I'm their mother!
Calm down.

there was nothing I could do...

She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

I wait for Yusuf's kick.

- His music warns me.

1304
01:33:38,794 --> 01:33:42,730
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1305
01:33:42,898 --> 01:33:46,095
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

1707
02:15:59,065 --> 02:16:00,089
[SCOFFS]

1708
02:16:00,266 --> 02:16:02,029
Impossible.

1709
02:16:02,568 --> 02:16:05,162
We were young men together.

1710
02:16:06,773 --> 02:16:09,105
I'm an old man.

1711
02:16:10,343 --> 02:16:12,402
Filled with regret.

1712
02:16:15,548 --> 02:16:18,244
Waiting to die alone.

1713
02:16:21,421 --> 02:16:23,582
I've come back for you.

1714
02:16:26,859 --> 02:16:30,727
To remind you of something.

1715
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,366
Something you once knew.

1716
02:16:39,238 --> 02:16:41,468
That this world is not real.

1717
02:16:46,379 --> 02:16:50,873
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

1718
02:16:51,717 --> 02:16:54,481
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1719
02:17:00,593 --> 02:17:01,924
Come back...

1720
02:17:04,464 --> 02:17:07,831
...so we can be
young men together again.

1721
02:17:11,604 --> 02:17:13,572
Come back with me.

1722
02:17:16,676 --> 02:17:18,109
Come back.

1723
02:17:27,854 --> 02:17:29,549
Hot towel, sir?

1724
02:17:30,189 --> 02:17:33,056
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

1725
02:17:33,226 --> 02:17:35,524
Do you need immigration forms?

1726
02:17:37,630 --> 02:17:38,961
Thank you.

1727
02:17:39,432 --> 02:17:41,059
Hot towel, sir?

1728
02:17:42,068 --> 02:17:45,060
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

1729
02:18:56,442 --> 02:18:57,500
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1730
02:18:58,644 --> 02:19:00,271
Thank you, sir.

1731
02:19:44,323 --> 02:19:45,688
Welcome.

1732
02:19:46,158 --> 02:19:47,557
This way.

1733
02:20:08,748 --> 02:20:12,206
James? Phillipa?

1734
02:20:15,955 --> 02:20:17,217
Look who's here.

1735
02:20:22,828 --> 02:20:23,886
Hey.

1736
02:20:24,997 --> 02:20:27,693
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
Daddy! Daddy!

1737
02:20:27,867 --> 02:20:30,131
Daddy!
How are you?

1738
02:20:31,237 --> 02:20:32,829
Look what I've been building!

1739
02:20:33,005 --> 02:20:36,702
- What are you building?
We're building a house on the cliff!

1740
02:20:36,876 --> 02:20:39,743
On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

1741
02:20:39,912 --> 02:20:42,472
Let's go.
Come on, Daddy!

1742
02:28:04,757 --> 02:28:06,748
