1
00:00:0,173 --> 00:00:7,233


2
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:32,945
Those who've finished drinking, return your...

3
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:34,350
...empty cartons to the correct number and sit back down.

4
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:44,958
Our school has been selected from ten thousand candidates...

5
00:00:46,302 --> 00:00:50,398
...all across the country to promote milk for middle schoolers.

6
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:57,837
You're currently approaching your second growth period.

7
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:02,948
The calcium in milk not only strengthens your bones,

8
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:05,553
but also nurtures your brains.

9
00:01:14,363 --> 00:01:19,460
These are porn movies I confiscated from Kamiyama last month.

10
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,361
He digitally removed the mosaic on them at Watanabe's house,

11
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:27,407
and planned on giving them to all the boys in the class.

12
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:34,543
I'm sure you know that your bodies and hearts are about to...

13
00:01:34,683 --> 00:01:35,911
(You're kidding me! You kissed him!?)

14
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:37,916
...go through an immense period of growth known as puberty.

15
00:01:39,888 --> 00:01:45,087
I don't know how effective milk will be on thirteen year old bodies and minds.

16
00:01:46,428 --> 00:01:50,865
But I'm sure we'll see some changes in you come the March health checkups.

17
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,734
Though I'll be gone by then.

18
00:01:57,106 --> 00:02:01,566
I've had enough, so this will be my last month as a teacher.

19
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,177
You gotta be kidding!

20
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:05,542
Awesome!

21
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:15,447
(25th March
End of term ceremony for Year One Class B)

22
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:20,722
I don't really know whether I've been a good teacher.

23
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:30,805
Stop messing around! The teacher's trying to say something!

24
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:37,206
Thank you, Hoshino.

25
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:43,446
Do any of you know a teacher called Masayoshi Sakuramiya?

26
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:44,643
Yeah!

27
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:47,017
He's the super-teacher that wrote this book, right?

28
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:48,817
He's totally awesome.

29
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:51,016
He's a truly passionate teacher who has published books,

30
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,560
and has appeared on television.

31
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:57,762
Originally he was a total deadbeat, right? He dropped out...

32
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,266
...of school and travelled the world before becoming a teacher.

33
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:01,266
That's right.

34
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:04,099
Last year he was told he only had a few months left to live.

35
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,799
Yet he wasn't discouraged, and continued to put his...

36
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:09,570
...all into his classes until the very last.

37
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:16,108
He taught at...

38
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:18,742
...the first school I ever worked at.

39
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:20,149
Seriously!?

40
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:23,622
The weak will always hurt those weaker than them.

41
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,957
Are the only choices available to bear it or die?

42
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,426
No, the world you live in is not so limited.

43
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:34,559
If you're stuck in a difficult situation,

44
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:37,467
it's okay to retreat to somewhere safer.

45
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:38,737
Retreat, huh?

46
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:40,808
Guess we better had then!

47
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:43,969
I'm outta here!

48
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:50,650
Already taking Mr. Sakuramiya's words to heart.

49
00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:52,617
Truly, the man is a genius.

50
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:54,119
Well, I suppose it hardly matters.

51
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:57,455
Compared to Mr. Sakuramiya,

52
00:03:57,593 --> 00:04:00,687
I might never have been much of a teacher.

53
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:04,532
But there were two rules I chose to work by.

54
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,827
One: Address the students politely.

55
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:09,938
Two: Do my best to place myself on the same level as them.

56
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:11,801
Speak with them as I'd like to be spoken to.

57
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,036
Be frank with them as if we were friends, talking to them about anything they wanted.

58
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:19,807
I think I must have been quietly influenced...

59
00:04:19,948 --> 00:04:22,781
...by drama characters who spoke in such ways.

60
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:25,414
I'm sorry, Nagaguchi.

61
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:26,452
Even though you sent me late night e-mails,

62
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:29,386
telling me you wanted to lose weight, or that you wanted to die,

63
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:32,517
I could never answer you kindly.

64
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:37,155
Because frankly I never completely trusted what any of you told me.

65
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:39,665
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

66
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:42,637
I remember a certain event.

67
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:50,336
A girl wrote to a young male teacher saying she was in love with him.

68
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,343
I remember this!

69
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,382
That she'd kill herself if he didn't meet her. He panicked and agreed to meet her at a love hotel.

70
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:57,246
The girl waited there, and got a photo of him.

71
00:04:57,386 --> 00:05:02,414
Then she showed it to her parents, who stormed into the school.

72
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:04,620
Ridiculous...

73
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,958
It was just a stupid prank by a girl who was angry for being scolded.

74
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:12,032
The teacher was a fool to trust her.

75
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,068
So you don't believe us about anything!?

76
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:19,269
It's just because students...because all of you...are so good at lying.

77
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:21,899
(I'm waiting up on the roof.)

78
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:27,507
Miss, I'm feeling ill. Can I go to the nurse?

79
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:28,980
Go ahead.

80
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,251
Anyway, after that, if I was called out by a student of the opposite gender,

81
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,551
even one of my own, I'd get a male teacher from...

82
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:41,993
...another class to go instead.

83
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:45,456
Just as whenever one of the boys in this class...

84
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:48,434
...asked to meet me, I'd send Mr. Tokura from Class A.

85
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,970
I feel that's deeply irresponsible as our teacher.

86
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:52,596
Oh you do, do you?

87
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:55,403
I see. I suppose you can look at it that way.

88
00:05:55,544 --> 00:06:00,607
Spending your every moment thinking about marrying a Johnny's Jr.

89
00:06:00,749 --> 00:06:03,240
you can become quite self-absorbed, and completely wrapped up in your own little worlds.

90
00:06:03,385 --> 00:06:08,846
It's easy to forget what it means simply to live.

91
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:14,452
I'm going to make sure none of you ever use words like 'I want to die' so lightly again.

92
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:18,528
I'm going to give you one final, very important lesson.

93
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:25,199
(Life)

94
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:39,148
As you know, I'm a single mother.

95
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:45,218
I had intended to marry the father of my daughter Manami.

96
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,194
We were both teachers, but he was someone I really looked up to.

97
00:06:49,865 --> 00:06:53,426
Shortly before we were due to be married, I became pregnant.

98
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:58,665
And he was diagnosed with HIV during a physical examination.

99
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:02,937
HIV. A virus which destroys the immune system.

100
00:07:03,078 --> 00:07:05,774
The virus which causes AIDS.

101
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:10,880
He contracted it as a relief worker abroad.

102
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:13,078
It's okay, you can breathe.

103
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:15,416
It doesn't pass through the air.

104
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:17,650
It also won't pass through handshakes, sneezes,

105
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:21,729
baths, or swimming pools.

106
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:26,734
Even if you're close to someone infected regularly, it doesn't pose problems.

107
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:29,428
So I'm not even infected to begin with.

108
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:35,570
HIV isn't guaranteed to pass via sex.

109
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:40,239
Though I myself couldn't believe I wasn't infected, and demanded a re-evaluation.

110
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:44,983
In the end, I gave birth to my child, but didn't marry.

111
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:49,017
That was the decision I took.

112
00:07:49,157 --> 00:07:50,647
Why didn't you marry him?

113
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:53,454
Even though the child wasn't infected,

114
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:55,563
her father was. And if that became...

115
00:07:55,697 --> 00:07:57,324
public knowledge, she'd face discrimination.

116
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:58,763
Who cares what people think!

117
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,530
The specter of his illness would hang over her even after he had passed.

118
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:09,508
It would only make her suffer. That was his judgement, and I agreed.

119
00:08:09,644 --> 00:08:11,202
That's so cruel on the kid!

120
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:17,310
It would've been crueler to do otherwise.

121
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:29,328
Even though he wanted to hold Manami more than anyone, he couldn't...

122
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,136
As hard as it was for me, I think it was a hundred times harder for him.

123
00:08:37,939 --> 00:08:41,773
I gave Manami every bit of love I had.

124
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:47,274
When she turned one, I went back to work.

125
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:49,951
Until she was six, she'd wait for me at the local nursery.

126
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:57,582
And after that, I entrusted her to a Ms. Takenaka I met via a volunteer center.

127
00:08:57,726 --> 00:09:00,593
She took care of a dog called Shaggy.

128
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:03,454
Manami really loved that dog,

129
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:07,932
so she put her in charge of feeding it.

130
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:12,899
At the start of this year, Takenaka was hospitalised.

131
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,374
Every day I finished work by the time she finished nursery.

132
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:18,979
Except on Wednesdays, when there were staff meetings.

133
00:09:19,114 --> 00:09:21,309
Then I'd go and meet her early, and have her...

134
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:25,852
wait until the meeting was over in the school infirmary.

135
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:42,436
Manami really loved a character called Cotton Bunny.

136
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:50,607
Her bag, her handkerchief, her tissues, her shoes...

137
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,173
Hey, Shimomura, you remember this pouch, right?

138
00:09:56,318 --> 00:10:00,311
Buy it for me Mommy!

139
00:10:00,455 --> 00:10:02,753
I already bought this one for you.

140
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:06,418
Why don't you just buy her it? It's only a pouch.

141
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:10,320
Thinking about it now, you were probably right.

142
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,261
Because in the end...

143
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:15,527
Manami?

144
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:21,970
Manami! Manami!

145
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:26,674
...it was the last thing Manami ever asked me to do for her.

146
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:34,015
Miss!

147
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:38,023
On the 13th of February...

148
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:38,818
Miss!

149
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,557
...the police determined that she had slipped into the pool, and drowned.

150
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,134
There were bread crumbs beside Shaggy,

151
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:53,367
and it was the same bread Manami was given at the nursery.

152
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:59,106
Manami had secretly been walking past the pool every week.

153
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:02,205
To give Shaggy food.

154
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:04,545
She's crying!

155
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:07,348
Aww, baby wants to cry!

156
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:09,081
Manami is gone.

157
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:18,933
I'll never touch her small hands again.

158
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:21,763
My hands will never again be able to feel her tiny cheeks...

159
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:25,663
Her soft hair...

160
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:28,904
Manami's death...

161
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:34,414
...was probably my fault. I failed as her guardian.

162
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:36,280
But...

163
00:11:37,752 --> 00:11:40,414
I wasn't going to let it end like that.

164
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,483
Manami died.

165
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:49,759
But it was no accident.

166
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:56,633
She was killed by students from this class.

167
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:12,543
(Moriguchi's going crazy!)

168
00:12:22,998 --> 00:12:25,728
What is it that protects you?

169
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:29,737
Your parents? Weapons?

170
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:35,140
No, your strongest ally is...

171
00:12:35,777 --> 00:12:39,577
Juvenile law.

172
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:43,879
Under Article 41 of the penal code, those under fourteen years of age...

173
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:45,850
are not liable for their crimes.

174
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:49,923
And cannot be punished for them. Isn't that lovely?

175
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,084
There was a thirteen year old girl just the same as you.

176
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:55,787
She mixed all sorts of drugs into her family's food,

177
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,127
calling it a holy rite, and recorded the results...

178
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:02,327
in detail on an internet blog.

179
00:13:02,804 --> 00:13:03,736
The Lunacy Incident?

180
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:05,772
That's right. The Lunacy Incident.

181
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:08,632
That was the name she used on her blog,

182
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:12,679
so the press gave it that name and turned it into a big scare story.

183
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:18,751
In the end, they never found a reason for...

184
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:21,914
...her to brutally murder her whole family.

185
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:25,356
But because of that, all sorts of foolish rumours began to spring up...

186
00:13:25,493 --> 00:13:29,520
...and she even won admirers among people her age.

187
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,133
(Tell us who we need to punish!)

188
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,637
The only one who received a harsh punishment...

189
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:42,937
...was the teacher who told her specific details about various medicines.

190
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:47,411
All she had to do was write a few remorseful words in a...

191
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:50,040
...juvenile detention center and she was pronounced rehabilitated.

192
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:53,581
Even if you kill someone, you're not going to be punished for it.

193
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:55,951
(Exactly. That's why I did it!)

194
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:57,991
And there's no way for us to stop these crimes...

195
00:13:58,126 --> 00:14:01,391
For us to stop child murderers.

196
00:14:01,996 --> 00:14:06,160
If you felt like it, you could kill someone with a baseball bat...

197
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:08,428
...or a nice long kitchen knife...

198
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,629
...or a medicine ball from P.E...

199
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:12,740
...or even with your bare hands!

200
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:16,434
And there'd be nobody to stop you.

201
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,136
That hurts...

202
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,541
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:20,181 --> 00:14:22,342
Hurry up, hurry up!

204
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:27,783
Guess even you wanted to find out who the culprits are, huh?

205
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:33,489
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I have no intention of telling you their names.

206
00:14:33,628 --> 00:14:36,290
The hell!? That's not fair!

207
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,227
Masami's father was Masayoshi Sakuramiya.

208
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:49,800
The reason that we had a special sort of funeral at our house...

209
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:54,677
...was because he wanted to finally hold Manami before she was gone.

210
00:14:55,817 --> 00:14:58,980
The first time Manami was held by her father...

211
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,112
...her soul had already departed.

212
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,393
He confessed to me that his condition had worsened into AIDS.

213
00:15:08,463 --> 00:15:11,762
But in the few months of life he had left...

214
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:15,459
...I couldn't bring myself to say anything to him.

215
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:20,098
I believe that along with Manami,

216
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:25,474
something important inside me died too.

217
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,016
Last week, I went to visit Ms. Takenaka, who had retired.

218
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:39,593
She gave me a box of Manami's things I had left with her.

219
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:43,163
And this was in the box.

220
00:15:43,298 --> 00:15:47,064
The pouch I had never bought her, 

221
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:49,469
Where did it come from?

222
00:15:49,604 --> 00:15:53,404
Ms. Takenaka said she found it near Shaggy's kennel.

223
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,168
Shaggy...

224
00:15:58,112 --> 00:16:01,047
The students sometimes drop their things here...

225
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:06,547
...while they play catch and clean the pool...

226
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:14,090
I remember it dawning on me that the only punishments children...

227
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:19,223
...ever have to deal with are a few extra laps, or having to clean the pool...

228
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:23,630
Don't be stupid! It's not me.

229
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:25,671
(I know who it is!)

230
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:32,706
Was Minami really alone at the pool that day?

231
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:40,581
There are two students responsible.

232
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:57,864
I'll refer to them as 'A' and 'B'.

233
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:17,488
'A' is a straight As student. Looking at him, you wouldn't expect him to have any problems at all.

234
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:23,152
But...there are some fairly unsettling rumours you hear from time to time...

235
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:26,529
Since he was in junour school, he's been picking up stray cats and dogs...

236
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:29,068
...and taking them home to kill with his Execution Machine.

237
00:17:29,203 --> 00:17:31,137
Execution Machine?

238
00:17:31,272 --> 00:17:34,173
Some sort of weird tool he made himself.

239
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:38,040
He puts photos of the animals he kills with it on his site.

(A new machine is currently in development. Be prepared!)

242
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:47,243
I checked out A by calling his junior school teacher,

243
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:50,357
but was told there had been no problems with him at all.

244
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,950
Just as I was about to give up on him...

245
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:55,323
So what do you teach, Miss?

246
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:57,431
...'A' came to my office.

247
00:17:57,565 --> 00:17:59,055
Science.

248
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:01,225
Lights and stuff?

249
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,466
If you want to know about that, shouldn't you just ask your dad?

250
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,469
There's something good inside. Try opening it!

251
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,949
Awesome, huh?

252
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:27,694
So I'm a test subject, huh?

253
00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:31,964
Are you going to use this to torture animals?

254
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,330
No point in that.

255
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:41,172
Pop...

256
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:42,435
What?

257
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:44,978
Can't you hear that, Miss?

258
00:18:46,214 --> 00:18:49,706
It's the sound of something important to you disappearing...

Whatever. Just stamp here.

...and one full of perfectly played junior school sincerity...

266

They only made him seem more frightening.

Just tell me which one is better!

270
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,922
I consulted the Principal on the matter, but...

271
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:36,928
...he did little more than echo my concerns.

275

I asked 'A' about the truth behind Manami's death.

276
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,627
Just messin' with ya.

277
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:18,470
'A' told me the truth with a smile.

278
00:20:18,606 --> 00:20:20,198
He hardly seemed to care that the woman before him...

279
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:24,801
...was the mother of the girl he killed.

280

'A''s motive...

281
00:20:29,984 --> 00:20:32,475
Was pure naivety.

282
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:35,888
A desire to have the world notice him.

283
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:39,459
To be recognised as more talented than any of his peers.

284
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:44,860
But on the day that he got his wish and was published in the newspaper.

285
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:48,560
The world turned their eyes from him...

...to a certain girl of the same age.

They all just care about that Lunacy freak.

290

An overdose? Hah!

291
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:07,914
If I wanted to kill someone, I could make everything myself. Just like this.

292

I want to kill this little brat.

293
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:17,522
That was the only thought that ran through my head.

294
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:24,269
'B' had transferred to our school, and joined the P.E club, but...

295
00:21:24,405 --> 00:21:26,430
...it was all just athletics...

...and began attending a cram school.

301
00:21:40,388 --> 00:21:42,356
But his grades didn't get any better.

302
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:46,586
And though he worried, he was too lazy to do anything about it.

303
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:57,426
He holed up in the police station.

304
00:21:57,872 --> 00:22:00,432
He got a shock when the person who came to meet him...

...wasn't me, but Mr. Tokura.

It's not fair.

317
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,619
She kept saying it.

318
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:50,485

At the start of February, 'A' made contact with 'B'.

320
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,936
To recruit him to aid in a terrible plan.

321
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:15,611
Who would be good?

322
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:19,379
For what?

323
00:23:20,988 --> 00:23:23,650
Woah, is that the thing that won the contest?

324
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:27,022
I juiced it up a bit, so I want to test it on someone.

325
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:32,856
It doesn't really matter who. Though I did make it to zap bad guys.

326
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,168
Then I guess we'd better find some creep to test it on too.

327
00:23:35,302 --> 00:23:38,430
'B''s first suggestion was Mr. Tokura.

328
00:23:39,106 --> 00:23:41,700
'A' didn't respond.

329
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:45,473
So then 'B' put forward my name.

330
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:47,171
I hate that bitch.

331
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:52,377
One of her students is in trouble, and she sends another teacher to do her dirty work.

332
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,852
But I've already tested it on her.

333
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:58,356
'A' wasn't interested in that idea either.

334
00:23:58,693 --> 00:24:01,355
Then how about her daughter?

335
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:07,533
We'd be punishing a teacher for caring more about her daughter than her students.

336
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:13,738
'B' talked about how Manami came by the pool to feed the dog...

337
00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:19,039
...and how he saw her clamouring for the pouch...

338
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,149
...and it not being bought for her.

339
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:30,555
The target they chose...

340
00:24:30,691 --> 00:24:33,854
...was my daughter.

341
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:36,421
My young, defenseless daughter.

342
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:54,243
Your mommy wouldn't buy this for you, right?

343
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,210
Or has she given you one already?

344
00:24:58,753 --> 00:25:02,917
Right. She asked us to go and buy it for you.

345
00:25:03,057 --> 00:25:04,319
Mommy said that?

346
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:09,086
Here you go. A Valentine's Day present from your lovely mommy.

347
00:25:09,764 --> 00:25:11,163
Try opening it.

348
00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:13,425
There's chocolate inside.

349
00:25:38,793 --> 00:25:42,388
What the hell? T...this is bad!

350
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,554
She's dead.

351
00:25:43,697 --> 00:25:48,464
I killed her 'cause she was a little brat that wouldn't shut up.

352
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:52,436
If you tell them all that I did it, they'll let you off.

353
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:55,371
I told him that and headed home.

354
00:25:57,044 --> 00:25:59,569
But then that moron had to go and...

355
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:06,620
If it came out that the pouch had killed her...

356
00:26:07,054 --> 00:26:09,522
I thought I'd be guilty, so...

357
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:23,470
I thought if I made it look like she fell in the pool...

358
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:29,173
I wouldn't be found out.

359
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:55,531
That was the truth behind Manami's death.

360
00:27:10,918 --> 00:27:13,079
As the two of them said...

361
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,314
...the police determined that it was an accident.

362
00:27:16,457 --> 00:27:19,221
I have no intention of fighting that judgement.

363
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:27,256
It wasn't simply the pouch that killed her.

364
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,971
I took a look at it...

365
00:27:33,107 --> 00:27:35,075
...and even taking into account that she was only four...

366
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:39,942
...it can't deliver enough of a shock to stop someone's heart.

367
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:41,846
Want to give it a try?

368
00:27:44,518 --> 00:27:49,182
Manami had just fallen unconscious.

369
00:27:50,524 --> 00:27:53,459
There's no doubt in my mind that the true cause of her death...

370
00:27:53,594 --> 00:27:57,860
...was her drowning after 'B' threw her into the pool.

371
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,359
It's quite ironic.

372
00:28:01,502 --> 00:28:06,166
'A' had the guts to kill someone, but failed to do so.

373
00:28:06,607 --> 00:28:12,273
And 'B' didn't want to hurt anyone, but ended up killing Manami.

374
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,745
Even if I brought forth this evidence to the police, the two would...

375
00:28:14,882 --> 00:28:19,683
..be protected by juvenile law, and would suffer nothing more than being put into care.

376
00:28:20,187 --> 00:28:22,417
Essentially, they'd be viewed as innocent.

377
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,354
I've decided that that's simply not enough.

378
00:28:28,462 --> 00:28:33,764
It's a teacher's duty to reprimand her students when they've done wrong.

379
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:37,829
I intend to make the two of them realise the severity of their crimes...

380
00:28:37,972 --> 00:28:40,839
...and come to appreciate the importance of life.

381
00:28:41,775 --> 00:28:44,107
I want them to live, each day...

382
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:47,179
bearing the weight of their crimes.

383
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:53,947
I mixed a little something...

384
00:28:54,488 --> 00:28:59,289
...into the cartons of milk the two of them were drinking.

385
00:29:03,597 --> 00:29:08,557
The HIV-contaminated blood of Masayoshi Sakuramiya.

386
00:29:10,838 --> 00:29:12,135
Shit!

387
00:29:20,948 --> 00:29:22,438
Calm down!

388
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:27,218
You were good enough to drink it all up, too.

389
00:29:27,354 --> 00:29:28,685
Thank you.

390
00:29:28,822 --> 00:29:32,724
I hope you look forward to the three month wait on blood tests.

391
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,229
If the results come back positive, the incubation period is five to ten years.

392
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:41,232
Time enough, I think, to repent for your sins,

393
00:29:41,368 --> 00:29:43,734
and to realise the value of life.

394
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,652
Spring is a season when everything bursts into life.

395
00:30:05,793 --> 00:30:08,853
The flowers, the trees, the grass, the birds, and even people...

396
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:20,738
I wish you all a wonderful Spring holiday!

(Confession: Yuko Moriguchi)

398
00:30:23,544 --> 00:30:25,535
That's all I have to say.

399
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:15,158
Miss Moriguchi...

400
00:31:16,463 --> 00:31:18,954
...you wouldn't believe your eyes.

401
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:25,861
Seeing the sunny smiles on the faces of our class...

402
00:31:29,343 --> 00:31:32,744
...now that you've gone, and the new term is rolling in.

403
00:31:33,714 --> 00:31:35,409
(6th April
Start of term ceremony for Year Two Class B)

404
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:38,416
April didn't bring any changes to our class,

405
00:31:38,552 --> 00:31:41,077
but it did bring a new face during homeroom.

406
00:31:41,221 --> 00:31:42,779
Werther.

407
00:31:42,923 --> 00:31:45,255
That's what people have been calling me since my school days.

408
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:49,187
But it's 'Werther', not 'worrier'. You can count on me.

409
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:50,956
The awful jokes kept coming.

410
00:31:51,098 --> 00:31:52,463
Yukari.

411
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,968
Maki?
(And he acted all friendly with us, like he had known us forever.)

412
00:31:56,103 --> 00:31:59,561
Ayaka? And...Naoki?

413
00:32:00,474 --> 00:32:01,668
Oh, that's right, he caught a cold.

414
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:05,767
Everyone knew Nao wasn't absent because of some stupid cold.

415
00:32:05,913 --> 00:32:08,575
What surprised us more was that Shuuya...

416
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:13,011
...continued coming to school.

417
00:32:13,153 --> 00:32:16,919
I wasn't exactly what you'd call a serious student in school.

418
00:32:17,057 --> 00:32:22,085
But then I read a book that changed my life.

419
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:27,126
That had to be...

420
00:32:28,268 --> 00:32:30,896
...the worst joke of all.

421
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:35,908
"While wandering the world, I read the Bible.

422
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:40,779
And in it I discovered the true shape of education.

423
00:32:41,815 --> 00:32:44,511
'What man among you...

424
00:32:44,651 --> 00:32:46,949
...who has 100 sheep and loses one of them...

425
00:32:47,087 --> 00:32:50,113
...does not leave the 99 in the open field...

426
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:54,751
...and go after the lost one until he finds it?'"

427
00:32:54,895 --> 00:32:56,419
Teach, you're awesome!

428
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:04,400
I want to show you all how passionately I believe in these words!

429
00:33:05,005 --> 00:33:07,872
I think...everyone was just cowardly...

430
00:33:08,008 --> 00:33:10,738
You can count on me whenever you need me!

431
00:33:11,845 --> 00:33:15,303
They wanted to hide from the horrible truth Ms. Moriguchi had shown us.

432
00:33:15,449 --> 00:33:17,883
I'll support you with all my might!

433
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:22,316
So they pretended to be stupid.

434
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:26,051
I want to be like a big brother to you all!

I'm sorry.

441
00:34:08,602 --> 00:34:10,900
I've been lying to you.

442
00:34:11,038 --> 00:34:14,906
I told you Naoki couldn't come to class because of colds or illnesses.

443
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:17,408
But he's not just been skipping.

444
00:34:17,544 --> 00:34:21,105
He wants to come to class, but he's very sick mentally.

445
00:34:21,248 --> 00:34:24,115
Werther was the only one in the class...

446
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:26,344
...who didn't know why he was like that to begin with.

447

(We'll refer to the one who leaked Miss Moriguchi's confession as Boy 'C')

448
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:32,385
The mail was sent to everyone in the class just after...

449
00:34:32,526 --> 00:34:34,756
...the closing ceremony that day. Nobody knew who sent it.

450

How about it, everyone?

451
00:34:36,763 --> 00:34:39,254
Want to help me make it easier for him to come back?

452
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:47,802
For example, maybe we could make lots of leaflets, and...

453
00:34:47,941 --> 00:34:52,344
...Class Representative Mizuki and I could take one to his house each week.

454
00:34:53,113 --> 00:34:55,911
No good? What do you think, Mizuki?

455
00:34:56,683 --> 00:34:57,513
Sounds okay.

456
00:34:57,651 --> 00:35:00,085
Stand up! Thanks.

457
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,654
Do you have a nickname too, Mizuki?

458
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:04,347
Mozuki.

459

00:35:17,304 --> 00:35:20,171
Right, I'll call you that from now on.

Is Naoki here?

467
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:54,669
Yes.

468
00:35:58,979 --> 00:36:01,914
If a teacher as passionate as you had been his homeroom teacher,

469
00:36:02,048 --> 00:36:05,575
Nao might never have ended up like this.

470
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,780
The last teacher was a single mother, right?

471
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:13,556
Imagine, bringing your child to work in the first place.

472
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:17,060
Nao's mother danced around the subject of the incident...

473
00:36:17,197 --> 00:36:19,825
...itself, and just kept blaming Miss Moriguchi.

474
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,630
I can't help but feel like she was so focused on her daughter...

475
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:25,567
...that she lost sight of the needs of her students.

476
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:26,433
So Naoki is...

477
00:36:26,573 --> 00:36:27,665
Naoki is the sort of boy...

478
00:36:27,808 --> 00:36:31,335
...who can do anything if he tries.

479
00:36:31,478 --> 00:36:34,276
Please let me help with Naoki.

480
00:36:34,414 --> 00:36:36,405
Thank you.

481
00:36:40,654 --> 00:36:41,882
Nao!

482
00:36:45,425 --> 00:36:46,414
Nao!

483
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:50,321
I told you to stay the hell away from me!

484
00:36:50,464 --> 00:36:51,863
Nao!

485
00:36:59,105 --> 00:37:02,734
It's all that bitch's fault.
(Confession: Yuko Shimomura)

486
00:37:03,844 --> 00:37:07,644
That dear little Nao ended up like this...

487
00:37:07,781 --> 00:37:09,305
Pee.

488
00:37:10,717 --> 00:37:16,212
He wouldn't let me touch anything he had touched...

489
00:37:16,356 --> 00:37:20,122
...and insisted on washing every inch of it himself.

490
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:32,798
Yet for some reason he wouldn't wash his hair, and refused to take a bath.

491
00:37:34,508 --> 00:37:35,600
That bitch...

492
00:37:35,742 --> 00:37:37,642
Why Manami?

493
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:40,268
Why did Manami have to die?

494
00:37:40,413 --> 00:37:42,210
What are you babbling about?

495
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:47,116
She made it sound like it was all Nao's fault.

496
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:54,420
Even though he was just led astray by bad friends.

497
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:56,722
It's not fair.

498
00:37:58,565 --> 00:38:00,328
Nao...

499
00:38:02,102 --> 00:38:03,569
Stay the hell away!

500
00:38:26,726 --> 00:38:29,160
The hell aren't you workin'?

501
00:38:49,215 --> 00:38:51,683
(Death to Shuuya Watanabe)

502
00:38:56,122 --> 00:38:57,350

503
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:01,084

504
00:39:01,227 --> 00:39:02,489
(10 points, 9 points, 8 points...)

505
00:39:04,397 --> 00:39:06,558
(Death to Shuuya Watanabe! Murderer!)

506
00:39:21,548 --> 00:39:22,412
(Shuuya Punishment Points scoreboard)

507
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:23,948
(Do your best everyone! ^^)

508
00:39:43,003 --> 00:39:47,269
Nobody knew who it was...
(Holy war on the murderer! Gather those points!)

509
00:39:47,407 --> 00:39:49,534
...who sent around the mails.

510
00:39:55,749 --> 00:39:58,513
Who'll write some words to cheer up Naoki?

511
00:40:32,252 --> 00:40:34,049
(FILL..)

512
00:40:34,187 --> 00:40:35,347
Fill your heart with joy!

513
00:40:35,488 --> 00:40:36,682
(THE...)

514
00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:38,723
The road ahead is still long!

515
00:40:38,858 --> 00:40:40,416
(KILL...)

516
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,085
Kill off all your doubts!

517
00:40:43,229 --> 00:40:44,355
(LEARn...)

518
00:40:44,497 --> 00:40:46,658
You live you learn!

519
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:49,662
How is Naoki?

520
00:40:49,803 --> 00:40:52,237
Can I talk to him for just a few moments?

521
00:41:02,048 --> 00:41:03,276
Sir...

522
00:41:04,784 --> 00:41:06,411
Just call me Werther.

523
00:41:07,153 --> 00:41:11,021
Doing this stuff isn't going to make Nao come to school.

524
00:41:11,157 --> 00:41:12,590
It might actually have the oppos...

525
00:41:12,726 --> 00:41:15,559
Mozuki, relax.

526
00:41:15,695 --> 00:41:18,960
This is just a little adolescent angst. If he gets through it, he'll see the light.

527
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,162
(Believe)

528
00:41:21,301 --> 00:41:22,928
Let's believe in each other!

529
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:23,763
(Never)

530
00:41:23,903 --> 00:41:26,098
Never give up!

531
00:41:37,183 --> 00:41:38,480
Why...?

532
00:41:39,586 --> 00:41:41,679
Why is it that Nao can be peaceful, but...

533
00:41:41,821 --> 00:41:44,016
...everytime that guy comes here...

534
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:48,524
...he's terrified...

535
00:41:51,664 --> 00:41:53,325
That stupid teacher.

536
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:57,092
Spouting that optimistic rubbish.

537
00:41:59,672 --> 00:42:01,765
He's useless.

538
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:11,943
I slipped sleeping pills into his food.

539
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:19,115
My husband was away on work.

540
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:22,023
And my eldest daughter was busy with her studies in Tokyo.

541
00:42:23,296 --> 00:42:28,529
There was nobody in the house but the two of us.

542
00:42:30,637 --> 00:42:32,798
Nobody to protect him but me.

543
00:43:23,823 --> 00:43:24,790
Mom...

544
00:43:26,492 --> 00:43:28,119
Nao...

545
00:43:38,872 --> 00:43:41,500
Who's this?

546
00:43:44,077 --> 00:43:46,136
The heck's he smiling for?

547
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:52,848
June.

548
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,688
There are bullies in this class.

549
00:44:00,526 --> 00:44:04,519
And the one being bullied is Shuuya Watanabe.

550
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:11,827
This note was in among the homework I took in yesterday.

551
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:14,730
It took courage to write this.

552
00:44:14,874 --> 00:44:17,434
I'm not just gonna ignore that.

553
00:44:17,844 --> 00:44:20,642
I think the bullies are just jealous.

554
00:44:21,447 --> 00:44:26,783
Because Shuuya's the smartest kid in the year.

555
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,751
Don't think you can just walk all over him...

556
00:44:28,888 --> 00:44:31,118
...just because he's smarter than you!

557
00:44:31,257 --> 00:44:34,749
He couldn't have been more wrong.

558
00:44:34,894 --> 00:44:38,421
Shuuya's intellect is one of his unique qualities!

559
00:44:38,564 --> 00:44:41,624
You all possess unique, individual abilities too!

560
00:44:41,768 --> 00:44:44,464
The ability to bully those weaker than you.

561
00:44:44,604 --> 00:44:47,095
The ability to forget things you don't want to face.

562
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,471
I want to see you all continue to polish those abilities.

563
00:44:51,411 --> 00:44:55,040
Because I'm always watching over you.

564
00:45:10,163 --> 00:45:12,723
Hey, it was you who grassed us up, right?

565
00:45:12,865 --> 00:45:16,130
No! It wasn't me!

566
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:18,260
The class blamed me.

567
00:45:18,404 --> 00:45:22,067
Because I was the only one whose punishment points sat at...

568
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,937
Mizuki 0 Points

569
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:36,712
Allying yourself with a murderer...

570
00:45:36,856 --> 00:45:39,450
Don't you have any shame, Mozuki?

571
00:45:40,693 --> 00:45:43,958
Don't you feel sorry for Miss Moriguchi?

572
00:45:45,365 --> 00:45:46,559
Don't!

573
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:47,723
Lemme go!

574
00:45:47,867 --> 00:45:54,431
Kiss!

575
00:45:54,574 --> 00:45:59,671
Miss... Our class is finished.

576
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Naoki's crying.

577
00:46:10,423 --> 00:46:15,918
He's probably thinking about the accident.

578
00:46:17,063 --> 00:46:20,521
And crying...

579
00:46:20,666 --> 00:46:22,827
...for the girl who died.

580
00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:25,628
It's clear to me.

581
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,802
I know he hasn't changed a bit.

582
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,742
That same old gentleness...

583
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,680
He's still Naoki.

584
00:46:41,954 --> 00:46:54,924
Fill...the...kill...lear... Filthy killer.

585
00:47:32,905 --> 00:47:35,601
(I'm at the underpass under the bridge. Can we meet?)

586
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:44,215
(I'll be there.)

587
00:47:56,696 --> 00:47:58,630


588
00:47:58,764 --> 00:48:01,028


589
00:48:02,602 --> 00:48:04,229
Just wanted to let you know.

590
00:48:07,673 --> 00:48:13,202
It's fine. I already knew.

591
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:29,350
Hey! Wanna go drink some juice?

592
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:36,425
So you already knew?

593
00:48:39,505 --> 00:48:42,440
Yeah. Had to be a lie.

594
00:48:43,876 --> 00:48:46,811
Mixing HIV-infected blood into milk.

595
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,906
Couldn't believe everyone bought it.

596
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:52,449
How come?

597
00:48:52,952 --> 00:48:54,476
Well...

598
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:59,080
If someone was really trying to kill someone, or get revenge...

599
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:03,328
...they wouldn't feed us all that shit about the importance of life.

600
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:04,451
You think?

601
00:49:04,597 --> 00:49:06,656
She didn't have the guts.

602
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:11,297
No matter how much she hated you.

603
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:20,807
She just said that stuff to give you a wake up call.

604
00:49:22,248 --> 00:49:24,079
I could tell.

605
00:49:25,017 --> 00:49:29,147
You're not afraid of me?

606
00:49:35,628 --> 00:49:38,222
Even though I'm Boy 'A'?

607
00:49:41,067 --> 00:49:44,434
Why'd you bother telling me the results?

608
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:49,503
Because even though my life isn't very important...

609
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:53,235
...yours is.

610
00:50:50,736 --> 00:50:55,673
You've been sending weird mails around and setting everyone on me...

611
00:50:55,808 --> 00:50:57,400
Right Hoshino?

612
00:51:07,987 --> 00:51:10,512
If you keep fucking with me...

613
00:51:10,656 --> 00:51:13,250
...then I'm gonna put these lips all over you.

614
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,587
Just kidding.

615
00:51:56,569 --> 00:52:02,166
I'll pay for it. All of it.

616
00:52:23,896 --> 00:52:27,354
You shouldn't eat it. You'll get AIDS.

617
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:31,427
During the closing ceremony...

618
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:34,596
The milk I drank had Miss Moriguchi's...

619
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:40,269
What Nao told me...it was too terrible.

620
00:52:41,881 --> 00:52:45,977
Moriguchi is a demon.

621
00:52:46,385 --> 00:52:48,546
Nao! We're going to the hospital.

622
00:52:50,389 --> 00:52:51,151
Forget it.

623
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:55,021
What're you saying!? If you died, I'd...

624
00:52:55,161 --> 00:52:56,560
I'm a murderer.

625
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:58,060
You are not!

626
00:52:58,197 --> 00:53:00,757
You were just trying to protect your friend, so you took the body, and...

627
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,563
It wasn't a body. She was still breathing.

628
00:53:04,703 --> 00:53:07,365
That's why I threw her in the pool.

629
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:13,808
S...so she was alive, and...

630
00:53:13,946 --> 00:53:15,470
And you just didn't realise! That's right.

631
00:53:15,614 --> 00:53:17,445
Not really.

632
00:53:18,984 --> 00:53:23,580
She opened her eyes right in front of me.

633
00:53:31,964 --> 00:53:35,832
So I just...

634
00:53:46,145 --> 00:53:47,476
July.

635
00:53:52,418 --> 00:53:57,651
Nobody dared to bully Shuuya anymore.

636
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:01,519
(Nobody dared to bully Shuuya anymore.)

637
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:14,300
Don't look! I'm writing a letter!

638
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,304
Huh? To who?

639
00:54:15,441 --> 00:54:17,568
I'm not going to send it or anything.

640
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:21,672
But it's just...full of my feelings.

641
00:54:30,589 --> 00:54:32,216
Cool.

642
00:54:33,325 --> 00:54:35,259
This is awesome, Shuuya!

643
00:54:37,863 --> 00:54:40,024
All I wanted...

644
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:46,367
All I wanted was for someone to recognise me.

645
00:54:48,107 --> 00:54:54,740
I don't have a mother, and I've been alone all this time.

646
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:58,172
I told Shuuya...

647
00:54:58,317 --> 00:55:01,047
...a secret I had kept from everyone else.

648
00:55:01,186 --> 00:55:05,850
That Lunacy girl...is my other side.

649
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:12,160
I let him see the real me, that I hid from everyone else.

650
00:55:16,702 --> 00:55:18,602
Hey...

651
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:24,974
Is there anyone you really want to get rid of?

652
00:55:31,951 --> 00:55:33,009
Go home!

653
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:35,883
Nao, are you there!?

654
00:55:36,021 --> 00:55:39,479
Nothing's going to be solved by holing yourself up in your room!

655
00:55:44,763 --> 00:55:46,355
Don't think you're facing this alone!

656
00:55:46,498 --> 00:55:47,760
I'll help you!

657
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,959
I'll listen to anything you have to say!

658
00:55:50,102 --> 00:55:52,434
Believe in me, Naoki!

659
00:55:52,571 --> 00:55:55,199
You've got to come to the end of year ceremony tomorrow!

660
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:57,406
Everyone's waiting for you!

661
00:56:07,086 --> 00:56:12,285
Mozuki... Thanks for always coming with me.

662
00:56:23,268 --> 00:56:27,329
Naoki...isn't Naoki anymore.

663
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:32,968
The gentle Nao that I loved...is gone.

664
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:44,022
Yoshihiko...Mariko... Goodbye.

665
00:56:44,156 --> 00:56:52,461
Forgive me. I'm going to take Nao with me t...

666
00:57:09,515 --> 00:57:16,011
(...to heaven.)

667
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:30,501
Nao...

668
00:57:32,137 --> 00:57:36,403
The next day, the end of term ceremony was postponed.

669
00:57:36,542 --> 00:57:39,477
And in the afternoon, a staff meeting was called.

670
00:57:40,946 --> 00:57:42,607
Because Nao...

671
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:46,575
...killed his mother.

672
00:57:51,557 --> 00:57:55,357
I'm sure it's a shock to you that Nao did a thing like this, but...

673
00:57:55,494 --> 00:57:59,430
The police are wanting to make inquiries.

674
00:58:02,468 --> 00:58:03,730
Mozuki.

675
00:58:05,571 --> 00:58:09,302
You just need to tell the teachers and the police whatever comes to mind.

676
00:58:10,509 --> 00:58:11,806
I know.

677
00:58:15,247 --> 00:58:18,808
Miss... Miss Moriguchi.

678
00:58:19,785 --> 00:58:24,245
I want to ask you once more.

679
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:29,021
Is life a heavy burden to bear?

680
00:58:30,596 --> 00:58:34,532
No matter whose life it is?

681
00:58:43,408 --> 00:58:47,310
I've collected a range of different medicines.

682
00:58:48,013 --> 00:58:52,712
I planned to use them to commit suicide.

683
00:58:54,019 --> 00:58:58,217
But it's just as easy to take them...

684
00:58:58,357 --> 00:59:00,291
...and mix them into Werther's tea.

685
00:59:01,426 --> 00:59:04,725
Life isn't worth a thing.

686
00:59:05,397 --> 00:59:10,596
I'm sure that's what you thought when you did what you did to Shuuya and Nao.

687
00:59:11,804 --> 00:59:16,002
Though I'm not sure you did anything at all...

688
00:59:19,611 --> 00:59:22,978
I'm actually a little bit afraid.

689
00:59:23,649 --> 00:59:26,049
Though part of me doesn't care...

690
00:59:26,852 --> 00:59:29,844
...whether a creep like Werther lives or dies.

691
00:59:32,291 --> 00:59:34,919
I said whatever came to mind.

692
00:59:35,727 --> 00:59:41,029
That everything Nao did... That him becoming the way he did...

693
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:46,798
Was all Werther's fault.

694
01:00:10,996 --> 01:00:16,161
Nobody taught me that killing people was wrong.

695
01:00:18,503 --> 01:00:23,202
Where other kids got given beautiful picture books and

696
01:00:23,342 --> 01:00:24,536
my Mum taught me Ohm's law and Norton's theorum.

697
01:00:24,676 --> 01:00:29,636
She only ever talked about electronics.

698
01:00:30,883 --> 01:00:34,182
She'd break cute toys to pieces,

699
01:00:39,491 --> 01:00:43,154
and show me how they worked.

700
01:00:47,065 --> 01:00:51,399
Mom dreamed of becoming a reasearcher in electrical engineering.

701
01:00:52,704 --> 01:00:57,437
She married the most unspectacular person you could imagine...

702
01:00:57,576 --> 01:01:01,478
...and gave birth to me.

703
01:01:03,282 --> 01:01:06,308
In order to raise me,

704
01:01:06,451 --> 01:01:11,354
Mom threw away her career as a researcher, and cast aside a shining future.

705
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:14,084
You're going to be a genius.

706
01:01:14,693 --> 01:01:17,821
Because you've got my blood in your veins.

707
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:25,933
But she soon came to regret that decision.

708
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:29,466
And to hate me for it.

709
01:01:29,608 --> 01:01:33,806
Why don't you get it? Why can't you even do something like this!?

710
01:01:39,518 --> 01:01:40,985
If only you weren't here.

711
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,314
If only I wasn't here.

712
01:01:45,357 --> 01:01:46,915
I'm sorry...

713
01:01:47,059 --> 01:01:51,428
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

714
01:01:52,497 --> 01:01:53,623
What're you doing?

715
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,697
My dad couldn't stand the way she treated me, and divorced her.

716
01:01:59,438 --> 01:02:04,398
And Mom decided to go back to her dream of being a researcher.

717
01:02:04,876 --> 01:02:07,470
Of course, that meant leaving me behind.

718
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:11,374
The only things she left me were...

719
01:02:11,516 --> 01:02:14,883
These are all wonderful books that have had a big impact on me.

720
01:02:15,654 --> 01:02:17,588
I'm sure they'll be useful to you further down the line.

721
01:02:17,723 --> 01:02:20,851
...a pile of books, and a few words.

722
01:02:20,993 --> 01:02:23,826
You've got the same blood as me.

723
01:02:23,962 --> 01:02:26,954
The same talent flows in your veins.

724
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:33,503
See you around.

725
01:02:58,764 --> 01:03:02,757
As she left, I heard...

726
01:03:05,904 --> 01:03:09,840
...the sound of something important to me disappearing.

727
01:03:10,909 --> 01:03:13,901
(Confession: Shuuya Watanabe)

728
01:03:14,846 --> 01:03:16,404
Pop...

729
01:03:19,484 --> 01:03:21,679
Everyone will die.

730
01:03:28,393 --> 01:03:30,258
Want a drink too?

731
01:03:33,365 --> 01:03:35,424
Including me.

732
01:03:36,601 --> 01:03:41,061
My entire world will...

733
01:03:42,707 --> 01:03:45,005
31st August.

734
01:03:45,677 --> 01:03:48,441
I planted a bomb in the school.

735
01:03:55,454 --> 01:03:59,288
The detonator is tied to the dial button on my phone.

736
01:04:01,693 --> 01:04:05,151
A piece I wrote on the topic of 'Life' during my first term...

737
01:04:05,297 --> 01:04:07,322
...was 

738
01:04:07,466 --> 01:04:10,958
And come tomorrow's start of term ceremony.

739
01:04:11,103 --> 01:04:14,197
I'll be standing in front of every student in the school reading it.

740
01:04:15,774 --> 01:04:18,265
Realise the importance of life!

741
01:04:19,111 --> 01:04:22,979
I'll never forget the words of Miss Moriguchi, who told me that.

742
01:04:24,149 --> 01:04:27,676
They were words of truth, from a woman...

743
01:04:27,819 --> 01:04:33,018
...who had lost her darling daughter.

744
01:04:47,739 --> 01:04:50,435
When I've finished my speech, I'll trigger the detonator.

745
01:04:50,876 --> 01:04:55,836
And I'll be blown to pieces, along with all the idiots sitting in front of me.

746
01:04:58,617 --> 01:05:02,986
The media will be all over it, of course.

747
01:05:04,189 --> 01:05:06,749
??

748
01:05:06,892 --> 01:05:09,622
̰ӡ???

749
01:05:09,761 --> 01:05:16,530
So I'm leaving my last will and testament...on this website.

750
01:05:18,436 --> 01:05:22,736
The year after he divorced my mom, Dad got remarried.

751
01:05:23,942 --> 01:05:25,933
In perfect accordance with natural law...

752
01:05:26,077 --> 01:05:28,409
...it was a union of two morons...

753
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,208
...so their child was just as stupid.

754
01:05:30,348 --> 01:05:32,111
Your dad and I have been thinking...

755
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,649
...that maybe we could turn the storehouse into a study room for you.

756
01:05:33,785 --> 01:05:36,652
The baby will be crying everyday, and...

757
01:05:37,622 --> 01:05:40,989
it would be good for you not to be disturbed.

758
01:05:52,637 --> 01:05:56,573
I read the books Mom left me every day.

759
01:05:57,075 --> 01:06:01,637
I could feel her blood burning in my veins.

760
01:06:02,447 --> 01:06:05,780
I wanted to use the talents she had left me.

761
01:06:05,917 --> 01:06:07,578
The morons were happier to keep...

762
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:10,847
me out of sight. So I shut myself away like...

763
01:06:10,989 --> 01:06:13,480
some sort of monster.

764
01:06:43,154 --> 01:06:44,178
What's this?

765
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:46,787
A backwards clock.

766
01:06:46,925 --> 01:06:50,861
Idiots who only met up to uncensor porn movies...

767
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:56,257
...couldn't hope to understand my genius.

768
01:06:57,936 --> 01:06:58,732
(Einstein's Laboratory)

769
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:01,998
First I set up a website.

770
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:05,837
Then I visited the page of my mom's prestigious university,

771
01:07:06,311 --> 01:07:07,835
and sent them the address.

772

01:07:11,616 --> 01:07:13,413
(He's posting some pretty amazing stuff!)

774
01:07:13,551 --> 01:07:17,078
I thought maybe Mom might see it.

775
01:07:20,358 --> 01:07:20,915
But...

776
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:22,686
(0 comments)

777
01:07:25,697 --> 01:07:29,997
It pissed me off that whenever I posted stupid junk...

A professor who had inspired Mom. Who she had looked up to more than anyone.

784
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:57,724
I wanted to show him my inventions.

785
01:07:58,396 --> 01:08:02,924
It was the perfect stage to demonstrate the talents Mom had left me.

786
01:08:03,301 --> 01:08:05,701
If my inventions were just recognised on a big stage...

787
01:08:05,837 --> 01:08:09,933
...then surely my mom would hear word of it too.

788
01:08:10,675 --> 01:08:13,337
I tested my invention on our homeroom teacher...

789
01:08:13,678 --> 01:08:15,236
...with pleasing results.

790
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:20,875
And as expected, took first prize. But...

(Lunacy Incident)
(Junior high student murders family of four)

A student of a city public school is being held under suspicion...

793
01:08:25,724 --> 01:08:27,351
...of murdering four members of her family.

794
01:08:27,492 --> 01:08:31,553
...the world didn't even blink an eye.

795
01:08:32,163 --> 01:08:34,256
Nobody noticed. Not even Mom.

796
01:08:35,066 --> 01:08:39,127
I had to do something bigger. Something the media couldn't ignore.

797
01:08:39,671 --> 01:08:44,233
A murder.

798
01:08:45,977 --> 01:08:48,571
A murder using the very gifts that...

799
01:08:48,713 --> 01:08:54,015
...my mom had left me.

800
01:08:55,754 --> 01:08:57,654
I didn't care who I killed.

801
01:08:57,789 --> 01:09:00,690
But I needed a helper.

802
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,957
Someone too stupid to notice what I was thinking.

803
01:09:05,597 --> 01:09:07,929
Someone who would do as they were told.

804
01:09:08,767 --> 01:09:11,998
Who would spread the word of my murder like wildfire.

805

An idiot among idiots.

01:09:17,142 --> 01:09:18,404
I found him.

807
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,716
If you tell them all that I did it, they'll let you off.

808
01:09:29,721 --> 01:09:31,655
Don't worry about me trying to drag you into it.

809
01:09:32,791 --> 01:09:35,123
I never thought of you as a friend anyway.

810
01:09:36,294 --> 01:09:38,762
You're pathetic, untalented...

811
01:09:38,897 --> 01:09:41,457
...and utterly worthless.

812
01:09:41,599 --> 01:09:44,500
All I did was tell someone stupid that they were stupid.

813
01:09:44,636 --> 01:09:49,198
So why'd he go and...
(Four year old girl drowns in pool accident)

814
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,240
...mess everything up?

815
01:09:51,876 --> 01:09:54,276
I wanted to be friends...

816
01:09:54,412 --> 01:09:57,245
With you...

817
01:09:58,683 --> 01:10:00,310
I didn't have any friends.

818
01:10:00,452 --> 01:10:02,818
Wanna watch a video together or something?

819
01:10:02,954 --> 01:10:05,479
I've been wanting to talk to you for a while.

820
01:10:05,623 --> 01:10:08,217
Nobody who paid me any attention at all...

821
01:10:08,359 --> 01:10:10,452
You seem different to all those other idiots.

822
01:10:11,062 --> 01:10:14,054
Sort of easy-going. Like a grown up.

823
01:10:14,199 --> 01:10:17,498
Nobody had ever acknowledged me before.

824
01:10:17,635 --> 01:10:20,729
So I chose a target like you asked.

825
01:10:20,872 --> 01:10:22,703
How about Moriguchi's daughter?

826
01:10:22,841 --> 01:10:24,138
Why Manami?

827
01:10:24,275 --> 01:10:26,607
Why did Manami have to die?

828
01:10:26,744 --> 01:10:28,109
I wonder...

829
01:10:28,246 --> 01:10:30,009
I don't even remember anymore.

830
01:10:30,148 --> 01:10:32,309
I just did what I was told.

831
01:10:33,351 --> 01:10:35,751
I scouted around the pool.

832
01:10:36,621 --> 01:10:37,485
But you...

833
01:10:37,622 --> 01:10:40,182
If you tell them all that I did it, they'll let you off.

834
01:10:40,325 --> 01:10:41,986
He...

835
01:10:44,562 --> 01:10:47,554
He just wanted to kill someone.

836
01:10:48,366 --> 01:10:49,958
But he failed.

837
01:10:50,101 --> 01:10:51,728
She was alive.

838
01:10:52,103 --> 01:10:54,037
She was still breathing.

839
01:10:54,672 --> 01:10:56,503
...and utterly worthless.

840
01:10:57,575 --> 01:10:59,042
I'm worthless?

841
01:10:59,577 --> 01:11:01,670
He wanted to kill someone and screwed up!

842
01:11:01,813 --> 01:11:03,178
He's the worthless one!

843
01:11:03,314 --> 01:11:04,338
Tough luck!

844
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:10,786
Looks like I'll do what he never did!

845
01:11:14,659 --> 01:11:16,422
Why the hell did you do that!?

846
01:11:17,061 --> 01:11:19,461
If you wanna spread rumours, do it yourself.

847
01:11:27,438 --> 01:11:28,234
Pop.

848
01:11:28,373 --> 01:11:32,332
A month passed, and finally the dumb teacher put two and two together.

849
01:11:32,477 --> 01:11:36,379
I'm not going to debate the police's conclusion.

850
01:11:36,514 --> 01:11:37,879
God damn it...

851
01:11:38,016 --> 01:11:41,383
It wasn't simply the pouch that killed her.

852
01:11:41,786 --> 01:11:46,189
...even taking into account that she was only four, it can't deliver enough of a shock to stop someone's heart.

853
01:11:46,324 --> 01:11:47,655
This is fucking ridiculous...

854
01:11:47,792 --> 01:11:51,853
I mixed a little something into the cartons of milk the two of them were drinking.

855
01:11:52,597 --> 01:11:56,226
The HIV-contaminated blood of Masayoshi Sakuramiya.

856
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,909
Moriguchi, you're the best.

857
01:12:13,518 --> 01:12:16,043
A life-threatening illness is just what I need!

858
01:12:16,187 --> 01:12:20,954
My stupid dad'll have to let Mom know about this!

859
01:12:21,693 --> 01:12:23,957
She'll definitely agree to meet me!

860
01:12:24,095 --> 01:12:27,656
She'll meet me, even if it's difficult for her.

861
01:12:27,799 --> 01:12:29,266
I'll meet Mom...

862
01:12:29,767 --> 01:12:31,325
She'll look out for me...

863
01:12:31,469 --> 01:12:34,666
And I'll show her just what she taught me!

864
01:12:38,476 --> 01:12:39,943
Pop.

865
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:45,943
Everything after that was just a way of burning time.

866
01:12:49,721 --> 01:12:51,052
My smiles...

867
01:12:51,189 --> 01:12:52,417
My tears...

868
01:12:52,557 --> 01:12:53,489
This and that...

869
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:54,649
All of it.

870
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:57,352
Even living...

871
01:13:00,865 --> 01:13:05,529
They were all just boring ways to pass the time.

872
01:13:11,009 --> 01:13:14,206
(That day, I met Miss Moriguchi by chance...)

873
01:13:17,215 --> 01:13:20,878
How did he...? That talentless...

874
01:13:21,653 --> 01:13:25,384
Worthless...

875
01:13:29,894 --> 01:13:31,555
It's all Moriguchi's fault.

876
01:13:31,696 --> 01:13:37,066
She wanted me dead, and even sent spies here.

877
01:13:37,201 --> 01:13:40,432
But Mom just kept bad mouthing her.

878
01:13:40,571 --> 01:13:42,869
That's why she's dead.

879
01:13:43,474 --> 01:13:46,272
Even though I worked so hard to not infect her...

880
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:48,379
To keep everything clean...

881
01:13:48,513 --> 01:13:50,310
I'm gonna die too!

882
01:13:55,086 --> 01:13:59,250
Yet...I'm still alive.

883
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:05,024
(Confession: Naoki Shimomura)
I don't think it's fully dawned on me yet.

884
01:14:09,567 --> 01:14:10,397
I stink...

885
01:14:10,535 --> 01:14:13,095
But this is proof that I'm alive.

886
01:14:13,237 --> 01:14:16,673
My teeth... My hair... My nails... This smell...

887
01:14:16,808 --> 01:14:19,606
And the fact that I'm still hungry.

888
01:14:30,855 --> 01:14:35,258
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!

889
01:14:35,393 --> 01:14:37,554
I'm going to die... I'm only thirteen...

890
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:39,162
Moriguchi's going to kill me!

891
01:14:39,297 --> 01:14:44,030
I still haven't kissed anyone...or had sex...

892
01:14:44,769 --> 01:14:45,827
Why?

893
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:47,699
Because you're worthless.

894
01:14:47,839 --> 01:14:50,137
I am not! I'm...

895
01:14:50,274 --> 01:14:51,969
You're a good boy, Nao.

896
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:53,441
That's right, huh Mom?

897
01:14:53,578 --> 01:14:56,172
Exercise, study...

898
01:14:56,647 --> 01:14:58,342
Killing people.

899
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:01,042
You can do anything if you put your mind to it.

900
01:15:13,364 --> 01:15:15,958
I'm sorry, Nao.

901
01:15:16,267 --> 01:15:17,564
Why?

902
01:15:18,536 --> 01:15:19,867
Because you're worthless.

903
01:15:20,004 --> 01:15:21,062
Shut up!

904
01:15:25,076 --> 01:15:32,312
I'm sorry. It's my fault. I didn't raise you right...

905
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:34,077
Worthless.

906
01:15:49,467 --> 01:15:52,493
The boy's actions and state of mind are yet...

907
01:15:52,637 --> 01:15:54,764
to be disclosed, but...

908
01:15:54,906 --> 01:15:59,468
According to his lawyer, he accepted the verdict calmly.

909
01:16:00,111 --> 01:16:03,376
(Miss Moriguchi, is life...)

910
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:10,081
Even though he loved his mom, he...

911
01:16:11,255 --> 01:16:12,882
Just like you.

912
01:16:15,259 --> 01:16:16,749
Nothing.

913
01:16:18,396 --> 01:16:19,863
What's just like me?

914
01:16:20,264 --> 01:16:21,026
You're scaring me, Shuuya.

915
01:16:21,165 --> 01:16:23,224
What the hell do you know about me?

916
01:16:26,971 --> 01:16:30,407
I know everything.

917
01:16:32,777 --> 01:16:37,043
You were just...a way to pass the time.

918
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:42,286
Piss off.

919
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:43,682
Thinking you're so hot because you're Lunacy.

920
01:16:43,821 --> 01:16:47,382
Playing at being a psychopath.

921
01:16:47,525 --> 01:16:49,618
And gathering up this shit.

922
01:16:52,263 --> 01:16:53,958
Lunacy is your other side? The fuck is that supposed to mean?

923
01:16:54,098 --> 01:16:57,932
Entertaining yourself with stupid daydreams.

924
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:00,028
I'm not buying it.

925
01:17:00,171 --> 01:17:01,570
Shuuya.

926
01:17:02,406 --> 01:17:04,670
You have the guts to kill anyone, right?

927
01:17:04,809 --> 01:17:08,540
Then drink this shit yourself and die.

928
01:17:14,252 --> 01:17:15,776
Oedipus complex.

929
01:17:17,288 --> 01:17:19,085
You're nothing more...

930
01:17:20,391 --> 01:17:23,224
Than a little baby who's spent his whole life crying for a mother who left him.

931
01:17:23,361 --> 01:17:27,263
You don't even have the guts to just go and see her.

932
01:17:28,165 --> 01:17:31,362
You're scared, right? That if you go see her, she'll push you away.

933
01:17:31,502 --> 01:17:34,471
You don't want to think that she didn't wa...

934
01:17:44,715 --> 01:17:46,342
Miss Moriguchi...

935
01:17:47,518 --> 01:17:51,955
That day, I came across you by chance...

936
01:17:55,126 --> 01:17:56,855
And I...

937
01:18:30,795 --> 01:18:33,025
There was no blood in the milk, was there?

938
01:18:34,165 --> 01:18:36,725
There's no way you'd...

939
01:18:38,069 --> 01:18:40,629
...have the guts to do something like that.

940
01:18:41,172 --> 01:18:43,197
I've been thinking that this whole time.

941
01:18:43,607 --> 01:18:46,235
I don't even really know anymore.

942
01:18:47,945 --> 01:18:49,640
I don't care if that Werther creep dies.

943
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:54,649
It seems Mr. Terada will be taking some time away from work.

944
01:18:55,419 --> 01:18:58,650
Because Naoki ended up...

945
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:01,519
It was all Werther's fa...!

946
01:19:01,659 --> 01:19:03,183
I'm responsible.

947
01:19:04,495 --> 01:19:07,828
I've been meeting with Mr. Terada every now and then.

948
01:19:07,965 --> 01:19:11,560
He's very serious about his job...and very na?ve...

949
01:19:12,036 --> 01:19:15,028
A textbook Sakuramiya fan.

950
01:19:15,973 --> 01:19:17,497
So I decided to tell him that Manami's deceased father...

951
01:19:17,641 --> 01:19:21,771
...was none other than Sakuramiya himself.

952
01:19:23,347 --> 01:19:26,214
I strung him along, and used him...

953
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:29,410
...to make them suffer.

954
01:19:33,691 --> 01:19:36,956
Of course I didn't tell him why Manami died, but...

955
01:19:37,094 --> 01:19:40,222
He was good enough to take my advice to heart.

956
01:19:40,364 --> 01:19:42,924
To make home visits to Naoki.

957
01:19:43,067 --> 01:19:45,831
To not be discouraged, even if he wasn't greeted warmly.

958
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:48,404
To be sure to go at least once a week.

959
01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:51,633
To call out to him, even if the door was shut in his face.

960
01:19:51,776 --> 01:19:54,711
I told him that...

961
01:19:55,379 --> 01:19:58,143
...Sakuramiya would have done the same.

962
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:03,386
As for Shuuya being bullied...

963
01:20:04,121 --> 01:20:07,022
...I suggested fabricating a message from someone in the class.

964
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:10,457
I told him the students would find it easier that way.

965
01:20:11,796 --> 01:20:17,166
I told him precisely because...

966
01:20:18,135 --> 01:20:20,899
...I knew it would only make things worse.

967
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:25,702
I was so disappointed to hear he wasn't being bullied anymore.

968
01:20:25,843 --> 01:20:28,744
I thought it best to surround him with hostile classmates...

969
01:20:28,879 --> 01:20:32,645
...until either he killed himself, or one of them did it for him.

970
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:36,113
I guess you're a nicer bunch than I thought.

971
01:20:36,253 --> 01:20:38,244
Miss...

972
01:20:40,157 --> 01:20:41,146
Here you go.

973
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:42,919
Thank you.

974
01:20:51,202 --> 01:20:54,171
If you mix that blood into their milk,

975
01:20:57,174 --> 01:21:00,439
you'll only be repaying hatred with hatred.

976
01:21:01,412 --> 01:21:05,314
And your mind will never be at ease.

977
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:09,210
They're sure to see the error of their ways one day.

978
01:21:09,353 --> 01:21:11,355
Let's believe in them.

979
01:21:11,355 --> 01:21:16,258
For in their redemption lies your recovery.

980
01:21:17,194 --> 01:21:19,458
That's what Sakuramiya told me.

981
01:21:19,997 --> 01:21:25,993
He always knew just what to say.

982
01:21:27,037 --> 01:21:28,868
But...

983
01:21:32,743 --> 01:21:36,611
I told them I did it anyway.

984
01:21:46,023 --> 01:21:48,958
Even had I done it,

985
01:21:49,093 --> 01:21:52,324
the chance of them being infected was almost zero.

986
01:21:54,798 --> 01:21:57,995
And even if they somehow were infected,

987
01:21:58,135 --> 01:22:01,263
AIDS is no longer the death sentence it used to be.

988
01:22:01,872 --> 01:22:04,966
Its progress can be slowed through modern medicine.

989
01:22:05,943 --> 01:22:11,540
If only we had found Sakuramiya's cancer sooner...

990
01:22:11,682 --> 01:22:14,446
...maybe he might have survived that too.

991
01:22:16,921 --> 01:22:19,446
But they didn't know any of that.

992
01:22:20,691 --> 01:22:23,751
And just hearing 'HIV' sent them into a panic.

993
01:22:24,261 --> 01:22:27,230
A sea of confused, foolish faces.

994
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:36,734
Miss...

995
01:22:40,077 --> 01:22:43,103
I lost my family.

996
01:22:45,082 --> 01:22:47,107
Please don't hurt Shuuya...

997
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:55,781
I won't forgive him.

998
01:22:57,161 --> 01:23:01,427
What about if I died? Would you care?

999
01:23:01,565 --> 01:23:03,032
Of course.

1000
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,204 
He's just lonely.

1001
01:23:12,343 --> 01:23:15,801
He just wants his mom...to look at him again.

1002
01:23:17,448 --> 01:23:23,853
He just wants to be acknowledged by the mother who threw him away.

1003
01:23:23,988 --> 01:23:25,922
And...

1004
01:23:50,414 --> 01:23:55,283
Miss... Is life...

1005
01:23:57,454 --> 01:23:59,479
It's light as can be.

1006
01:26:04,314 --> 01:26:06,578
Ridiculous...

1007
01:26:15,859 --> 01:26:20,523
Her body was still warm. It creeped me out.

1008
01:26:20,664 --> 01:26:23,224
So I stuck her in the fridge.

1009
01:26:24,535 --> 01:26:27,368
I only killed another kid my age.

1010
01:26:27,504 --> 01:26:30,029
So juvenile law is on my side.

1011
01:26:30,174 --> 01:26:32,369
Nobody's going to punish me for it.

1012
01:26:33,911 --> 01:26:35,879
How dull...

1013
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:41,613
When I started making it, I actually had no idea what to use it for.

1014
01:26:42,252 --> 01:26:43,048
Three days ago.

1015
01:26:43,187 --> 01:26:44,677
Assistant Professor Yasaka.

1016
01:26:44,822 --> 01:26:49,885
It was from my mother!

1017
01:26:51,295 --> 01:26:55,129
She wanted to meet me.

1018
01:26:55,265 --> 01:27:00,134
Before I knew it, I was walking to the university.

1019
01:27:02,005 --> 01:27:05,941
The third research lab of the electrical engineering department.

1020
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:12,772
The door swung open, and there she was. I wondered if she'd

1021
01:27:12,916 --> 01:27:17,944
burst into tears and embrace me if I called out to her. But I decided against it.

1022
01:27:18,088 --> 01:27:22,923
What I wanted her to embrace wasn't my body, but something bigger.

1023
01:27:23,327 --> 01:27:28,026
I wanted her to acknowledge my talent.

1024
01:27:28,565 --> 01:27:31,227
To see the legacy I left to the world.

1025
01:27:32,336 --> 01:27:34,304
I left the university.

1026
01:27:34,438 --> 01:27:37,168
To fulfill my destiny.

1027
01:27:38,909 --> 01:27:41,377
I decided where to use my bomb.

1028
01:27:43,113 --> 01:27:45,206
A massacre is about to unfold.

1029
01:27:45,349 --> 01:27:49,342
And this time my audience won't just be one idiot like Shimomura,

1030
01:27:49,486 --> 01:27:53,320
but everyone who visits this site.

1031
01:27:55,626 --> 01:27:58,652
I pray that news of my death, and of the...

1032
01:27:59,897 --> 01:28:03,856
...bloody page I am about to write into history...

1033
01:28:04,001 --> 01:28:06,970
...will find her. That my feelings will reach her.

1034
01:28:08,005 --> 01:28:11,964
I want...my mother to know what I've done.

1035
01:28:22,119 --> 01:28:27,250
There are men in existence who can, or more accurately, who have...

1036
01:28:27,558 --> 01:28:29,082
...an absolute right to commit all kinds of wicked and criminal acts. For them...

1037
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:33,557
For me...

1038
01:28:33,697 --> 01:28:36,791
...to a certain extent, laws do not exist.

1039
01:28:37,501 --> 01:28:42,962
This is the justification cited by the protagonist of Crime and Punishment,

1040
01:28:43,106 --> 01:28:45,370
Raskolnikoff, after he murders his wife.

1041
01:28:45,976 --> 01:28:47,910
But I believe...

1042
01:28:48,378 --> 01:28:51,711
That life is... That every life is important.

1043
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:54,748
That every life is beautiful.

1044
01:28:55,519 --> 01:29:00,388
There isn't a single life in this world that can simply be cast away!

1045
01:29:08,599 --> 01:29:10,362
Just kidding...

1046
01:29:58,482 --> 01:30:00,814
Shuu, this is your mommy.

1047
01:30:00,951 --> 01:30:03,249
I'm so sorry for leaving you alone this whole time.

1048
01:30:03,387 --> 01:30:04,479
Who the hell is this?

1049
01:30:05,489 --> 01:30:08,356
It's Moriguchi. It's been a while.

1050
01:30:08,492 --> 01:30:11,154
I picked up the little present you left in the gymnasium.

1051
01:30:11,294 --> 01:30:14,627
It was the feeble work of a feeble mind.

1052
01:30:14,765 --> 01:30:17,199
I had no problem disarming it.

1053
01:30:17,668 --> 01:30:19,636
Though you helped me out blabbing all about it on that website of...

1054
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:20,429
Shut up!

1055
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:22,037
Not while I still have so much to say.

1056
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,372
I thought about how to take revenge on you...

1057
01:30:25,509 --> 01:30:28,103
And even if I killed you, you don't seem to especially value...

1058
01:30:28,245 --> 01:30:31,806
your own life.

1059
01:30:31,948 --> 01:30:34,849
I've been checking your site this whole...

1060
01:30:34,985 --> 01:30:38,011
time, wondering if there's no better way to punish you.

1061
01:30:38,555 --> 01:30:43,151
I saw that delightful little love letter you wrote to your mom.

1062
01:30:43,593 --> 01:30:45,652
But I won't have you lying to so many people.

1063
01:30:46,496 --> 01:30:48,225
As your former teacher, I must insist...

1064
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:51,493
...on correcting your work one last time.

1065
01:30:51,968 --> 01:30:55,404
Did you really think...

1066
01:30:55,539 --> 01:30:58,406
...that the contact details I left you were from her?

1067
01:30:58,542 --> 01:31:00,134
Mother...

1068
01:31:01,078 --> 01:31:04,445
You set off the very next day, didn't you?

1069
01:31:04,581 --> 01:31:07,482
The door swung open, and there she was. 

1070
01:31:07,617 --> 01:31:10,017
But you never did meet her...

1071
01:31:10,153 --> 01:31:12,917
To fulfill my destiny...

1072
01:31:13,056 --> 01:31:15,547
Telling a pathetic little lie like that...

1073
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:17,251
You bitch...

1074
01:31:17,394 --> 01:31:20,227
You casually strolled into her laboratory.

1075
01:31:20,363 --> 01:31:23,298
Carefully carrying a bunch of junk...

1076
01:31:23,433 --> 01:31:26,527
...that you planned on showing off to her.

1077
01:31:27,237 --> 01:31:30,673
But she wasn't there,

1078
01:31:31,174 --> 01:31:34,405
was she, Watanabe?

1079
01:31:41,151 --> 01:31:44,177
Hey. What are you doing?

1080
01:31:45,622 --> 01:31:49,649
This is Assistant Professor Yasaka, right?

1081
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:51,654
Yeah. You know her?

1082
01:31:51,795 --> 01:31:55,026
She's the person I admire most in the whole world.

1083
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:59,198
Right... But she's Assitant Professor Seguchi now.

1084
01:31:59,336 --> 01:32:00,633
Seguchi?

1085
01:32:01,171 --> 01:32:04,265
Yep. This person. They're on their honeymoon right now.

1086
01:32:04,407 --> 01:32:08,605
Kind of amazing, huh? Getting married at that age. H...hey!

1087
01:32:08,745 --> 01:32:13,478
You threw everything to the floor, and stormed out in tears.

1088
01:32:13,617 --> 01:32:15,949
I sure know a lot, huh?

1089
01:32:16,086 --> 01:32:18,145
I was watching the whole thing.

1090
01:32:20,357 --> 01:32:25,852
It was me who sent you her details.

1091
01:32:27,597 --> 01:32:31,829
Kitahara... The girl you killed...

1092
01:32:31,968 --> 01:32:35,369
Told me about your Achilles' heel.

1093
01:32:35,505 --> 01:32:38,030
Shuuya's just lonely.

1094
01:32:38,175 --> 01:32:42,578
He just wants his mom...to look at him again.

1095
01:32:43,013 --> 01:32:47,109
So I searched her out. It didn't take long to find her.

1096
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:50,981
To find the person you were so desperate to see that you resorted to murder.

1097
01:32:51,121 --> 01:32:53,919
To find out where she lived...what she was doing...

1098
01:32:54,057 --> 01:32:55,115
Shut up!

1099
01:32:57,894 --> 01:33:03,958
Plus I wanted to see just how much you cared about your mommy.

1100
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:11,967
Was the little boy who ran away crying really the same person who talked tough in those videos?

1101
01:33:12,108 --> 01:33:14,099
I decided against it.

1102
01:33:14,244 --> 01:33:16,769
My beloved mommy threw me away.

1103
01:33:16,913 --> 01:33:19,279
Worse, she probably doesn't even remember doing it.

1104
01:33:19,416 --> 01:33:20,883
I left the university.

1105
01:33:21,017 --> 01:33:25,511
I hate this. I've had enough. I want to die.

1106
01:33:25,655 --> 01:33:29,352
Taking as many people with me as I can.

1107
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:34,161
These were the real thoughts that ran through your head as you set the bomb.

1108
01:33:35,465 --> 01:33:36,898
You idiot...

1109
01:33:37,033 --> 01:33:39,558
What the fuck do you know?

1110
01:33:39,703 --> 01:33:42,103
You're the one who's clueless here.

1111
01:33:42,672 --> 01:33:45,835
Why do innocent people have to die for you?

1112
01:33:46,276 --> 01:33:50,303
This was between you and your mother.

1113
01:33:50,447 --> 01:33:54,008
So why did you have to drag Manami and Kitahara into it?

1114
01:33:54,150 --> 01:33:55,811
I didn't care who I killed.

1115
01:33:55,952 --> 01:33:58,045
Then why not start with your beloved mommy?

1116
01:33:58,188 --> 01:33:59,519
Shut up!

1117
01:33:59,856 --> 01:34:01,847
What are you doing? Give me that!

1118
01:34:10,901 --> 01:34:14,200
The police are on their way to your house.

1119
01:34:14,337 --> 01:34:18,034
It won't be long before they discover Kitahara's body.

1120
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:23,209
She was the only one...

1121
01:34:23,346 --> 01:34:25,644
...willing to understand the proud, pathetic little creature that you are.

1122
01:34:25,782 --> 01:34:28,615
I only killed another kid my age.

1123
01:34:28,752 --> 01:34:31,084
So juvenile law is on my side.

1124
01:34:31,221 --> 01:34:32,586
Nobody's going to punish me for it.

1125
01:34:32,722 --> 01:34:35,418
Even if the law protects you,

1126
01:34:35,558 --> 01:34:38,356
I'll never forgive you.

1127
01:34:42,465 --> 01:34:45,059
After disarming the bomb this morning,

1128
01:34:46,670 --> 01:34:49,468
I took a trip to visit someone.

1129
01:34:50,573 --> 01:34:55,476
And took them that lovely little present of yours.

1130
01:35:13,096 --> 01:35:16,224
You were so desperate to meet her...

1131
01:35:16,366 --> 01:35:19,494
...and it was so easy for me.

1132
01:35:20,637 --> 01:35:24,004
She had just returned from her honeymoon the night before.

1133
01:35:28,678 --> 01:35:31,203
I told her everything.

1134
01:35:31,348 --> 01:35:38,311
How much you loved her. And how many people you had sacrificed for her.

1135
01:35:38,455 --> 01:35:44,257
She hadn't forgotten you, you know.

1136
01:35:44,694 --> 01:35:46,161
Stop...

1137
01:35:48,999 --> 01:35:53,163
Anyway, I gave her your present...

1138
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:57,335
...that little invention of yours...

1139
01:35:57,474 --> 01:36:00,034
...and left.

1140
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:32,167
She was a wonderful person.

1141
01:36:32,308 --> 01:36:36,176
So I was praying that you wouldn't press the detonator.

1142
01:36:39,816 --> 01:36:46,654
But you...went and did it anyway.

1143
01:36:49,826 --> 01:36:51,657
Just kidding...

1144
01:36:59,369 --> 01:37:04,033
I heard it too. The sound of something important to you disappearing.

1145
01:37:07,043 --> 01:37:12,743
But it wasn't a pop... It was more like...KABOOM!

1146
01:37:21,157 --> 01:37:23,091
Stop it!

1147
01:40:47,163 --> 01:40:49,563


1148
01:41:35,278 --> 01:41:36,802
Watanabe...

1149
01:41:36,946 --> 01:41:40,973
You're the one who made the bomb.

1150
01:41:41,117 --> 01:41:42,948
And you're the one who pushed the detonator.

1151
01:42:25,962 --> 01:42:29,125
This is my revenge.

1152
01:42:32,535 --> 01:42:34,730
I have plunged you into the depths of hell.

1153
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:57,451
This is the first step toward your redemption.

1154
01:43:13,009 --> 01:43:14,874
Just messing with you.
