1
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,750
<i>I'm the police.</i>

2
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,250
<i>And I'm here to arrest you.</i>

3
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,500
<i>You've broken the law.</i>

4
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,250
<i>I did not write the law.</i>

5
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,250
<i>I may even disagree with the law.</i>

6
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,000
<i>But I will enforce it.</i>

7
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:52,000
<i>No matter how you plead, cajole,
beg or attempt to stir my sympathies,</i>

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,500
<i>nothing you do will stop me from placing
you in a steel cage with grey bars.</i>

9
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,833
<i>If you run away, I will chase you.</i>

10
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:00,917
<i>If you fight me, I will fight back.</i>

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,333
<i>If you shoot at me, I will shoot back.</i>

12
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,500
<i>By the law,
I am unable to walk away.</i>

13
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,000
<i>I'm a consequence.</i>

14
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,792
<i>I am the unpaid bill.</i>

15
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:11,917
<i>I am fate with a badge and a gun.</i>

16
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:15,083
<i>Behind my badge is a heart like yours.</i>

17
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:16,833
<i>I bleed.</i>

18
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:17,833
<i>I think.</i>

19
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,500
<i>I love.</i>

20
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,917
<i>And yes, I can be killed.</i>

21
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,917
<i>And although I'm but one man...</i>

22
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:28,500
<i>... I have thousands of brothers and sisters
who are the same as me.</i>

23
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,083
<i>They will lay down their lives for me.</i>

24
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:32,583
<i>And I them.</i>

25
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,917
<i>We stand watch together.</i>

26
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:36,833
<i>A thin blue line.</i>

27
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,333
<i>Protecting the prey
from the predators.</i>

28
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,083
<i>The good from the bad.</i>

29
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,750
<i>We are the police.</i>

30
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:52,917
<i>Thirteen X-ray nine is in pursuit of a
Code vehicle west on two seven.</i>

31
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:54,333
Go ahead, motherfucker.

32
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:56,083
Try to run, you son of a bitch.

33
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:58,750
Hold on, hold on!

34
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,750
<i>Eastbound through the alley at
twenty hundred block from Hooper.</i>

35
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:05,000
<i>Now eastbound through the alley
at twenty hundred block from Hooper.</i>

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,083
Oh shit!

37
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,917
Come around, come around!

38
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:09,667
Move!

39
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,250
Get the fuck around!

40
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,083
Pull to the right!

41
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,333
Pull to the right!

42
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,083
He's not going to pull to the right.

43
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,333
You stupid motherfucker!

44
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,167
He almost lost it!

45
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:25,583
Pit him!

46
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,250
Pit him!

47
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:28,417
Got him!

48
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:36,792
Fuck you!

49
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,417
You good?

50
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,250
Good.

51
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,583
This fucker's down.

52
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,750
I'm going to hook him.

53
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:00,500
You're all good.

54
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:02,917
<i>Thirteen x-ray nine,
you can show a Code Four.</i>

55
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:07,750
<i>Thirteen x nine is requesting additional
supervisors to the four thousand block at Naomi.</i>

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,833
Walk it off.

57
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,333
You good?

58
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:11,750
I'm good.

59
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,417
Holy shit.

60
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:14,250
Yeah, motherfucker.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,667
All right.

62
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:17,917
This is my day job.

63
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:20,667
Some of you... Sorry, bro, I'm recording.

64
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,583
This is my day job.

65
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,333
Some of you might know me as Brian.

66
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,000
Or Taylor.

67
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:29,083
But here I am Police Officer Two Brian Taylor.

68
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:34,250
This is where the forces of good,
prepare to fight to forces of evil.

69
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,000
This is my partner, Officer Zavala.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,750
I'm in my chones.

71
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,250
I know, come on.

72
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,083
- No no, I'm in my chones.

73
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,333
We work basic patrol here at Newton.

74
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:45,000
One of the toughest divisions in the LAPD.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,833
Shootin' Newton, that's right.

76
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,500
Lucky Thirteen.

77
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,750
This is a department issue sidearm.

78
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,833
Glock nineteen.

79
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,833
Spyderco tactical knife.

80
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,500
This little thing can break windows.

81
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,167
Two Smith and Wesson handcuffs.

82
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,917
Can of OC spray.

83
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:05,250
Pepper spray.

84
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,583
Two extra mags.

85
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,250
What else?

86
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:08,750
That's my nametag.

87
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,500
You can see my partner's dirty locker.

88
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,917
Yours is like a woman.

89
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:13,500
Look at this.

90
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,833
What is this, Pottery Barn?

91
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,250
Are you going to shut the fuck up
and get ready for roll call?

92
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,083
Don't swear.

93
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,917
I have to edit that out, when you swear.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,750
Oh fuck.

95
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,917
Oh shit.

96
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:24,083
Fuck.

97
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,833
You kids having fun?

98
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,500
Look, it's Officer Van Houser.

99
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,750
Officer Three.

100
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:33,833
Van Houser.

101
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,583
Considered unpromotable by the department.

102
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,500
And the angriest fucking cop in the world.

103
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,083
I'm going to tell Sarge
that you're taping in here.

104
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
What'd you say?

105
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,083
I'm going to tell Sarge
that you're taping in here.

106
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,583
It's not really called taping anymore.

107
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,917
- It uses flash cards, but it's not really a...
- Don't worry about it.

108
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,083
God damn it!

109
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:53,750
Like that?

110
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:57,333
Turn it on.

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,333
Am I recording you?

112
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,083
Yes, and I'm recording you.

113
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,917
That's so cool.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,917
That thing there?

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,750
That's the lens right there.

116
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:08,000
Just like this right here.

117
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,417
Hey guys, quiet down.

118
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,917
All right, let's settle down.

119
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:13,542
Let's settle down.

120
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:14,667
Captain's here, he'd like to say a few words.

121
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:15,750
Let's quiet down.

122
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,250
Thank you, Sergeant.

123
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:16,917
Good afternoon.

124
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,167
Good afternoon.

125
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,417
- Put it down.

126
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:20,667
I'd like to welcome back Zavala and Taylor.

127
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,417
D.A.cleared these guys
in last month's shooting.

128
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:24,667
Turned out to be a good shooting.

129
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:27,250
I know firsthand what you guys went through.

130
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,333
It's a unpleasant experience
being under that much scrutiny.

131
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,833
But you need to remember something.

132
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,542
An on the job shooting
is still considered a homicide.

133
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,917
It's never an easy ride.

134
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:40,417
If you do the right thing,
I will always have your back.

135
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:45,333
Do the wrong thing and cross me,
I will personally throw you under the bus.

136
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,917
Am I clear?

137
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:47,667
Yes sir!

138
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:48,167
Taylor, am I clear?

139
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:48,583
- Yes sir.

140
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,000
Sergeant, am I clear?

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,417
- Yes sir.

142
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,583
Have a nice day.

143
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,333
Thank you, Captain.

144
00:05:58,167 --> 00:05:59,083
Quiet down!

145
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,833
See this?

146
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:02,000
It's a ticket book.

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,583
Inside are things called tickets.

148
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,667
Son of a bitch.

149
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,417
You can do things like stop motorists,

150
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:09,833
and cut citations for speeding
or going through a light.

151
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,167
You all need to write.

152
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:12,583
Sarge, we cut citations every watch.

153
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,833
I'm not talking to you,
I'm talking to these two idiots.

154
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,417
My partner has a question.

155
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,750
I don't really know how to write.

156
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,917
But I do sign and draw pictures.

157
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,917
Seriously, you don't start writing,
Captain's going to shit on my head,

158
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:28,583
and in turn,
I'm gonna shit on yours.

159
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,167
And I promise you,
you guys are going to be separated.

160
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,000
Do it, Sarge.

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,083
Orozco and Davis, X Twenty-five.

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,333
Peterson and Washington, X Forty One.

163
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,083
Zavala and Taylor, you got X Thirteen.

164
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,500
Williams and Cho, X Eight.

165
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,333
Alameda and Green, X Twenty-one.

166
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:45,500
Van Houser and Sook, X Four.

167
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,333
Yeah, Sarge?

168
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:47,917
That's not our area.

169
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:48,750
That's not your area?

170
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,583
No, we work Nine.

171
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,333
I'm sorry.

172
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,083
Oh no, you're right.

173
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,083
You're on X Thirteen.

174
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:55,083
Sorry fellas, this isn't Monopoly.

175
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,417
You don't get to choose your real estate.

176
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,167
Now go.

177
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:57,583
Get out.

178
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:02,667
Zavala, try not to kill anybody
before the end of the watch.

179
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,417
Really, Sarge?

180
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,750
Sir, if we kill someone in X Thirteen,
can we go back to X Nine?

181
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,250
Today is a brand new day.

182
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,250
Get the shop, gas the shop, wash the shop.

183
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,833
Make sure day watch didn't leave
behind any surprises for us.

184
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:16,000
Look for guns, drugs, puke.

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Pay attention, Boot.

186
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,500
Goodbye.

187
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,583
Hurry up- Yes sir.

188
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,417
How you doing, Van Houser?

189
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,917
I warned you about that shit.

190
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,667
Where you running with that piece, Boot?

191
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:23,583
What?

192
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,167
Why you so scared?

193
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,083
Go, go!

194
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,583
Jesus Christ!

195
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,500
- Go on, shit.

196
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,083
It's like it's day one.

197
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,750
Boot, slow down with that piece.

198
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:30,583
Slow down!

199
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,333
Orozco, have you been working out?

200
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,167
Yeah, with your mom.

201
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:34,333
Why are you shooting everything?

202
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,750
It's for his class.

203
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,333
I thought you were studying law.

204
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:38,500
Pre-law.

205
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
I need an art elective.

206
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,333
I'm taking filmmaking.

207
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,083
Well, get my good side.

208
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,667
You don't have a good side.

209
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,500
Listen, you know they can subpoena
that shit if something goes sideways, right?

210
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,083
Think twice.

211
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:49,667
Two words.

212
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,083
Erase button.

213
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,083
Two words: Just because you guys think
you're these big ghetto gunfighters now,

214
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,833
don't mean you can be dropping your calls.

215
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,500
That was at least two dozen words.

216
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, I barely got a G.E.D.
so what do you expect, white boy?

217
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:04,417
Saddle up, ladies,
we're sick of holding up your end.

218
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,667
Admit it, you'd hit that shit.

219
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:06,333
Orozco.

220
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,583
Yeah.

221
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,750
With a cinderblock.

222
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,583
Check the roof, Boot.

223
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,250
Where's your shop?

224
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,583
I got Red Bull, Monster, and-

225
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,000
They all say thirteen, check the roof.

226
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,583
Thank you, ma'am.

227
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,833
Faster, Boot, let's go - Get in the car!

228
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:20,083
- Yes sir!

229
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,583
And then I got you some kombucha
because I know you like that stuff.

230
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,333
Fuck that shit!

231
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,000
What is that?

232
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,750
It's good to be back, man.

233
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Old lady was driving me crazy at the casa,
like making me do shit.

234
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:18,542
Oh no!

235
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,583
She dared ask for your help around the house.

236
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,917
That's incredible.

237
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,083
Outrageous.

238
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:25,000
Just because I look like
the dudes from Home Depot,

239
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,333
doesn't mean I do the shit
the dudes from Home Depot do.

240
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,833
I would never profile you as a man
who helps his wife with chores.

241
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:30,417
Shut up.

242
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,208
Dude, I'm your homie.

243
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,250
I would never do that.

244
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,667
Her brother was always coming
over during the day to swim.

245
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,250
Every day.

246
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,917
I hate everything about him.

247
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,542
He smells like weed sometimes.

248
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,417
Like he's got a prescription.

249
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,250
The guy was like: "No, it's all good"
and I was like whatever, get him the hell out of here.

250
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,500
I swear to God I'm filling
in that pool with cement.

251
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,333
Not personally, cause you'll hire
a Home Depot dude for that task.

252
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:55,417
Fuck you.

253
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,500
Thirteen X thirteen.

254
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,833
Four fifteen man at nine seven four two Maple.

255
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,750
Code Two.

256
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,250
Incident four five six two.

257
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,708
Thirteen X thirteen.

258
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,667
Roger, show us enroute.

259
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,000
X thirteen roger.

260
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,167
First customer of the day.

261
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,583
I hope they enjoy our police service.

262
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,208
Suck my dick!

263
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,000
That motherfucker's a lying ass nigger.

264
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:24,500
Fuck him and fuck you too!

265
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,250
Shut your fucking  if you touch me, I will kill you.

266
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,083
Stay where you are.

267
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,250
I don't give a fuck about both you motherfuckers.

268
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:29,917
I'm ready to die today.

269
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:30,750
Fuck y'all.

270
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,208
This can go several ways right now.

271
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,292
It is all about your attitude.

272
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:35,333
Fuck you!

273
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,167
I got my mail!

274
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:36,917
I helped him!

275
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,917
I helped him give me my mail!

276
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,250
I'm getting tired of this shit!

277
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,000
All right.

278
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,083
- I'm not playing with you all.

279
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:45,000
Sir, if you've been drinking, you need to stay the
fuck inside and not intimidate the mailman.

280
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:45,583
That's it.

281
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,250
Fuck you!

282
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,500
You need to shut the fuck up!

283
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,583
- Because without that badge and gun, you ain't shit.

284
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:49,917
- Yeah?

285
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,750
You're less than motherfucking nothing.

286
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,833
You motherfucking border hopping, donkey riding, Mexican motherfucker.

287
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:55,167
- Oh yeah?

288
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:56,083
Is that so?

289
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,500
You want to find out what I'm about?

290
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,417
Show me!

291
00:10:58,417 --> 00:10:58,750
Yeah, I wanna see!

292
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,417
Fuck.

293
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,750
Let's settle this right here like grown men, motherfucker!

294
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:02,917
Not again, man.

295
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:03,333
What'd you say?

296
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,042
You wanna take a fade?

297
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:05,083
You want to fight me?

298
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:05,750
Yeah, I want to fight you.

299
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,458
Let's go, bro.

300
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,125
I whip your punk ass you going to get the fuck out of my crib?

301
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:09,750
Hell no.

302
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,917
But you called me out.

303
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:12,833
Now I'm calling you out.

304
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:13,292
What's up?

305
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:17,000
You whip my ass I'll put those motherfucking handcuffs on my motherfucking self.

306
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,750
And that's on the set.

307
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,500
Door.

308
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,583
It's going to be a pleasure beating your bitch ass.

309
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,500
My fucking fantasy.

310
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,667
I don't know who the fuck you think
you're fucking with, but I love this shit.

311
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,250
To beat a motherfucking punk-ass police ass like yours.

312
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,333
Keep talking.

313
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,000

314
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:41,833
Oh shit.

You like that?

320
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,583
This ain't no wrassling match.

321
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,250
You all right?

322
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:11,667
You all right?

323
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,167
Come on!

324
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:17,750
Oh shit!

325
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:20,250
Come on!

326
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:27,250
That's what happens when you fuck with the police.

327
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,417
Yeah, come on.

328
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:30,917
Take him!

329
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,417
Fuck you, border hopping motherfucker!

330
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,667
You all right?

331
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:49,917
Gimme the hooks.

332
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,667
What's up, putos?

333
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,750
It's big bad Wicked from Curbside Gang Locotes.

334
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:14,750
You ready for this shit?

335
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,667
Fuck yeah.

336
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,583
I was born to fucking do this shit.

337
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:21,000
Show these motherfuckers whose barrio this is.

338
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,333
You almost ran the light, stupid.

339
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:23,750
You're going to get us pulled over, La.

340
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,583
Fuck that shit.

341
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,250
I gotta fucking be at work.

342
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,667
You better not bust out wasting my motherfucking time, I'm gonna tell you that shit right now.

343
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,250
La La, when are you going to fuck the homeboy?

344
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,917
I am not fucking the homeboy, dog.

345
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,917
Shit, what do I look like?

346
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,833
The little fucking paisa hoochies you guys fucking kick it with?

347
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,167
What you packing?

348
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:45,333
I'm packing a motherfucking thirty round clip for these swamp ass niggers.

349
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,167
This is it right here.

350
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,917
Slow down, this is the street.

351
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:48,417
This is it.

352
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,000
All right.

353
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,250
Wicked, you're going to jump
and get the party started, got it?

354
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:51,750
- I got it.

355
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,917
Listen to the homie.

356
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,250
All right, put your fucking face on, let's go!

357
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,083
Get your shit ready.

358
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,667
Put that fucking shit away!

359
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,750
Your fucking shit is good to go.

360
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,333
What the fuck do I have to fucking tell you?

361
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:02,417
I don't want to fucking have to baby you!

362
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,750
OK, ready homies.

363
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,417
Get ready.

364
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:06,167
Get your fucking face on!

365
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:06,500
- All right.

366
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,417
Fuck.

367
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:07,833
You guys ready?

368
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:08,333
- Ready.

369
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,250
All right.

370
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,917
But on some real shit, though,  I wanted to holler at you.

371
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:17,000
All my niggers keep on talking about how you got your ass
whipped by a motherfucking little punk-ass wonton.

372
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,333
No, these niggers is hating.

373
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,667
Let me tell you something.

374
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,417
Me and the cop got  down, right?

375
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:25,083
Motherfucker took off his badge, dropped his  gun.

376
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,500
I mean, he kept it gangster.

377
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,750
We straight up squabbled.

378
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,500
Head up.

379
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,667
But they still took you to the County though?

380
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,250
Yeah, but for disorderly conduct.

381
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,583
Not for squabbling with the police, you feel me?

382
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,417
You fought a cop and they didn't put no assaulting a peace officer on you?

383
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,417
Listen to me, my nigga.

384
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:39,083
I'm trying to tell you all.

385
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,250
They really showed me love to keep it G.

386
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,750
I'm a two time felon, right?

387
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,667
Y'all know that, right?

388
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:46,417
Could have struck me out and gave me life
for fighting that cop, you feel me?

389
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:48,167
I got right out, it wasn't shit.

390
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,750
All right, but we heard you got your ass beat.

391
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,583
You better shut the fuck up, CK.

392
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,917
I'll run this fucking fork up in your ass, I swear to god.

393
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,417
Let me tell you something...

394
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,000
win, lose or draw...

395
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:02,083
...as long as you squabble and get down,
that's gangster, you understand what I'm saying?

396
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:02,500
Yup.

397
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,250
I mean, that Mexican cop might be acting bull with you, Tre...

398
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,417
But he's still out there out there killing niggers.

399
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,250
Straight out.

400
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,167
No no no.

401
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,583
Listen to me, all y'all.

402
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,333
This whole fucking thing is like changing of the guard.

403
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:17,583
Back in the day, all these neighborhoods
used to be black, and what are they now?

404
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,667
Mexicans.

405
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,417
Exactly.

406
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:23,500
There used to be chicken stands on the corner,
and now there's fucking taco stands on every corner.

407
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,583
We're in some real shit and if we don't come together,
we're going to be some extinct niggers pretty soon.

408
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,833
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

409
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,333
Go go go!

410
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,750
Fuck!

411
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:56,917
Fuck yeah!

412
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:58,083
We got those putos!

413
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:58,917
We got them!

414
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,750
Eat shit, motherfuckers!

415
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,417
Fuck!

416
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,750
Show those putos whose neighborhood this fucker is!

417
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:06,583
Shit.

418
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,917
Fucking proud of you.

419
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,667
And that's what I'm fucking telling you.

420
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,333
Good.

421
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,083
That was fucking good.

422
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:13,417
That's what I'm fucking telling you.

423
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,417
I'm proud of you.

424
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,417
Fucking did it.

425
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,167
That's what I'm fucking talking about when I'm fucking proud of you.

426
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:21,833
Fucking proud of you man now you're a fucking man.

427
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:22,750
Right?

428
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,583
Right, homie.

429
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,083
- Right?

430
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:24,750
Right.

431
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,167
- All right then.

432
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,167
No fucking fear.

433
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:28,500
No fucking fear.

434
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,083
That's how we fucking do it.

435
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,333
That's how we fucking do it.

436
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,167
Call the motherfucking ambulance!

437
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,417
They got CK!

438
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:38,583
Somebody call a fucking ambulance!

439
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,750
Bitch ass sewer rats was from Curbside.

440
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,917
I seen them.

441
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:43,917
Fucking Ese's are serving us.

442
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:45,083
Curbside's serving us.

443
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,083
Curbside's banging all over us on Bloods.

444
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,083
You got that chopper?

445
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,083
Let's go hit these little punk ass fools.

446
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:50,917
Cut that fucking camera off!

447
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:06,750
So this is what we believe to be the Code thirty-seven vehicle used in the drive-by last night.

448
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,917
Curbside Gang's at it again.

449
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:09,000
It fits the description.

450
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,000
It comes back as stolen.

451
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:14,667
Curbside likes these vehicles because they blend in,
you can put a lot of people in them.

452
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,417
This door slides back, and the gang members open fire.

453
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:23,417
The victim was a male black from a Blood set that has basically
been at war with this Hispanic gang over control of narcotic sales.

454
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:23,583
Partner.

455
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,417
Yeah.

456
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,583
What's up?

457
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,167
- Check this out.

458
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh shit.

459
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,333
Those are shell casings.

460
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:35,083
Detectives told us that three different weapons were used
and we're seeing at least two kinds of shells, so... Shit.

461
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,167
What's up?

462
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,417
Those are the Homicide Detectives working the case.

463
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,417
The hell's this?

464
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:42,083
What?

465
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,000
Candid Camera?

466
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,750
No sir, it's just a project I'm working on.

467
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,167
Yeah?

468
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:45,667
Yeah.

469
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,583
I don't want to see that.

470
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:50,125
There are forty-five and nine millimeter shell casings inside.

471
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:51,083
How do you know that?

472
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,583
Did you touch them?

473
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,250
No sir.

474
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,667
Did you fuck up my vehicle?

475
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:55,333
No sir.

476
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,542
- Sir, we found it, we called you.

477
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:02,250
The big dogs are here now, so set up some
yellow tape and stand on the other side of it.

478
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,417
It's been two hours, we're still waiting for the detectives
to release the scene so we can go back on patrol.

479
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:08,917
Comfortable footwear.

480
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,333
Policing is all about comfortable footwear.

481
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,000
Officer Van Houser.

482
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,583
Good evening.

483
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:26,750
Sarge said I should relieve you guys so you can go
back to being the street gods that you are.

484
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,750
I'm down with that.

485
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:31,833
On the street.

486
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,333
Watch the street.

487
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,917
Make sure no assholes come up here and kill us.

488
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,583
Yes sir.

489
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:40,750
Fucking Christ.

490
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,083
Officer Van Houser, have you made a difference today?

491
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,542
You know I see you guys out here, you're being good little company men, aren't you?

492
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,917
Are you doing the Lord's work?

493
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:53,917
And you're making a difference, as you call it.

494
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:58,250
It's all fun and games to you, you get to run and jump and fight and shoot.

495
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:05,000
One day the LAPD is going to bend you over your
black and white... and they are going to fuck you up the ass.

496
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:13,958
They are going to fuck you so long and so hard...
you're going to want to eat your gun just to make it stop.

497
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:22,167
And if you don't eat your gun and the fucking somehow
magically stops...they're going to give you freeway therapy.

498
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:25,167
You're going to end up doing West End Valley daywatch.

499
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:31,750
Spending two hours every day on the fucking freeway
just thinking about the fucking that they gave you.

500
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,000
Bad guys attack from up front.

501
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,250
The department comes in from the rear.

502
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:38,583
Watch your six.

503
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,583
I'm ready.

504
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,167
This may say Purell but It's really K-Y.

505
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,917
Officer Zavala.

506
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,417
That's funny.

507
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,542
You kids have fun out there.

508
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:53,250
The LAPD's got a big fucking cock.

509
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,583
You've got a big heart.

510
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,583
Thank you for sharing that.

511
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,833
Can't wait to get it up the ass.

512
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:07,167
Are you going to hook up with a Mexican girl?

513
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,250
Quit trying to hook me up with one of them.

514
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,083
It'd be great if you did but--

515
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:11,917
I get it, man.

516
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:12,583
Shit.

517
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,833
Sweet brown sugar.

518
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,125
You should marry one of my cousins.

519
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:23,333
If they're anything like you I wouldn't be able
to stand a fucking hour with them.

520
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,000
Waking up in the morning, they'd be like...

521
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,917
"Hey, can I tell you a story?"

522
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:29,000
I know.

523
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,417
Here's a story about this and a story about that
and a story about this and a story about that 

524
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:35,875
But all you gotta do is this...

525
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,750
You want to come to my cousin's quinceanera?

526
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,042
My daughter's quinceanera?

527
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:41,167
My brother's quinceanera?

528
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:41,875
Yeah.

529
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,250
My sister's quinceanera?

530
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:45,500
There's always something happening, though, bro.

531
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,250
It's better than like Hey, do you know
the new kind of flavored coffee I have?

532
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,125
Do you like this kind of coffee?

533
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:50,917
Oh really?

534
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,167
Shut the fuck up.

535
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,333
The baristas are excellent.

536
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,417
You like fucking coffee, don't give me that shit.

537
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:56,667
I like fucking good Starbucks coffee.

538
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,083
Whatever.

539
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:57,917
I'll let you lay into me.

540
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,500
Lay into me.

541
00:20:58,542 --> 00:20:59,833
Fine.

542
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,583
Thirteen x-ray thirteen.

543
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:03,667
Missing juvenile.

544
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,292
Two seven one seven Jefferson.

545
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:08,542
Code Incident five seven five five and thirteen twenty-seven.

546
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,333
Thirteen x-ray thirteen, we're going
to be Code Six on the missing juvenile.

547
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:14,750
I can't see dick.

548
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,000
Hi.

549
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,500
We got a call about some missing children.

550
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,167
Yes, my babies are gone.

551
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:25,917
All right.

552
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:26,792
My babies are gone.

553
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:27,500
You want to let us in?

554
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:27,917
We can talk.

555
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:28,625
We can have that conversation.

556
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:29,917
OK.

557
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:31,667
My babies are gone.

558
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,917
They've been missing all night.

559
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:33,750
And I've been here.

560
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,083
Why don't you just step over here for a second, ok?

561
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,583
Officer, we're wasting time.

562
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,417
Let me see your hands.

563
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:38,667
How many children are missing?

564
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:39,583
Two.

565
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,917
A boy and a girl.

566
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,917
What are the ages of the children that are missing?

567
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:44,417
One is...

568
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:46,750
one and the other be three.

569
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,375
Sir!

570
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:48,500
Somebody took them.

571
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:49,500
Let me see your hands, please.

572
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,583
Maybe it was when I went to the bathroom.

573
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,250
Let me see your hands.

574
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:51,917
Someone quick quick quick.

575
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:52,292
OK ma'm

576
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:52,958
In and out

577
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:53,333
- All right.

578
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:53,625
Ok.

579
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,083
All right.

580
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:54,375
All right.

581
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:56,000
Hands behind your head.

582
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,417
I've been here all night.

583
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,542
Officer, we're good here.

584
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:00,583
Don't say anything to them.

585
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,000
I know, but they're not here.

586
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,667
They're gone.

587
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:03,250
The babies are gone.

588
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,083
What did you say?

589
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,250
I'm going to check the house, ok?

590
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,167
Listen to me, officer.

591
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,583
I'm trying to tell you.

592
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,333
I've looked-

593
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:08,708
The kids are with their grandma.

594
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:08,917
Is this your husband?

595
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:10,583
No, that's not my husband.

596
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:11,500
Sit the fuck down!Sit the fuck down!

597
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:12,583
I've been looking.

598
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,542
I understand.

599
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:14,042
I'm going to check the house.

600
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,792
Sometimes children can hide under a bed or in a closet.

601
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,625
You can talk to my partner.

602
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,792
You're wasting time!

603
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,750
The kids are at grandma's!

604
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:20,958
The kids are not here!

605
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,583
If you can please go outside and get my kids.

606
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:24,583
Talk to my partner.

607
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:26,083
Stop, don't push me!

608
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:27,583
My babies are missing!

609
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,583
Let me see some type of warrant.

610
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,250
You got a warrant?

611
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:30,583
Let me see some type of warrant.

612
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,917
We don't need a warrant, she let us in.

613
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,208
Why the fuck did you say anything?

614
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,292
You stupid  why the fuck did you say anything?

615
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,833
Sit down-

616
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,750
I was going to get a cigarette.

617
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,333
Not right now.

618
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:41,333
I'm trying to tell you, the kids are with their grandma, ok?

619
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,208
I heard you.

620
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:43,917
They're with the grandma.

621
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:48,917
Would you please listen to me, Officer?

622
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:50,000
Let me see some type of warrant.

623
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:53,833
You shut the fuck up!

624
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:55,417
Why the hell did you let them in here?

625
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,583
Press charges on this motherfucker!

626
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,917
You fucking bitch, I'm going to kill you!

627
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,333
I'm going to kill you, motherfucker!

628
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:01,250
Get the fuck off me!

629
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,083
What the fuck's happening?

630
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:03,917
Wait a minute!

631
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:04,583
- All right, all right!

632
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,833
Did you head what I said to you?

633
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:06,417
Did you hear what I said to you?

634
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,500
You just let me know how clear I have to make myself to you.

635
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,000
Why don't you open your fucking mouth and tell me how clear I have to make myself to you.

636
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,417
Partner!

637
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:12,750
Partner!

638
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,917
Get off him.

639
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:16,167
Brian, what's up?

640
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,583
You ok, partner?

641
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,000
What's happening, Brian?

642
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,000
Fuck you, you dumb-ass smoker bitch!

643
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,583
I'm going to kick you in the fucking face!

644
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,083
I found the kids.

645
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:24,833
Fucking crackhead.

646
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,333
It's ok, it's ok.

647
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,000
You're ok now.

648
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:40,917
I'm just gonna  oh shit.

649
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:43,750
It's ok.

650
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,917
It's ok, sweetie.

651
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:45,333
All right.

652
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:48,417
Hey buddy, stay still.

653
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,750
All right, you're ok now.

654
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:54,167
You're ok.

655
00:23:58,667 --> 00:23:59,417
Come here, come here.

656
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:00,000
You ok?

657
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,833
You gonna take care of your sister?

658
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Fucking kids.

659
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,500
It's so funny.

660
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:55,417
It's so funny to text.

661
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:56,083
Who are you texting?

662
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:56,667
That same bitch?

663
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,000
Dude, yeah.

664
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,667
She's smart.

665
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,167
She's like the first girl I can have a conversation with.

666
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,500
You know she has a Master of Science in Fluid Hydraulics.

667
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,583
Fluid Hydraulics?

668
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:07,167
Yes.

669
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:09,583
I wouldn't brag about that.

670
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:12,833
That she has a master's degree in Fluid Hydraulics.

671
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:13,667
I date all these girls, man.

672
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:14,667
They're smoking hot.

673
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,417
Your little fucking badge bunnies

674
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:17,917
I get laid without a badge, thank you very much.

675
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,083
Because you were in the Marines.

676
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:21,417
Don't ask don't tell.

677
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,250
There's a pattern.

678
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,667
An M.O. here.

679
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:26,000
First date is dinner and a respectful kiss.

680
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,917
Second date is dinner, full carnal knowledge.

681
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:35,083
And then third date is dinner and uncomfortable silences when I try to discuss anything of merit.

682
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,583
Then it's two or three booty calls and it's on to the next.

683
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:44,333
Ok, I went to prom and I got married a week later.

684
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:47,583
And I ain't tapped anybody but Old Faithful for like eight years.

685
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:50,333
So I don't know what you're tripping about.

686
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,000
Ok.

687
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Wait, look at me real quick.

688
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,667
aha

689
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:53,750
Ok, ready?

690
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,167
Yeah.

691
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:55,917
I want somebody to talk to.

692
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Not just sleep with.

693
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Do you fucking understand what I'm saying?

694
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:00,083
Oh.

695
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,583
Yeah.

696
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:02,667
Jesus, dude.

697
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:06,500
White people get hung up on this fucking soul mate bullshit.

698
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,167
Just hook up with a chick that can cook and wants kids.

699
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:12,667
Some bitch that's down for you, that won't fuck your friends, and you're straight.

700
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:18,417
You're the smartest motherfucker I know, you're not going to find some chick that's as smart as you.

701
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:21,917
Really?

702
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,083
Yeah, what?

703
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:23,750
Really?

704
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:27,750
I'm sorry the perfect girl wasn't dumped
in front of me when I was eighteen years old.

705
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,667
Do you talk to Gabby?

706
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,500
Do you even have discussions with the girl?

707
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:34,333
Do you want me to translate that into fucking His- Spanish?

708
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:35,500
Into Hispanic?

709
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,667
Whatever the fuck it is.

710
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,500
Yeah, what do you think, we're mutes?

711
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:42,917
And we just .... like sign to each other?

712
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:44,500
Yeah we talk, stupid.

713
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
Gabby's a trip.

714
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,417
You know she's a trip.

715
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,000
You should hear the shit that comes out of her mouth.

716
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,500
You know what?

717
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,583
She would be great on Jeopardy.

718
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:51,167
She's way smarter than I am.

719
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,167
All right, so you see what I'm talking about.

720
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:54,000
That's all I want

721
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,083
I know you want a chick like my girl,
but I'll kill you if you touch her.

722
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:57,667
Fuck!

723
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:58,500
I'm going to kill you!

724
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,750
Shut up!

725
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:05,250
What's this chick's name?

726
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,500
You don't deserve to fucking know her name.

727
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,333
Dude, fuck that!

728
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,667
Jannet.

729
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:13,583
Did you run her?

730
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,500
Yes, she's clean.

731
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,917
She's kind of the complete package.

732
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
We're going out again.

733
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:25,583
Saturday's my little sister's quinceanera.

734
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:27,417
You should roll through with Jannet from another planet.

735
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:30,250
The shit's going to be hardcore Mexican, though.

736
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,333
You know how my familia rolls.

737
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,500
Hey, mija.

738
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:09,500
What's up?

739
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:13,833
Come here, baby girl. Drink the Jim Jones, baby, come on.

740
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:17,250
Hey baby?

741
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,500
Tell me something.

742
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:20,167
You ever fucked on heroin?

743
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,667
Yeah right.

744
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,000
I could fuck forever on that shit.

745
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,250
I'll eat your pussy for hours, girl.

746
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,833
Get the fuck over here.

747
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,167
Fuck that fool, he's crazy, he's tripping.

748
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,333
You're my fucking lady.

749
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:35,167
I'll buy you shit.

750
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,417
You see this shit right here?

751
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,833
It's fucking money.

752
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,917
Real shit.

753
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:42,083
What you like?

754
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:45,000
Come here.

755
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,583
Ok.

756
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:49,000
Any Newton unit.

757
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,833
Five oh seven party.

758
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:51,250
Three six four five Trinity Street.

759
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,167
Incident thirty eight ninety and RD thirteen seventy-six.

760
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,000
X nine, send me the call

761
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,083
X Nine roger.

762
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:59,917
X twenty five shows code six of x nine.

763
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,500
Twenty-five roger.

764
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,083
X thirteen, we're going to be code six on the party call.

765
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:03,833
X thirteen, roger.

766
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,000
Cops!

767
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,917
Cops!

768
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:23,667
OFFICER Keep your eyes wide, this place is assholed up.

769
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:25,167
Clear the car.

770
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:38,000
Put that shit away.

771
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:40,833
Put that down

772
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:49,083
What's the occasion?

773
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:57,667
Can you turn down the music?

774
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:05,917
Have some respect, La La.

775
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,583
Don't light up in front of us.

776
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,583
Why don't you take a hit, mija.

777
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:10,750
It'll chill you out.

778
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,583
It'll be like back in the days.

779
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:13,750
Remember?

780
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,833
No, I don't remember shit.

781
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:16,250
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

782
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:16,917
I said put it out.

783
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:21,167
You know you want this, pig.

784
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,917
I wouldn't fucking touch that
if you were the last bitch on earth.

785
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,167
Fuck you.

786
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:27,167
No, fuck you.

787
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:28,167
Why don't you take a seat.

788
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,000
You look in the mirror, you're just a common
fucking gangster bitch (on) like all the rest.

789
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,417
Lock it up, Orozco.

790
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:33,250
Why don't you sit your ass down.

791
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,083
Why don't you do what the fuck they tell you, puppet?

792
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:35,833
Want me to make you?

793
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,500
Lock it up, partner.

794
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,500
You know what?

795
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,500
I'll fucking sit down now.

796
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Thank you.

797
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,750
Thank you very much.

798
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:58,000
So Mr. Big Evil... why do they call you Big Evil?

799
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:03,667
Because ... my evil is big.

800
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,167
Can you turn down the music,
because we got a noise complaint or some shit.

801
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,167
Then you go faster.

802
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,333
I am nailing this.

803
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:23,833
Hey bro.

804
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:24,167
Hey.

805
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:26,750
Hi baby.

806
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,250
Cindy, what's up?

807
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,750
I wanted to introduce you to Janet.

808
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,417
Hi. It's so nice to meet you.

809
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,167
Happy birthday.

810
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:32,500
You look beautiful.

811
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,250
Thank you.

812
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:34,750
Pick up your dress so you don't step on it.

813
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,250
Yeah.

814
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:35,750
You look beautiful.

815
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,333
I gotta go.

816
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:36,750
Bye!

817
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,333
Bye

818
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:37,833
All grown up.

819
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:38,667
He spoils her.

820
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,917
But I want to give you the lowdown.

821
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,167
I'm listening.

822
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,167
Everybody here is pretty much family.

823
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:44,250
Like somehow.

824
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:45,667
They're all Mexican family.

825
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:51,167
You got cousins and you got aunts and uncles just like everything
else and then you got cousins' cousins. And then you have Brian.

826
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,333
You stick around, you're going to see someone throw up.

827
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:55,333
Couple fights.

828
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:56,167
It's fun.

829
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:56,750
It's fun.

830
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:57,667
Enough, enough.

831
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,083
I'm sorry.

832
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,833
Well, I'm Irish, so it's the same thing..

833
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:03,167
Big families, and no one gets divorced.

834
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:04,500
And they all wear purple.

835
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,917
Well, less purple... but just as much beer.

836
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:10,750
They get way too drunk and get in fistfights.

837
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:11,417
Yeah, same here.

838
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,583
But you mess with one person
you have the whole family after you.

839
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:14,667
That's the way to do it.

840
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:15,667
There you go.

841
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,833
You just described Mexican people.

842
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:17,917
Can I feel it?

843
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,917
Is that ok?

844
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:20,167
Yeah, he's actually kicking a lot right now.

845
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,667
And I think his feet are right there.

846
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,167
Do you feel it?

847
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:25,500
Wow.

848
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,583
Oh my god.

849
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,083
I like her, Brian.

850
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:29,333
Buddy.

851
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:30,500
How long have you know Brian?.

852
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,417
Three years.

853
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,333
He and Mike went to the Academy together.

854
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:34,333
Right.

855
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,750
Brian, it's you.

856
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:41,333
Hi.

857
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,250
I'm going to try not to wake you up.

858
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,917
I can't believe that I stayed over.

859
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,833
This is interesting.

860
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,583
I have never shot one before.

861
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:05,500
Maybe that could be our next date.

862
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:11,750
I did go through your wallet.

863
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,417
I'm sorry.

864
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,833
I am naturally curious.

865
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:16,000
I hope that's ok.

866
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,917
Gotta love a guys who has a picture of his mom in his wallet.

867
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,417
This?

868
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:35,000
Kristin, Mia, Raquel, etcetera, etcetera.
You won't be needing this anymore.

869
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:45,333
You were drooling.

870
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,333
What are we looking for again?

871
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:06,083
All the food groups: dope, money and guns.

872
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,333
The ghetto will provide.

873
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,667
Fucking Sarge.

874
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,292
Serge, We're staking out Curbside.

875
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:20,500
They're going to spot your unit.

876
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:21,833
You think they don't know you're here?

877
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,417
Van Hauser wants to file a complaint on you, Taylor.

878
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,125
The USS Van Hauser?

879
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:30,417
LAPD's stealthiest submarine,
only surfaces at the end of watch?

880
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:32,500
He said you were videotaping him.

881
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,000
What did I tell you about that shit?

882
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:36,500
Why is he such a bitter dude?

883
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,333
If he hates pushing the black and white so much, why doesn't he just leave his badge

884
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:41,958
on the watch commander's desk and go home and eat a bowl of dicks?

885
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,667
Have some empathy for this man.

886
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:48,167
Taylor, I gotta put in m log that I verbally
counseled you about this fucking camera.

887
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:48,917
What?

888
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,417
I was documenting a crime scene.

889
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,750
Have a good day, ladies.

890
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:52,917
Take it easy.

891
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:11,750
Is that Big Evil's mom right there?

892
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,500
His mom?

893
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:13,208
Yeah, that's Mrs.Evil.

894
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,000
Who's the cowboy?

895
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,333
I don't know.

896
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,250
He's got money, look at his truck.

897
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:21,333
I'm going to run him.

898
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:22,417
You want to jam this fool?

899
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:23,375
Yes I do.

900
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:27,542
Plate's clean.

901
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:29,167
Shit.

902
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:30,667
What's our PC?

903
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,583
That stupid CD hanging from his rearview mirror,
obstructing his vision.

904
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,750
Let's do this.

905
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,750
All right-.

906
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:50,333
Come on, fucker.

907
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,417
Wait wait wait.

908
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:54,917
Light them up.

909
00:37:55,833 --> 00:38:00,083
Thirteen-x-ray-thirteen,
we're code six on three nine street east of Wall.

910
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:03,208
License plate four boy one seven three two.

911
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:04,167
Grey Dodge pickup.

912
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,083
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

913
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,375
Let's get this fucker.

914
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:24,667
We stopped you because a CD is hanging
from your mirror. Get out of the truck.

915
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:25,000
Gun!

916
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:32,375
Get the fuck out of the car.
Get the fuck out of the car.

917
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:35,500
You good, partner?

918
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:36,542
I'm good.

919
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:41,000
X twenty five shows code six with x thirteen.

920
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:43,042
Thirteen x two five, roger.

921
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,333
You ok?

922
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,167
***

923
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,333
Transport this son of a bitch.

924
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,000
No problem.

925
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,542
Check out this motherfucker's burner.

926
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:03,167
Holy shit.

927
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,167
He's got more bling than the old lady's wedding ring.

928
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:11,500
A cell.

929
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,333
You don't have any holes in you?

930
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:14,417
I'm good.

931
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,417
Let's toss the truck.

932
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:18,500
Who was he shooting at?

933
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:19,583
What?

934
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:20,750
Who was he shooting at?

935
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:21,500
Me.

936
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:23,250
That's fucked up.

937
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:28,917
Air eleven, show us responding.

938
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:39,917
Fucking ... soup.

939
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:45,417
What's up?

940
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,583
That's big money right there.

941
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:51,542
Shit.

942
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:58,333
Oh shit.

943
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:03,750
What the fuck is it?

944
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:05,917
Homeboy's a player.

945
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:08,417
We got a surprise for you.

946
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:10,917
Liberace's AK.

947
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:20,750
Holy shit.

948
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:27,333
Here we have two of the major food groups:
money and guns.

949
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,667
This is the lifeblood of our organization.

950
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:31,500
Paperwork.

951
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:38,083
The way red corpuscles carry oxygen through the body
paperwork carries information through the department.

952
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:40,417
What are corpuscles?

953
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:41,083
Evening, guys.

954
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,625
How you doing, captain?

955
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:44,667
Sir.

956
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:45,000
So this is it?

957
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,667
These are the guns you took off the Cowboy?

958
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,583
Yes sir.

959
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:48,292
Mind if I pick them up?

960
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,208
Fancy.

961
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,417
That's some nice hardware.

962
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,000
I heard he took a shot at you.

963
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,500
Are you ok?

964
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,250
Yeah, I'm fine.

965
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:56,833
I'm good.

966
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,667
Liberace's AK.

967
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,000
Looks like Liberace's AK.

968
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,167
Keep up the good work, guys.

969
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:03,917
I really appreciate it.

970
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,667
Carry on.

971
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:05,583
Thank you.

972
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:06,292
Good evening, sir.

973
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,042
Good night, Van Hauser.

974
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:08,000
Evening, sir.

975
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:10,750
Why do you get nervous?

976
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,333
Women want him, men want to be him, man.

977
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:13,292
He's just

978
00:41:13,292 --> 00:41:13,667
Yeah, I know.

979
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,417
But you want him.

980
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,917
I'm not gay, but I'd go down on him if he asked.

981
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:20,500
Sometimes I don't know when you're kidding.

982
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
And I have to know when you're kidding.

983
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:23,833
I'm not kidding.

984
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:25,042
I gotta know when you're kidding.

985
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:25,583
I'm not kidding.

986
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,583
I gotta go.

987
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,583
I'm taking Janet to the Philharmonic.

988
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,750
Enjoy your white people shit.

989
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,167
Thanks, I'll bring you back a burrito.

990
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,333
No problem.

One more time.

997
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,583
Stop.

998
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,833
Stop, man, fuck.

999
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,667
What are you going to say to the taxpayers
when you crash the fucking car?

1000
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,917
Drink more coffee.

1001
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:44,333
I'm on my ninth fucking Red Bull.

1002
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:47,333
We got a fire.

1003
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:48,000
Where?

1004
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:48,583
Go left.

1005
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:52,000
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen,
we're code six on a structure fire.

1006
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:52,750
What's that address?

1007
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:53,583
One zero zero two.

1008
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:56,250
One zero zero two Sixth Street.

1009
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,417
Go ahead and send RA and fire.

1010
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:00,000
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

1011
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:08,500
My babies- my babies are in there!

1012
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:08,833
Where?

1013
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:11,167
They're upstairs in the bedroom.

1014
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:12,500
Z, no!

1015
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:14,833
Wait for fire!

1016
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:15,917
Fuck!

1017
00:43:20,917 --> 00:43:21,833
Over there, kids room.

1018
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:22,583
Shit.

1019
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:26,417
It's the kids' room, come on!

1020
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:35,583
Come here.

1021
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:39,500
Come here, come here.

1022
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,333
Go with him!

1023
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:40,958
- Come on!

1024
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,583
Come here.

1025
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:42,792
Wrap your arms around me.

1026
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:18,458
Wrap your legs around me.

1027
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:18,458
You got it.

1028
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:43,500
There you go.

1029
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:45,083
I'm going down!

1030
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,000
Come on, come on, come on.

1031
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,667
Come on.

1032
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,000
Yup.

1033
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:50,167
You all right?

1034
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:50,667
I'm good.

1035
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:51,083
I'm good.

1036
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,000
Come on.

1037
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:52,833
Go go go!

1038
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:53,917
I'm going.

1039
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,833
Fuck!

1040
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:57,833
Come on, put your head right here.

1041
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,667
Come down!

1042
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:02,500
Let's go!

1043
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:02,750
Let's go!

1044
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:03,375
Come on!

1045
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,625
Where's my baby girl?

1046
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:10,917
Where is she?

1047
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,583
Wait, lady, you got more kids?

1048
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:14,500
My girl.

1049
00:44:14,542 --> 00:44:15,500
She's two.

1050
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:16,917
Oh shit.

1051
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:18,250
No! Z, no!

1052
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,667
Come on!

1053
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,167
Go, go go, get up!

1054
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,000
Fuck it's hot.

1055
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,083
God damn it!

1056
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:39,417
Come here, babe.

1057
00:44:39,417 --> 00:44:40,167
Come here.

1058
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,750
Cover her face.

1059
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,250
Put that blanket around her face.

1060
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:44,667
I got her.

1061
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:48,583
I can't breathe.

1062
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:52,500
Come on, go go go.

1063
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:53,875
I can't see.

1064
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,250
Where you at?

1065
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,167
I'm right here.

1066
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:56,833
Follow the light.

1067
00:44:57,917 --> 00:44:58,667
I can't see you.

1068
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,167
I'm right here.

1069
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:04,667
Come on.

1070
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:05,583
I got it.

1071
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:06,625
I got her.

1072
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:07,667
Shit.

1073
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,167
I'm going down.

1074
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,000
Come on.

1075
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,250
All right.

1076
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:23,667
Stay still.

1077
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,083
Fuck, I got it.

1078
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:36,917
I fucking can't see out of my...

1079
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:50,500
Where's Z?

1080
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,833
I'm right here.

1081
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,917
I'm going to check you out, sit down right here.

1082
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Can you open your eyes?

1083
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,750
You all right?

1084
00:45:57,833 --> 00:45:58,917
Give me a bottle of water.

1085
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,333
Get the fuck away!

1086
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:05,333
I'm right here.

1087
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:06,167
I'm right here.

1088
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:07,583
Get away, get away.

1089
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:08,667
I'm right here.

1090
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,500
Fuck.

1091
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,167
Get away.

1092
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,917
I'm right here.

1093
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,917
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

1094
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:13,833
Don't fucking freak out.

1095
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:16,417
Shut up, shut up We're good, we're good.

1096
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:17,000
Shut up.

1097
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:36,167
For their selfless actions and their exemplary service to the citizens of this city... the Medal of Valor is presented to Officer Brian Taylor.

1098
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,833
and Officer Miguel Zavala.

1099
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
What's up, Sandra?

1100
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:58,083
Hi Brian.

1101
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,250
You feel like a hero?

1102
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:07,583
What?

1103
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:10,417
You feel like a hero?

1104
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:13,500
No.

1105
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,583
Yeah, me neither.

1106
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,500
What's a hero feel like?

1107
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,250
I don't know.

1108
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:33,750
Did I tell you that me and Gabby
got into a huge fight over the fire?

1109
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:36,333
Nope, you didn't tell me that.

1110
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:46,167
She's like you could have died for someone
else's kid when ours hasn't even been born yet.

1111
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:48,250
She's like you're not a fireman.

1112
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,583
Janet said the same thing.

1113
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:51,417
Yeah?

1114
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:56,917
I don't think I can go into another burning building.

1115
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,250
I only went in because you did.

1116
00:47:59,917 --> 00:48:01,083
Now you know.

1117
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:13,083
All right, dickhead, what is it?

1118
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,500
You remember that cowboy with the blinged out AK?

1119
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:24,167
Yeah, he's probably my cousin.

1120
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,750
I crisscrossed some numbers on his cell.

1121
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,417
Couple addresses come up in our basic area.

1122
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:28,750
You're not a detective.

1123
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:29,833
That guy is something.

1124
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:30,417
He's into something.

1125
00:48:30,417 --> 00:48:31,583
Oh really, you think?

1126
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:35,333
DA didn't buy the ADW and only filed on the weapons beef.

1127
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:38,167
Gang Unit says they'll get it him
but they're too busy or some shit.

1128
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,500
And Narco's not interested because we didn't find dope.

1129
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:42,500
Yeah, but you're not a detective.

1130
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:43,583
You're not a fireman.

1131
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:44,250
Fuck you.

1132
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,250
Follow me into the house, dude.

1133
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,000
I said you're not a detective.

1134
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:49,917
I want to be a detective.

1135
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:50,583
You wanna be?

1136
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:51,833
Follow me into the house, dude.

1137
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:53,250
Follow me into the house.

1138
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,417
Follow me into the house.

1139
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:12,333
Thirteen-x-thirteen with a code six
at ninethree one eight five three street.

1140
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,583
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

1141
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:31,500
The fuck?

1142
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:33,250
What the fuck?

1143
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:36,583
This is weird.

1144
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,833
Thirteen x-ray thirteen, you need to send us additional unit.

1145
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:55,917
Thirteen-x-thirteen is requesting two additional units for a building search at one zero zero two six street.

1146
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:09,417
It's ok, it's ok.

1147
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:10,417
it's ok.

1148
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:11,750
Open the door.

1149
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,333
It's ok. Goodbye.

1150
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:15,667
Fuck this guy.

1151
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:26,500
Get that shit out of here.

1152
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,583
I know what that means.

1153
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:30,500
Shut the fuck up.

1154
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,500
Spread your legs.

1155
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,000
Spread your fucking legs.

1156
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:40,250
Put your fucking head back.

1157
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:43,333
Gun, partner.

1158
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:44,250
Oh yeah?

1159
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,000
Get your fucking head back.

1160
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:57,500
Another gun, partner.

1161
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,500
Two?

1162
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:04,167
Wads of cash.

1163
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:06,583
Tell him to get on his knees.

1164
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,000
Get the fuck over here.

1165
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,750
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen.

1166
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:17,583
We've got one in custody.

1167
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:19,083
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

1168
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,250
All right, we're good.

1169
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,250
All right.

1170
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:31,417
What do we got?

1171
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:34,583
Check it out, partner.

1172
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,917
I got this motherfucker.

1173
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:46,833
Oh my god.

1174
00:52:12,917 --> 00:52:13,750
Take my buddy.

1175
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:15,500
What the fuck, Zavala, you catch them, I clean them?

1176
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,417
Take him.

1177
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:19,500
I don't know, we got like-

1178
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:21,917
I'm going to go outside.

1179
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:22,667
Z, you good?

1180
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:23,167
I'm good.

1181
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,583
Z!

1182
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:24,250
I'm good.

1183
00:52:26,417 --> 00:52:28,500
What are you doing with all these people?

1184
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,500
You're a fucking asshole.

1185
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:30,583
Asshole.

1186
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:31,500
What the fuck?

1187
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:34,500
Federal agents.

1188
00:52:34,917 --> 00:52:35,750
Who's in charge here?

1189
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:36,750
Are you in charge?

1190
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:37,833
What the fuck.

1191
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:38,833
I need to know who's in charge here.

1192
00:52:38,917 --> 00:52:40,333
Is this man under arrest?

1193
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:40,917
Yes sir.

1194
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,333
What are the charges against this man?

1195
00:52:42,417 --> 00:52:43,917
Turn that fucking camera off.

1196
00:52:43,917 --> 00:52:44,333
It's off.

1197
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:45,083
Get that fucking camera off me.

1198
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,333
You guys fucked up.

1199
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:49,417
Just lost a POI because of you guys.

1200
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:50,750
Are we clear in there?

1201
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,417
Clear.

1202
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,500
What the fuck?

1203
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,000
What did we fuck up?

1204
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:55,917
I don't fucking know, dude.

1205
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,417
Who the fuck is this guy?

1206
00:52:57,417 --> 00:52:58,417
I don't fucking know.

1207
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:24,417
We have one POI.

1208
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:26,917
I just want to fucking talk to this guy.

1209
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:27,750
Let's just get out of here.

1210
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,167
I just want to fucking talk to him just for a second.

1211
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,083
Go ahead.

1212
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:38,250
I don't want to cause any trouble here, but we just fucking  we rolled up here, I don't know what's going on.

1213
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,750
This is the second cowboy like this we've run into in a week.

1214
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,333
Watch out for these guys.

1215
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:44,000
They operate by a different set of rules.

1216
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,583
I know I'm just a ghetto street cop but you've got to give me something here.

1217
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:50,250
We've got indicators he's a runner for the Sinaloa Cartel.

1218
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:52,333
We ran him, he came up clean.

1219
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:56,083
You guys don't have the proper clearance for any of this information, but I'm going to throw you a bone.

1220
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:58,083
Cartels are operating here.

1221
00:53:58,083 --> 00:53:59,167
We're on it.

1222
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,083
Be careful.

1223
00:54:00,083 --> 00:54:01,583
What does that mean though?

1224
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:04,750
It means you and your homeboy need to power down.

1225
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:08,833
Because you just tugged on the tail of the snake and it's going to turn around and bite you back.

1226
00:54:08,917 --> 00:54:10,000
I'm throwing you a bone here.

1227
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,500
Be grateful for what I'm giving you.

1228
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,167
I'm giving you a warning.

1229
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,750
Lay low.

1230
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:16,333
Can I get your name for my log.?

1231
00:54:16,417 --> 00:54:17,583
Negative, move along.

1232
00:54:18,917 --> 00:54:19,750
Yeah, all right.

1233
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,000
You know there's five year old kids in there?

1234
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,250
For six months?

1235
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:26,167
Good bye.

1236
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,500
Get off the crime scene.

1237
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,333
Go home.

1238
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:28,750
Bye.

1239
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:29,500
Have a nice night.

1240
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,500
Yeah. Fucking feds.

1241
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:31,833
Z, what the fuck?

1242
00:54:31,917 --> 00:54:32,833
Fuck them.

1243
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,042
I didn't think that shit came over here.

1244
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:51,458
Kids, women.

1245
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,583
Did you see that fucking toilet?

1246
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:53,583
Filled up with shit.

1247
00:54:56,917 --> 00:54:58,792
We had no fucking business being there.

1248
00:54:58,792 --> 00:54:59,917
We didn't even have a call there.

1249
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:01,667
I didn't know what we were fucking rolling up on.

1250
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,125
You think I knew what we were rolling up on?

1251
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,917
It's human trafficking.

1252
00:55:42,792 --> 00:55:43,583
He's so cute.

1253
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:45,125
You did so good.

1254
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:47,750
I love this smell.

1255
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,083
Just hold his head a little bit.

1256
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:52,375
I am.

1257
00:55:52,458 --> 00:55:53,125
He's fine.

1258
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:57,083
You gotta hold him like this, like a football.

1259
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:58,750
I know how to hold a baby.

1260
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,833
Babe, please.

1261
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:05,458
Like that.

1262
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:06,500
Hey.

1263
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,167
Hi!

1264
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,042
Hey partner, what's up?

1265
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:10,458
Come here.

1266
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,125
Look who's here.

1267
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:17,875
How's mama doing?

1268
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,458
Mama's tired and cranky.

1269
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:21,417
Just like baby.

1270
00:56:21,417 --> 00:56:23,250
Mama wants to choke Daddy.

1271
00:56:23,292 --> 00:56:24,417
Come on, babe.

1272
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:26,125
Did you name him Brian?

1273
00:56:26,167 --> 00:56:27,500
Sorry.

1274
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:29,458
He's a junior.

1275
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:30,750
Named him after his daddy.

1276
00:56:30,792 --> 00:56:32,083
So what's his name?

1277
00:56:34,875 --> 00:56:35,792
Fuck you.

1278
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:38,000
Can I hold him?

1279
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:39,958
Yeah.

1280
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:51,583
So sweet.

1281
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:54,417
You're so done.

1282
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:09,250
Hey baby.

1283
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:11,750
What are you wearing?

1284
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:14,167
I can say it.

1285
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:14,875
What are you wearing?

1286
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:17,875
I don't care.

1287
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:18,583
You still look good.

1288
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:21,208
Yeah, Brian's right here.

1289
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:23,417
OK.

1290
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:24,583
All right, sorry.

1291
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:26,000
OK, I love you.

1292
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,542
Bye.

1293
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:28,458
You didn't even say hi.

1294
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,917
She was pissed.

1295
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,500
How'd you know you were going to marry Gabby?

1296
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,167
She told me.

1297
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:40,500
I was just some stoner working at my uncle's muffler shop and one day she grabbed me by the shoulders...

1298
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,458
and said we're getting married and you're joining the department'

1299
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:46,667
because you can make a lot of money without a college degree and I was like fuck yeah'.

1300
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,750
I mean, you love her.

1301
00:57:48,792 --> 00:57:51,000
You guys, you never fight.

1302
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:52,250
You're happy together.

1303
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,542
She's my bitch for sure.

1304
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:56,458
I'm just telling you the way it went down.

1305
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:58,750
I popped her cherry in high school.

1306
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:01,125
She's never been with anybody else.

1307
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:02,583
I've never wanted to be with anybody else.

1308
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:04,125
You know, it's easy.

1309
00:58:05,542 --> 00:58:07,667
Things are getting super serious with Janet and me.

1310
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:09,042
What, you just found that out?

1311
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:10,792
Did you read that in the paper or something?

1312
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:12,458
Homegirl owns your ass.

1313
00:58:13,708 --> 00:58:14,500
She wants to move in.

1314
00:58:15,667 --> 00:58:16,292
She's always over.

1315
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:17,708
Why spend the money on two apartments.

1316
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:19,542
It's not about the money.

1317
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:22,500
No, her parents are so traditional.

1318
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,542
Oh yeah?

1319
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,375
They will go ballistic.

1320
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,958
But at least we can tell them we're engaged.

1321
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:28,625
Hold up.

1322
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:30,083
Don't play with that shit.

1323
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:34,375
You don't ask a broad to marry you because her folks are old school.

1324
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:35,458
No, you don't understand.

1325
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:37,250
No, you don't do that shit.

1326
00:58:37,292 --> 00:58:38,750
Think about it.

1327
00:58:38,792 --> 00:58:41,625
After you think about it, think about it again.

1328
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:43,083
Jesus.

1329
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:44,917
Marriage is forever.

1330
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,125
Just realize that.

1331
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:48,583
It's a promise before god.

1332
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:54,958
My grandma was really deep.

1333
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:57,333
She's seen it all.

1334
00:58:57,375 --> 00:58:58,667
You know what I'm saying?

1335
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:02,542
When me and Gabby got engaged, she asked me one thing.

1336
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:03,458
Do you want to hear it?

1337
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:04,750
Fine, let's hear it.

1338
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,000
She said can you live without her?

1339
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:14,292
And if the answer's yes, man up and forget her.

1340
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:15,583
Don't string her along.

1341
00:59:17,125 --> 00:59:17,958
Think about it.

1342
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,250
I did.

1343
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:33,042
Thirteen-x-ray- forty-three.

1344
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:33,917
Officer needs help.

1345
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:34,542
Where?

1346
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:36,042
Newton units, stand by.

1347
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:37,250
X forty-three officer needs help.

1348
00:59:37,292 --> 00:59:38,875
Thirteen x forty-three, what's your location?

1349
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:40,000
I don't know.

1350
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:40,625
What?

1351
00:59:40,667 --> 00:59:42,042
That's Van Hauser's car.

1352
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:42,833
Come on, Boot!

1353
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:43,625
Just book it south.

1354
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:44,292
Go.

1355
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,792
Find a street sign, put it out.

1356
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,333
I don't see any!

1357
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:49,333
***

1358
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:51,375
Is there a number on a house?

1359
00:59:51,417 --> 00:59:52,000
A building number?

1360
00:59:52,042 --> 00:59:53,958
The house is three one seven seven.

1361
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,083
Sir, back up!

1362
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:57,458
Holy shit.

1363
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:58,625
Hook a left on Maple.

1364
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:02,583
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen show us responding code three from three zero and Maple.

1365
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:03,958
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

1366
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:05,750
Responding code three Maple and three zero.

1367
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:07,667
Right there!

1368
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:13,375
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen show us code six at Compton and three one street.

1369
01:00:13,417 --> 01:00:14,125
Who is that?

1370
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:15,417
Taylor and Zavala.

1371
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:18,333
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen, send me an airship to set up a perimeter.

1372
01:00:18,375 --> 01:00:19,333
Oh shit.

1373
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:20,667
Would you call for a rescue?

1374
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:21,708
Do not move.

1375
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:22,417
What did he look like?

1376
01:00:22,417 --> 01:00:22,833
Where'd he go?

1377
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:24,250
Northbound through the houses.

1378
01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:28,500
Hispanic male, blue checkered shirt.

1379
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,125
Zerohead, he's a parolee, he's fucking huge.

1380
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:35,000
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen, suspect headed northbound, heavyset male Hispanic, shaved head.

1381
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:35,625
Weapon used was a knife.

1382
01:00:35,667 --> 01:00:38,292
Let's do this shit.

1383
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:39,250
Careful, men.

1384
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:39,625
On your left.

1385
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:40,375
He's fucking huge.

1386
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:43,792
It's clear over here.

1387
01:00:43,792 --> 01:00:44,417
Crossing.

1388
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:45,625
The windows?

1389
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:46,333
You got left?

1390
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,417
I got right.

1391
01:00:47,417 --> 01:00:48,375
Push push push.

1392
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:51,417
You're on my elbow.

1393
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:52,208
You call it out.

1394
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:52,875
You call it out if you see it.

1395
01:00:55,042 --> 01:00:55,542
I see him.

1396
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:56,042
On the left.

1397
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:56,542
On the left.

1398
01:00:56,542 --> 01:00:57,542
Ready, go go, split.

1399
01:00:57,542 --> 01:00:58,750
Take it, you bitch.

1400
01:00:58,792 --> 01:00:59,375
Fuck you!

1401
01:00:59,417 --> 01:00:59,917
On the left.

1402
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:00,500
I've got him, you ready?

1403
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,417
Fucking bitch.

1404
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:01,917
Fucking whore.

1405
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:03,167
Try to fuck with me?

1406
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:03,625
Fuck you!

1407
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:05,792
Get the fuck off her or I will blow your fucking head off.

1408
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:06,625
I'm done.

1409
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:07,250
I ain't resisting, officer.

1410
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,458
Don't fucking look at me!

1411
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,625
I ain't resisting, sir.

1412
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:10,333
Shut the fuck up!

1413
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,083
Get up.

1414
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:12,333
Put your hands over your head.

1415
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:12,917
Get up.

1416
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:15,292
Put your hands over your head.

1417
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:17,958
Back up towards me til I tell you to stop.

1418
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:19,083
Move.

1419
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:20,000
Move.

1420
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:20,792
Move.

1421
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:21,917
Move.

1422
01:01:21,917 --> 01:01:22,375
Stop.

1423
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:24,458
Now get on your fucking knees.

1424
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:26,458
And cross your goddamn feet together, you hear me?

1425
01:01:26,542 --> 01:01:27,417
Cross your legs.

1426
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:31,167
If I hear a fucking word out of you, I will blowyou out of your fucking socks.

1427
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:31,917
Hook him, Z.

1428
01:01:39,292 --> 01:01:41,208
Thirteen-x-ray-thirteen, show a code four.

1429
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:41,833
Suspect's in custody.

1430
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:43,458
You good, Z?

1431
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:43,958
I'm good.

1432
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,375
Are you good?

1433
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:46,833
God damn it.

1434
01:01:46,917 --> 01:01:48,958
All right, you're going to be all right.

1435
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:49,917
You're going to be all right.

1436
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,625
Fuck man, her face is all fucking broken.

1437
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:55,958
Thirteen-x-ray-thirteen requesting an additional RA.

1438
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,958
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger on the RA.

1439
01:01:57,958 --> 01:01:59,708
We're here for you, all right?

1440
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,000
We got the cavalry coming.

1441
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:03,625
That motherfucker's going to pay for what he did, you hear me?

1442
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:05,250
Boot, you hear me?

1443
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,458
Boot?

1444
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:06,958
Don't call her Boot.

1445
01:02:07,042 --> 01:02:08,208
Well I don't know what her fucking name is.

1446
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,417
Is there a tag anywhere?

1447
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:10,083
Do you see a tag?

1448
01:02:10,083 --> 01:02:10,458
No.

1449
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:12,792
You hearing me?

1450
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:14,250
She's nodding, she's nodding, she hears me.

1451
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:15,958
You're going to be all right.

1452
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,708
Do you hear me?

1453
01:02:17,792 --> 01:02:18,375
It's all good.

1454
01:02:18,417 --> 01:02:18,958
It's all good.

1455
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,375
You're going to be OK, brother.

1456
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:27,750
Fucking cut my vest off.

1457
01:02:27,792 --> 01:02:28,833
God damn it.

1458
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:29,750
I tell you one fucking thing.

1459
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:33,417
Fucking cut my vest off.

1460
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:34,417
All right, we got your back.

1461
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,833
Jesus Christ.

1462
01:02:35,917 --> 01:02:37,292
God damn it.

1463
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:37,917
Get back, all right.

1464
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:38,500
You're good.

1465
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:39,833
We got your back.

1466
01:02:39,917 --> 01:02:41,333
They cut my fucking vest.

1467
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:42,667
They cut my fucking vest.

1468
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:45,083
What's up?

1469
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:45,542
You OK?

1470
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:48,083
I'm really tired.

1471
01:02:48,167 --> 01:02:50,208
Why didn't you shoot that son of a bitch?

1472
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:51,208
You had him dead to rights.

1473
01:02:52,792 --> 01:02:54,833
I just didn't feel like killing anyone tonight, Sarge.

1474
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,208
You feel like writing this up?

1475
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:59,250
Brass is going to want clean paper, make sure all the logs match.

1476
01:02:59,292 --> 01:03:00,083
Sarge, did you see that?

1477
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:02,667
Van H had a fucking Ginsu sticking out of his eye.

1478
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,292
His eye was cut in half.

1479
01:03:04,292 --> 01:03:05,792
The lens was hanging out.

1480
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:07,167
He's not coming back.

1481
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,833
Rookie too.

1482
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:10,000
What?

1483
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:10,417
She ain't coming back.

1484
01:03:10,417 --> 01:03:12,583
She gave me this to give to the Watch commander.

1485
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:13,500
On the spot?

1486
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:14,250
Yeah.

1487
01:03:15,042 --> 01:03:17,125
Oh well, she wouldn't have made probation anyway.

1488
01:03:17,167 --> 01:03:17,958
Hell no.

1489
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,292
What, because her daddy's not a captain?

1490
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:21,000
You know she wasn't cut out for this shit.

1491
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,625
Why is that?

1492
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:22,833
The evidence.

1493
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:24,417
She almost got Van Hauser killed.

1494
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:25,458
You guys are cold.

1495
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,208
You got cold, dead eyes, you know that?

1496
01:03:27,667 --> 01:03:28,458
Yeah, both of us.

1497
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,833
Yeah, both of you.

1498
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:30,375
You have a soul?

1499
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,167
Yes, we just leave it at home.

1500
01:03:32,167 --> 01:03:34,542
We going to sit around yapping or we going to get this done?

1501
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:36,042
You guys saved that rookie's life.

1502
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:38,083
That was one big fucking fat ese.

1503
01:03:38,125 --> 01:03:39,750
Can we clear the scene?

1504
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:42,333
Division's fucking falling apart over here.

1505
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:43,083
We good?

1506
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:43,583
You good?

1507
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:44,542
Good good good?

1508
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:45,583
We're all good.

1509
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:45,833
Yes?

1510
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:46,417
Go back to work.

1511
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:47,542
Good night, ladies.

1512
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:54,917
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing Officer and Mrs.

1513
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:55,833
Taylor.

1514
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:09,667
What's up, guys.

1515
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:41,625
All right.

1516
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:47,875
Janet, you got a lot of heart hooking up with a cop.

1517
01:05:47,917 --> 01:05:54,375
Because it takes a strong person... and I see like a lot of cops' wives in here, they're all nodding their heads.

1518
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,083
You gotta take care of her.

1519
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:04,792
Cause I'm her big brother now. And every cop in here... we're all her family now too.

1520
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:10,458
I'm going to cry, baby, shut up.

1521
01:06:13,167 --> 01:06:16,958
And Janet, we're all hoping you can make a man out of Brian.

1522
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,083
Because we've all given up.

1523
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:20,000
So here we go.

1524
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,583
To Brian and Janet.

1525
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:26,625
Cheers!

1526
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:34,417
Can I ask you something?

1527
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:38,750
Why the fuck did you get married in your dress blues?

1528
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:42,583
If you worked at Best Buy would you wear that fucking stupid polo shirt?

1529
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:44,583
I like that polo shirt.

1530
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,000
I'm representing.

1531
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:50,625
You know I love you, man

1532
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:51,667
Jesus.

1533
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:52,667
Here they go again.

1534
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:53,750
I love you too, bro.

1535
01:06:55,833 --> 01:06:56,917
I would lay down my life for you.

1536
01:06:56,917 --> 01:06:57,833
I love you, man.

1537
01:06:57,833 --> 01:06:59,167
I would take a fucking bullet for you.

1538
01:06:59,167 --> 01:07:00,667
I love you, man.

1539
01:07:00,667 --> 01:07:03,458
Why don't you guys get married to each other?

1540
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:03,792
All right, shut up.

1541
01:07:04,417 --> 01:07:05,750
Everybody take a shot.

1542
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:06,625
Salud!

1543
01:07:06,667 --> 01:07:08,583
Cheers!

1544
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:24,417
My boy Garcia?

1545
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:26,083
He's a fucking beast.

1546
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:31,458
I've seen this motherfucker knock an asshole out with one punch.

1547
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,125
Yoked assholes, man.

1548
01:07:33,125 --> 01:07:35,750
Yoked assholes from the joint when they had weight piles.

1549
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,083
You know what I'm talking about?

1550
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:38,958
You don't know what I'm talking about,
you're fucking twelve years old.

1551
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:43,917
Cops like him... Like soldiers.

1552
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:47,333
He took a bullet for me.

1553
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:50,625
My bullet.

1554
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:52,125
He took my bullet.

1555
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:58,250
He took my bullet.

1556
01:07:58,292 --> 01:08:00,458
That's what he was.

1557
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,417
That's what he was to me.

1558
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:03,250
It should have been me.

1559
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,750
Cause he was a good guy.

1560
01:08:06,417 --> 01:08:07,458
I was shit.

1561
01:08:10,917 --> 01:08:11,667
Fuck it.

1562
01:08:22,417 --> 01:08:23,083
Gimme a kiss.

1563
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:25,292
You'll learn this.

1564
01:08:25,292 --> 01:08:25,875
You'll learn.

1565
01:08:25,917 --> 01:08:28,417
Marriage is really basic.

1566
01:08:29,625 --> 01:08:32,125
There's just a couple guidelines.

1567
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:34,667
One: you've got to give it up all the time.

1568
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:37,000
All the time.

1569
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:37,792
You love that.

1570
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:40,167
I don't hate that idea.

1571
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:41,792
It's not a bad idea.

1572
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,417
It's not a bad thing.

1573
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:45,583
No, seriously, girls throw it at cops.

1574
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:46,917
Throw what exactly?

1575
01:08:46,917 --> 01:08:47,792
Their pussy.

1576
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,417
Girls throw it.

1577
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,750
So you can't give him an excuse, girlfriend.

1578
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:53,292
You can not give him an excuse.

1579
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:54,333
I've actually seen that before.

1580
01:08:54,417 --> 01:08:56,917
It's called assault on a peace officer.

1581
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:58,292
You ready?

1582
01:08:58,292 --> 01:08:58,625
Hell yeah.

1583
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:00,458
Try new things.

1584
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:00,792
Baby...

1585
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,667
Like the gooch.

1586
01:09:02,667 --> 01:09:04,000
The what?

1587
01:09:04,583 --> 01:09:05,625
The gooch?

1588
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:07,583
Texas twister.

1589
01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:09,083
No, that's something that's made up.

1590
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:10,458
The internet made that up.

1591
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:11,833
You want to know what Mike likes?

1592
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:12,458
No!

1593
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:15,500
No!

1594
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:19,417
Babe, I love you so much.

1595
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:21,083
The western, you know?

1596
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:22,958
Open to explore, right?

1597
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:23,625
Gabby!

1598
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:24,917
It's our wedding!

1599
01:09:24,917 --> 01:09:25,833
Cup him.

1600
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:26,625
Suck him.

1601
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:27,167
No no no!

1602
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,500
You just rub it a bit and then.

1603
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:28,917
What the fuck?

1604
01:09:28,917 --> 01:09:29,333
Gabby!

1605
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:30,458
Venture off a little more.

1606
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:31,625
Venture off?

1607
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,333
They swear they don't like it but...

1608
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:33,292
Shit!

1609
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:34,958
Really?

1610
01:09:39,292 --> 01:09:39,917
I'm happy.

1611
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:44,167
Janet's dope.

1612
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:54,833
You're my brother and everything, but you're a piece of shit.

1613
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,167
Does she know that?

1614
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:02,542
Yeah, she knows who I am.

1615
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:12,000
I mean, you can't get into something with somebody without ... She knows who I am.

1616
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,083
Yeah.

1617
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:14,583
I know who you are.

1618
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:16,917
You're a piece of shit.

1619
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:21,458
If you break her heart, I'm going to fuck you up.

1620
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:24,792
Good to know.

1621
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:37,833
If anything happened to you, I would take care of your kids.

1622
01:10:37,875 --> 01:10:39,583
If you had any.

1623
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:41,958
And I would take care of her.

1624
01:10:45,167 --> 01:10:46,417
I would take care of Janet.

1625
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,250
What's in the stack?

1626
01:11:08,292 --> 01:11:08,792
Anything good?

1627
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:12,583
Let's see here... Business dispute.

1628
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:13,625
Request police mediation.

1629
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:15,708
One neighbor threw a cup of water on the other neighbor's window.

1630
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,917
We're not buying that.

1631
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:18,625
Three ninety male.

1632
01:11:18,667 --> 01:11:20,125
Intoxicated person outside a liquor store.

1633
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:21,542
Get the fuck out of here.

1634
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:23,833
There's a drunk man outside the liquor store?

1635
01:11:25,792 --> 01:11:26,875
Welfare check.

1636
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:29,292
Woman requests PD contact her elderly mother.

1637
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:30,167
Yeah, buy that one.

1638
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:31,083
You serious?

1639
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:33,792
Yeah, if we buy a couple of these, maybe they'll send us a code three call.

1640
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:35,042
Cool.

1641
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:37,083
I'll hit her up for the next hotshots.

1642
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:39,083
On this episode, we're rolling to a call.

1643
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:42,458
A woman called the station to check on her elderly mother.

1644
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:43,458
So we're going to go.

1645
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,208
These are the calls most agencies deal with, you know?

1646
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:48,667
Not every call's a foot pursuit or a car chase.

1647
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:52,250
Some guys at other agencies have never even drawn their weapon or been in a gunfight.

1648
01:11:52,292 --> 01:11:54,000
Yeah, but here that's just half your shift.

1649
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:54,958
In the south end...

1650
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,583
we'll get involved in more capers in one deployment period than most cops see their entire career.

1651
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:00,583
Hell yeah.

1652
01:12:04,167 --> 01:12:05,625
Mrs. Williams!

1653
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:11,750
Mrs.Williams!

1654
01:12:11,792 --> 01:12:13,125
Police Officers!

1655
01:12:14,417 --> 01:12:15,292
Go around back, check it out.

1656
01:12:15,292 --> 01:12:16,000
All right.

1657
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:16,583
Here we go.

1658
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:19,458
I'm going to wait for my partner.

1659
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,625
He's going to check the back to see if she's around the back over there.

1660
01:12:22,625 --> 01:12:25,750
Often times, a lot of these people, they're very old people.

1661
01:12:25,792 --> 01:12:27,083
They can't hear us.

1662
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:31,333
You know, they can't hear  the hearing aids, you know.

1663
01:12:32,042 --> 01:12:32,500
Nothing.

1664
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:36,500
So the owner of this house is actually the daughter of the woman who lives in it.

1665
01:12:36,542 --> 01:12:41,917
She gave us permission for the welfare check, so we're going to... We're going to boot the door.

1666
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:46,458
Officer Zavala specializes in booting doors.

1667
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,750
I kick doors down.

1668
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:48,708
There you go.

1669
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:49,958
I kick doors down.

1670
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:52,708
Say it in English now.

1671
01:12:52,792 --> 01:12:54,125
I kick doors down.

1672
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:55,542
Wait, did you check if it was unlocked?

1673
01:12:56,958 --> 01:13:01,792
Ladies and gentlemen, always a good idea to make sure a door is locked ... before you boot it.

1674
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:02,958
Are you going to cut that out?

1675
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,958
Yeah, sorry.

1676
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:05,292
It was always locked.

1677
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:06,500
Clearly my partner always knew that.

1678
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:09,083
You know what's going to happen, right?

1679
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:09,500
What?

1680
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:13,125
She's going to roll through, come from
the church or the store or whatever.

1681
01:13:13,792 --> 01:13:16,125
And then she's going to see property
damage and what's going to happen?

1682
01:13:16,167 --> 01:13:16,500
What's going to happen?

1683
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:18,042
We're going to be the bad guys.

1684
01:13:21,625 --> 01:13:22,333
Shit.

1685
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:24,958
We got a dead body.

1686
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:40,417
What have we got?

1687
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:41,083
Squatters?

1688
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,750
Yeah, I'd say someone's been kicking it back here for sure.

1689
01:13:44,958 --> 01:13:45,958
LAPD

1690
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,292
Let's roll through.

1691
01:14:03,292 --> 01:14:03,792
You good?

1692
01:14:03,792 --> 01:14:04,333
Clear.

1693
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:13,042
That is wrong.

1694
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:13,833
I said it was clear.

1695
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:14,333
All right.

1696
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:15,625
I'm just filming it.

1697
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:30,625
I found her.

1698
01:14:30,625 --> 01:14:31,375
What's up?

1699
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:47,667
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen, I'm going to need a supervisor and two additional units at our location.

1700
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:51,875
And RA for the elderly female approximately seventy years old.

1701
01:14:54,125 --> 01:14:55,083
Not conscious, not breathing.

1702
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:59,125
Thirteen x thirteen's requesting two additional units and a supervisor.

1703
01:14:59,167 --> 01:15:00,542
Five one seven one Maple.

1704
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:03,458
Incident one four six seven, RA thirteen fifty-   one.

1705
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:06,292
What is she, grandma praying to the dope gods or some shit?

1706
01:15:06,667 --> 01:15:07,958
That's not fucking grandma.

1707
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:15,500
Don't fucking play on them.

1708
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,125
No, look.

1709
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:17,583
Hollow.

1710
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:18,750
Somebody's opened it before.

1711
01:15:18,792 --> 01:15:19,958
That's what that means.

1712
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:23,000
Take that shit out.

1713
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,792
You can't pull it out yourself?

1714
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:25,792
Just fucking pull it out.

1715
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:39,292
Party time.

1716
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:48,500
Z... No, wait wait wait.

1717
01:15:49,167 --> 01:15:49,750
What?

1718
01:15:49,792 --> 01:15:50,500
Do you see that pot?

1719
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:51,625
Yeah.

1720
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:54,708
That shit's still steaming.

1721
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:55,458
Oh shit.

1722
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,125
I'm going in.

1723
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:56,792
Ready?

1724
01:15:56,792 --> 01:15:57,125
Go ahead.

1725
01:16:15,292 --> 01:16:16,083
What is that?

1726
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:16,583
Is that a body?

1727
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:19,125
Yeah, there's bodies in there.

1728
01:16:19,167 --> 01:16:20,667
Thanks for the fucking update.

1729
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:24,417
Fuck.

1730
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:26,417
Is it clear?

1731
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:28,250
Clear.

1732
01:16:29,833 --> 01:16:30,500
What does it say?

1733
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:32,292
What's that shit say?

1734
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:33,417
Keep bringing them.

1735
01:16:33,458 --> 01:16:35,000
Ha ha ha.

1736
01:16:39,792 --> 01:16:40,167
Fuck!

1737
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:40,625
Come on.

1738
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:42,875
Get your shit together.

1739
01:16:42,917 --> 01:16:43,917
Pull your shit together.

1740
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:53,333
Fuck out of here.

1741
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,708
Let's get out of here.

1742
01:16:57,958 --> 01:16:58,458
Fuck.

1743
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:00,792
Sick motherfuckers.

1744
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:02,000
Who would do shit like that?

1745
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:17,958
What is that shit?

1746
01:17:18,917 --> 01:17:19,750
I don't fucking know.

1747
01:17:20,917 --> 01:17:22,167
I've never seen that kind of shit.

1748
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,083
Do you have hand sanitizer?

1749
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:27,958
No, I don't.

1750
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:33,792
I'm Serene Branson on the scene in south Los Angeles
at one of the largest narcotics seizures this year.

1751
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:38,208
In addition to the drugs, officials are telling us
there was a very gruesome discovery.

1752
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:41,583
An unknown number of bodies
showing evidence of torture.

1753
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:48,458
A police official familiar with the investigation denied
rumors Mexican drug cartels are responsible for the murders.

1754
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:55,292
We're having a lot of problems.

1755
01:17:55,292 --> 01:17:58,083
The Lord of the South wants something done.

1756
01:17:58,125 --> 01:18:02,292
This is just two city cops, right?

1757
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:03,583
Yes, two city cops.

1758
01:18:03,583 --> 01:18:04,958
Take care of these assholes or I'll take care of you.

1759
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:08,542
Got a problem with that?

1760
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:10,250
Consider it done.

1761
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,708
And don't leave a mess.

1762
01:18:13,792 --> 01:18:17,292
People hate cops, people in gangs.

1763
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,625
Write down what you spend. I'll get it done.

1764
01:18:43,167 --> 01:18:46,083
Gabby wants to know if you and Janet want to roll to the Dodgers game with us tonight.

1765
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:48,375
We're going to Santa Barbara.

1766
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:51,458
All right, fuck you then, I'll sell that shit online or something.

1767
01:18:54,625 --> 01:18:55,667
Here's Tre right here.

1768
01:18:56,917 --> 01:18:57,500
What's up, Tre?

1769
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,250
What's up back.

1770
01:19:01,417 --> 01:19:02,083
What you doing?

1771
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:05,083
I'm doing what I do, you know what I'm saying?

1772
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:05,917
Same shit, different day.

1773
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:07,333
Ain't shit changed.

1774
01:19:07,417 --> 01:19:08,417
What's up with you all?

1775
01:19:09,667 --> 01:19:10,292
Just slow motion.

1776
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:12,083
And that little incident you and I had?

1777
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:13,750
You kept it G.

1778
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:15,750
You didn't snitch on me.

1779
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:16,833
And I respect that.

1780
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:21,000
So check this out, my people just got out of Folsom prison.

1781
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:21,708
From up north.

1782
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:22,333
Oh yeah?

1783
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:23,833
Word is you got a hit on you all.

1784
01:19:23,917 --> 01:19:25,000
You all been greenlit.

1785
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,333
We're cops, everybody wants to kill us.

1786
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:29,167
I'm just telling you what they're saying.

1787
01:19:29,917 --> 01:19:34,792
No, you know what, we appreciate the info, but this don't mean you get a pass if we catch you slipping.

1788
01:19:34,792 --> 01:19:36,292
I ain't looking for no fucking pass.

1789
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:38,000
I do what I do, you know what I'm saying?

1790
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,000
I had to say it, though, you know how it is.

1791
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,083
All right, what you doing this weekend?

1792
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:43,167
You like the Dodgers?

1793
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:44,750
You going to slide a nigger some tickets or something?

1794
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:45,917
You like the Dodgers?

1795
01:19:45,917 --> 01:19:46,708
Have a good weekend.

1796
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:47,417
Slide me some tickets.

1797
01:19:47,417 --> 01:19:49,500
Shut the fuck up!

1798
01:19:55,833 --> 01:20:00,250
Did you fuck with my... come on, did you fuck with my shit?

1799
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:02,167
I don't fuck with your shit.

1800
01:20:03,667 --> 01:20:04,833
Mike, come on.

1801
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,250
Don't be a little bitch about it.

1802
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:07,667
I didn't fuck with your shit.

1803
01:20:07,667 --> 01:20:08,667
You fucked with my shit.

1804
01:20:08,667 --> 01:20:09,917
It was in totally different order.

1805
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,833
Why do you have an investigation report on here?

1806
01:20:11,917 --> 01:20:14,167
I don't have an investigation report on there.

1807
01:20:14,167 --> 01:20:15,083
It's your handwriting.

1808
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:15,500
Don't be an idiot.

1809
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,583
All this is fucked up.

1810
01:20:16,667 --> 01:20:18,083
Did you drop it or something?

1811
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:20,000
There's three types of pages.

1812
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,167
It's all out of order.

1813
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:23,708
It's all fucking out of order.

1814
01:20:24,708 --> 01:20:25,583
No, it's a pain in the ass.

1815
01:20:25,583 --> 01:20:26,333
I'm sorry, partner.

1816
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:31,833
Wait until they hit a small street.

1817
01:20:32,542 --> 01:20:35,417
At a stop sign, you fucking tap the bumper, we're going to get out and blast.

1818
01:20:35,417 --> 01:20:36,167
Fuck no.

1819
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:37,292
What do you mean, no?

1820
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,833
We should get them when they go to lunch at the Chinese place.

1821
01:20:39,917 --> 01:20:41,667
That Chinese place is crawling with cops.

1822
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:43,417
We gotta get these fuckers when they're alone.

1823
01:20:43,458 --> 01:20:45,750
We can fucking follow their asses home and hit them there.

1824
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:49,750
White boy's in fucking Simi Valley and the other fucking fool's in San Gabriel.

1825
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,167
We gotta get these fuckers at the same time.

1826
01:20:51,167 --> 01:20:53,083
This is the one-time, homie.

1827
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:54,500
Not a bunch of fucking niggers.

1828
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Motherfucker.

1829
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:56,667
This fucker is straight from the fucking SHU.

1830
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:58,083
You stop fucking around.

1831
01:20:58,083 --> 01:20:58,833
You got in the fucking car.

1832
01:20:58,917 --> 01:21:03,792
You want to fucking hang with the fucking carnales... now you fucking pay the fucking price of fucking admission, homeboy.

1833
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:05,875
I'll fucking kill this fucking bitch, all right?

1834
01:21:05,917 --> 01:21:07,167
You shut the fuck up.

1835
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:10,333
You get that fucking shit out of my fucking face.

1836
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:11,500
I'll fucking kill you, motherfucker.

1837
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,625
Don't you fucking disrespect.

1838
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:08,417
Don't worry.

1839
01:21:08,458 --> 01:21:09,333
I got this shit.

1840
01:21:09,417 --> 01:21:10,000
Fuck.

1841
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,792
I don't know where the fucking rubber band is either.

1842
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:17,333
Don't blame me for the rubber band.

1843
01:21:17,417 --> 01:21:18,750
You just took the rubber band off.

1844
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:23,583
If you hadn't fucking put everything out of order, then the rubber band wouldn't be out and the... Look, it's the butterfly effect, ok?

1845
01:21:23,583 --> 01:21:25,625
Do you know what the butterfly effect is?

1846
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:26,500
Nope.

1847
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:27,583
It's the butterfly effect.

1848
01:21:27,667 --> 01:21:28,833
Look it up.

1849
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:31,458
Just because you say it twice doesn't mean that I get it the second time.

1850
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:32,250
Look it up.

1851
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:35,417
This is fucking stupid.

1852
01:21:35,417 --> 01:21:37,333
Those motherfuckers got bulletproof vests.

1853
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:38,833
We need to hit them with some AKs and shit.

1854
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:39,583
Don't fucking rank out.

1855
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:40,500
Fuck you!

1856
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,667
When the fuck have I ever backed out from shit?

1857
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:46,167
Get that fucking camera out of my face.

1858
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:49,833
I'm saying we just can't fuck this shit up.

1859
01:21:50,833 --> 01:21:51,833
I don't give a fuck.

1860
01:21:51,917 --> 01:21:53,167
You know me.

1861
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:54,833
I'll do the motherfucking time.

1862
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:57,750
I just don't want the big homies fucking whacking me.

1863
01:21:58,333 --> 01:22:01,083
Fucking whacking me for fucking up.

1864
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:03,417
We need a fucking plan.

1865
01:22:03,417 --> 01:22:04,833
And you fucking know it.

1866
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:06,500
Think about it.

1867
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,875
That's all I'm saying.

1868
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:15,167
Fucking head back.

1869
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,583
I'll get some fucking big guns from the Border Brothers.

1870
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:29,250
Never fall asleep in a room full of cops.

1871
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:36,417
That shit ain't even fucking funny.

1872
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:41,250
Just cause you won the fucking award doesn't give you license to be a fucking asshole.

1873
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,250
You got shit on your face.

1874
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:44,667
What is this?

1875
01:22:44,667 --> 01:22:46,417
Are we in the third fucking grade?

1876
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:49,417
Keep it up, it's going to earn you a risk management case.

1877
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,500
Give me this fucking camera.

1878
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,500
He had something....

1879

I'm serious.

1880
01:22:52,417 --> 01:22:55,000
This department built you up, they will fucking tear you down.

1881
01:22:55,167 --> 01:22:56,333
You know it's fucking funny.

1882
01:22:56,333 --> 01:22:57,833
Laugh, you fucking idiot.

1883
01:22:57,875 --> 01:22:59,667
Who left their shaving cream on the table?

1884
01:23:06,333 --> 01:23:07,500
How was Santa Barbara?

1885
01:23:10,583 --> 01:23:11,250

01:23:20,917 --> 01:23:22,000
Are you serious?

1890
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:23,250
Already?

1891
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:24,833
She's not even Mexican.

1892
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:29,625
Yeah, she's going for the ultrasound tomorrow, but three of those little piss stick things...

1893
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:31,833
Positive, positive, positive.

OK?

1902

2163
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:22,583
This is the second floor.

2164
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:23,583
What?

2165
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:24,583
I got nowhere to go.

2166
01:40:24,583 --> 01:40:27,167
Homegirls trying to distract them, but it aint happening.

2167
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:28,750
And the footsteps grow louder.

2168
01:40:29,333 --> 01:40:30,417
Louder and louder.

2169
01:40:30,417 --> 01:40:34,333
Then the door opens  oh my god, Im naked...
underneath the bed.

2170
01:40:34,417 --> 01:40:36,833
And then all I can seeis little footsteps.

2171
01:40:36,833 --> 01:40:41,750
I see his hairy feet and I see her nails all painted
and theyre yapping, theyre doing their thing.

2172
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:42,667
And they crash.

2173
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:49,500
And this is the part I never told Gabby... I hear a little smootchie smootch,
and I hear some shit, and Im praying, please no.

2174
01:40:50,417 --> 01:40:51,417
And they did it.

2175
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:52,667
What? ... What?

2176
01:40:52,917 --> 01:40:54,083
They got down!

2177
01:40:54,833 --> 01:40:57,417
Im talking Gabbys parents fucking!

2178
01:40:57,417 --> 01:40:58,833
All right, I got it.

2179
01:40:58,917 --> 01:40:59,250
No!

2180
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:01,583
The shit was so traumatic.

2181
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:05,917
It must have been a little uncomfortable around the folks after that.

2182
01:41:07,083 --> 01:41:09,667
Yeah, because her fathers a freak.

2183
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:13,583
I guess when youve been married that long, you gotta mix it up a little bit.

2184
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:17,750
I tried rolling like that with Gabby and she was like hell no,
youre not touching me there.

2185
01:41:20,833 --> 01:41:22,250
It makes me fucking uncomfortable.

2186
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:23,917
I know, you know why?

2187
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Because youre a freak too.

2188
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,333
Dont go there, just dont go there.

2189
01:41:27,333 --> 01:41:29,833
I fucking cant breathe.

2190
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:31,833
Holy shit.

2191
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:36,417
Any Newton unit...

2192
01:41:42,583 --> 01:41:44,250
Lets go fight crime or something.

2193
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:44,500
OK.
