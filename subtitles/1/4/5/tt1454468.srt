1
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:06,729
Please verify that the P-one ATA removal

2
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:08,869
on replacement cap part
one and two are complete.

3
00:01:09,645 --> 00:01:16,120
DMA M-one, M-two, M-three and M four
are complete. - Okay. Copy that, Explorer.

4
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:21,537
Dr. Stone, Houston. Medical is
concerned about your ECG readings.

5
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:26,248
I'm fine, Houston.
- Well, Medical doesn't agree, Doc.

6
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:29,921
Are you feeling nauseous?
- Not any more than usual, Houston.

7
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:31,605
Diagnostics are green.

8
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,359
Link to communications card
ready for data reception.

9
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:40,131
If this works, when we touch down tomorrow,
I'm buying all you guys a round of drinks.

10
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:42,258
That's a date, Doctor.

11
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:44,989
Just remember, Houston's
partial to margaritas.

12
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,207
Booting comms card now.

13
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:51,017
Please confirm link.

14
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:54,187
That's a negative,
we're not seeing any data.

15
00:01:55,153 --> 00:01:57,823
Standby, Houston, I'm
gonna reboot the comms card.

16
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:59,479
Standing by.

17
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:03,584
Houston, I have a bad feeling
about this mission. - Please expand.

18
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:05,912
Okay, let me tell you a story.

19
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:09,807
It was ninety-six. I'd been
up here for forty-two days.

20
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:12,220
Every time I passed
over Texas, I looked down

21
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,997
knowing that Mrs. Kowalski
was looking up, thinking of me.

22
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:18,824
Six weeks I'm
blowing kisses at that woman.

23
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:23,087
Then we land at Edwards and I find out
that she's run off with this lawyer.

24
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:26,274
So, I packed my car, and
I headed to... - ... Tijuana.

25
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:28,440
You've told this story, Kowalski.

26
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,236
As Houston recalls, she, uh,
took off in your seventy-four GTO.

27
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:35,719
Engineering requests fuel
status on the jetpack prototype.

28
00:02:36,394 --> 00:02:39,291
Five hours off the reservation and
I show thirty percent drain.

29
00:02:40,062 --> 00:02:42,431
Give my compliments to Engineering.

30
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:44,713
Except for a slight malfunction
in the nulling of the roll axis,

31
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:47,245
this jetpack is one
prime piece of thrust.

32
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,688
Engineering says thank you.

33
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:52,565
Tell 'em I still prefer my
sixty-seven Corvette, though.

34
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,838
Speaking of which, did I ever tell you...
- We know the Corvette story, Matt.

35
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,386
Even Engineering?
- Especially Engineering.

36
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:02,242
We're going to miss you, Matt.

37
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,363
Comms card reboot in progress.
- Thank you, Doctor.

38
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:08,347
Shariff, what's your status?

39
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:12,485
Nearly there. Replacing battery
module A-one and C.

40
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:16,049
Ccould you be a little more specific?

41
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:18,581
Indeterminate estimates
make Houston anxious.

42
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,466
No, Houston. Don't be anxious.

43
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:23,356
Anxiety's not
good for the heart.

44
00:03:24,464 --> 00:03:26,599
System is ready to reactivate.

45
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,064
Hubble telescope engaged.
Upgrade fully functional.

46
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:33,737
That applause you hear
is for you, Shariff.

47
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:36,483
Congratulations. Kick back,
take the rest of the day off.

48
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:45,718
Matt, do you have a visual on just what
Mission Specialist Shariff is doing up there?

49
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:49,574
He appears to be doing
some form of the Macarena.

50
00:03:50,073 --> 00:03:53,444
But that would be just a best-guess
scenario on my part.

51
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:58,442
Dr. Stone, Houston. Medical now have you with
a temperature drop to thirty-five-point-nine

52
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,082
and a heart-rate rise to seventy.

53
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:05,451
How are you feeling?
- Houston, I'm fine.

54
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:08,890
It's just keeping your lunch down
in zero-G is harder than it looks.

55
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:13,064
Dr. Stone, Medical is asking
if you want to return to Explorer.

56
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:17,000
Negative. We've been here a week,
Houston. Let's just finish this.

57
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:20,843
Card is up.
- No, that's a negative.

58
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:23,751
I'm afraid we're getting
nothing on this end, Doctor.

59
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:28,381
Try again.
- No, still nothing.

60
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,298
Houston, can you please turn
that music off? - Kowalski.

61
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,173
Not a problem.

62
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:38,110
Thank you, Kowalski.

63
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:44,260
Now, Houston?
- That's a negative.

64
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:47,397
Could Houston be
misinterpreting the data?

65
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:50,180
Well, we're not receiving any data.

66
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:54,504
Engineering is recommending
a vis-check for component damage.

67
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:57,950
Let me see what's going on.

68
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:01,012
What have we got?

69
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:11,006
Visual examination doesn't
reveal any damaged components.

70
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:13,657
The problem must be originating
from the comms panel.

71
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:16,348
Yeah, that seems to be the case.

72
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:19,234
Engineering admits that you
warned us that this could happen.

73
00:05:20,204 --> 00:05:22,582
That's as close to an apology
as you're going to get from them.

74
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:24,418
We should have listened to you, Doc.

75
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,270
Get working. - Well, ooks like we're
going to have to improvise.

76
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,499
I'm on it.
- How long do you think it'll take you?

77
00:05:31,952 --> 00:05:35,092
One hour.
- Outstanding.

78
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:38,213
Installing your system in the
Hubble is the purpose of this mission

79
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,463
and so we appreciate
your patience, Doctor.

80
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:44,084
Kowalski, we... we know you don't
care about things like this,

81
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:46,928
but, uh, for your information, this
delay is not gonna be long enough

82
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,923
for you to break Anatoly
Solovyev's spacewalking record.

83
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,935
It seems like you're gonna be left...
- Seventy-five minutes shy?

84
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:55,949
Never crossed my mind.

85
00:05:56,542 --> 00:06:01,855
Matt... it's been a privilege.
- Right back at you, Houston.

86
00:06:02,615 --> 00:06:04,662
Enjoy your last walk.

87
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,364
Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone in
removing the panel?

88
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:11,103
Assistance appreciated.
- Permission granted.

89
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:12,815
Thank you, Houston.

90
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:15,986
Mind if I join the fun?
- Certainly.

91
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,281
How you feeling?

92
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:21,134
Like a Chihuahua that's
being tumble-dried.

93
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,649
Well, it's been a rough week.

94
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:26,202
If it makes you feel any
better, I coughed up everything

95
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:28,657
but my kidneys on my first ride.

96
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:31,084
Shit.

97
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:38,620
Sorry.

98
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:43,747
I'm used to a basement lab in a hospital
where things fall to the floor. Thank you.

99
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:49,166
Well, you're the genius up here.
I only drive the bus.

100
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:54,050
Yeah, well, call me a genius if I can get
this board initialized in the next hour.

101
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:57,138
Explorer, this is Houston.
- Go ahead, Houston.

102
00:06:57,421 --> 00:07:01,513
NORAD reports a Russian satellite
has incurred a missile strike.

103
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:06,578
The impact has created a cloud of debris
orbiting at twenty thousand miles per hour.

104
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,567
Current debris orbit does not
overlap with your trajectory.

105
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:14,580
We'll keep you posted on any
developments. - Copy that, Houston.

106
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:20,249
Should we... Should we be worried? - No,
let's let the boys down there worry for us.

107
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,542
Explorer, engage arm
and pivot to cargo bay.

108
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:26,539
Stand by for arm maneuver.

109
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,690
So, doc, now that you work for
NASA, how do you like us?

110
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:33,084
Kind of like winning
the lottery, huh?

111
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:36,170
I was just happy that they didn't
cut the funding to my research.

112
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:38,701
How long was your training?
- Six months.

113
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:40,607
Including holidays?
- Mm-hm.

114
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:44,953
So, what is this scanning system?
- Oh, nothing Matt.

115
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:47,695
It's just a new set of eyes to
scan the edge of the universe.

116
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:50,971
It's designed for hospital use,
but this one's a prototype.

117
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,319
Stand by for locking.

118
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:58,715
Listen, they don't bankroll prototypes.
Even for your pretty blue eyes.

119
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,417
Well, my eyes are brown.

120
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:06,241
Right now, your eyes are
bloodshot.

121
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:08,133
Kowalski!

122
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:12,349
Is this great, or
what? Woo-hoo-hoo!

123
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,942
And to think he went to Harvard.

124
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:21,909
You gotta admit one thing:

125
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:25,042
Can't beat the view.

126
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:31,581
So, what do you like
about being up here?

127
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:34,973
The silence.

128
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:38,673
I could get used to it.

129
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:00,623
Terrific.

130
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:03,732
Houston, from first inspection,
comms panel appears to be dead.

131
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:06,462
Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary?

132
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:09,231
You're the expert, doctor.
It's your call.

133
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,771
Houston, I have a bad
feeling about this mission.

134
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:14,813
Please elaborate.
- It's the same feeling

135
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:16,880
I had about Mardi Gras in 1987.

136
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:19,607
That is affirmative.

137
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,407
Surprisingly, Control hasn't heard
the Mardi Gras story. Please proceed.

138
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:27,272
Well, it's day one, and I'm
bumping my way down Bourbon Street

139
00:09:27,553 --> 00:09:30,644
looking for a sister
of a friend of mine.

140
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:34,268
Streets are full of people. I'm thinking
there's no way I'm gonna find this girl.

141
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:37,670
Proceeding to override. - Then all of the
sudden, I look up, and there she is,

142
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:40,557
and I'm about to yell out,
and I see she's holding hands

143
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:44,781
with some short, hairy guy in board
shorts and a Margaritaville shirt.

144
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:48,134
And then I realize that
this guy is not a guy.

145
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:50,224
That my girl is holding hands with a...

146
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:51,943
ISS, this is Houston.
- Proceed, Houston.

147
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,862
Explorer, this is Houston.
- Go ahead, Houston.

148
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,655
Mission abort. Repeat. Mission abort.

149
00:09:57,755 --> 00:09:59,891
Initiate emergency
disconnect from Hubble.

150
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,106
Begin reentry procedure. ISS,
initiate emergency evacuation.

151
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:07,417
Copy all, Houston, and in work.
Matt, immediate return to Explorer.

152
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,239
Repeat, immediate
return to Explorer. - Copy.

153
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,628
Explorer, prep airlock.
- Airlock engaged,

154
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:14,790
ready to receive.
- Houston, elaborate.

155
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,845
Debris from the missile strike has
caused a chain reaction,

156
00:10:17,914 --> 00:10:20,482
hitting other satellites
and creating new debris.

157
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:23,626
Traveling faster than a high-speed
bullet up towards your altitude.

158
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,931
All copy?
- Copy all.

159
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:29,021
Put a bow on it, Dr. Stone.
- I can't.

160
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,565
The board is still initializing.
- I'm not gonna ask you again.

161
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,655
One second.
- Not one second. Now.

162
00:10:35,756 --> 00:10:37,062
Shut it down.

163
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:40,607
That's an order.
- Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

164
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,074
I'm done. I'm done.

165
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,747
Kowalski, initiate emergency
disconnect from the Hubble.

166
00:10:44,846 --> 00:10:47,212
All right, Shariff, let's do this.
- Roger, Matt.

167
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:50,302
Houston, update.
- Well, we have a full-on chain reaction.

168
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:52,628
It's been confirmed that it's
the unintentional side effect

169
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:55,709
of the Russians striking
one of their own satellites.

170
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:59,091
They shot down their own satellite?
- Right of disposal.

171
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,894
Most likely a spy sat gone
bad. Now it's shrapnel.

172
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,227
Explorer, ready to disengage HST.

173
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:10,138
Locks releasing in three... two... one.
- Explorer, new data coming through.

174
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,977
What's the blowback, Houston?
- It's not good.

175
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:15,413
Most of our systems are gone.

176
00:11:15,513 --> 00:11:18,983
Debris chain reaction is out of
control and rapidly expanding.

177
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,942
Multiple satellites are down, and
they keep on falling.

178
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,058
Define 'multiple satellites. '
- Most of them are gone.

179
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:27,351
Telecommunication systems are dead.

180
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:29,802
Expect a communication
blackout at any moment.

181
00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:32,737
Kowalski, visual of debris at nine o'clock.
- Half of North America

182
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:34,509
just lost their Facebook.

183
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,252
Explorer, repeat, expect a
communication blackout

184
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:38,873
at any moment.

185
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:42,232
Copy that, Houston.
- Explorer, this is Kowalski,

186
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:46,467
confirming visual contact with debris.
Debris is from a BSE sat. - Heads up!

187
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,958
To repeat, I have...
- Dr. Stone requesting faster transport.

188
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,963
We have to go. We have to go, go, go!

189
00:11:51,964 --> 00:11:55,033
Kennedy reports meteorologicalconditions
no-go for re-entry.

190
00:11:55,558 --> 00:12:00,750
Houston, Explorer. Copy. Explorer, Dr. Stone
requesting faster transport to bay area.

191
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:03,466
Explorer, do you copy?
- Explorer, permission to retrieve Dr. Stone.

192
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:05,414
You're a go, Kowalski.

193
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:08,167
Houston, this is Explorer, copy.

194
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:11,843
All right. - We've lost
Houston. We've lost Houston.

195
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:15,358
Unstrap. Look, we need to
get the hell out of here. - All right.

196
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,459
Need some help there, Matt?
- No, don't wait for us. - It's stuck!

197
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,841
Man down! Man down!

198
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:26,206
Houston, this is Explorer, copy. Houston,
this is Explorer, copy. Kowalski, repor...

199
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:33,271
Explorer's been hit! - Explorer, do
you read? Explorer, over! Explorer!

200
00:12:35,481 --> 00:12:39,083
Astronaut is off structure!
Dr. Stone is off structure!

201
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:41,910
Dr. Stone, detach! - No!
- You must detach!

202
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,465
If you don't detach, that
arm's gonna carry you too far!

203
00:12:44,753 --> 00:12:46,796
Listen to my voice!
You need to focus!

204
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:49,172
I'm losing visual of you.

205
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:51,171
In a few seconds, I won't
be able to track you.

206
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,307
You need to detach!
I can't see you anymore!

207
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:56,375
Do it now!
- I'm trying! I'm trying! I'm trying!

208
00:12:57,648 --> 00:12:59,854
Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone.

209
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,680
Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone.

210
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:15,883
Dr. Stone, do you copy?
Repeat, do you copy?

211
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:19,101
Yes, yes, yes. I copy! I'm detached!
- Give me your position.

212
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,763
I don't know! I don't know! I'm
spinning! I can't... I can't...

213
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,951
Report your position. - GPS is
down. It's down, I can't...

214
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:30,250
Give me a visual.
- I told you, nothing. I see nothing!

215
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:34,585
Do you have a visual of Explorer? - No. No.
- Do you have a visual of ISS? - No.

216
00:13:34,587 --> 00:13:38,408
You need to focus. Anything, use the
sun and the Earth, give me coordinates.

217
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,077
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

218
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,803
Give me coordinates!
Dr. Stone, do you copy?

219
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:47,530
Repeat, do you copy?

220
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:52,215
Give me your position!
Report your position.

221
00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:55,644
Do you have a visual of Explorer?

222
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,766
Do you have a visual of ISS?

223
00:13:57,767 --> 00:13:59,268
I need you to focus. Anything.

224
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:01,541
Use the sun and the
Earth, give me coordinates.

225
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,736
Give me coordinates.

226
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,994
Kowalski? Kowalski, do you copy?

227
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:45,580
Kowalski... I have... have a vis...
Kowalski, I have a visual.

228
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:51,562
I have... have a visual of Explorer.
With north at... twelve o'clock

229
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,258
and the shuttle is at
the center of the dial.

230
00:14:58,118 --> 00:15:04,260
I can see... I can see the Chinese station.
No, it's the International Space Station.

231
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:06,439
ISS is at...

232
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:09,875
ISS is at seven o'clock.

233
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:19,865
Lieutenant Kowalski, do you copy?

234
00:15:25,931 --> 00:15:28,088
Explorer, do you... do you copy?

235
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,982
Houston, do you copy?

236
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:47,012
Houston, this is Mission
Specialist Ryan Stone.

237
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:49,661
I am off structure and I am drifting.

238
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:51,070
Do you copy?

239
00:15:57,762 --> 00:15:59,049
Anyone?

240
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:04,458
Anybody?

241
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:09,120
Do you copy?

242
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:13,238
Please copy.

243
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:17,895
Please.

244
00:16:37,215 --> 00:16:40,778
Dr. Stone, do you copy?
- Yeah, Lieutenant Kowalski, yes.

245
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:43,273
Yes, Lieutenant Kowalski, I'm
here, I'm here. - Repeat, do you copy?

246
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:46,695
Yes, yes, I copy, I'm here!
I'm here. - Flash your light.

247
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,361
My light... my light?
- Flash it so I can see you.

248
00:16:49,462 --> 00:16:52,250
Okay. Uh...

249
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:53,787
I...

250
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:56,801
Okay, okay. Here, here! I'm here!

251
00:16:56,902 --> 00:17:00,819
There you are. Hang on
tight. Report your status.

252
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:03,667
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm all right.

253
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:05,558
Your status. Give me your readings.

254
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:11,935
Three... three... three point six PSI.
- Your O2, give me your O2.

255
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:16,604
Oxygen is going down. It's going down
fast. It's going down fast. Nine...

256
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,786
No. No, eight-eight percent.

257
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,497
Okay, you're breathing too fast.
- Eight three point nine percent.

258
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:23,058
You're burning oxygen, and
we don't want to do that.

259
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:26,479
We want to relax. Copy?
- Okay, sorry. Yes, copy, copy.

260
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,354
All right. Nearly there.
- Please hurry.

261
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:34,859
You can holster that torch, Dr. Stone.
- Sorry. Sorry.

262
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:43,403
Gotcha. All right, now
I'm gonna tether you to me.

263
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:48,377
I know, you never realized how
devastatingly good-looking I am.

264
00:17:48,972 --> 00:17:52,523
But I need you to stop staring and
help me with the tether.

265
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:55,836
Okay?
- Okay, okay.

266
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,386
I got it.

267
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:02,111
All right, here we go. All right.

268
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:04,893
Now, to clear you from the jets...
I'm gonna give you a little push.

269
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:06,235
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.
- Not a push.

270
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,699
No, no.
- A nudge.

271
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,577
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no! Damn it, no! No!

272
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:20,565
See? Where you go, I go.

273
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:27,699
Better.

274
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,203
Let's get outta here.

275
00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:34,646
Goddamn it.
- I know what you mean.

276
00:18:36,103 --> 00:18:38,399
Damn it.
- You're burning oxygen.

277
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:43,096
We're going back to the shuttle.
How's that for a plan? Copy?

278
00:18:43,131 --> 00:18:45,790
Fuck!
- Right. Copy that.

279
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:48,763
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

280
00:18:48,764 --> 00:18:50,719
Dr. Stone and I are gonna
make our way back to base.

281
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:54,083
Can you get the Explorer to prepare the
airlock for arrival? Copy?

282
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:57,972
Houston, this is...
Kowalski. How do you copy?

283
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:01,238
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

284
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:03,529
They can't hear us.
- We don't know that.

285
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:05,142
That's why we keep talking.

286
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,817
If somebody is listening,
they might just save your life.

287
00:19:08,787 --> 00:19:12,445
Set your watch for ninety minutes.
- Why ninety?

288
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:16,192
Well, Houston clocked that debris
at fifty thousand miles an hour.

289
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,132
If you factor in our current orbit,
then I figure we got about ninety minutes

290
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:21,518
before we get our asses kicked again.

291
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:25,546
O2 down to six percent.
- Okay.

292
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:28,795
Pretty scary shit being
untethered up here, isn't it?

293
00:19:30,098 --> 00:19:34,416
Yeah, pretty scary shit.
- Well, you did all right.

294
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,571
Well, you weren't so bad yourself.

295
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,545
Houston, in the blind.
This is Kowalski.

296
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:51,004
Our current location is approximately
nine hundred meters out from the Explorer.

297
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,131
Dr. Stone and I would like to retrieve
the body of Mission Specialist Shariff

298
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:59,843
and return it to the shuttle.
Am I a go to retrieve?

299
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:06,035
Roger that.
- Where is he? Where is he?

300
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:36,095
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

301
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:41,791
Grab him!

302
00:20:45,006 --> 00:20:48,134
Grab him!
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

303
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:54,718
You're pullin' me away.
- Got... I got him!

304
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:57,009
Clutch him like he's your Valentine.
- I got him. Okay. I got him.

305
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,557
I can't engage my thrust with you
two yo-yoin' around.

306
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:32,101
Jesus Christ.

307
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:35,832
Here's hopin' you have a hell of
an insurance policy, Houston.

308
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:42,622
The damages to Explorer are catastrophic.
Will commence search for survivors.

309
00:21:42,723 --> 00:21:44,650
O2 down to five percent.

310
00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:47,540
All right, here we go.
Careful of the edges!

311
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,083
Here. Here!

312
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:51,610
Houston, in the blind. To confirm.

313
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,490
Mission Specialist Dr. Stone and
Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski

314
00:22:56,491 --> 00:22:59,449
are the sole survivors
of the STS-one-five-seven.

315
00:23:02,476 --> 00:23:04,045
I apologize for not complying.

316
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:06,323
I should've stopped working as
soon as you instructed me to.

317
00:23:06,324 --> 00:23:08,009
We were gonna get hit no matter what.

318
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,380
There was nothing you could
do to change that.

319
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:16,861
Hey.
- Yes?

320
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:21,584
All right, we have to make our
way to the Space Station.

321
00:23:23,016 --> 00:23:24,528
Over there.

322
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,821
It's a bit of a hike, but we
need to use their escape pod,

323
00:23:28,822 --> 00:23:31,269
the Soyuz, to get back to Earth.

324
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:33,153
Agreed?

325
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:37,665
Dr. Stone, agreed?

326
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:42,628
Agreed.
- All right. After you.

327
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:46,314
Oh, God.

328
00:23:55,982 --> 00:23:58,223
Houston, in the blind.
This is Kowalski.

329
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:02,135
Dr. Stone and I have
determined to proceed to ISS

330
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:05,278
and use one of their
Soyuz for re-entry.

331
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:08,662
ISS, if you hear us...

332
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,363
we could sure use a rescue mission.

333
00:24:25,414 --> 00:24:29,232
O2 down to two percent.
- We're getting there.

334
00:24:30,882 --> 00:24:32,462
Beautiful, don't you think?

335
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:35,394
What?

336
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:37,062
The sunrise.

337
00:24:38,753 --> 00:24:40,706
That's what I'm gonna miss the most.

338
00:24:45,998 --> 00:24:48,418
So where's home, Dr. Stone?

339
00:24:51,244 --> 00:24:53,135
Ryan, where's home?

340
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,539
Home?

341
00:24:57,491 --> 00:25:00,402
Down there. Mother Earth.

342
00:25:01,257 --> 00:25:02,973
Where do you pitch you tent?

343
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:09,361
Lake Zurich.
- Where the hell is that?

344
00:25:13,015 --> 00:25:15,323
Illinois.
- Illinois.

345
00:25:15,423 --> 00:25:17,136
Central Time Zone.

346
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,043
That would make it roughly...

347
00:25:20,904 --> 00:25:22,419
eight PM.

348
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:25,771
What are the good people of Lake
Zurich doing at eight o'clock?

349
00:25:27,257 --> 00:25:28,785
I don't know.

350
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:33,568
I'm not gonna make it. I'm slowing
you down. - What would you be doing?

351
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:39,577
Come on, Ryan. It's eight o'clock.

352
00:25:40,544 --> 00:25:43,809
You've just left the hospital
after an eighteen-hour shift.

353
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:46,105
Driving home.

354
00:25:49,604 --> 00:25:50,853
The radio.

355
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,434
I listen to the radio.
- There we go.

356
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,684
Let me guess.

357
00:25:57,784 --> 00:26:01,927
NPR? Classical? Top forty?

358
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:09,180
Anything. I don't care, as long
as they don't talk. I just drive.

359
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:13,393
And where are you driving to?

360
00:26:16,102 --> 00:26:20,230
I just drive.
- What do you miss down there?

361
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,989
Is there a Mr. Stone?

362
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,572
No.
- Nobody special?

363
00:26:31,688 --> 00:26:35,439
Somebody down there looking
up, thinking about you?

364
00:26:37,893 --> 00:26:39,372
Ryan?

365
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:48,031
I had a daughter.

366
00:26:58,821 --> 00:27:00,253
She was four.

367
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:07,190
She was at school playing tag.
Slipped, hit her head, and that was it.

368
00:27:10,138 --> 00:27:12,184
Stupidest thing.

369
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:21,134
I was driving when
I got the call, so...

370
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:24,581
Ever since then, that's what I do.

371
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:31,519
I wake up, I go to
work, and I just drive.

372
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,157
O2 down to one percent.

373
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,433
Well, I've got good
news and bad news.

374
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:18,007
The good news is, we're about
five minutes from the ISS

375
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,246
and I know where the
Russians stash their vodka.

376
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:23,130
And that is good, because
I'm runnin' on fumes here.

377
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:28,012
The bad news is, I'm gonna be about ten
minutes short of breakin' Anatoly's record,

378
00:28:28,013 --> 00:28:29,563
and I...

379
00:28:30,504 --> 00:28:32,595
What? - I'm redlining.

380
00:28:32,695 --> 00:28:35,048
My O2 tank pressure is low.

381
00:28:35,253 --> 00:28:38,574
Your tank is out of oxygen but you
still have it in your suit. - Got it.

382
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:40,373
So you have to sip, not gulp.

383
00:28:41,326 --> 00:28:44,681
Wine, not beer.
Sip, Ryan.

384
00:28:45,484 --> 00:28:48,391
Houston, in the blind, we
have a visual of the ISS.

385
00:28:48,697 --> 00:28:52,276
The station must have been evacuated
because the first Soyuz is missing.

386
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,555
The second Soyuz exhibits surface
damage, and its chute has been deployed.

387
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,813
Any use as an escape pod
for re-entry is impossible.

388
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:03,563
Shouldn't we be turning?
We're drifting again.

389
00:29:03,664 --> 00:29:06,247
Not yet. I wasn't
kidding about those fumes.

390
00:29:06,348 --> 00:29:08,872
This can has one or
two good thrusts left...

391
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,497
if we're lucky.

392
00:29:23,217 --> 00:29:24,356
Steady.

393
00:29:34,057 --> 00:29:35,287
Aim.

394
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,082
Fire!

395
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,143
Brake! Brake! You have to brake!
- I can't, the can's empty.

396
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:49,722
We're gonna hit hard! Grab
a hold of anything you can!

397
00:30:01,782 --> 00:30:04,871
What do I do? What do I do?!

398
00:30:15,226 --> 00:30:16,599
Ryan!

399
00:30:20,461 --> 00:30:24,038
The tether broke, I'm detached!
I'm detached!

400
00:30:24,137 --> 00:30:25,563
Grab a hold!

401
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,548
Grab anything!

402
00:30:45,696 --> 00:30:46,989
Ryan!

403
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,865
Give me five!
- I've got you.

404
00:30:50,866 --> 00:30:54,202
I've got you. Right here, right here.

405
00:30:56,518 --> 00:31:00,154
Shit!
- No. No, no, no...

406
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,938
Got ya.

407
00:31:12,202 --> 00:31:13,203
Got ya.

408
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,510
You just... hold on and I'm gonna
start pulling you in. I'm gonna start...

409
00:31:19,572 --> 00:31:22,806
Hey, Doc. - Just hold on. Hang
on. I am gonna pull you in.

410
00:31:23,065 --> 00:31:25,845
Ryan, listen. - I'm gonna pull
you in. - You have to let me go. - No.

411
00:31:25,945 --> 00:31:28,578
The ropes are too loose. I'm
pulling you with me.

412
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,857
You have to let me
go, or we both die.

413
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:34,199
I'm not letting you go! We're fine!
- No.

414
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:42,333
Ryan, let me go.
- No. No.

415
00:31:43,365 --> 00:31:45,572
You're not going anywhere.
You're not going anywhere.

416
00:31:45,774 --> 00:31:49,390
It's not up to you. - No, no, no, no...
Please don't do this.

417
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:54,220
Please, please, please, please don't do
this. Please don't do this. No, no, no.

418
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,346
Please don't,
Matt. Please don't do this.

419
00:32:00,187 --> 00:32:01,735
You're gonna make it, Ryan.

420
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:04,265
No!

421
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:29,317
I had you. I had you! I had you.

422
00:32:45,035 --> 00:32:46,474
Ryan, do you hear me?

423
00:32:49,396 --> 00:32:53,253
Do you copy?
- My CO2 alarm went off.

424
00:32:53,354 --> 00:32:56,733
My CO2 alarm went off. - Look,
you need to board the station.

425
00:32:57,622 --> 00:32:59,262
Do you see the airlock?

426
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:11,687
Hey, Ryan, you copy?

427
00:33:14,011 --> 00:33:15,627
Look for the
airlock.

428
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:20,838
It's above you, next to
the Zarya module.

429
00:33:24,568 --> 00:33:27,018
You see it?
- Yes.

430
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:32,176
Yes, I see it. I see it. - Good.
That's where you want to go.

431
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:35,173
Now you're getting
lightheaded, right?

432
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:41,484
Yeah. Yes. - That's because you're
breathing CO2. You're losing consciousness.

433
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:44,275
You need to board the station.
- Okay.

434
00:33:45,547 --> 00:33:48,139
That second Soyuz is
too damaged for re-entry,

435
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:51,045
but it's perfectly fine
for a little Sunday drive.

436
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:53,053
Sunday drive?

437
00:33:53,457 --> 00:33:58,159
Look to the west. You see that
dot in the distance?

438
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,925
That's a Chinese station.
- Yes.

439
00:34:01,127 --> 00:34:03,647
You're gonna take the Soyuz, and
you're gonna cruise over there.

440
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:07,966
Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzhou.

441
00:34:08,903 --> 00:34:11,465
I've never flown a Shenzhou.
- It doesn't matter.

442
00:34:11,778 --> 00:34:14,432
Its re-entry protocol is
identical to the Soyuz.

443
00:34:15,728 --> 00:34:17,260
Okay.

444
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:23,369
You never flown the Soyuz either?
- Only a simulator.

445
00:34:24,224 --> 00:34:29,580
Well, then you know.
- But I crashed it.

446
00:34:29,789 --> 00:34:31,893
It's a simulator, that's
what it's designed for.

447
00:34:35,233 --> 00:34:37,875
Every time. I crashed it every time.

448
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,434
You point the damn thing at Earth.

449
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:42,399
It's not rocket science.

450
00:34:42,932 --> 00:34:43,976
And by this time tomorrow,

451
00:34:43,977 --> 00:34:46,796
you're gonna be back in Lake Zurich
with a hell of a story to tell.

452
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:49,194
You copy?

453
00:34:50,903 --> 00:34:54,709
Ryan, you copy? - I'm gonna take
the Soyuz and come get you.

454
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,491
No, you're not.
- I'm coming to get you.

455
00:34:56,738 --> 00:34:59,113
No, I've got too much of a head
start on you. - I'm coming to get you.

456
00:34:59,215 --> 00:35:01,439
I'm afraid that ship already sailed.

457
00:35:02,695 --> 00:35:05,187
Ryan, you're
gonna have to learn to let go.

458
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:08,810
But I... - I want to hear you say
you're gonna make it...

459
00:35:10,964 --> 00:35:13,014
Come on, Ryan, say it.

460
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:18,696
I'm gonna make it.
- All right. Keep going.

461
00:35:19,557 --> 00:35:22,523
What kind of name is Ryan for a girl?

462
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:27,815
Dad wanted a boy.
- Are you close to the airlock?

463
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:31,922
Not yet.
- Keep going.

464
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,018
So now that we have some
distance between us...

465
00:35:35,235 --> 00:35:38,346
you're attracted to me, right?
- What?

466
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:42,328
Well, people say I have beautiful
blue eyes.

467
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:49,758
You have beautiful...
You have beautiful blue eyes.

468
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:51,544
I have brown eyes.

469
00:35:55,073 --> 00:35:57,739
You want to know the good news?
- What?

470
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,705
I'm gonna break Anatoly's record,

471
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,224
and I think mine's gonna
stand for a long, long time.

472
00:36:02,324 --> 00:36:05,206
No. I'm coming to get you.

473
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,623
Oh, my God.
- What? What?

474
00:36:11,466 --> 00:36:12,906
Wow.

475
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,920
Hey, Ryan?
- Yeah?

476
00:36:17,103 --> 00:36:19,758
You should see the sun on the Ganges.

477
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,959
It's amazing.

478
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,334
Where are you? Where are you?

479
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:54,725
Comms. Comms. There you are.

480
00:41:05,475 --> 00:41:07,442
Okay. Matt, this is Ryan, copy.

481
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,753
Matt, this is Ryan, copy.

482
00:41:16,021 --> 00:41:19,459
Matt, I made it, I'm here, I'm
on the station. Do you copy?

483
00:41:25,935 --> 00:41:27,589
Come on, Matt, talk to me.

484
00:41:28,212 --> 00:41:30,664
Tell me where
you are, give me your position.

485
00:41:31,743 --> 00:41:35,193
Where are you? Give me a visual.
Just tell me what you see.

486
00:41:40,004 --> 00:41:42,632
Come on. You've been yammering
since we left Cape Canaveral,

487
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,035
and now you decide to shut up?

488
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:48,045
Talk to me. Just say something,
say anything! I don't care!

489
00:41:54,341 --> 00:42:00,248
Hey, tell me about, uh, Mardi Gras.
Tell me about the hairy guy. Huh?

490
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:02,384
Tell me what happened.

491
00:42:02,485 --> 00:42:04,931
What happened to the hairy guy?

492
00:42:11,053 --> 00:42:13,143
Please talk to me.

493
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:18,786
Please.

494
00:42:34,074 --> 00:42:35,588
Houston, in the blind...

495
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:42,393
this is Mission Specialist Ryan
Stone reporting from the ISS.

496
00:42:44,342 --> 00:42:47,281
All communications with Mission
Commander Matthew Kowalski

497
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,923
have been lost.

498
00:42:51,954 --> 00:42:54,198
Radio transmission absent.

499
00:42:56,044 --> 00:42:58,178
Visuals nonexistent.

500
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:05,831
To confirm, I, Ryan
Stone, am the sole survivor

501
00:43:06,257 --> 00:43:08,393
of STS-one-five-seven.

502
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:24,704
What now?

503
00:45:00,063 --> 00:45:01,065
Okay.

504
00:45:04,046 --> 00:45:08,271
Okay. Where is it, where
is it? Where is the power?

505
00:45:11,741 --> 00:45:15,821
Great, just like training.
Undocking, undocking.

506
00:45:16,363 --> 00:45:20,120
Undocking. Red.

507
00:45:25,449 --> 00:45:27,402
Okay.

508
00:45:28,466 --> 00:45:32,113
Okay, where is it?
Where is it?

509
00:45:32,307 --> 00:45:33,307
Come on.

510
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:35,369
Okay.

511
00:45:38,785 --> 00:45:41,110
Okay, I remember this,
I remember this.

512
00:45:56,234 --> 00:45:58,993
You don't have four minutes.

513
00:45:59,792 --> 00:46:00,792
We're going manual.

514
00:46:01,835 --> 00:46:03,073
Come on.

515
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:09,919
Okay. Active-Activate, undock.

516
00:46:34,932 --> 00:46:36,991
Seven minutes to get out of here.

517
00:46:43,698 --> 00:46:45,707
All right, okay.

518
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,062
What... what?

519
00:47:12,506 --> 00:47:14,735
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

520
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:45,794
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

521
00:47:55,702 --> 00:47:57,733
Come on, come on, come on!

522
00:47:58,003 --> 00:47:59,509
Come on!

523
00:47:59,511 --> 00:48:01,494
Come on, come on, come on!

524
00:48:02,427 --> 00:48:04,190
That's right, that's right.

525
00:48:04,722 --> 00:48:07,425
That's right, that's
right, that's right.

526
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:11,420
Come on.

527
00:48:47,347 --> 00:48:48,349
Great.

528
00:49:34,444 --> 00:49:37,535
Clear skies with a chance of
satellite debris.

529
00:50:51,207 --> 00:50:54,202
Okay, we detach this, and we go
home. Piece of cake.

530
00:51:20,918 --> 00:51:22,317
Okay.

531
00:51:26,201 --> 00:51:27,907
Okay, what do we have?

532
00:51:28,449 --> 00:51:30,343
Okay, all right.

533
00:51:40,912 --> 00:51:42,257
Shit.

534
00:51:49,384 --> 00:51:51,417
Okay, come on.

535
00:51:51,516 --> 00:51:52,517
Come on, come on.

536
00:51:53,355 --> 00:51:54,357
All right.

537
00:53:25,561 --> 00:53:27,121
I hate space.

538
00:53:47,162 --> 00:53:48,850
Shut up.

539
00:53:52,783 --> 00:53:53,959
Okay.

540
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:03,350
All right.

541
00:54:08,014 --> 00:54:09,229
That's good.

542
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,459
Okay.

543
00:54:13,646 --> 00:54:15,565
Let's stabilize you.

544
00:54:30,918 --> 00:54:32,189
Okay.

545
00:54:33,276 --> 00:54:36,026
Let's go visit the Chinese station.

546
00:54:36,962 --> 00:54:38,413
Houston, in the blind,

547
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:44,248
Tiangong is approximately one
hundred kilometers to the west,

548
00:54:44,631 --> 00:54:51,609
and I am off its course by about thirteen
degrees. I will correct trajectory.

549
00:55:14,331 --> 00:55:17,509
Okay. Okay.

550
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,167
Okay.

551
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:24,473
I will engage S-Ka-Dae
in five... four...

552
00:55:24,763 --> 00:55:27,158
three... two... one.

553
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:44,202
What's happening, what's
happening? Come on, come on.

554
00:55:47,287 --> 00:55:48,462
One.

555
00:56:02,813 --> 00:56:04,525
Come on, come on.

556
00:56:08,495 --> 00:56:10,670
You gotta be kidding me.

557
00:56:11,078 --> 00:56:12,746
You gotta be kidding me!

558
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:19,382
No! Don't you fuck...

559
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:34,022
Houston, in the blind. Houston, in
the blind, this is Dr. Ryan Stone.

560
00:56:34,526 --> 00:56:38,515
I'm calling from the
Soyuz TMA-one-four-M.

561
00:56:38,991 --> 00:56:43,003
I'm currently out of fuel
and adrift, do you copy?

562
00:56:44,865 --> 00:56:48,625
Houston. This is Dr. Ryan Stone.

563
00:56:49,298 --> 00:56:50,300
Do you copy?

564
00:56:54,976 --> 00:56:59,514
Houston. This is
Ryan Stone. Do you copy?

565
00:57:02,908 --> 00:57:07,658
Houston, this is Missish... Mission
Specialist Ryan Stone, do you copy?

566
00:57:09,437 --> 00:57:12,292
Houston, Houston,
please confirm identity.

567
00:57:12,654 --> 00:57:16,169
Houston, you're coming in
over an A.M. frequency. Copy.

568
00:57:17,663 --> 00:57:18,664
Do you copy?

569
00:57:19,554 --> 00:57:22,848
Is this the Chinese station? Is
this Tiangong? Copy.

570
00:57:24,517 --> 00:57:29,047
Mayday, can you copy?
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

571
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:34,940
Yes, yes. Mayday, mayday.
Mayday, mayday.

572
00:57:35,935 --> 00:57:38,174
Aningaaq.

573
00:57:40,886 --> 00:57:43,909
Is that...? Is that your...?
Is that your name?

574
00:57:43,911 --> 00:57:46,963
Aningaaq is your... is your
name? Is that your name?

575
00:57:48,728 --> 00:57:49,730
Mayday!

576
00:57:49,731 --> 00:57:52,707
No, no, no. No, my name
is not 'Mayday. ' I'm Stone.

577
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:56,738
Dr. Ryan Stone, I need help. I am...

578
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,511
Those are dogs.

579
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,875
They're calling from Earth.

580
00:58:08,297 --> 00:58:10,117
They're calling from Earth.

581
00:58:22,671 --> 00:58:27,736
Aningaaq, make your dogs bark
again for me, would you please?

582
00:58:29,733 --> 00:58:34,284
Your dogs. Dogs, you
know. Woof, woof. Dogs.

583
00:59:19,197 --> 00:59:21,215
Oh, I'm gonna die, Aningaaq.

584
00:59:23,533 --> 00:59:27,181
I know, we're all gonna
die. Everybody knows that.

585
00:59:27,274 --> 00:59:29,515
But I'm gonna die today.

586
00:59:32,141 --> 00:59:35,312
Funny, that. You know, to know...

587
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,291
But the thing is, it's
that I'm still scared.

588
00:59:41,983 --> 00:59:43,807
I'm really scared.

589
00:59:46,573 --> 00:59:49,180
Nobody will mourn for me,

590
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,557
no one will pray for my soul.

591
00:59:53,216 --> 00:59:55,115
Will you mourn for me?

592
00:59:56,598 --> 00:59:58,787
Will you say a prayer for me?

593
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:01,048
Or is it too late?

594
01:00:05,487 --> 01:00:08,745
I mean, I'd say one for myself,
but I've never prayed in my life,

595
01:00:08,965 --> 01:00:10,010
so...

596
01:00:10,856 --> 01:00:12,792
Nobody ever taught me how.

597
01:00:16,834 --> 01:00:19,302
Nobody ever taught me how.

598
01:00:30,513 --> 01:00:31,894
A baby.

599
01:00:44,512 --> 01:00:46,649
There's a baby with you, huh?

600
01:00:49,511 --> 01:00:51,666
Is that a lullaby you're singing?

601
01:00:54,612 --> 01:00:56,413
That's so sweet.

602
01:00:58,596 --> 01:01:00,783
I used to sing to my baby.

603
01:01:04,638 --> 01:01:06,781
I hope I see her soon.

604
01:02:17,195 --> 01:02:20,255
That's nice, Aningaaq. Keep
singing, just like that.

605
01:02:22,227 --> 01:02:24,736
Sing me to sleep, and I'll sleep.

606
01:02:26,376 --> 01:02:30,475
Keep singing. And sing, and sing.

607
01:02:59,941 --> 01:03:01,822
No, no, no, don't!

608
01:03:44,859 --> 01:03:46,904
Check your watch. Thirteen
hours and eleven minutes.

609
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:50,157
Call Anatoly and tell
him he's been bumped.

610
01:03:50,886 --> 01:03:52,425
It's a little gloomy in here, isn't it?
- How did you...?

611
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:55,676
Trust me, it's a hell of a story.
- But how did...?

612
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,022
That's better.

613
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:03,993
I found a little extra...
a little extra battery power.

614
01:04:04,259 --> 01:04:06,519
It helps that I didn't
have you around to distract me.

615
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:10,910
I have to say, I'm glad to see ya. I
didn't think you were gonna make it.

616
01:04:11,404 --> 01:04:14,055
Did you find the vodka?
- You...

617
01:04:14,889 --> 01:04:17,682
You never told me where...
where it was, so... - Well...

618
01:04:23,533 --> 01:04:26,870
To Anatoly. Na zdorovje.

619
01:04:31,984 --> 01:04:36,594
Huh? - No. - No? All right.
Let's get out of here.

620
01:04:38,696 --> 01:04:43,189
The Chinese station's about a hundred
miles. Just a little Sunday drive.

621
01:04:43,534 --> 01:04:44,970
We can't.
- Sure we can.

622
01:04:45,635 --> 01:04:46,663
There's no fuel, I tried everything.

623
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:50,047
Well, there's always something
we can do. - I tried everything.

624
01:04:50,147 --> 01:04:52,292
Did you try the soft landing jets?

625
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:54,593
They're for landing. So...
- Well, landing is launching.

626
01:04:54,689 --> 01:04:56,920
It's the same thing. Didn't you
learn about that in training?

627
01:04:57,019 --> 01:04:59,019
I never got to land the simulator.
I told you that.

628
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:01,757
But you know about it.
- And I crashed it every time.

629
01:05:01,857 --> 01:05:04,217
Listen, do you want to go back,
or do you want to stay here?

630
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:09,189
I get it, it's nice up here.

631
01:05:12,382 --> 01:05:16,186
You can just shut
down all the systems,

632
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:19,376
turn out all the lights...

633
01:05:20,198 --> 01:05:22,791
and just close your eyes
and tune out everybody.

634
01:05:23,683 --> 01:05:25,607
There's nobody up
here that can hurt you.

635
01:05:26,117 --> 01:05:27,478
It's safe.

636
01:05:31,021 --> 01:05:33,881
I mean, what's the point of going
on? What's the point of living?

637
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:42,282
Your kid died. Doesn't
get any rougher than that.

638
01:05:44,828 --> 01:05:47,391
But still, it's a matter of what
you do now.

639
01:05:48,746 --> 01:05:52,029
If you decide to go, then
you gotta just get on with it.

640
01:05:52,872 --> 01:05:55,294
Sit back, enjoy the ride.

641
01:05:55,933 --> 01:05:59,698
You gotta plant both your feet on
the ground and start livin' life.

642
01:05:59,798 --> 01:06:03,554
How did you get here?
- I'm telling you, it's a hell of a story.

643
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:06,491
Hey, Ryan?
- What?

644
01:06:06,706 --> 01:06:09,131
It's time to go home.

645
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,769
Landing...

646
01:06:55,992 --> 01:07:00,257
Landing... Landing is launching.

647
01:07:00,845 --> 01:07:02,235
I said...

648
01:07:16,107 --> 01:07:19,017
Okay, landing, landing.
Landing is green.

649
01:07:29,951 --> 01:07:31,104
Okay.

650
01:07:32,903 --> 01:07:36,576
Okay, landing. All right.

651
01:07:37,226 --> 01:07:42,041
Okay. Soft landing jets trigger automatically
at three meters before landing, so...

652
01:07:44,966 --> 01:07:47,230
You're a clever son of a
bitch, Matt.

653
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:53,548
I need to... I need to get rid of
the B.O... And the engine module.

654
01:07:54,884 --> 01:07:56,291
Right. Okay.

655
01:07:57,007 --> 01:07:58,291
Okay.

656
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:01,351
Okay.

657
01:08:04,149 --> 01:08:05,755
Tri-module separation.

658
01:08:07,012 --> 01:08:08,013
Go.

659
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:23,873
Okay.

660
01:08:24,775 --> 01:08:26,760
Houston, here's the tricky part.

661
01:08:27,415 --> 01:08:29,537
Soyuz has to think

662
01:08:29,737 --> 01:08:33,247
we are three meters off the Earth.

663
01:08:34,148 --> 01:08:36,753
All right. Okay.

664
01:08:37,147 --> 01:08:42,516
Hey, Matt? Since I had to listen to endless
hours of your storytelling this week,

665
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:44,832
I need for you to do me a favor.

666
01:08:46,098 --> 01:08:51,405
You are gonna see a little girl with
brown hair, very messy, lots of knots.

667
01:08:52,077 --> 01:08:55,390
She doesn't like to
brush it. That's okay.

668
01:08:56,434 --> 01:08:57,712
Her name is Sarah.

669
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:00,479
Can you please tell her

670
01:09:01,524 --> 01:09:03,791
that Mama found her red shoe?

671
01:09:04,975 --> 01:09:07,066
She was so worried
about that shoe, Matt.

672
01:09:07,955 --> 01:09:09,692
But it was just right under the bed.

673
01:09:13,433 --> 01:09:15,827
Give her a big hug
and a big kiss for me,

674
01:09:15,928 --> 01:09:17,801
and tell her that Mama misses her.

675
01:09:19,176 --> 01:09:21,041
You tell her that she is my angel.

676
01:09:22,009 --> 01:09:25,582
And she makes me so
proud. So, so proud.

677
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,292
And you tell her
that I'm not quitting.

678
01:09:39,878 --> 01:09:41,697
You tell her that I love her, Matt.

679
01:09:42,896 --> 01:09:45,205
You tell her that I love her so much.

680
01:09:47,987 --> 01:09:49,553
Can you do that for me?

681
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:53,782
Roger that?

682
01:09:56,183 --> 01:09:57,557
Here we go.

683
01:10:33,881 --> 01:10:36,005
You're losing altitude, Tiangong.

684
01:10:39,256 --> 01:10:42,724
You keep dropping and you're gonna
kiss the atmosphere.

685
01:10:43,425 --> 01:10:46,533
But not without me,
because you're my last ride.

686
01:10:47,878 --> 01:10:49,345
Okay.

687
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:51,720
Wait.

688
01:10:58,750 --> 01:10:59,886
Five...

689
01:11:01,101 --> 01:11:02,212
four...

690
01:11:03,404 --> 01:11:04,462
three...

691
01:11:05,682 --> 01:11:07,364
No more just driving.

692
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:10,789
Let's go home.

693
01:11:15,582 --> 01:11:18,662
Steady. Okay, come on, come on.

694
01:11:19,796 --> 01:11:20,797
Steady, steady.

695
01:11:22,092 --> 01:11:23,890
Come on. Come on.

696
01:11:28,001 --> 01:11:29,603
Where are you? Where
are you? Forty-five,

697
01:11:30,277 --> 01:11:33,089
ninety, one-eighty.

698
01:11:40,416 --> 01:11:41,417
Come on.

699
01:11:50,481 --> 01:11:51,954
Okay, okay.

700
01:11:53,839 --> 01:11:55,584
Okay.

701
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,602
All right.

702
01:12:09,587 --> 01:12:11,090
Damn it.

703
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:16,707
Down, down, down.
Come to Mama.

704
01:13:29,999 --> 01:13:31,398
Okay.

705
01:13:37,809 --> 01:13:40,030
Okay. Shit!

706
01:13:46,721 --> 01:13:47,721
Okay.

707
01:13:49,715 --> 01:13:53,204
Come on. Shenzhou, come
on. Shenzhou. Shenzhou.

708
01:13:54,258 --> 01:13:58,460
Fuck! Okay, this way. Shenzhou.

709
01:14:05,797 --> 01:14:09,029
Where are you? Come on,
where are you? What's this?

710
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:59,955
In the Soyuz, the
power button is here.

711
01:15:03,361 --> 01:15:06,516
Okay, undocking,
undocking.

712
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:09,493
Eeni, meeni...

713
01:15:09,495 --> 01:15:14,122
Okay, that doesn't sound
good. Miny, meeni... moe.

714
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:17,572
No hablo chino.

715
01:15:18,888 --> 01:15:21,052
Miny... moe.

716
01:15:22,954 --> 01:15:25,357
Okay. Okay, good.

717
01:15:33,687 --> 01:15:35,626
Houston. Houston, in the blind.

718
01:15:35,953 --> 01:15:37,878
This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone

719
01:15:38,249 --> 01:15:39,841
reporting from the Shenzhou.

720
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:41,983
I'm about to undock from Tiangong...

721
01:15:46,796 --> 01:15:49,444
And I have a bad
feeling about this mission.

722
01:15:51,789 --> 01:15:53,833
Reminds me of a story, Houston...

723
01:15:56,300 --> 01:16:00,419
Never... Never mind the story,
Houston. Never mind the story.

724
01:16:02,948 --> 01:16:06,103
It's getting hot in here. Okay.
All right.

725
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:08,095
Okay.

726
01:16:08,869 --> 01:16:12,869
All right, the way I see it,
there's only two possible outcomes.

727
01:16:13,116 --> 01:16:17,643
Either I make it down there in one piece
and I have one hell of a story to tell,

728
01:16:18,366 --> 01:16:20,833
or I burn up in the next ten minutes.

729
01:16:22,329 --> 01:16:26,671
Either way, whichever
way... no harm, no foul!

730
01:16:34,198 --> 01:16:35,702
Because either way...

731
01:16:38,059 --> 01:16:40,397
it'll be one hell of a ride.

732
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:44,510
I'm ready.

733
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:55,806
Shenzhou, in the blind, this is
Houston. Indicate FM frequency.

734
01:18:57,292 --> 01:18:59,918
Our radars detect you
on a re-entry trajectory.

735
01:18:59,954 --> 01:19:02,362
If you copy, please confirm identity.

736
01:19:23,245 --> 01:19:28,341
This is Houston.
- It's freezing, it's boring as hell.

737
01:19:28,941 --> 01:19:30,976
...is: No money down!

738
01:19:30,977 --> 01:19:35,065
...messages, we'll be right...
- Please confirm identity.

739
01:19:35,066 --> 01:19:36,068
Skies over the Midwest
are completely clear...

740
01:19:36,069 --> 01:19:39,398
We've deployed a rescue
mission to retrieve you.

741
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:41,798
Rescue mission is on the way.

742
01:19:45,635 --> 01:19:47,103
Shenzhou, in the blind, this is Houston.

743
01:19:47,104 --> 01:19:49,774
We've deployed a rescue
mission to retrieve you.

744
01:22:44,021 --> 01:22:45,410
Thank you.
