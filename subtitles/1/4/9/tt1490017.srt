1
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,377
He is coming.

2
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,754
Cover your butt.

3
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,171
Cover the what?

4
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,262
Vitruvius.

5
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:53,805
Lord Business.

6
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:56,099
You've hidden the Kragle well, old man.

7
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:58,268
Robots, destroy him!

8
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:00,228
Yes, Lord Business.

9
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:02,480
Your robots are no match
for a MasterBuilder.

10
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,024
For I see everything!

11
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,985
Unh! My eyes! Ow!

12
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:10,655
The Kragle. The most
powerful super weapon...

13
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,490
is mine.

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,452
Oh, the Kragle!

15
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:20,832
Now my evil power will be unlimited!
Can you feel me?

16
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,082
I can feel you.

17
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,127
Whoo! Nothing's gonna stop me now.

18
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:25,879
Wait. There was a prophecy.

19
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,672
Oh, now there's a prophecy.

20
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,382
About the Piece of Resistance.

21
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:32,552
Oh, yes! The supposed
missing Piece of Resistance...

22
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:35,138
that can somehow magically
disarm the Kragle.

23
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:36,973
Give me a break!

24
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:41,352
One day, a talented lass or fellow

25
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,855
A Special One with face of yellow

26
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,733
Will make the Piece of Resistance found

27
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:49,611
From its hiding refuge underground

28
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,863
And with a noble army at the helm

29
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:56,117
This MasterBuilder will thwart
The Kragle and save the realm

30
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,661
And be the greatest
Most interesting

31
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:01,831
Most important person of all times

32
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,833
All of this is true

33
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,668
Because it rhymes

34
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,670
Oh, wow.

35
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:10,715
That was a great, inspiring legend...

36
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,050
that you made up.

37
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:16,387
A "Special One"?

38
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:20,308
What a bunch of hippie-dippie baloney.

39
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,329
Good morning, apartment!

40
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,373
Good morning, doorway!
Good morning, wall.

41
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:45,333
Good morning, ceiling.
Good morning, floor!

42
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,584
Ready to start the day!

43
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:49,629
Ah, here it is!

44
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,919
"Instructions to fit in...

45
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,290
have everybody like you...

46
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:53,633
and always be happy!

47
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,051
Step one:

48
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:56,301
Breathe."

49
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,349
Okay, got that one down.

50
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,310
Greet the day,
smile and say..."

51
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,563
Good morning, city!

52
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:08,857
- Good morning, city!
- Good morning, city!

53
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:11,943
- Good morning, city!
- Top of the morning to you there, city!

54
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:14,863
- Good morning, city! How you doing?
- Good morning, city!

55
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:17,490
Exercise."

56
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,409
Jumping jacks. Hit them!

57
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:20,743
One!

58
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:22,620
Two!

59
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:23,912
Three!

60
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,373
I am so pumped UP!

61
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,041
Shower."

62
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,671
And always be sure to keep
the soap out of your...! Aah!

63
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,464
Shave your face.

64
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:34,757
Brush your teeth.

65
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:36,885
Comb your hair. Hmm.

66
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:39,136
"Wear clothes."

67
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:41,389
Oop! I almost forgot that one!

68
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,182
No. No. Uh-uh. No.

69
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:44,642
Not that. Wrong.

70
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:46,269
And that's it. Check.

71
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,605
Eat a complete breakfast...

72
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:52,066
with all the special
people in your life.

73
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:55,403
Hey, Plantie, what do you
wanna do this morning?

74
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,572
Watch TV? Me too!

75
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,490
Hi, I'm President Business...

76
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,826
president of the Octan Corporation
and the world.

77
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:05,076
<i>Let's take extra care to follow the
instructions, or you'll be put to sleep.</i>

78
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,457
And don't forget Taco Tuesday's
coming next week!

79
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:11,461
That's the day every rule-following citizen
gets a free taco and my love!

80
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:12,462
Have a great day, everybody!

81
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:14,714
You have a great day too,
President Business.

82
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,091
Man, he's such a cool guy.
I always wanna hear more of what...

83
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:18,718
Wait, did he say "put to sleep"?

84
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,428
Tonight on Where Are My Pants?

85
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:24,599
Honey, where are my pants?

86
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:30,605
What was I just thinking? I don't care.

87
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:33,107
Greet your neighbors."

88
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:34,484
- Hey, Joe.

89
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:36,194
Whoa! Hey, Surfer Dave.

Obey all traffic signs and regulations.

97
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,294
Enjoy popular music.

98
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:54,584
Top of the charts again...

99
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:57,435
<i>- ...it's "Everything ls Awesome. "</i>
- Oh, <i>my gosh,</i> I <i>love this song!</i>

Everything is awesome

Everything is cool

102
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:03,304
When you're part of a team

103
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:06,140
Everything is awesome

104
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,809
When we're living our

105
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:08,643
Dream

106
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,395
Always use a turn signal.

107
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,689
Park between the lines. Yes!

108
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,300
Drop off dry-cleaning before noon.

109
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Read the headlines.

110
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:16,608
Don't forget to smile.

111
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:18,296
Always root for the local sports team.

112

Go, Sports Team!

113
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:21,194
Always return a compliment.

114
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:22,949
- Hey, you look nice.
- So do you!

115
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,701
Drink overpriced coffee.

116
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:26,911
Here you go. That's $37.

117
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,620
Awesome!

Everything is awesome

119

Did you see
Where Are My Pants? last night?

120
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,087
"Honey, where's my pants?"

121
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:38,381
Classic episode.

122

Everything is awesome

123
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:44,178
Instructions coming in from Central.

124
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:47,223
Okay, it says here to take
everything weird and blow it up.

125
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,228
All right, Cylinderheads...

126
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,147
let's make it look
like it does in the instructions!

127
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:54,981
Hey, buddy!

128
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,607
I need a 1-by-2 key hole.

129
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:57,858
No problem, Michael.

130
00:05:58,026 --> 00:05:59,360
We need a 2-by-2 macaroni.

131
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,446
2-by-2 macaroni flying in. Here's one.

132
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:04,699
Guys, got a 1-by-1
with an indented stud on one side.

133
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:07,744
- Cheese slopes. Come on, everybody.
- Roger that, Roger.

134
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:09,034
Look alive, coming at you.

135
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:10,204
Can I get a couple LURPs over here?

136
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:12,540
- Thanks, Gail.
- Guys, watch me drill this down.

137
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,251
Everything is awesome

<i>Have you heard the news?
Everyone's talkin'</i>

Man, I feel so good right now!
I could sing this song for hours!

144
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,854
Everything is awesome

145

When you're part of a team!

147
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:43,088
Yeah!

148
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,823
I'm going to the sports bar
after work tonight.

149
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:49,452
Who wants to eat some delicious
chicken wings and get crazy?

150
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:51,142
Chicken wings? I love chicken wings!

151
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:53,247
Hey, who wants to share a croissant
with this guy?

152
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,489
Croissants? I love croissants.

153
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,417
Oh, yeah! I sure do love giant sausages.

154
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:57,667
Giant sausages? No way!

155
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,420
You know what I love to do?

156
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,670
Is share a meal
with the special people in my life.

157
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:02,965
Fred, Barry, Gail, me and you?

158
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,426
Ah! No, wait, guys!

159
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,929
Wait up! Okay, I'll meet you there.

160
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,514
Oh. Where did it go?

161
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,682
Oh, there you are.

162
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:17,021
I think I heard a whoosh.

163
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:26,239
Hey, pal, I hate to tell you this...

164
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:28,449
but, uh, I don't think
you're supposed to be here.

165
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:30,910
Yeah, the rules specifically state...

166
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,830
work site closes at 6,
it's a hard-hat area only.

167
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,916
That's not official safety orange.

168
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:41,045
"If you see anything weird,
report it immediately."

169
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:43,214
Well, I guess I'm gonna...

170
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:47,760
have to report youuu...

171
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,388
UUU...

172
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:53,432
UUU...

173
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:55,685
UUU...

174
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:57,270
UUU...

175
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,646
UUU...

176
00:07:58,896 --> 00:07:59,981
UUU...

177
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,524
UUU...

178
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:03,276
UUU...

179
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:08,406
Where are you going? Miss!
I didn't mean to scare you! I'm sor...

180
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:22,920
Ow. Ow!

181
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:24,964
Hey! Heh. That's not so bad.

182
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,425
Yeow! Ooh! Aah! Aah! Ooh!

183
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:32,805
Ow.

184
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:34,640
Ow.

185
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:36,601
Hey.

186
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,650
What is that?

187
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:48,863
Come here.

188
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:53,409
What do I do?
I don't have my instructions.

189
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,245
Touch the Piece.

190
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:59,957
Touch the Piece. Touch the Piece.

191
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:04,503
I feel like maybe I should touch that.

192
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:06,547
It's so...

193
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:07,965
<i>interesting.</i>

194
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:09,467
Touch the Piece.

195
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,388
It's so interesting.

196
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,766
Touch the Piece.

197
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:18,559
Touch the Piece.

198
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,020
- Touch the Piece.
- Uh...

199
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:23,064
Touch the...

200
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,110
A Special One with face of yellow

201
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:30,613
Will make the Piece of Resistance found

202
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:33,449
From its hiding refuge underground

203
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:34,992
What's going on down here?

204
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:38,412
This MasterBuilder will thwart
The Kragle and save the realm

205
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:39,663
Come on, Emmet!

206
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,873
The Special has arisen.

207
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,917
It's your turn to be the hero.

208
00:09:44,252 --> 00:09:45,753
- Wake up.
- Ugh.

209
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,129
Come on, wake up!

210
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,540
Where are the MasterBuilders?

211
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,549
How did you find
the Piece of Resistance? Eh?

212
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,041
- Where are the others hiding?
- Good morning, apartment?

213
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:54,262
- Aah!

214
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,113
How did you find
the Piece of Resistance?

215
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:57,222
The piece of what?

216
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,267
The Piece of Resistance.

217
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,820
<i>I... I don't... Where</i> am <i>I?
What's happening?</i>

218
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,980
"What's happening?"

219
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,941
Playing dumb, MasterBuilder.

220
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,567
No. I... "MasterBuilder"?

221
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:11,404
- Oh. So you've never heard of the prophecy?
- No.

222
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:12,238
Or The Special?

223
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:13,155
No, no!

224
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,991
You're a liar! We'll kill you!

225
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:20,746
Look, urn,
I watch a lot of cop shows on TV.

226
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:23,374
Isn't there supposed to also be...?

227
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,627
Isn't there supposed to be a good cop?

228
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,631
Oh, yes. But we're not done yet.

229
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,968
Hi, buddy! I'm your friendly
neighborhood police officer!

230
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,499
- Would you like a glass of water?
- Yeah. Yeah, actually.

231
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:37,554
Too bad.

232
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:39,056
Security cameras picked up this.

233
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:43,060
Unh! You were found at the construction
site convulsing with a strange piece.

234
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:44,311
That's disgusting!

235
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,814
Then why is it permanently stuck
to your back?

236
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,985
Get it off me! Get it off me! Aah!

237
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,635
It won't come off! It's chasing me!

238
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,030
Look, it's not my fault!

239
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,040
I have no idea how this thing
got on my back!

240
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,950
Of course, buddy. I believe you.

241
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,868
Great. Aah!

242
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:00,578
I "believe" you too.

243
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,247
You see the quotations
I'm making with my claw hands?

244
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,708
It means I don't believe you!

245
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,626
Why else would you show up
with that thing on your back...

246
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:09,718
just three days before
President Business...

247
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:12,006
is going to use the Kragle
to end the world?

248
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,300
President Business is gonna end the world?

249
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,843
But he's such a good guy.

250
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,262
And Octan, they make good stuff.

251
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,890
Music, dairy products, coffee, TV shows...

252
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,352
surveillance systems,
all history books, voting machines.

253
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:25,602
Wait a minute.

254
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,980
Come on, you can't be this stupid.

255
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,607
This is a misunderstanding.

256
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,650
I'm just a regular, normal, ordinary guy.

257
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:33,986
I'm late to meet my best friends
in the whole world.

258
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,029
They're probably missing me right now.

259
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,739
They're probably out looking around.

260
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,190
"Hey, where's Emmet?
Hey, where's my best friend Emmet?"

261
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,619
Hey, you know what?
Ask all my friends. They'll tell you.

262
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:44,538
Oh, we asked them, all right.

263
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:45,789
Boom!

264
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,958
That guy's not a criminal mastermind.

265
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,209
See?

266
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:52,671
Yeah. You know, he's kind of
an average, normal kind of guy.

267
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:53,922
Thank you.

268
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,799
But, you know, he's not, like...

269
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,218
normal like us. No.

270
00:11:57,468 --> 00:12:00,179
He's not that special.

271
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,182
Wait, I'm so confused.
Who are we talking about?

272
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:06,394
Wait, does he work with us?

273
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:07,978
Gail doesn't remember me?

274
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:09,229
Look at Randy here.

275
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:11,857
He likes sausage. That's something.

276
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,652
Gail is perky. That's something.

277
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:15,444
And Harry...

278
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,863
<i>- ...well...</i>-

279
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,493
When you say the other guy, I go:

280
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:24,662
Harry's the best!

281
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,039
- Harry's got personality.
- He's weird! He's weird!

282
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,459
I know that guy but I know, like,
zippy-zap about him.

283
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,169
We just talked earlier.

284
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,213
I mean, all he does is say yes...

285
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,507
to everything everybody else is doing.

286
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,884
You know, he's just sort of a "Hmm!"

287
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:41,846
Little bit of a blank slate, I guess.

288
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,890
<i>That'll be $42, please.</i>

289
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:49,103
We all have something that makes us
something and Emmet is...

290
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:52,731
nothing.

291
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,860
There you go.

292
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:59,113
- I told you I was a nobody.
- Oh.

293
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,906
It's the perfect cover.

294
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:02,825
Cover? Cover for what?

295
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,661
I can't break him.
Take him to the melting chamber.

296
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,746
What? Aah!

297
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,127
You're gonna melt me'? Am I gonna die?

298
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:14,712
You'll live. You'll be fine.

299
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,424
President Business.
I have him right here, sir.

300
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:22,636
Yes, we've told him he'll live
so he doesn't try to escape, but, um...

301
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,138
we're lying to him.

302
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:25,890
Wait, what did he just say?

303
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,140
Hold still.

304
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:30,227
Wait! There's obviously been a mix-up here.
You've got the wrong...

305
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:32,271
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

306
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,107
That is gonna start hurting...

307
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,400
pretty soon.

308
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,342
Ow, ow, ow!

309
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:05,845
No, no, no!

310
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,850
Whoa. Who are you?

311
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:15,606
It's you?

312
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,608
Come with me if you wanna not die.

313
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:23,239
Hi, everybody! How's the melting goi...?

314
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:24,489
Hey, hey, he)”

315
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:26,324
Red alert, red alert.

316
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:29,954
Everyone, to go after The Special.

317
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:33,332
The tunnel's that way.

318
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,418
Oh, boy!

319
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:38,254
Oh, sir, you're brilliant.

320
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:42,258
- We'll build a motorcycle out of the alleyway.
- Ow. Oh.

321
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,436
So, uh, didn't catch your name...

322
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:58,023
or anything about
what you're, uh, up to.

323
00:14:58,274 --> 00:14:59,692
Or what we're doing here.

324
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,502
It's brilliant, sir, that you pretended
to be a useless nobody...

325
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,072
but you can drop the act with me.
It's cool.

326
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,782
Oh, the act.

327
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:08,409
Whoa.

328
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:11,536
Whoa!

329
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,455
Jump on. Let's go!

330
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,379
Hey, uh, I...
Hang on, sir.

331
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:21,629
All units...

332
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,424
cut him off on Elm, now!

333
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:24,800
Or whenever you can.

334
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,385
10-4, Bad Cop.

335
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:27,928
- Watch out!
- Hold on.

336
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:32,391
We need to meet up with Vitruvius...

337
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,310
- ...and tell him the Piece has been found.
Uh-huh.

338
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,728
They're up on the monorail.

339
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,438
Release the copper choppers.

340
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,488
Oh, no!

341
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,410
Will you please tell me what is happening?

342
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,121
I'm rescuing you, sir.
You're the one the prophecy spoke of.

343
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,371
You're The Special.

344
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,789
Me?

345
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,502
You found the Piece of Resistance.

346
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:02,046
And the prophecy states...

347
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,465
that you are the most important,
most talented...

348
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:05,841
most interesting...

349
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:10,095
and most extraordinary person
in the universe.

350
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,139
That's you. Right?

351
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,518
Uh, yes. That's me.

352
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:17,769
Great. You drive.

353
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:18,978
What?

354
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:28,864
I wanna go home!

355
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,700
This is not what I meant!

356
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:41,728
Oh, no.

357
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:42,752
Look out, Special!

358
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:45,381
Uh, sorry. Never driven a motorcycle.
Sorry!

359
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:50,761
- Wow, he's amazing.
- Aah!

360
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,351
That was incredible!

361
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,853
You're even better
than the prophecy said you'd be.

362
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:01,271
Oh. Really?

363
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,148
I'm, uh... I'm Wyldstyle.

364
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,150
- Oh, I'm sorry, what was it?
- Wyldstyle.

365
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:06,485
- "Wyldstyle"?
- Yep.

366
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:07,778
- What are you, a DJ?
- No.

367
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,072
- Oh, that's your name? "Wyldstyle"?
- Yeah.

368
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:11,865
Like on your birth certificate,
it says "Wyldstyle."

369
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:12,783
Let's not talk about my name!

370
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,410
Don't let The Special get away.

371
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,900
Sir, we've blocked the freeway.

372
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,121
Hang on, sir!

373
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:18,997
What are you doing?

374
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,083
Let's fly!

375
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,836
Whoa!

376
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,629
Head for the secret tunnel.

377
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,172
Uh, these are the city limits.

378
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:28,663
Let's just head for the tunnel.

379
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:31,301
You want me to drive
into that weird swirly hole?

380
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:32,136
Are you insane?

381
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,096
Don't brake! Go! Don't stop! Go! Now!

382
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,346
I can't do this!

383
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:37,850
That is against the instructions!

384
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,728
Wait, what's your favorite restaurant?

385
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:41,978
Any chain restaurant.

386
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,521
Favorite TV show?

387
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:43,272
Where Are My Pants?

388
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:44,022
Favorite song?

389
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:45,315
Everything ls Awesome

390
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,567
Oh, no!

391
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,953
Darn, darn, darn, darny-darn!

392
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,328
Wait. Where are we?

393
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,415
This is so weir...! Ow!

394
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,709
You're not The Special! You lied to me!

395
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,586
It really kind of depends on...

396
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,476
You're not even a MasterBuilder, are you?

397
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,799
Uh, I mean, I know what a MasterBuilder is.

398
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:55,010
Why don't you tell me what it is?
That way I could see if you're right.

399
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,513
You've ruined the prophecy.

400
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,016
Look, I'm sorry, okay? You just...

401
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,477
You made being special sound so good.

402
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,480
And to think I was going to follow you
to the end of the universe.

403
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,524
You were?

404
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,191
Here's the thing.

405
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:12,736
How do we know for sure
that I'm not The Special?

406
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,446
- We just don't know it yet.
- Quiet.

407
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,281
Y'all want a giant turkey leg?

408
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,492
Do you have any idea
what that does to your colon?

409
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,872
- Oh, my G-O-S-H.
- Just put the hat on.

410
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:24,748
Oh...

411
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,667
and this. And this. And this.

412
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,460
- And this.
- Aah!

413
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,337
And, by the way, I have a boyfriend.

414
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,673
Uh, I'm not sure exactly
why you'd bring that up.

415
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:33,923
It's super serious.

416
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,509
You do not want to mess with him.

417
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,260
Okay)'-

418
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,678
So don't get any ideas.

419
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,596
I never have any ideas.

420
00:19:40,491 --> 00:19:41,491
Wait!

421
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,559
- Stick them up.
- Hands where I can see them.

422
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,770
Hey, uh, listen. You think you can
explain why I'm dressed like this...

423
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,480
and what those big words
in the sky were all about?

424
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,191
And, like, where we are in time.

425
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:56,488
Your home, Bricksburg,
is one of many realms in the universe.

426
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,738
There's also this one...

427
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,426
Pirate's Cove, Knight's Club,
Viking's Landing, Clown Town...

428
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:01,702
a bunch of others
we don't need to mention.

429
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:02,536
Mm-hm.

430
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,587
Lord Business,
or as you think you know him...

431
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:05,873
President Business...

432
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:08,959
stole the Kragle,
the most powerful object in the universe.

433
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:10,878
Blah, blah, blah.

434
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:13,922
Proper name. Place name. Backstory stuff.

435
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,383
- ...Piece of Resistance is The Special.
Mm-hm.

436
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,011
I'm so pretty. I like you.

437
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,555
But I'm angry with you for some reason.

438
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,056
- ...tower at the end of the universe...
Mm-hm.

439
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,227
Put the Piece of Resistance
onto the Kragle...

440
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,894
and disarm it forever.

441
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,144
Great.

442
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,396
I think I got it...

443
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:30,689
but just in case...

444
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,019
tell me the whole thing again.
I wasn't listening.

445
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,071
Okay. All the people
of the universe were once free to travel...

446
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:41,283
and mingle and build
whatever they wanted.

447
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,660
But President Business
was confused by all the chaos.

448
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,496
So he erected walls between the worlds...

449
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,416
and became obsessed
with order and perfection.

450
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,043
And he stole the mysterious...

451
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,128
secret super weapon called...
The Kragle!

452
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,546
And he hired Bad Cop...

453
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,796
to hunt down all the MasterBuilders,
who were always changing everything.

454
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,676
And those of us who remained...

455
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:03,555
<i>well, we went into hiding.
Built the tunnels to survive.</i>

456
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,485
And we search for the Piece of Resistance.

457
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:08,310
The only thing that can stop the Kragle.

458
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,728
Kragle. I know that.

459
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,022
It might have been that cop.
He said something about the Kragle.

460
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,441
President Business
was going to use the Kragle...

461
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,052
to end the world in three days.

462
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,353
I can't make any sense of it.

463
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:18,570
Taco Tuesday.

464
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,989
I knew that was suspicious.
There's no time to lose.

465
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:24,201
We must find Vitruvius and get to
the Office Tower before it's too late.

466
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,452
Okay)'-

467
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,829
Heh. How scary can someone's office be?

468
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,370
President Business,
we're trying to locate the fugitive...

469
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:42,886
but his face is so generic it matches
every other face in our database.

470
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,680
Diabolical.

471
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,891
Okay, have Bad Cop meet me in my office...

472
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,742
- ...in 23 seconds. Ciao.
- Will do, sir.

473
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,728
Coffee sales are through the roof, sir.

474
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,299
Glad to hear it.
Let's rebuild that roof to be even higher!

475
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:55,649
The roof team is on it.

476
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,110
Sir, can you approve this poster
for Taco Tuesday?

477
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,403
Perfect. Whoo!

478
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,653
- I love everyone in this room.
- We love you, sir!

479
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,074
- Great job on the radio station.
- Thank you, sir.

480
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,368
We love listening to this song
over and over again.

481
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:07,618
Keep it up, GUYS-

482
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,663
Honey, where are my...

483
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:10,913
- ...pants?
Ha-ha-ha!

484
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:12,124
Cut! Ha, ha!

485
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,001
Hilarious. That never gets old.

486
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:15,251
It does not.

487
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,754
Bad Cop is waiting for you
in your office.

488
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,256
Wonderful. Fantastic.

489
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,299
Would you cancel my 2:00?

490
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,677
This next meeting could run a little bit...

491
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:24,928
deadly.

492
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:33,895
Activate helmet.

493
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,481
Light sequence.

494
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:37,732
Flame test.

495
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:40,485
- Engage dramatic entrance.
- Aah!

496
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:41,945
Bad Cop.

497
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,197
Lord Business.
I know The Special got away, but...

498
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,199
Don't be so serious.

499
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,576
Where's the other guy?

500
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:49,661
- Hey, friend.
- Hey, buddy!

501
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,663
- I missed you.
- Aw, did you really?

502
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:53,593
Have I ever shown you my relic collection?

503
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:54,833
Nope. I don't think you have.

504
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,723
Nobody knows where this stuff comes from.

505
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:57,918
This one...

506
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,504
is the Cloak of Ban Da'ld.

507
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,275
I hear it's super painful to take off.

508
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:02,883
- You wanna try it on?
- Well, um...

509
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,593
No, but thank you.

510
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:07,345
We've done some great work
over the years together, Bad Cop...

511
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,473
capturing all those MasterBuilders...

512
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,349
and torturing them and whatnot.

513
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,309
Thank you, sir.

514
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,602
Although...

515
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,413
you did let the Piece of Resistance go.

516
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:17,064
The one thing that can ruin my plans.

517
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:19,566
The one thing that I asked
you to take care of.

518
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,860
That's super frustrating.

519
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,821
It makes me just wanna pick up whoever...

520
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,865
is standing closest to me...

521
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,825
and throw them through this window...

522
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:32,746
and out into the infinite abyss
of nothingness!

523
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,667
I wanna do it so bad.

524
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,961
I know you do, sir. Please don't.

525
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:43,507
And it's not just you, Bad Cop,
that keeps messing up my plans.

526
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:47,385
People everywhere
are always messing with my stuff.

527
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,472
But I have a way to fix that.

528
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:54,142
A way to keep things exactly
the way they are supposed to be.

529
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:56,478
Permanently.

530
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,313
Behold...

531
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:00,482
the most powerful weapon...

532
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:02,234
of all the relics:

533
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,695
The Kragle!

534
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,161
As you can see, they're loading the
Kragle in a big machine upstairs.

535
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:14,411
I call it...

536
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,957
the Tentacle Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer.

537
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:18,500
Or TAKOS.

538
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,960
The "S" is silent.

539
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,546
So on Taco Tuesday...

540
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:24,965
it's going to spray the Kragle
over everyone and everything...

541
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:28,593
with a bunch of super-scary nozzles
like this one!

542
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:31,805
- I'll show you how it works.
- Sir, I don't know if this is necessary.

543
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:34,266
Oh, don't worry. I won't test it on you.

544
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,017
I'll do it on your parents!

545
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:38,394
What?

546
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:39,896
- Hi, son.
- Hi!

547
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:41,648
How's it going in the big city?

548
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,025
Mommy. Daddy.
What are you doing here?

549
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:46,695
Okay, Pa. I just want you to act naturally.

550
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,989
- Like you're going about your day.
- Gotcha.

551
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,699
Yeah. Keep your hand up like that.

552
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:51,949
Ma, scoot...

553
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,702
two steps in to the right.

554
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,871
- Pa, whenever I talk to Ma...
- Uh-huh?

555
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:57,247
- ...you start to move.
- Sorry, sir.

556
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:58,665
Get back to where you were!

557
00:24:58,915 --> 00:24:59,624
- Here?
- Perfect.

558
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,252
That's great. You can't do anything better.
No reason why you should move.

559
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:03,003
Right.

560
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:03,753
Now, Ma...

561
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,505
hand on his shoulder. And you...

562
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:08,091
- Pa, you just moved and you've just wrecked it!
- Uh-huh.

563
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,009
You wrecked it!

564
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:11,428
Bad Cop, you see what I'm talking about?

565
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:15,432
All I'm asking for is total perfection.

566
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,100
Send in a Micro-manager!

567
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:21,396
Commencing micro-management.

568
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:25,691
Hold still, you guys.

569
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:29,778
And then...

570
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:31,072
I just spray them...

571
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:32,532
With the TAKOS.

572
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,452
Oh, Pa, hold me.

573
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:38,788
Oh, darling, I can't move me legs.

574
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,041
- Does that upset you, Bad Cop?
- Um...

575
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:44,544
Surely you feel bad for your parents,
and you wanna help them, don't you?

576
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:48,590
We're okay, son. Just a
little stuck, is all.

577
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,425
Go ahead...

578
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,678
finish the job.

579
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:55,222
Of course, sir.

580
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:56,556
No, I don't want to.

581
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:58,308
- You have to.
- I don't want to.

582
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:00,078
- Would you please be quiet?
- I can't.

583
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,631
- You must. Shut it!
- But they...

584
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,647
- it's not nice.
- It's your job, man.

585
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,023
I can't do it.

586
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,858
- They're innocent.
- Just as I thought.

587
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,861
Your Good Cop side's
making you soft, Bad Cop.

588
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:10,779
Robots!

589
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,406
Bring me the ﬂeece-crested
Scepter of Q-Teep...

590
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:15,575
and the Pé-Lish Remover of Na-ll.

591
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:18,078
You've already let The Special
get away once.

592
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:18,912
Sir.

593
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,206
I'm just gonna make sure
it doesn't happen again.

594
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:23,625
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

595
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:29,922
Oh, son!

596
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:33,843
On Taco Tuesday, I'm going to
Kragleize the entire universe...

597
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:37,138
so that everyone
will stop messing with my stuff!

598
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,015
Are you gonna be with me...

599
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,725
or are you gonna be stuck...

600
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:43,895
having a tea party
with your mom and dad?

601
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,145
Son?

602
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:47,356
Sorry, Dad.

603
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,318
I have a job to do.

604
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:10,488
All you have to do is blend in
and act like you belong here.

605
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:11,548
Ah, perfect.

606
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:14,175
Well, hi there, I'm a cowboy!

607
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,706
Bang, bang, bang-bang-bang-bang!

608
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,637
Shoot, shoot, shoot. Bullet, bullet, gun.

609
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,931
Zap, zap, zap, pow. Zap, pow.

610
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,267
- What are they looking at?
- I made a mistake.

611
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:23,935
You should just be still. Act like a stool.

612
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:25,353
- Wait!
- Howdy, guys!

613
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:27,603
- Quiet. Nope, stools don't talk.
- Come sit on me.

614
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,024
Okay, shh.

615
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:30,775
Let me show you how it's done.

616
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:37,114
What a lady!

617
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,161
Okay, let me just find the wizard...

618
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,204
and get this over with.

619
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,670
- Ooh!
- There he is.

620
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,714
- Vitruvius.
- Who?

621
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:55,467
I've never heard of that man,
whom I am not.

622
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,344
- Who are you?
- It's me.

623
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,180
I am a blind man and cannot see.

624
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,431
- It's Wyldstyle.
- Oof.

625
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:02,681
Are you a DJ?

626
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,771
- What? Why does everybody...?
- Oh, wait, wait.

627
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,414
Are you the student I used to have...

628
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:08,402
who was so insecure
she kept changing her name?

629
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,105
No, no, no.

630
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,732
- First Darkstorm, then Geminizzle.
- No. Never.

631
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:12,942
Then Neversmile, then Freakface,
then Snazzypants.

632
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:14,151
Okay. All right, yes.

633
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,196
Meet me upstairs in 10 seconds.

634
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:26,790
Oh, man.

635
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,084
You have a very weirdly...

636
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:30,960
- ...decorated place.
- Thank you.

637
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,381
Vitruvius, we have found
the Piece of Resistance.

638
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,216
- Is it true?
- Yes, but...

639
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,593
Wyldstyle. The prophecy states that...

640
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,512
you are The Special.

641
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:43,139
The embodiment of good, foiler of evil.

642
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,308
The most talented, most brilliant...

643
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,395
most important person in the universe.

644
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,897
That would be great...

645
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:53,326
but Emmet is the one
who found the Piece.

646
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:55,402
Oh, okay. Emmet!

647
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:56,861
The prophecy states that...

648
00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:58,738
you are The Special.

649
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:01,449
- The most talented...
- I'm not sure he's The Special.

650
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:03,201
Because he's not even
a MasterBuilder. Watch.

651
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,971
Emmet, just given what's around you...

652
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:06,121
- ...build something simple.
- Okay.

653
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:07,288
- Like an awesome race car.
- Great.

654
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:09,040
- Go.
- Do you have the instructions?

655
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,710
No. You must create the instructions
in your mind, my liege.

656
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:15,296
Ah. Okay. Race car.

657
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:16,547
Um...

658
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:19,300
Well, there's a lot of
really cool stuff here.

659
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,429
Don't see a wheel...

660
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,347
OI'...

661
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:29,978
three more wheels.

662
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:32,939
See? He can't do it.
He will never be a MasterBuilder.

663
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:35,483
Of course not.
Not if you keep telling him he can't.

664
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,235
He needs to see that he can.

665
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:38,485
What are you doing?

666
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:40,447
- We are entering your mind...
- What?

667
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,740
To prove that you have
the unlocked potential...

668
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:44,409
to be a MasterBuilder.

669
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:45,869
Ujjayi breath.

670
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,918
Whoa, are we inside my brain right now?

671
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,838
- It's big. I must be smart.
Mm-hm.

672
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:59,757
I'm not hearing a lot of activity here.

673
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,510
I don't think he's ever had an
original thought. In his life.

674
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Ha, ha. That's not true.

675
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,805
For instance, one time I wanted to have...

676
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:08,016
a bunch of my friends over to watch TV...

677
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:11,686
Not unlike this TV
that just showed up magically.

678
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,771
And not everybody
can fit on my one couch...

679
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,103
and I thought to myself:

680
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,195
"What if there was such a thing
as a bunk bed...

681
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:18,443
but as a couch?"

682
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,987
Introducing the double-decker couch.

683
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:24,073
So everyone could watch TV together
and be buddies!

684
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:26,989
That is literally the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

685
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:29,537
Please, Wyldstyle, let me handle this.

686
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,624
That idea is just the worst.

687
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:34,584
There must be something around here...

688
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,002
that proves his potential.

689
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,671
If The Man Upstairs
chose him to be The Special...

690
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:40,048
there must be a reason.

691
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:41,549
- Who's The Man Upstairs?
- See?

692
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,519
He doesn't even know about
The Man Upstairs.

693
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,152
Does he have, like, super-gross hands...

694
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:47,379
that look like they're made
out of big pink sausages?

695
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,390
Like eagle talons mixed with squid?

696
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:52,185
Wait. You've seen the...?

697
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:53,871
Whoa!

698
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,730
That's what I was just thinking about.

699
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,648
How did you...?

700
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,024
I had this weird dream
when I touched the Piece.

701
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:00,276
Well, I mean, I wasn't asleep,
so it wasn't really a dream.

702
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:02,570
Emmet, you had a vision.

703
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,820
I did?

704
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:05,323
MasterBuilders spend years...

705
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,533
training themselves
to clear their minds enough...

706
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:10,870
to have even a fleeting glimpse
of The Man Upstairs...

707
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,791
and yet, your mind is already
so prodigiously empty...

708
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,044
that there is nothing in it
to clear away in the first place.

709
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,379
With proper training...

710
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:22,048
you could become a great MasterBuilder.

711
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,298
I could?

712
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,718
The prophecy chose you, Emmet.

713
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,929
But I can't do any of the stuff...

714
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:29,939
that the prophecy
says I'm supposed to do.

715
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:33,768
All you have to do is to believe.

716
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,060
Then...

717
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,605
you will see everything.

718
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:39,857
Are you ready, my son?

719
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:44,654
Yes, I am.

720
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:46,739
I think.

721
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,783
Then we haven't a moment to lose.

722
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,493
We must assemble...

723
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,495
the MasterBuilders.

724
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,164
Do you think Zeppelins
are a bad investment?

725
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,846
Any of you fellas seen this guy?

726
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,808
Wait a minute, partner.

727
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:15,727
Draw a cowboy hat on him.

728
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:24,360
These mechanical birds
will get our message out.

729
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:26,112
They will go to an Internet cafe...

730
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:28,002
and e-mail the remaining
MasterBuilders...

731
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:31,159
who will meet us in the secret realm
of Cloud Cuckooland.

732
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:33,995
Cuckooland? Wait.
What happened to that whole training part?

733
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:35,830
Don't worry, Emmet.

734
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,749
Your training begins now.

735
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,250
Piano man...

736
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:41,293
mope" UP-

737
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:42,754
Your training begins later!

738
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:46,006
On three.

739
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:47,215
One...

740
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:56,392
- Whew. I think we're in the clear.
- Freeze, turkeys.

741
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,354
All I want is the Piece of Resistance.

742
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:01,689
We would rather he died
than give it to you.

743
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:04,233
I would not rather he died.

744
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:07,403
Look, everybody, we can do this
the easy way, or we can do it...

745
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:08,321
Go, run!

746
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:09,947
They took the hard way. Fire!

747
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:11,199
Fire!

748
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,160
Vitruvius, which way to Cloud Cuckooland?

749
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,204
Head for the big bright thing in the sky.

750
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:18,289
- You mean the sun?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

751
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:19,707
Let's get out of here. Here, use this.

752
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:20,957
What? Wait, hey...

753
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,835
- What are you doing? Aah!
- Let's go!

754
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,047
I don't know what I'm doing.

755
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:30,384
Good bye.

756
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:31,678
Boom!

757
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:39,268
Oh, dang!

758
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:45,358
Aah! I've got pigs! I hate pigs!

759
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:47,276
Quit playing around in the mud.
I could use your help.

760
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:49,404
Wyldstyle, we could really use...

761
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:50,238
your help!

762
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:51,488
Oink, oink, oink.

763
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:09,590
Oink!

764
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:12,677
Vitruvius, they're gaining on us.
Build something!

765
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
Let Emmet try!

766
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,514
No, let's not let Emmet try!
I haven't had any training.

767
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:17,348
That's okay.

768
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,600
We'll start with
how to become a MasterBuilder.

769
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:22,395
Trust your instincts.

770
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:23,645
Okay, okay. Um...

771
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:25,106
Build something! Build something!

772
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,524
Aha. Take that!

773
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:33,573
Unless your instincts are terrible.

774
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:40,871
No! The wheel!

775
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:48,296
I can't control it much longer!

776
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:51,632
Emmet, we need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

777
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:52,467
Um...

778
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:54,719
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

779
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:56,763
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

780
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:59,515
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

781
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:02,602
Something that spins around.
Spins around. Spins around.

782
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,312
Oh.

783
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:07,648
Emmet, where are you going?

784
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:11,359
Oh, this better work.

785
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:12,820
Hang tight!

786
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,532
Dagnabit!

787
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:19,702
Well done, Emmet.

788
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:21,662
Hey! I did it.

789
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:23,998
Wow. You actually did it.

790
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:27,501
Train!

791
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:36,052
Oh, no.

792
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:37,845
Get off my train.

793
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,095
Run!

794
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:45,435
Wyldstyle!

795
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:49,690
Owie!

796
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:51,067
He's gonna ram us.

797
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:53,361
Quick, quick, quick! That piece!
Give me that piece.

798
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:54,862
Huh?

799
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:56,614
Build a ramp!

800
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,913
What the heck?

801
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,748
Rest in pieces.

802
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:08,834
- Uh...
- Oh, no.

803
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:09,918
Wait. No, no, no.

804
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:19,262
Hey)'-

805
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:21,556
Thanks for saving my life back there.

806
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:23,182
Even if, you know...

807
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:26,561
eventually it turned
out to be pointless.

808
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,522
Well, for what it's worth...

809
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:32,859
this has been about the greatest
15 minutes of my life.

810
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:40,782
What the...?

811
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:45,246
Relax, everybody, I'm here.

812
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:46,122
Batman!

813
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:47,498
- What's up, babe?
- Babe!

814
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,542
- What?
- Oh, sorry. Batman, this is Emmet.

815
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,878
Emmet, this is my boyfriend, Batman.

816
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:53,588
I'm Batman.

817
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:56,549
That's your boyfriend? Aah!

818
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:00,219
Batman, huh? Where'd you guys meet?

819
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:02,847
It's actually a funny story, right, Bat?

820
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:04,097
There he is.

821
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:06,392
- "Police" to meet you, Bad Cop.
- Batman!

822
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:07,310
The pleasure...

823
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
is all "spine."

824
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:09,645
Guess what...

825
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:10,896
you big dumb baby.

826
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,316
Your car is a baby carriage.

827
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:16,235
Oh, no, your boyfriend's gone.

828
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:17,528
- Hey, babe.
- What?

829
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:18,779
Let's hold hands.

830
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:23,075
So, uh...

831
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:25,578
Hey, guys, I think we're about
to crash into the sun.

832
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:27,914
Yeah, but it's gonna look really cool.

833
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:36,631
Uh, is this Cloud Cuckooland?
I don't see any clouds.

834
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:38,591
- Or cuckoos.
- No, no, this is...

835
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:39,841
Middle Zealand.

836
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:41,177
A wondrous land...

837
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:42,947
<i>full of knights, castles, mutton...</i>

838
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,348
torture weapons, poverty,
leeches, illiteracy...

839
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:46,974
and, um...

840
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,267
Dragon!

841
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:51,103
Yeah, that too.

842
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:56,359
Once we arrive at Cloud Cuckooland,
we'll raise an army...

843
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:57,276
of MasterBuilders to...

844
00:37:57,526 --> 00:38:00,655
Anyway, you guys gotta check out
these new subwoofers I installed.

845
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:02,907
I call them the dogs. Listen to them bark!

846
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:05,826
Can you turn that down a little bit?

847
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:08,663
This is a song I wrote for Wyldstyle.

848
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:10,289
Darkness

849
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:11,958
It's about how I'm an orphan.

850
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,709
No parents

851
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,461
This is real music, Emmet.

852
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:18,339
Batman's a true artist. Dark, brooding.

853
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:20,549
Well, I'm dark and brooding too.

854
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,677
Guys, look, a rainbow.

855
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:24,647
So you're gonna drive up the curved part...

856
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,429
Super rich

857
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,120
take it all the way to the top...

858
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:28,599
Kind of makes it better

859
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,101
and park the car.

860
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:34,146
Friends, welcome
to Cloud Cuckooland. Now...

861
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:39,819
I just need to give the secret knock.

862
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:52,873
Okay)'-

863
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:01,048
I'm just gonna come right out.

864
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:04,093
I have no idea what's going on,
or what this place is at all.

865
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:07,555
Hi! I am Princess Unikitty...

866
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:11,058
and I welcome you all
to Cloud Cuckooland.

867
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:15,604
There's no signs or anything.

868
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:17,773
How does anyone know what not to do?

869
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:19,233
Here in Cloud Cuckooland...

870
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,568
there are no rules.

871
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:22,194
There's no government...

872
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:23,779
no babysitters...

873
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,197
no bedtimes...

874
00:39:25,448 --> 00:39:26,991
no frowny faces...

875
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:29,076
no bushy mustaches...

876
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,537
and no negativity of any kind.

877
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,747
You just said the word "no"
like a thousand times.

878
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:36,167
And there's also no consistency.

879
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:38,210
I hate this place.

880
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:40,337
Any idea is a good idea...

881
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:42,214
except the not happy ones.

882
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:44,341
Those you push down deep inside...

883
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:46,802
where you'll never, ever, ever...

884
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:47,636
ever...

885
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:49,597
find them.

886
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:52,224
Your fellow MasterBuilders
are gathered in the Dog.

887
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:53,601
The what?

888
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:57,897
Ah! Is that Superman?

889
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:00,125
Girl, what are you doing?

890
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,984
- Hey, Superman!
- Oh, hey. What's up?

891
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,070
- Lantern. Green Lantern.
- Yeah, yeah.

892
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,840
You wanna sit together at the meeting?

893
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:08,616
Um, I have to go back to Krypton.

894
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:09,909
Didn't Krypton blow up?

895
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:13,329
My fellow MasterBuilders,
including but not limited to...

896
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:14,779
Robin Hood, Mermaid Lady...

897
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,331
Gandalf...

898
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:16,082
Swamp Creature...

899
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:18,084
- ...1980-something Space Guy...
- Hello!

900
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:20,169
2002 NBA All-Stars...

901
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,004
- ...and Wonder Woman.
- Unh!

902
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:25,549
You have traveled far to be here
for a moment of great import.

903
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
We have learned...

904
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,886
that Lord Business plans to unleash...

905
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:30,721
a fully weaponized Kragle...

906
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,431
on Taco Tuesday...

907
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:35,059
to end the world as we know it.

908
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,436
Please, calm yourselves.

909
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:38,187
Green Ninja...

910
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:38,938
Milhouse...

911
00:40:39,188 --> 00:40:39,897
Nice Vampire...

912
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,427
Michelangelo, Michelangelo...

913
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:42,650
and Cleopatra.

914
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,610
There is yet one hope.

915
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,737
The Special has arisen.

916
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:50,241
Have the young man step forward.

917
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:51,492
As you wish, Dubbledore.

918
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:52,451
I'm Gandalf!

919
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,745
- It's pronounced "Dumbledore."
- Dubbadore?

920
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:56,247
No, "Dumbledore."

921
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:57,206
Thought you said "Dubbadore."

922
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:58,040
Vitruvius!

923
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,650
You gotta write that down.
I'm not gonna remember any of it.

924
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:01,961
But here we go.

925
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:07,174
The Special will now give
an eloquent speech.

926
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,055
Go ahead, man. You got this.

927
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:15,850
Okay)'-

928
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:24,525
Hello. I'm Emmet.

929
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:26,902
Oh, and this is the Piece of Resistance.

930
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:37,580
Thank you.

931
00:41:38,122 --> 00:41:40,916
Well, uh, I know that I, for one...

932
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:43,419
am very excited to work with you guys...

933
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:45,629
to get into the Octan Tower,
find the Kragle...

934
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:47,840
and put this thing on the thing.

935
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,593
And I know it's going to
be really hard, but...

936
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:52,094
"Really hard"?

937
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:56,807
Wiping ye burn with a hook
for a hand is really hard.

938
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,726
This be impossible.

939
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:01,812
The last time we tried to storm
Lord Business' office...

940
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:04,231
we used every plan we could conceive.

941
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:07,735
The result was a massacre
too terrible to speak of.

942
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,319
Who are you?

943
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:11,447
The name be Metal Beard.

944
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:14,200
And I'll tell you me tale of woe.

945
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,076
Oh, great, here we go again.

946
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:16,952
I arrived...

947
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:18,403
<i>at the foot of the Tower...</i>

948
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:21,290
with me hearty MasterBuilder crew...

949
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,544
<i>only to find the Kragle was all
the way up on the infinityeth floor...</i>

950
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:28,130
guarded by a robot army...

951
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,461
and security measures...

952
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,799
of every kind...

953
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,176
imaginable:

954
00:42:32,426 --> 00:42:33,469
Lasers...

955
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,554
sharks...

956
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,765
laser sharks...

957
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:39,516
overbearing assistants...

958
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:42,853
and strange, dangerous relics...

959
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:44,103
that entrap...

960
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:44,730
<i>II-Snap...</i>

961
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,980
and zap.

962
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:50,110
And there be a mysterious room
called the Think Tank.

963
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:52,571
I barely made it out of that...

964
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:53,447
<i>I"OOfT7...</i>

965
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:54,697
with just me head!

966
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:58,744
And organs.

967
00:42:58,994 --> 00:42:59,662
Okay)'-

968
00:42:59,912 --> 00:43:02,665
I had to replace every part
of my once-strapping...

969
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:04,333
virile pirate body...

970
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:08,128
with this useless hunk of garbage
ye see before ye.

971
00:43:08,379 --> 00:43:12,007
So if ye think it'd be a
good idea to return...

972
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:13,379
to that forsaken place...

973
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,635
Special...

974
00:43:14,885 --> 00:43:16,929
what idea have ye that be better...

975
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:18,722
than the ideas of 100...

976
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:21,433
of our fallen MasterBuilder brothers?

977
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:23,310
Well, uh...

978
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,438
Well, technically I'm not exactly
a MasterBuilder yet.

979
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:27,689
What?

980
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:31,610
Please! Everyone! Please!

981
00:43:32,278 --> 00:43:33,279
Rubbish!

982
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:35,155
Yes, it's true.

983
00:43:35,406 --> 00:43:38,075
I may not be a MasterBuilder.

984
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:40,244
I may not have a lot of experience...

985
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:43,622
fighting or leading
or coming up with plans.

986
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:46,166
Or having ideas in general.

987
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:49,962
In fact, I'm not all that smart.

988
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:53,841
And I'm not what you'd call
a "creative type."

989
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:55,551
Plus...

990
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:57,886
generally unskilled.

991
00:43:58,887 --> 00:43:59,930
Also...

992
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,850
scared and cowardly.

993
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:05,394
I know what you're thinking:

994
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:08,022
"He is the least qualified person...

995
00:44:08,272 --> 00:44:10,482
in the world to lead us."

996
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:12,901
And you are right.

997
00:44:13,152 --> 00:44:16,113
This is supposed to make us feel better?

998
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:18,532
No, there was about to be a "but."

999
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:20,617
- You're a butt!
- Yes.

1000
00:44:20,868 --> 00:44:23,078
You all be on your own!

1001
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:25,831
I be leaving this lost cause!

1002
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,084
Why are you leaving?

1003
00:44:29,335 --> 00:44:32,254
A house divided against itself
would be better...

1004
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:33,589
than this.

1005
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,132
Abraham Lincoln!

1006
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:37,301
You bring your space chair right back here!

1007
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:39,178
Come on, guys!

1008
00:44:39,428 --> 00:44:42,139
We can still do this. Right?

1009
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:44,016
You're not even a bit special.

1010
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:46,810
Well, you were right about him
being a ding-dong.

1011
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:48,645
You're a huge disappointment.

1012
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:52,107
Get him out of here.
I don't wanna look at him.

1013
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:57,905
Well, at least it can't get any worse.

1014
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:01,283
I was wrong.

1015
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,288
It's the Orb of Tee-ti-list!

1016
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:09,291
Ruh-roh. It's the bad guys.

1017
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,335
Whoa. How did he...?

1018
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:14,296
Go! Run! Come on, everyone!
Protect The Special.

1019
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:15,923
What's that on his ankle?

1020
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:18,717
It's a tracking device.

1021
00:45:20,052 --> 00:45:20,928
Take the MasterBuilders prisoner.

1022
00:45:21,178 --> 00:45:22,679
Oh, he led them right to us.

1023
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,099
Guys, no, no, no. It's not my fault.

1024
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:28,435
You are the worst leader I've ever seen.
To the Batmobile!

1025
00:45:30,164 --> 00:45:31,164
Dang it.

1026
00:45:31,188 --> 00:45:32,189
To the invisible jet!

1027
00:45:34,108 --> 00:45:35,984
- Dang it!
- Every man for himself.

1028
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:38,028
No, we must protect the Piece.

1029
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:39,655
Shaq, do you know what time...

1030
00:45:39,905 --> 00:45:41,782
- ...it is?
- It's game time.

1031
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:46,662
Y'all ready for this?

1032
00:45:48,622 --> 00:45:50,374
Oh, no! They were ready for that.

1033
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:51,250
It didn't break!

1034
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,252
Because it's Kragled. Machine gum!

1035
00:45:54,795 --> 00:45:55,795
Fire!

1036
00:45:55,963 --> 00:45:56,963
No!

1037
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:58,632
Aah! I can't move!

1038
00:45:58,882 --> 00:45:59,591
Don't worry, Superman.

1039
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:01,443
- I'll get you out of there.
- No! Don't!

1040
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:05,514
Aah! Oh, my gosh. My hands are stuck.
My legs are stuck as well.

1041
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:06,765
I super hate you.

1042
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:10,352
- Ow! You're pulling my torso off.
- Babe...

1043
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:11,723
help me get him out of here.

1044
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:12,980
I said "every man for himself."

1045
00:46:13,272 --> 00:46:14,857
Hey, you gotta be there for me.

1046
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:19,902
Fine!

1047
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:21,530
Fine. Fine. Fine.

1048
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,657
- I need you to have a better attitude.
- I have a great...

1049
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:25,534
- ...attitude.
- Ouch.

1050
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:27,411
The Special's in the northwest quadrant.

1051
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:28,912
We've got him cornered.

1052
00:46:29,932 --> 00:46:30,932
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

1053
00:46:30,956 --> 00:46:31,956
Where'd he go?

1054
00:46:36,712 --> 00:46:37,712
Oh, no!

1055
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:39,506
They've hit our silly cloud stabilizers!

1056
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:41,592
Let's go!
We need to get Emmet out of here.

1057
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:44,845
- Can't we build something?
- Hey! I'm Ben. But you can call me Benny.

1058
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:46,335
I can build a spaceship. Watch.

1059
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:48,724
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship
Spaceship, spaceship

1060
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:50,851
No! You can't. The skies are surrounded.

1061
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:53,145
That's okay. I didn't really wanna build...

1062
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:54,795
a spaceship anyway. That's cool.

1063
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:56,458
Where can we go
where we can't be found?

1064
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,150
Maybe we could go underwater?

1065
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,027
What if we went underwater?

1066
00:47:00,277 --> 00:47:00,986
Great idea, babe!

1067
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,916
Thank you, Batman.
Your ideas are the best.

1068
00:47:03,155 --> 00:47:03,864
But I just said that.

1069
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:07,075
- We could build a submarine.
- A Bat-Submarine, patent pending.

1070
00:47:07,326 --> 00:47:08,326
With rainbows!

1071
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:10,204
And dream catchers, in case we take a nap.

1072
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:11,788
Like an underwater spaceship!

1073
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:13,640
But you can't build all of them at once.

1074
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:15,083
Ready? Break.

1075
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:15,959
Okay)'-

1076
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:19,296
Blue razzleberry and sour apple!

1077
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:21,381
If anybody has black parts,
I need them, okay?

1078
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:22,758
I only work in black.

1079
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:25,010
And sometimes, very, very dark gray.

1080
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,428
- Use the yellow bricks!
- Hey, guys, can I help?

1081
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:28,680
- No! It has to be this way!
- No, I need that!

1082
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:29,640
Where is he?

1083
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,059
Anyone know what this is,
and do you need it?

1084
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:34,150
I think we could use wings
and rocket boosters.

1085
00:47:34,228 --> 00:47:35,729
Ew. Get your retro space stuff
out of my area.

1086
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:38,941
You guys, hey, just tell me exactly
what to do. And how to do it.

1087
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:42,361
Emmet, don't worry about
what the others are doing.

1088
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:46,490
You must embrace
what is special about you!

1089
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,100
There he is!

1090
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:58,085
All units, attack the sub!

1091
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:03,882
Emmet, get in here!

1092
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:11,557
Stop him! Stop him! Don't let him...

1093
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:12,807
get to the water!

1094
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:14,256
Dive, dive, dive! Everybody in!

1095
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:15,309
We're going under!

1096
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:34,246
Oh, no.

1097
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:55,809
My home.

1098
00:48:57,728 --> 00:48:59,479
It's gone.

1099
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:05,569
I feel something inside.

1100
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:07,821
It's like the opposite of happiness.

1101
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:11,575
I must stay positive.

1102
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:15,494
Ah. Bubble gums.

1103
00:49:17,331 --> 00:49:18,331
Butterflies.

1104
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:24,963
Cotton candy.

1105
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,883
Gosh, I'm so sorry, Unikitty.

1106
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:32,137
Do you want to sit down
and talk about it?

1107
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:36,516
What the heck is that?

1108
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,518
It's a double-decker couch.

1109
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:40,489
Which seemed like a good idea
at the time...

1110
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,857
but I now realize
it's not super helpful.

1111
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:46,652
But, you know, it has cup holders.

1112
00:49:46,902 --> 00:49:49,446
Seats flip up with coolers underneath.

1113
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:53,575
You are so disappointing
on so many levels.

1114
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:56,578
- Why are my pants cold and wet?
- Ew.

1115
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:58,163
Uh...

1116
00:49:59,058 --> 00:50:00,058
Hull breach.

1117
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:01,166
The walls are crying!

1118
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:03,502
We're coming apart at the seams!

1119
00:50:04,795 --> 00:50:06,213
This is not how Batman dies.

1120
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:08,423
Emmet!

1121
00:50:08,674 --> 00:50:10,509
- Hold on, hold on!
- Wyldstyle!

1122
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:14,429
Deep breath! Deep breath, everybod...!

1123
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,325
Micro-managers,
what's going on down there?

1124
00:50:36,118 --> 00:50:38,161
Scanning submarine wreckage.

1125
00:50:39,246 --> 00:50:41,331
No survivors detected.

1126
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:44,584
Scuba cops,
dredge the entire ocean if you have to.

1127
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:46,753
We have got to find that Piece.

1128
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:48,964
Let's get these prisoners
back to Lord Business...

1129
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:50,465
and give him the good news.

1130
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:53,427
The Special is no more.

1131
00:50:57,806 --> 00:50:59,099
Hello, everybody!

1132
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:02,227
Superman. Wonder Woman,
I had no idea you'd be here.

1133
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:03,770
Mr. Shaquille O'Neal.

1134
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,856
Greetings, all!

1135
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:08,358
Welcome to my Think Tank.

1136
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:10,694
Help us!

1137
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:13,145
All the MasterBuilders
you've captured over the years...

1138
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:14,276
you've brought them here.

1139
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:16,825
You're a very perceptive person, Superman.

1140
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:20,370
They come up with all the instructions
for everything in the universe.

1141
00:51:20,746 --> 00:51:21,746
Robots!

1142
00:51:21,872 --> 00:51:24,166
No! No! Grr!

1143
00:51:28,462 --> 00:51:29,963
Can't get much worse than this.

1144
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:32,382
- Uh, hello, neighbor.
- Oh, no.

1145
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:33,632
It's Green Lantern.

1146
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,887
Oh, my gosh, we're roommates!
How crazy is that?

1147
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:39,765
Does anyone have some Kryptonite
that they could give me?

1148
00:51:40,474 --> 00:51:43,351
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where is The Special?

1149
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:46,521
The Special and the Piece of Resistance
are at the bottom of the ocean.

1150
00:51:46,772 --> 00:51:48,523
Wait, are you telling me
you don't have him?

1151
00:51:48,774 --> 00:51:52,402
Sir, my scuba team is looking
for his remains as we speak.

1152
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:56,615
Bad Cop, he could still be alive!
The Piece could still be out there.

1153
00:51:56,865 --> 00:52:00,327
The only remnant of The Special
was a double-decker couch.

1154
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:01,870
Wait, hold on.

1155
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,997
A double-decker couch?

1156
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:04,790
Yes, sir.

1157
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,960
Really? So it's like a bunk-bed couch?
Is that what it's like?

1158
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:10,420
That's weird.

1159
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,190
If you're sitting in the top middle...

1160
00:52:12,422 --> 00:52:14,782
how are you gonna get down
without climbing over someone?

1161
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,177
If you're sitting on the bottom
and you're watching TV...

1162
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:20,055
are you gonna have to watch
through a bunch of dangling legs?

1163
00:52:20,305 --> 00:52:22,057
Who's gonna want to sit on the bottom?

1164
00:52:22,307 --> 00:52:23,558
It is literally...

1165
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:27,813
the most useless idea
I have ever heard.

1166
00:52:30,816 --> 00:52:33,026
- Well, we're still alive.
- Yeah!

1167
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:35,445
Heh. The double-decker couch.

1168
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:37,405
It wasn't totally pointless after all.

1169
00:52:37,656 --> 00:52:39,491
It's the one thing that stayed together.

1170
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:41,493
I always believed in you, Emmet.

1171
00:52:41,743 --> 00:52:44,538
I don't mean to spoil the party,
but does anyone else notice...

1172
00:52:44,788 --> 00:52:46,998
we're stuck in the middle
of the ocean on this couch?

1173
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:49,125
I mean, it's not like a
big gigantic ship...

1174
00:52:49,376 --> 00:52:50,752
is gonna come out of nowhere
and save us...

1175
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:52,087
My gosh!

1176
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:58,260
Avast, mateys!

1177
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:08,228
Metal Beard, I thought you said
we were a lost cause!

1178
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:09,479
Ye are!

1179
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:11,606
Did ye not hear me whole story...

1180
00:53:11,857 --> 00:53:15,068
circumscribing the folly
of this whole enterprise?

1181
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:17,654
Well, it's kind of hard not to hear
when you're yelling everything.

1182
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:19,322
So why did you come back?

1183
00:53:19,573 --> 00:53:21,950
This be-doubled land couch.

1184
00:53:23,076 --> 00:53:26,872
I watched Lord Business' forces
completely overlook it.

1185
00:53:27,122 --> 00:53:29,249
Which means we need more ideas like it!

1186
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:30,166
Oh, thank you.

1187
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:32,335
Ideas so dumb and bad...

1188
00:53:32,586 --> 00:53:36,464
that no one would ever think
they could possibly be useful.

1189
00:53:36,715 --> 00:53:38,300
Oh. Thank you.

1190
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,094
So, Special, what do we do?

1191
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:46,182
Uh...

1192
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:48,435
Well...

1193
00:53:48,894 --> 00:53:52,814
what's the last thing Lord Business
expects MasterBuilders will do?

1194
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:53,690
Build a spaceship?

1195
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,441
Kill a chicken?

1196
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:55,691
Marry a marshmallow.

1197
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:56,359
Why, this:

1198
00:53:56,610 --> 00:54:00,113
How you gonna keep 'em down on the farm?

1199
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:03,241
No! It's follow the instructions.

1200
00:54:04,618 --> 00:54:05,939
- Don't like that.
- Sounds weird.

1201
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:07,996
Now, listen. Wait, listen.

1202
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:13,919
Guys, you're all so talented
and imaginative.

1203
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:17,505
But you can't work together as a team.

1204
00:54:18,632 --> 00:54:20,634
I'm just a construction worker.

1205
00:54:20,884 --> 00:54:23,845
But when I had a plan and we were
all working together...

1206
00:54:24,095 --> 00:54:26,640
I mean, we could build a skyscraper.

1207
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:31,478
Now, you're MasterBuilders.

1208
00:54:31,728 --> 00:54:35,732
Just imagine what could happen
if you did that.

1209
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:39,110
You could save the universe.

1210
00:54:39,611 --> 00:54:42,280
Well said, Emmet. Well said.

1211
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:43,739
Really?

1212
00:54:43,782 --> 00:54:46,076
She be a fine speech there, laddie.

1213
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:47,702
Okay)'-

1214
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:51,665
Somebody get me some markers...

1215
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,502
some construction paper...

1216
00:54:57,712 --> 00:55:00,340
and some glitter glue!

1217
00:55:03,218 --> 00:55:04,218
I call this:

1218
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:06,429
"Emmet's plan to get
inside the Tower...

1219
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,400
put the Piece of Resistance
on the Kragle...

1220
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:09,891
and save the world."

1221
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:12,310
I've built a hundred just like them
back in the city.

1222
00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:15,271
If we can just get in, I know where
the air ducts and wiring are located.

1223
00:55:15,522 --> 00:55:16,522
I can get us anywhere.

1224
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,899
How will we get inside?

1225
00:55:18,608 --> 00:55:19,734
In a spaceship.

1226
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:22,570
- Spaceship! Ha, ha!
- Great idea. A Bat-Spaceship.

1227
00:55:22,821 --> 00:55:24,948
No, they're expecting us to show up...

1228
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:28,410
in a Bat-Spaceship, or a pirate
spaceship or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship.

1229
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,021
One of those sounds awesome to me.

1230
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:32,080
My idea is to build a spaceship...

1231
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:35,000
that's exactly like all the other
Octan delivery spaceships.

1232
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,420
So not the special spaceship that
I'm building for all of you right now?

1233
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:40,046
Sorry, Benny. Maybe next time.

1234
00:55:40,296 --> 00:55:43,174
Ooh, you're really letting the oxygen
out of my tank here.

1235
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:46,591
Yeah, but according
to your precious instructions...

1236
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,221
this ship needs a hyperdrive.

1237
00:55:48,471 --> 00:55:49,471
We don't have that part.

1238
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:50,597
Maybe we could find one!

1239
00:55:50,682 --> 00:55:53,363
What do you think, a spaceship
is just gonna appear out of the blue?

1240
00:55:53,435 --> 00:55:54,519
Are you kidding me?

1241
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:55,854
The same thing!

1242
00:56:00,627 --> 00:56:01,627
- Chewie!
- Mm!

1243
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:04,029
We're supposed to be halfway
to Naboo for a sweet party!

1244
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:05,947
This hyperdrive keeps malfunctioning...

1245
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:07,991
taking us to loser systems like this.

1246
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:09,784
Captain Solo, we must go.

1247
00:56:10,035 --> 00:56:12,075
You know how perturbed I get
if we are not punctual.

1248
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:13,455
The Droid's right. Let's roll.

1249
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:15,331
Now hold on, Han.

1250
00:56:15,582 --> 00:56:18,001
This might be the right galaxy after all.

1251
00:56:18,251 --> 00:56:20,545
Because I see a heavenly body.

1252
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:24,299
Ooh, whoa, I have a boyfriend.
And it is super serious. Right, babe?

1253
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:25,884
- Of course it's serious.
- Yeah!

1254
00:56:26,134 --> 00:56:28,053
- Got room for just one dude?
- Whoa! Babe!

1255
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:30,346
If he's a cool dude like you.

1256
00:56:30,597 --> 00:56:31,718
You're trying to bail on us!

1257
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:32,557
I'm not trying to bail!

1258
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:34,559
You asked them if you could go
with them on their party ship!

1259
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:36,329
That thing is filled with bon vivants.

1260
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:37,352
You speak French now?

1261
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:40,565
Babe, look, if this relationship
is ever gonna work between us...

1262
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:42,192
I need to feel free to party...

1263
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,402
with a bunch of strangers
whenever I feel like it.

1264
00:56:44,486 --> 00:56:44,986
What?

1265
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:46,236
Babe!

1266
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:48,990
I will text you.

1267
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,452
Where'd you get that
sweet space cape, brother?

1268
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:55,705
It's party time!

1269
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:57,832
Babe?

1270
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:10,095
Wyldstyle, you're such an amazing person.

1271
00:57:10,345 --> 00:57:14,349
And, you know,
if Batman can't see that, then he's just...

1272
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:18,603
Well, he's just as blind as a guy...

1273
00:57:19,187 --> 00:57:21,731
whose eyes stopped working.

1274
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:24,526
And I'm gonna tell you something:

1275
00:57:24,776 --> 00:57:27,112
Batman is the worst person I've ever met.

1276
00:57:27,362 --> 00:57:29,114
- Need a hyperdrive?
- No way.

1277
00:57:29,364 --> 00:57:30,990
- Babe!
- I knew it! I knew that.

1278
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:32,492
You really had me there!

1279
00:57:32,742 --> 00:57:35,495
Those guys were so lame.
All they did was play space checkers.

1280
00:57:35,745 --> 00:57:37,539
Plus, it turns out the hairy one's a dude.

1281
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:39,332
And the metal one too. All dudes.

1282
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:41,543
But won't they notice
their hyperdrive is missing?

1283
00:57:41,793 --> 00:57:44,879
Come on, Chewie, hit the hyperdrive.

1284
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:49,008
Nah, they'll be fine.

1285
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:56,808
All right, we need a red four-piece
unit over at the...

1286
00:57:57,058 --> 00:57:57,642
Unikitty...

1287
00:57:57,892 --> 00:58:00,979
you're supposed to follow
the instructions, remember?

1288
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:01,855
Sorry.

1289
00:58:02,105 --> 00:58:03,356
Ugh, this gives me the jeebies.

1290
00:58:03,606 --> 00:58:05,150
What do I even...? I can't...!

1291
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:09,529
Nice!

1292
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:12,490
We pilot the ship to the
service entrance...

1293
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,659
so we can get past the dangerous...

1294
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:16,286
but also kind of cool...

1295
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:17,579
laser gate.

1296
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:19,621
Space ID.

1297
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:20,664
I have a drive-on.

1298
00:58:20,832 --> 00:58:22,041
Who are you here to see?

1299
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:23,710
I'm here to see Your Butt.

1300
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,337
Is that last name "Butt,"
first name "Your," or is it...?

1301
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:27,588
Oh, my gosh!

1302
00:58:30,258 --> 00:58:32,927
Pow. Wham. Ka-zap.

1303
00:58:37,265 --> 00:58:38,308
First try!

1304
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:42,645
Step three."
We break into Lord Business' office...

1305
00:58:42,896 --> 00:58:45,315
and we'll plunder his collection
of relics for disguises.

1306
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:47,274
Step four:

1307
00:58:47,317 --> 00:58:48,526
Benny and Metal Beard...

1308
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:50,069
will sneak their way
into the master control room.

1309
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,405
Motion sensors triggered in Sector 12.

1310
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:53,655
10-4.

1311
00:58:54,073 --> 00:58:55,073
Uh-oh.

1312
00:58:59,037 --> 00:59:01,206
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Oh!

1313
00:59:01,456 --> 00:59:02,665
Do it.

1314
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:08,453
Metal Beard, that was awesome!

1315
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,340
First law of the sea...

1316
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:13,760
never place your rear end
on a pirate's face.

1317
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,137
Once inside,
they'll use their technical know-how...

1318
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:17,667
to disable the Kragle shield.

1319
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:18,889
I am the computer.

1320
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:21,267
Cool! Talking computer.

1321
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:24,687
Please disable the shield systems.

1322
00:59:24,938 --> 00:59:26,064
Of course.

1323
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:28,691
There are no movies
in your area with that title.

1324
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:33,363
Vitruvius will provide lookout
and make sure we're not being followed.

1325
00:59:33,613 --> 00:59:34,739
Okay.

1326
00:59:35,365 --> 00:59:37,951
Batman and Unikitty go
into the boardroom...

1327
00:59:38,201 --> 00:59:40,453
to make one last change
to Lord Business' plan.

1328
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:43,456
I move that we freeze the universe.
Can I get a second on that?

1329
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:44,374
BRUCE I second.

1330
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:47,085
Bruce Wayne, CEO of Wayne Enterprises.

1331
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:49,921
Bruce Wayne? Uh, who's that?

1332
00:59:50,171 --> 00:59:52,382
Sounds like a cool guy.

1333
00:59:54,384 --> 00:59:55,824
We'd like to invest in your company.

1334
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:58,388
Your weapon to control
the universe sounds super sweet...

1335
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,807
- ...I must say.
- It is, indeed, super sweet.

1336
01:00:01,057 --> 01:00:03,559
Cool. What kind of sound system
does it have?

1337
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:06,604
Uh, sound system?
Well, I mean, we have an iPod Shuffle.

1338
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:07,854
Wait a second.

1339
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:09,899
You're telling me you have
a machine to control the universe...

1340
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:12,149
and you can't listen to tunes
in surround sound?

1341
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,360
Embarrassing.

1342
01:00:13,528 --> 01:00:14,528
Well, I mean...

1343
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:16,938
we need to get that done.
I want eight-foot speakers.

1344
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:17,740
Great call.

1345
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:21,035
Yeah, I want speakers that you can hug
with your arms and your legs...

1346
01:00:21,286 --> 01:00:22,829
and just feel the beat.

1347
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:27,417
Listen up! We need new instructions
for a speaker system for the TAKOS.

1348
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:28,667
We'll never help.

1349
01:00:28,835 --> 01:00:29,836
Whatever you say, boss.

1350
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,560
Then once the instructions are printed...

1351
01:00:32,714 --> 01:00:34,799
Wyldstyle and I
will enter the Kragle room...

1352
01:00:35,049 --> 01:00:36,801
place the thing on the other thing...

1353
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:38,845
and save the universe.

1354
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:41,615
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, I didn't draw that.
Is that me exploding?

1355
01:00:41,848 --> 01:00:43,349
Uh, I didn't mention that earlier?

1356
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,477
When you reunite the Piece
with the Kragle, it might explode?

1357
01:00:46,728 --> 01:00:48,521
No! But it might not, right?

1358
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:52,150
Sure, sure, sure. Let's go with that.

1359
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:55,028
Attention, everybody!
Incoming speaker delivery!

1360
01:01:03,578 --> 01:01:04,704
Ow!

1361
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:06,496
Who are you two?

1362
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:08,875
We are transfers from downstairs.

1363
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,125
- What?
- Excuse me?

1364
01:01:10,293 --> 01:01:13,046
Your robot voice
sounds an awful lot like a human voice.

1365
01:01:13,296 --> 01:01:15,298
Give me a break.
I've never been a robot before.

1366
01:01:15,548 --> 01:01:17,592
What do you mean?
You have always been a robot!

1367
01:01:17,842 --> 01:01:19,719
No, no, no, do not listen to her.

1368
01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:21,721
What are your robot serial numbers?

1369
01:01:28,603 --> 01:01:29,937
Everything is awesome

1370
01:01:30,938 --> 01:01:32,648
No way. This is my jam.

1371
01:01:32,899 --> 01:01:34,484
This is also my jam.

1372
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:36,444
Everything is awesome

1373
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:38,821
Everything is cool
When you're part of a team

1374
01:01:39,072 --> 01:01:41,753
- Needs great harmonies.
- I don't want to sing the song. I'm not...

1375
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:44,243
Everything is awesome

1376
01:01:44,911 --> 01:01:47,914
Everything is cool
When you're part of a team

1377
01:01:48,164 --> 01:01:50,500
Everything is awesome

1378
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:53,419
When we're living our dream

1379
01:01:54,003 --> 01:01:55,046
Quick, let's go.

1380
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:56,547
Everything is awesome

1381
01:01:56,798 --> 01:01:58,508
Hmm, I thought you didn't like that song.

1382
01:01:58,758 --> 01:01:59,758
I don't.

1383
01:02:00,218 --> 01:02:01,427
Mm-hm.

1384
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:04,263
I know you put on this tough act...

1385
01:02:04,514 --> 01:02:05,973
but I don't think you're as mean
as you're trying to seem.

1386
01:02:06,224 --> 01:02:07,558
I'm not mean. What are you talking about?

1387
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:10,561
I'm just saying, you were all,
"He's not The Special, Vitruvius.

1388
01:02:10,812 --> 01:02:13,606
He can't possibly be The Special.
This guy? Are you kidding me?"

1389
01:02:15,066 --> 01:02:17,318
Anyways, I don't think that's you.

1390
01:02:17,652 --> 01:02:19,237
The real you, anyway.

1391
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:29,122
Look, Emmet.

1392
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:32,458
I wanted it to be me, okay?

1393
01:02:33,668 --> 01:02:35,253
I wanted to be The Special.

1394
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:39,382
And I know that sounds super mature.
It's just...

1395
01:02:39,966 --> 01:02:43,136
ever since I heard the prophecy,
I wanted to be the One.

1396
01:02:44,262 --> 01:02:46,639
I was right there in that
construction site...

1397
01:02:47,265 --> 01:02:49,308
right on top of it, and then...

1398
01:02:50,893 --> 01:02:52,270
it turned out to be you.

1399
01:02:58,985 --> 01:03:02,071
That night in the city,
when you thought I was The Special...

1400
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:08,411
and you said I was talented
and important...

1401
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:12,623
that was the first time anyone
had ever really told me that.

1402
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:15,468
And it made me
wanna do everything I could...

1403
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:17,545
to be the guy you were talking about.

1404
01:03:21,132 --> 01:03:22,132
Lucy.

1405
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:23,384
What?

1406
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:25,887
That was my real name.

1407
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:28,681
You asked earlier, and it's...

1408
01:03:29,891 --> 01:03:31,058
."Lucy.

1409
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:36,063
I really like that name.

1410
01:03:40,003 --> 01:03:41,003
Hey)'-

1411
01:03:41,027 --> 01:03:42,945
- What are you two losers talking about?
- Huh? What? Oh, nothing.

1412
01:03:43,196 --> 01:03:45,948
Thought I'd help you guys.
Left the weird cat thing to stall.

1413
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:48,242
Business, business, business. Numbers.

1414
01:03:48,493 --> 01:03:50,161
- Is this working?
- Yes.

1415
01:03:50,411 --> 01:03:51,411
Yay!

1416
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:52,705
There's Bad Cop.

1417
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:56,542
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes...

1418
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:58,544
Okay. Wait for my signal.

1419
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:00,213
Good luck, Emmet.

1420
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:01,714
Lucy.

1421
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:04,675
I guess this might be goodbye.

1422
01:04:05,218 --> 01:04:08,304
I don't like goodbyes.
Let's just call this:

1423
01:04:08,763 --> 01:04:10,640
"See you later, alligator."

1424
01:04:11,307 --> 01:04:13,518
"See you later, alligator"?

1425
01:04:15,436 --> 01:04:17,522
After a while, crocodile.

1426
01:04:20,775 --> 01:04:21,775
Who's Lucy?

1427
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:23,545
Batman, when we get inside this room...

1428
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:25,112
there are gonna be
audio sensors everywhere.

1429
01:04:25,363 --> 01:04:27,240
We have to be really, really quiet.

1430
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:30,409
Don't worry, Dad, I read your dumb
instructions. Stop yelling at me.

1431
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,953
Benny, what's our status with the shield?

1432
01:04:32,203 --> 01:04:33,443
Oh, yeah, no, it's going great.

1433
01:04:33,579 --> 01:04:35,957
It's just going great,
if somebody would listen to me!

1434
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:38,334
Downloading latest episode
of Where Are My Pants?

1435
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:41,087
Where are you
getting "pants" from? You know what I want!

1436
01:04:41,337 --> 01:04:42,380
The pipes are calling...

1437
01:04:43,316 --> 01:04:44,316
Bad Cop.

1438
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,133
Hi, this is Lord Business' assistant.

1439
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:48,424
He would like you to come
to his office immediately.

1440
01:04:48,553 --> 01:04:49,178
Copy that.

1441
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:51,264
- Thanks.
- You are welcome, sir.

1442
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,601
Hey, who is that?

1443
01:04:58,854 --> 01:04:59,855
That's the signal...

1444
01:05:00,106 --> 01:05:02,024
but the shield is still up.

1445
01:05:02,275 --> 01:05:03,609
We'll wing it.

1446
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:06,612
That's a bat pun.

1447
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:09,865
Shh. Benny...

1448
01:05:10,116 --> 01:05:11,576
disable the shield.

1449
01:05:11,826 --> 01:05:12,907
- Disable the shield.
- Now.

1450
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,161
Disable the shield.

1451
01:05:14,412 --> 01:05:16,172
- Searching for Albanian restaurants.
- What?

1452
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:19,170
- No! I never once said anything...!
- I don't understand what you mean.

1453
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:20,668
Disable the shield!

1454
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:21,918
Benny, what's going on?

1455
01:05:22,128 --> 01:05:23,588
Disable the shield! Come on!

1456
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:25,298
You are undermining me!

1457
01:05:25,548 --> 01:05:27,383
Which phrase
would you like me to underline?

1458
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:28,676
Disable the shield!

1459
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:30,136
Let me try.

1460
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:34,473
Be ye disabling of yon shield.

1461
01:05:34,724 --> 01:05:35,433
Disabling shield.

1462
01:05:35,683 --> 01:05:36,683
What?

1463
01:05:40,271 --> 01:05:42,815
Okay, in three...

1464
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:45,525
two...

1465
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:47,987
one.

1466
01:05:49,322 --> 01:05:50,781
Let's do this.

1467
01:05:52,158 --> 01:05:53,158
Lucy!

1468
01:05:56,287 --> 01:05:57,287
Lucy!

1469
01:05:58,581 --> 01:05:59,582
No!

1470
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:02,460
Oh, man.

1471
01:06:02,835 --> 01:06:03,919
Oh, no.

1472
01:06:04,503 --> 01:06:05,503
Uh-oh.

1473
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:08,257
Sneaking around the corner...

1474
01:06:10,051 --> 01:06:11,844
- Unh!
- Vitruvius.

1475
01:06:12,094 --> 01:06:15,514
I see you've accidentally
wandered into my Think Tank.

1476
01:06:15,765 --> 01:06:17,933
And by the way,
I found a few of your friends.

1477
01:06:18,184 --> 01:06:21,062
- By which I mean all of them!
- Sorry!

1478
01:06:21,312 --> 01:06:22,980
Acceptable work, Bad Cop.

1479
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:23,898
Thank you, sir.

1480
01:06:24,148 --> 01:06:26,734
Robots, destroy this old man at once.

1481
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:28,277
Did you just call me "old"?

1482
01:06:28,527 --> 01:06:29,737
Yeah. So what?

1483
01:06:30,488 --> 01:06:33,532
Well, Junebug, I really prefer the word...

1484
01:06:33,783 --> 01:06:34,784
"experienced"!

1485
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,800
Aha.

1486
01:06:51,842 --> 01:06:52,842
You see, Emmet?

1487
01:06:52,885 --> 01:06:56,097
A corrupted spirit is no match
for the purity of imagina...

1488
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:00,851
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Vitruvius!

1489
01:07:01,102 --> 01:07:02,561
No!

1490
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:05,898
Vitruvius.

1491
01:07:07,149 --> 01:07:10,069
My sweet Emmet. Come closer.

1492
01:07:10,361 --> 01:07:12,655
You must know something
about the prophecy.

1493
01:07:12,905 --> 01:07:14,657
I know, I'm doing my best...

1494
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:15,616
but I don't...

1495
01:07:15,866 --> 01:07:17,284
The prophecy...

1496
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:19,036
I made it up.

1497
01:07:19,537 --> 01:07:20,579
What?

1498
01:07:21,122 --> 01:07:23,791
I made it up. It's not true.

1499
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:26,293
But that means I'm just...

1500
01:07:26,794 --> 01:07:28,295
I'm not The Special?

1501
01:07:28,838 --> 01:07:29,838
You must listen.

1502
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:32,258
What I'm about to tell you...

1503
01:07:32,508 --> 01:07:35,136
will change the course of history.

1504
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:40,808
No.

1505
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:42,643
No.

1506
01:07:51,402 --> 01:07:52,403
Hey.

1507
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,321
Not so special anymore, huh?

1508
01:07:56,949 --> 01:07:57,992
Well, guess what.

1509
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:00,536
No one ever told me I was special.

1510
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:04,123
I never got a trophy just for showing up!

1511
01:08:04,373 --> 01:08:07,543
I'm not some special little snowflake...

1512
01:08:07,793 --> 01:08:08,793
“HO.

1513
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:11,130
But as unspecial as I am...

1514
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:14,425
you are a thousand-billion times...

1515
01:08:14,675 --> 01:08:16,135
more unspecial than me.

1516
01:08:16,385 --> 01:08:19,472
Robots, bring me the Sword of Exact Zero.

1517
01:08:19,722 --> 01:08:21,015
Yes, Lord Business.

1518
01:08:21,766 --> 01:08:23,225
It must be weird.

1519
01:08:23,476 --> 01:08:27,188
One minute, you're the most
special person in the universe.

1520
01:08:27,438 --> 01:08:30,483
And the next minute, you're nobody.

1521
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:35,654
Oh, I have a nice spot
for this in my relic room.

1522
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:37,990
Uh-oh! My mistake!

1523
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:39,700
There it goes!

1524
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:40,451
No!

1525
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:42,661
Bye-bye forever!

1526
01:08:42,912 --> 01:08:46,707
Well, I guess
there's only one thing left to do!

1527
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:50,586
Release the Kragle!

1528
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:53,839
- Computer!
- Yes, sir.

1529
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:56,091
Set the electric shocker
to 100 Mississippi.

1530
01:08:56,342 --> 01:08:57,342
<i>No problem.</i>

1531
01:08:57,343 --> 01:08:59,386
- Then terminate everyone.
- Already on it.

1532
01:08:59,637 --> 01:09:01,597
Emmet, that should give you enough time...

1533
01:09:01,847 --> 01:09:03,727
to witness the first
location to be Kragled.

1534
01:09:03,933 --> 01:09:05,434
- Your hometown.
- No!

1535
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:08,395
Bad Cop, unfortunately,
I'm gonna have to leave you here to die.

1536
01:09:08,646 --> 01:09:09,730
What? Sir.

1537
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,482
It's not personal.

1538
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:13,651
It's just business.

1539
01:09:14,193 --> 01:09:16,237
Lord Business.

1540
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:17,738
Ciao.

1541
01:09:19,323 --> 01:09:21,283
Beginning zapping termination...

1542
01:09:21,534 --> 01:09:23,202
in 99 Mississippi...

1543
01:09:23,452 --> 01:09:25,204
98 Mississippi...

1544
01:09:25,454 --> 01:09:27,206
97 Mississippi...

1545
01:09:27,873 --> 01:09:28,958
and so on.

1546
01:09:48,602 --> 01:09:50,396
Attention, everyone.

1547
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:53,315
This is President Business.

1548
01:09:54,817 --> 01:09:55,817
Hello.

1549
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,862
- Hi, welcome to Taco Tuesday!
- Whoa.

1550
01:09:58,571 --> 01:10:00,698
Don't worry about this big black...

1551
01:10:00,948 --> 01:10:02,867
monolith thing that's
blocking out the sun.

1552
01:10:03,617 --> 01:10:04,857
What you need to worry about...

1553
01:10:05,077 --> 01:10:07,496
is this question that
I'm about to ask you:

1554
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,124
Who wants a taco?

1555
01:10:13,085 --> 01:10:14,461
Yeah! I know!

1556
01:10:14,712 --> 01:10:17,131
Tacos, tacos! We're going crazy! Yeah.

1557
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:19,216
All right, everyone.

1558
01:10:19,466 --> 01:10:20,843
Act normal.

1559
01:10:22,845 --> 01:10:23,929
Perfect.

1560
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:26,765
Now, everybody say "Freeze!"

1561
01:10:30,311 --> 01:10:33,480
So I guess running around
and screaming is normal.

1562
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:36,317
Micro-managers,
commence micro-management.

1563
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:38,986
Commencing micro-management.

1564
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:43,073
What's going on? I can't move!

1565
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:48,162
Please, please! Won't somebody help us?

1566
01:10:48,412 --> 01:10:52,291
Emmet, you'll think of something,
right? Like you always do.

1567
01:10:53,334 --> 01:10:54,960
Didn't you hear him?

1568
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,004
The prophecy's made-up.

1569
01:10:58,088 --> 01:10:59,798
I'm not The Special.

1570
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:03,510
And to think for a moment
I thought I might be.

1571
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,890
- Emmet.
- Who said that?

1572
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,391
I did.

1573
01:11:09,642 --> 01:11:12,436
I am Ghost Vitruvius.

1574
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:15,522
Woo!

1575
01:11:16,023 --> 01:11:18,734
Emmet, you didn't let me finish earlier.

1576
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:20,361
Because I died.

1577
01:11:20,611 --> 01:11:22,237
The reason I made up the prophecy...

1578
01:11:22,488 --> 01:11:24,949
was because I knew that
whoever found the Piece...

1579
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,825
could become The Special.

1580
01:11:27,076 --> 01:11:29,745
Because the only thing
anyone needs to be special...

1581
01:11:29,995 --> 01:11:32,539
is to believe that you can be.

1582
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:36,251
I know that sounds like a cat poster,
but it's true.

1583
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:40,547
Look at what you did
when you believed you were special.

1584
01:11:40,798 --> 01:11:43,217
You just need to believe it some more.

1585
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:46,720
But how can I just decide
to believe that I'm special...

1586
01:11:46,971 --> 01:11:48,013
when I'm not?

1587
01:11:49,348 --> 01:11:52,059
Because the world depends on it.

1588
01:11:54,103 --> 01:11:56,939
Woo!

1589
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:59,900
Zapping termination in 35 Mississippi...

1590
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:00,734
What?

1591
01:12:00,985 --> 01:12:02,111
34 Mississippi...

1592
01:12:02,987 --> 01:12:04,113
33 Mississippi...

1593
01:12:04,989 --> 01:12:06,323
32 Mississippi...

1594
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:08,909
31 Mississippi...

1595
01:12:09,702 --> 01:12:10,702
30 Mississippi...

1596
01:12:10,828 --> 01:12:12,663
29 Mississippi...

1597
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:15,165
28 Mississippi, 27 Mississippi...

1598
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:18,710
26 Mississippi...

1599
01:12:18,919 --> 01:12:21,255
25 Mississippi...

1600
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:22,505
24 Mississippi...

1601
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:31,765
Emmet!

1602
01:12:32,016 --> 01:12:33,016
What are you...?

1603
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:34,643
18 Mississippi...

1604
01:12:34,893 --> 01:12:36,979
- ...17 Mississippi...
- Oh!

1605
01:12:37,229 --> 01:12:38,731
- ...16 Mississippi...
- Lucy!

1606
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:40,822
- ...15 Mississippi...
- Wait! What are you...?

1607
01:12:40,899 --> 01:12:42,776
Now it's your turn to be the hero.

1608
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:44,653
- 13 Mississippi...
- No!

1609
01:12:44,903 --> 01:12:46,363
12 Mississippi...

1610
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:48,282
See you later, alligator.

1611
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:49,532
Don't!

1612
01:12:51,577 --> 01:12:53,162
No, Emmet!

1613
01:12:53,412 --> 01:12:55,664
- Aah!
- 7 Mississippi...

1614
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:57,291
6 Mississippi...

1615
01:12:57,666 --> 01:12:59,376
5 Mississippi...

1616
01:12:59,626 --> 01:13:00,919
4 Mississippi...

1617
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:02,921
3 Mississippi...

1618
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:04,631
2 Mississippi...

1619
01:13:05,758 --> 01:13:06,758
1 Mississippi...

1620
01:13:07,301 --> 01:13:08,719
0 Missi... Error.

1621
01:13:08,969 --> 01:13:10,471
Termination failure.

1622
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:12,430
Emmet!

1623
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:21,106
No.

1624
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:29,740
He... He saved us.

1625
01:13:30,866 --> 01:13:32,242
Well, what do we do now?

1626
01:13:32,493 --> 01:13:33,814
There's gotta be a bright side...

1627
01:13:34,036 --> 01:13:34,745
here somewhere.

1628
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:36,538
Does anyone have any ideas?

1629
01:13:37,456 --> 01:13:38,999
Emmet had ideas.

1630
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:43,253
Arr, if only there were more people
in the world like he.

1631
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,134
Maybe there are.

1632
01:13:49,593 --> 01:13:51,178
Meet me downstairs in 10 seconds.

1633
01:13:53,263 --> 01:13:55,182
Honey, where are my...

1634
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:57,226
pant“?

1635
01:13:57,726 --> 01:13:58,769
- Hi!
- Hey, guess what.

1636
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:01,438
Found your pants. Series is over. Benny...

1637
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:03,941
send this out to
everyone in the universe.

1638
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:05,943
1980-something technology?

1639
01:14:06,193 --> 01:14:07,569
Now you're talking!

1640
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:13,367
Uh... Ahem. Hey, everybody.

1641
01:14:13,617 --> 01:14:17,204
You don't know me,
but I'm on TV, so you can trust me.

1642
01:14:17,454 --> 01:14:19,915
I know things seem kind of bad right now.

1643
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:22,584
But there is a way out of this.

1644
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:25,087
This is Emmet.

1645
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:27,464
And he was just like all of you.

1646
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:29,174
A face in the crowd...

1647
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:31,468
following the same instructions as you.

1648
01:14:32,261 --> 01:14:35,055
He was so good at fitting in,
no one ever saw him.

1649
01:14:35,722 --> 01:14:37,307
And I owe you an apology...

1650
01:14:37,808 --> 01:14:39,935
because I used to look down
on people like that.

1651
01:14:40,185 --> 01:14:42,855
"I used to think they were followers...

1652
01:14:43,105 --> 01:14:45,691
with no ideas or vision."

1653
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:48,235
Because it turns out Emmet had great ideas.

1654
01:14:48,485 --> 01:14:50,612
And even though they seemed weird...

1655
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:52,861
and kind of pointless...

1656
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:54,533
they actually came closer...

1657
01:14:54,783 --> 01:14:57,286
than anyone else to saving the universe.

1658
01:14:57,619 --> 01:15:00,455
And now we have to finish
what he started...

1659
01:15:00,706 --> 01:15:04,042
by making whatever weird thing
pops into our heads.

1660
01:15:04,293 --> 01:15:07,337
All of you have the ability
inside of you to be a groundbreaker.

1661
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:08,797
And I mean literally!

1662
01:15:09,673 --> 01:15:10,924
Break the ground!

1663
01:15:11,175 --> 01:15:12,175
Peel up the pieces...

1664
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:13,343
tear apart your walls!

1665
01:15:13,594 --> 01:15:15,304
Build things only you could build.

1666
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:16,680
Defend yourselves.

1667
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,600
We need to fight back
against President Business'...

1668
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:21,852
plans to freeze us!

1669
01:15:22,311 --> 01:15:25,022
Today will not be known as Taco Tuesday.

1670
01:15:25,522 --> 01:15:28,567
It will be known as Freedom Friday!

1671
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:32,487
But still on a Tuesday!

1672
01:15:39,244 --> 01:15:40,913
End of the line.

1673
01:15:43,665 --> 01:15:44,750
Bad Cop?

1674
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,085
I hope there's still a Good Cop
in me somewhere.

1675
01:15:48,962 --> 01:15:52,883
I'll hold these guys off.
You go stop them. Yay!

1676
01:15:53,133 --> 01:15:55,552
Great idea, but how will we get there?

1677
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:57,679
T-minus one.

1678
01:15:57,930 --> 01:16:00,182
Ten, nine, eight...

1679
01:16:00,432 --> 01:16:01,793
- ...seven, six...
- I could, uh...

1680
01:16:02,517 --> 01:16:04,037
- ...five, four...
- I could build a...

1681
01:16:04,686 --> 01:16:05,686
three, two, one.

1682
01:16:06,313 --> 01:16:07,689
I could build a spaceship!

1683
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,693
You're not gonna say no?

1684
01:16:11,944 --> 01:16:13,695
Build away, whatever your name is.

1685
01:16:13,946 --> 01:16:15,405
- Whoa! Yay!
- Ha-ha-ha!

1686
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:20,244
Okay. Spaceship! Spaceship!

1687
01:16:23,205 --> 01:16:24,205
Spaceship!

1688
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:26,666
Spaceship!

1689
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:27,542
Spaceship!

1690
01:16:27,793 --> 01:16:28,793
Spaceship!

1691
01:16:29,002 --> 01:16:30,170
Spaceship!

1692
01:16:30,879 --> 01:16:31,879
Spaceship!

1693
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:32,631
Spaceship!

1694
01:16:32,881 --> 01:16:34,341
All units, attack that spaceship.

1695
01:16:36,134 --> 01:16:37,134
Spaceship!

1696
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:39,239
Where'd he go?

1697
01:16:39,263 --> 01:16:40,263
Spaceship!

1698
01:16:43,141 --> 01:16:44,184
Wyldstyle, look...

1699
01:16:44,434 --> 01:16:46,561
it's the citizens!

1700
01:16:52,109 --> 01:16:53,527
Tallyho!

1701
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:55,445
Yee-haw!

1702
01:16:55,696 --> 01:16:58,156
And don't forget us MasterBuilders.

1703
01:16:58,407 --> 01:17:00,284
What is going on?

1704
01:17:00,534 --> 01:17:01,743
You stop...

1705
01:17:01,994 --> 01:17:03,078
building that stuff!

1706
01:17:03,328 --> 01:17:04,413
Just stop it!

1707
01:17:08,644 --> 01:17:09,644
Great job!

1708
01:17:09,668 --> 01:17:10,752
This might actually work.

1709
01:17:11,003 --> 01:17:13,964
'Twas your speech
which roused this hearty crew.

1710
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:16,925
If only Emmet were here to see this.

1711
01:17:17,175 --> 01:17:19,344
He'd say something adorable like...

1712
01:17:23,724 --> 01:17:25,976
Am I just gonna keep...

1713
01:17:26,226 --> 01:17:27,227
falling...

1714
01:17:28,228 --> 01:17:31,189
forever?

1715
01:17:42,492 --> 01:17:44,161
Is this another vision?

1716
01:17:46,913 --> 01:17:47,998
Where am I?

1717
01:17:49,041 --> 01:17:52,127
Is that the Office Tower?

1718
01:17:58,675 --> 01:17:59,675
Bricksburg!

1719
01:18:01,303 --> 01:18:02,304
What was that?

1720
01:18:04,848 --> 01:18:05,848
No, no, no.

1721
01:18:05,974 --> 01:18:06,974
<i>No!</i>

1722
01:18:09,019 --> 01:18:10,562
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship!

1723
01:18:10,812 --> 01:18:13,106
- Pew!
- What in the world is that?

1724
01:18:15,233 --> 01:18:17,361
It's adorable.

1725
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:21,531
Uh-oh.

1726
01:18:21,782 --> 01:18:23,784
No. No. Whoa, no, no, no.

1727
01:18:24,034 --> 01:18:25,314
Hey, don't eat me. Don't eat me.

1728
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:26,828
Do not eat me. Please.

1729
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:28,747
Hi, Emmet.

1730
01:18:29,664 --> 01:18:30,957
Uh...

1731
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:32,626
Hi?

1732
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:38,048
Is this The Man...?

1733
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:47,057
The Man Upstairs?

1734
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,024
What happened?

1735
01:18:57,025 --> 01:18:59,403
No, no, no, this is a disaster.

1736
01:19:00,362 --> 01:19:03,031
Why...? Why...? What? What?

1737
01:19:03,281 --> 01:19:04,281
What?

1738
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:08,286
Why is the dragon on top
of the luxury condo development?

1739
01:19:08,787 --> 01:19:09,871
But I was just playing...

1740
01:19:10,372 --> 01:19:11,706
I know it's hard to understand...

1741
01:19:11,957 --> 01:19:14,084
but this is Dad's stuff, okay?

1742
01:19:14,376 --> 01:19:16,628
All of this that you see before you...

1743
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:18,630
is all your father's.

1744
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,757
And everything is thought-out very...

1745
01:19:21,466 --> 01:19:22,506
What did you do down here?

1746
01:19:22,551 --> 01:19:24,071
Did you take the top off of the tower?

1747
01:19:24,553 --> 01:19:25,887
It was an accident.

1748
01:19:26,138 --> 01:19:28,515
You accidentally...

1749
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:30,183
expertly...

1750
01:19:30,434 --> 01:19:33,270
carefully took the entire top
off of that tower?

1751
01:19:33,956 --> 01:19:34,956
Yes.

1752
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,648
You know the rules. This isn't a toy.

1753
01:19:37,023 --> 01:19:39,609
- Um, well, it kind of is.
- No.

1754
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:43,363
Actually, it's a highly sophisticated
interlocking brick system.

1755
01:19:43,613 --> 01:19:45,866
- But we bought it at the toy store.
- We did.

1756
01:19:46,116 --> 01:19:49,119
But the way I'm using it
makes it an adult thing.

1757
01:19:49,369 --> 01:19:51,371
The box for this one said ages 8 to 14.

1758
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:55,625
That's a suggestion.
They have to put that on there.

1759
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:59,087
You can't expect me to be able
to resist playing with all this.

1760
01:19:59,337 --> 01:20:01,590
You have your stuff over near
the Christmas decorations.

1761
01:20:02,174 --> 01:20:04,259
All those bricks,
you can build anything you want.

1762
01:20:07,971 --> 01:20:11,224
Finn, we're gonna play a little game.
It's called:

1763
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:14,269
"Let's Put Everything Back
the Way You Found it."

1764
01:20:14,519 --> 01:20:16,021
But, Dad, you don't understand.

1765
01:20:16,271 --> 01:20:19,357
So I can make things
the way they're supposed to be.

1766
01:20:22,611 --> 01:20:24,029
Permanently.

1767
01:20:27,115 --> 01:20:28,366
More Kragles?

1768
01:20:28,617 --> 01:20:31,119
This rebellion ends right now.

1769
01:20:31,369 --> 01:20:32,746
Commencing...

1770
01:20:32,996 --> 01:20:34,164
micro-management.

1771
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,337
Oh, no. No!

1772
01:20:45,467 --> 01:20:47,010
Ha, ha! Fire in the hole!

1773
01:20:51,431 --> 01:20:52,431
Wait, what's happening?

1774
01:20:52,641 --> 01:20:55,310
No, wait! No, we're going down! Mayday!

1775
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,937
<i>No!</i>

1776
01:20:58,355 --> 01:20:59,355
Meow. Meow.

1777
01:20:59,564 --> 01:21:01,399
Hold on, Jeff. We're coming for you!

1778
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:02,359
No!

1779
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:03,609
Stop!

1780
01:21:03,944 --> 01:21:04,944
Oh, no!

1781
01:21:14,287 --> 01:21:16,164
Arr, there be too many Micro-managers!

1782
01:21:16,414 --> 01:21:17,707
What am I holding here?

1783
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:20,794
- It's a battleship.
- No, it's a hodgepodge. That's what it is.

1784
01:21:21,044 --> 01:21:22,254
What's Batman doing on it?

1785
01:21:23,088 --> 01:21:24,422
What is this, a robot pirate?

1786
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:26,590
Dang it.

1787
01:21:27,801 --> 01:21:29,122
Stop! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop!

1788
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:31,346
You got glue all over
that construction worker.

1789
01:21:32,806 --> 01:21:34,808
Here. Give that to me.

1790
01:21:35,559 --> 01:21:37,561
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1791
01:21:37,811 --> 01:21:39,451
All of those are my friends! No, stop it!

1792
01:21:39,604 --> 01:21:42,691
Ye were a hearty crew. But it be...

1793
01:21:43,525 --> 01:21:45,277
It be over.

1794
01:21:45,527 --> 01:21:47,362
No!

1795
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:51,533
The Piece of Resistance!

1796
01:21:51,783 --> 01:21:53,285
I can still save them!

1797
01:21:53,535 --> 01:21:56,955
Let's get this gunk
off this construction worker.

1798
01:21:57,205 --> 01:21:59,499
He's not just a construction worker, Dad.
He's the hero.

1799
01:21:59,749 --> 01:22:01,418
Nope, he's not.

1800
01:22:01,668 --> 01:22:04,254
He is a ordinary, regular...

1801
01:22:04,504 --> 01:22:06,089
generic construction worker...

1802
01:22:06,339 --> 01:22:09,050
and I need to put him back
where he belongs.

1803
01:22:10,302 --> 01:22:13,179
Now, where is my X-Acto knife?

1804
01:22:16,016 --> 01:22:18,643
I gotta get the Piece of Resistance.

1805
01:22:19,394 --> 01:22:22,522
If I could get the attention
of the smaller creature.

1806
01:22:23,273 --> 01:22:24,357
I gotta move.

1807
01:22:24,608 --> 01:22:26,735
Where is that?

1808
01:22:26,985 --> 01:22:28,778
Move!

1809
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,413
All right.

1810
01:23:00,435 --> 01:23:01,435
Move!

1811
01:23:06,608 --> 01:23:07,942
Now, I didn't move...

1812
01:23:12,197 --> 01:23:13,197
OW.

1813
01:23:15,575 --> 01:23:16,868
- Uh, Dad?
- Yeah.

1814
01:23:17,118 --> 01:23:20,080
I think I saw the X-Acto over there
near Middle Zealand.

1815
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:21,665
Oh, great. Thank you.

1816
01:23:21,915 --> 01:23:23,083
Welcome.

1817
01:23:30,924 --> 01:23:32,509
It's up to you now, Emmet.

1818
01:23:42,394 --> 01:23:43,728
Believe.

1819
01:23:44,979 --> 01:23:47,399
I know that sounds like a cat poster...

1820
01:23:47,649 --> 01:23:49,234
but it's true.

1821
01:23:56,366 --> 01:23:58,493
Whoa!

1822
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:12,298
Sorry, street.

1823
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:19,514
Ho-ho!

1824
01:24:24,644 --> 01:24:27,397
I can see everything.

1825
01:24:30,836 --> 01:24:31,836
Ha, ha!

1826
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:33,319
What the heck is this?

1827
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:35,613
I am a MasterBuilder.

1828
01:24:38,324 --> 01:24:41,035
Release every Micro-manager we have!

1829
01:24:41,286 --> 01:24:42,871
Let's get him, fellas!

1830
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:48,042
Hey, everyone!

1831
01:24:48,293 --> 01:24:50,170
- Emmet!
- Emmet! Yay!

1832
01:24:53,173 --> 01:24:55,717
Lucy, I'm going inside that thing.

1833
01:24:56,259 --> 01:24:57,259
You've got it, Emmet.

1834
01:24:57,469 --> 01:25:00,013
Take that! Ha, ha!

1835
01:25:00,263 --> 01:25:01,431
Good night! Come here!

1836
01:25:01,681 --> 01:25:03,308
We'll help you out, kid.

1837
01:25:03,558 --> 01:25:06,060
Here's how we do it pirate-style!

1838
01:25:08,772 --> 01:25:09,772
Yes! Emmet! That's it!

1839
01:25:12,901 --> 01:25:13,901
Take him down, boys!

1840
01:25:17,655 --> 01:25:18,656
Emmet!

1841
01:25:21,242 --> 01:25:22,869
Stay positive.

1842
01:25:23,995 --> 01:25:25,163
They're tearing me apart!

1843
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,791
Stay positive.

1844
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:29,208
Come on!

1845
01:25:29,334 --> 01:25:30,752
Oh, forget it!

1846
01:25:36,299 --> 01:25:38,968
You all need to be more friendly!

1847
01:25:41,596 --> 01:25:42,597
Emmet, go!

1848
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:43,932
Go! Now's your...

1849
01:25:44,182 --> 01:25:45,558
- ...chance!
- She's right!

1850
01:25:45,809 --> 01:25:48,645
- You can do it, me laddie!
- Go on, kid. Get in there!

1851
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:57,319
Sir, we got an intrud...!

1852
01:25:59,239 --> 01:26:00,365
Lord Business.

1853
01:26:00,615 --> 01:26:02,283
Back from the dead, Brickowski?

1854
01:26:02,534 --> 01:26:03,660
Well, you're too late!

1855
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:05,286
Skeletrons, get him!

1856
01:26:16,256 --> 01:26:17,799
Argh! I can't move!

1857
01:26:18,925 --> 01:26:20,093
You see, your friends...

1858
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:21,343
oh, they're finished!

1859
01:26:22,512 --> 01:26:23,721
My world is almost finished.

1860
01:26:25,348 --> 01:26:27,934
The last thing I need to do is finish...

1861
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:29,644
- ...you.
- No, stop! Please!

1862
01:26:29,894 --> 01:26:32,522
If you do one more thing,
I'm gonna unleash my secret weapon.

1863
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:34,399
Your secret weapon?

1864
01:26:35,149 --> 01:26:37,527
Yes, it's called:

1865
01:26:37,777 --> 01:26:39,779
The Power of The Special.

1866
01:26:40,029 --> 01:26:41,281
That sounds dumb.

1867
01:26:42,073 --> 01:26:45,451
All right, here it comes.
My secret weapon...

1868
01:26:46,411 --> 01:26:47,745
is this.

1869
01:26:49,038 --> 01:26:51,624
What is that? Is it super small?
I don't see anything.

1870
01:26:51,875 --> 01:26:54,043
It's my hand. I want you to take it.

1871
01:26:54,294 --> 01:26:55,670
You want me to take your hand off?

1872
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,590
No, I want you to join me.

1873
01:26:59,048 --> 01:27:02,135
Look at all of these
things that people built.

1874
01:27:02,427 --> 01:27:03,720
You might see a mess...

1875
01:27:03,970 --> 01:27:06,598
Exactly. And a bunch
of weird, dorky stuff...

1876
01:27:06,848 --> 01:27:09,100
that ruined my perfectly good stuff!

1877
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:11,936
Okay. What I see...

1878
01:27:12,437 --> 01:27:15,607
are people inspired by each other...

1879
01:27:16,149 --> 01:27:17,567
and by you.

1880
01:27:18,693 --> 01:27:21,237
People taking what you made...

1881
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:24,032
and making something new out of it.

1882
01:27:40,506 --> 01:27:42,216
Finn, did you make all of this?

1883
01:27:45,011 --> 01:27:47,597
The people are trying to stop
President Business...

1884
01:27:47,847 --> 01:27:49,724
from using the Kragle.

1885
01:27:50,558 --> 01:27:51,893
What's the Kragle?

1886
01:27:52,602 --> 01:27:55,355
Um, it's in there.

1887
01:27:57,523 --> 01:27:59,025
In here?

1888
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:40,775
So President Business is the bad guy?

1889
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:49,993
If...

1890
01:28:51,452 --> 01:28:53,955
If the construction guy...

1891
01:28:55,123 --> 01:28:56,763
said something
to President Business...

1892
01:29:00,712 --> 01:29:02,463
what would he say?

1893
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:10,430
You...

1894
01:29:11,723 --> 01:29:14,100
don't have to be...

1895
01:29:15,018 --> 01:29:16,352
the bad guy.

1896
01:29:18,896 --> 01:29:19,896
You...

1897
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:22,108
are the most talented...

1898
01:29:23,151 --> 01:29:24,485
most interesting...

1899
01:29:25,903 --> 01:29:29,198
and most extraordinary person
in the universe.

1900
01:29:30,825 --> 01:29:33,995
And you are capable of amazing things...

1901
01:29:34,746 --> 01:29:38,499
because you are The Special.

1902
01:29:41,878 --> 01:29:43,212
And so am I.

1903
01:29:46,174 --> 01:29:47,884
And so is everyone.

1904
01:29:49,343 --> 01:29:51,387
The prophecy is made-up...

1905
01:29:52,221 --> 01:29:54,057
but it's also true.

1906
01:29:54,724 --> 01:29:55,975
It's about all of us.

1907
01:29:56,684 --> 01:29:59,062
Right now, it's about you.

1908
01:30:00,396 --> 01:30:01,731
And you...

1909
01:30:02,857 --> 01:30:04,317
still...

1910
01:30:05,068 --> 01:30:07,236
can change everything.

1911
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:34,347
Oh, we got a hugger.

1912
01:30:36,891 --> 01:30:37,975
Be careful.

1913
01:30:38,226 --> 01:30:41,604
I have been told it might explode.

1914
01:30:52,615 --> 01:30:53,699
Phew.

1915
01:30:54,742 --> 01:30:57,078
Emmet, thank you.

1916
01:30:57,328 --> 01:30:59,789
And I just want you to know,
from the bottom of my heart...

1917
01:31:00,248 --> 01:31:01,791
from this moment forward...

1918
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:04,377
I solemnly promise that I will never...

1919
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:15,429
Emmet!

1920
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,974
Hey, everyone! ls everyone okay?

1921
01:31:18,766 --> 01:31:19,767
Where's Lucy?

1922
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:21,309
Emmet!

1923
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:22,728
Lucy!

1924
01:31:25,898 --> 01:31:27,191
We did it.

1925
01:31:33,239 --> 01:31:35,491
Oh. Uh, Emmet, wait.

1926
01:31:36,075 --> 01:31:38,744
Batman, there's something
I need to say to you.

1927
01:31:38,995 --> 01:31:40,580
No. Wyldstyle...

1928
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:42,039
I mean...

1929
01:31:42,748 --> 01:31:44,125
."Lucy.

1930
01:31:45,251 --> 01:31:47,378
He's the hero you deserve.

1931
01:31:50,506 --> 01:31:52,550
- Uh...
- Thanks, Batman.

1932
01:32:04,103 --> 01:32:06,772
I liked Emmet before it was cool.

1933
01:32:07,607 --> 01:32:09,650
Whoops, I have the antidote for the Kragle.

1934
01:32:09,901 --> 01:32:11,360
How did that happen?

1935
01:32:11,611 --> 01:32:13,029
Yay!

1936
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:14,447
- De-Kragler.
- Watch this.

1937
01:32:14,697 --> 01:32:15,823
- Yay!
- Oh, Mommy, Daddy.

1938
01:32:16,073 --> 01:32:17,073
You're okay!

1939
01:32:17,241 --> 01:32:18,826
- Oh, son!
- Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

1940
01:32:20,328 --> 01:32:22,079
We're okay, son. Ha, ha.

1941
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:24,971
Guys, time to come up for dinner.
It's Taco Tuesday, your favorite.

1942
01:32:25,208 --> 01:32:28,336
- Okay, honey. We'll be up in a sec.
- Yeah, we'll be up in a sec!

1943
01:32:28,836 --> 01:32:30,504
- I gotta tell you something.
- What?

1944
01:32:30,755 --> 01:32:32,755
Now that I'm letting you
come down here and play...

1945
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,720
guess who else gets to
come down here and play'?

1946
01:32:34,759 --> 01:32:36,135
- Who?
- Your sister.

1947
01:32:36,385 --> 01:32:37,385
What?

1948
01:32:37,386 --> 01:32:39,466
Well, things sure have a way
of working out smoothly.

1949
01:32:39,597 --> 01:32:40,306
Am I right, GUYS?

1950
01:32:40,556 --> 01:32:42,308
What?

1951
01:32:47,605 --> 01:32:50,024
We're from the Planet Duplon.

1952
01:32:50,274 --> 01:32:53,486
We are here to destroy you.

1953
01:32:55,071 --> 01:32:56,614
Oh, man.

1954
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:59,542
Yes, this is real music.

1955
01:38:00,709 --> 01:38:02,336
Dark, brooding...

1956
01:38:02,795 --> 01:38:04,421
important...

1957
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,006
groundbreaking.

1958
01:38:07,633 --> 01:38:08,676
Check out the lyrics.

1959
01:38:11,345 --> 01:38:12,763
Darkness

1960
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:16,433
No parents

1961
01:38:19,144 --> 01:38:20,938
Continued darkness

1962
01:38:21,188 --> 01:38:22,940
More darkness. Get it?

1963
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:25,067
The opposite of light

1964
01:38:25,776 --> 01:38:27,194
Black hole

1965
01:38:27,987 --> 01:38:29,196
Curtains drawn

1966
01:38:30,781 --> 01:38:32,366
In the basement

1967
01:38:33,492 --> 01:38:35,077
Middle of the night

1968
01:38:36,453 --> 01:38:38,455
<i>Blacked-out windows</i>

1969
01:38:40,124 --> 01:38:41,542
Other places that are dark

1970
01:38:43,794 --> 01:38:45,004
Black suit

1971
01:38:46,213 --> 01:38:47,715
Black coffee

1972
01:38:48,465 --> 01:38:50,634
You get it. That's just the first verse.

1973
01:38:50,884 --> 01:38:52,720
Darkness

1974
01:38:54,013 --> 01:38:55,889
No parents

1975
01:38:57,141 --> 01:38:58,392
Super rich

1976
01:38:59,935 --> 01:39:01,604
Kind of makes it better
