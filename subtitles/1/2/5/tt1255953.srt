Hmm ... I must tell you here

18
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,288
it is the decision
of your mother.

19
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:17,693
I was personally against
it, but she insisted.

20
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:20,991
You know ...

21
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,498
(Sigh)

22

00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:32,568
I could not refuse.

nothing surprising in this.

We'll meet again, huh?

working for you.

It has done this well in his
life, congratulations.

But your secretary, it
was also my mother.

Then his mother's job,
that's another story.

- Simon ...

00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:21,396
- Your secretary, you can
bury the edge you want.

94
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:24,134
My mother, myself, I want to
bury it in the normal way

95
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:25,869
for once in your fucking life

96
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:28,072
make it something normal.

(Closed Door)

101
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:46,663
- Take your time.

102
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,427
And come see me when Simon
will be calmed.

103
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:52,761
(Sigh)

104
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,934
I know it's very
unusual, but ...

105
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:59,309
(Sigh)

106
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,936
... Your mother was
not crazy, Jeanne.

107
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,920
(Chirping birds and
man's voice off)

108
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,326
- We have a large
family, astheure.

109
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:29,540
She spoke of a dog?

110
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:32,270
A big family, it's always a dog.

111
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:35,006
Will he have to also
find the dog?

112
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:37,706
Fucking crazy!

113
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:45,284
I'll fix that with John.

114
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,824
- Arrange what?

115
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,520
- We'll give him a
normal funeral.

116
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:55,668
We'll take care of her, then
I'll take care of you.

117
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:10,883
Where you going?

118
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:13,178
- You bury the bin as you like!

119
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:14,843
- Oh, stop!

120
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:18,180
You feel guilty because
you were not there

121
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:19,325
when she died.

122
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:21,256
You feel guilty because
you were there

123
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:22,691
when she had her accident.

124
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:25,387
We need to stop you feeling
guilty for everything!

125
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:27,226
I am not guilty of
anything, myself.

126
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,858
- Do you realize you realize
what he just read?

127
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,196
- Well, she's gone!

128
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:33,237
It's over, fucking,
you have the peace!

129
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:40,004
I have the fucking peace!

130
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:42,837
(Sigh)

131
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:47,243
I'm at peace now.

132
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:51,516
- Yes, I see it.

133
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:55,692
(Sigh)

134
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:59,595
- Mathematics as you
have known so far

135
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:03,691
have aimed to achieve a stringent
response and final

136
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:06,738
starting problems strict
and definitive.

137
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:10,364
Now, you enter an entirely
different adventure.

138
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:12,967
The subject will be
intractable problems

139
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:14,704
you will always lead

140
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:17,749
to other problems just
as intractable.

141
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:20,613
People around you
will repeatedly

142
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:23,745
it is picking what
you do not need.

143
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:26,915
You'll have no argument
to defend yourself,

144
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,824
for they shall be an exhausting
complexity.

145
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,165
Welcome to pure mathematics,

146
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,291
the land of loneliness.

147
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:39,428
This is my assistant,

148
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,403
Miss Jeanne Marwan.

149
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:43,932
- Hello!

150
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,978
We will start with the conjecture
of Syracuse.

151
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:55,287
- What is your intuition
telling you?

152
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:04,293
Your intuition is always right.

153
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,659
That's why you got potential

154
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,199
becoming a real mathematician.

155
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:11,963
But here, you'll need help.

156
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,130
Have you any family there?

157
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:19,338
Contacts?
- It's ridiculous, Niv.

158
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:23,006
- You come to learn that
A, your father is alive;

159
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:25,208
and B, you have another brother.

160
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:26,443
This is ridiculous

161
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:29,953
is that you are questioning
what is inevitable.

162
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:31,546
You need to know.

163
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:35,220
Otherwise, your spirit
will never be peace.

164
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,893
And no peace of mind, not
of pure mathematics.

165
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:46,630
It takes you a starting point.

166
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,677
- My father died during
the war, Daresh.

167
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:57,044
- That's the unknown variable

00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:39,192
We the students, we oppose
the Nationalist Party

338
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:41,697
trying to evict refugees
outside the borders.

339
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:43,197
- The National Party supports

340
00:33:43,368 --> 00:33:44,892
militias of the Christian right,

341
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:46,936
who make open threats
to refugees.

342
00:33:47,072 --> 00:33:49,063
- In the South, refugees
are now armed.

343
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:51,004
Et .. and they support

344
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:55,409
of much of the Muslim population
of the country.

345
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:58,744
- But you ...
but you're Christian.

346
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:01,374
- We, we are for peace.

347
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,885
Religion has nothing
to do with it.

348
00:34:04,022 --> 00:34:05,614
(Humming)

349
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:11,918
(Cree)

350
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:14,463
- Nawal!

351
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:17,724
(Arabic): Put the radio!
They come to close
the University!

352
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:20,564
The Nationalists have
closed the campus!

353
00:34:35,987 --> 00:34:37,750
- Nawal back.

354
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:40,217
Stay here.

355
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,819
- Uncle Charbel, the Nationalists
are closing the campus!

356
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:49,794
- There will be clashes.

357
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:52,129
Stay with me.

358
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:57,506
(A woman speaks Arabic
on the radio)

359
00:34:57,642 --> 00:34:59,007
(Shots)

360
00:34:59,144 --> 00:35:01,112
(Shouts off)

361
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:12,015
- There is shooting outside ...

362
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:15,919
- The table, girls!

363
00:35:16,094 --> 00:35:17,959
- Mom, they attack
the university!

364
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:20,826
- It's not a reason not to eat!

365
00:35:28,807 --> 00:35:30,297
- Aiou?

366
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:48,682
(Arabic)

367
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:03,804
Christian villages were attacked
in the South this morning.

368
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:06,068
- May God protect us!

369
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:08,235
- That's why they closed
the university.

370
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:11,746
In short time, it will
explode here as well.

371
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:18,220
We'll go to the mountain
until it calms down.

372
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,680
- For how long?

373
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,417
- We start tomorrow.

374
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:25,358
The rest of the family
is already there.

375
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,020
- And the school?

376
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,532
- Anyway, the school will close.

377
00:36:31,035 --> 00:36:33,003
God alone saitjusqu' when.

378
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:34,766
- And lejournal?

379
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:37,097
- Do not be afraid.

380
00:36:37,275 --> 00:36:40,676
Lejournal can survive without
us for a while.

381
00:36:41,513 --> 00:36:44,539
- But ideas survive if someone
is there to defend them!

382
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:46,513
- Exactly, Rafqa.

383
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:49,177
Exactly.

384
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:58,051
(Barking)

385
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:03,394
- There are only two orphanages
in the region.

386
00:37:03,535 --> 00:37:05,400
I will join you soon.

387
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,731
- You will not go there now!

388
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:11,905
Had promised to Grandma
to finish your studies.

389
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:13,600
- You heard your father.

390
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:16,771
It's going to explode across the country
if they attack the camps.

391
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:19,249
The study is finished.

392
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:21,741
(Sigh)

393
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:25,582
I think of him every day.

394
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:27,418
That's my child.

395
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:28,548
(Sigh)

396
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,389
I want to find him alive.

397
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,597
(Sigh)

398
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:40,936
(Arabic)

399
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:48,335
(Horn)

400
00:37:51,516 --> 00:37:53,984
(Arabic): I'm going to fetch
water from Shadia.

401
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:56,416
- Hurry, Nawal.

402
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:00,513

406
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:57,570
- Your name?
- Nawal.

407
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:00,074
- Nawal what?
- Nawal Marwan.

408
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:02,072
- Where are you?

409
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,447
- South.

410
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:04,603
- Why?

411
00:40:05,383 --> 00:40:07,112
- To meet my husband.

412
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,770

415
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:30,559
Wahab.

416

(Cries of children)

417
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:49,469
(Arabic)

418
00:42:57,255 --> 00:42:59,655
You still have only daughters?

419
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:03,091
- The boys are in Kfar
Kout past three years.

420
00:43:05,563 --> 00:43:08,726
You should go with us.
Kfar Kout was attacked
yesterday.

421
00:43:11,502 --> 00:43:13,493
(Panting)

422
00:44:00,184 --> 00:44:02,175

(Buzzing Fly)

424
00:44:38,723 --> 00:44:42,215
- Looking for the orphanage.
You know where is it?

425
00:44:42,927 --> 00:44:43,859
- There.

426
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:47,764
- Children?
Where are the children?

427
00:44:48,766 --> 00:44:51,098
- Should speak to those
who were there.

428
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:56,672
Muslim villagers fled
to the camp Deressa.

429
00:44:57,174 --> 00:44:59,768
They fear reprisals will come.

430
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:03,339
Children may be with them.

431
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:11,451
Chamseddine and his men killed all the
Christians to avenge the refugees.

432
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:17,288
Children are perhaps Deressa.

433
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,621

I am a Christian.

My daughter! My daughter!

459
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,487
I am in the village of Mama,

460
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:43,422
it then I wish you were here.

461
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:44,459
Listen.

469
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:53,151
Suha?

470
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,669
- Ahmed love you!
Ahmed loves you!

471
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:07,101

472
00:56:09,846 --> 00:56:10,835
- Hello.

473
00:56:11,348 --> 00:56:12,406
Can I help you?

474
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,387

00:58:21,011 --> 00:58:24,242
Uh ...
My mother's name
is Nawal Marwan.

508
00:58:24,381 --> 00:58:25,905
(Arabic)

509
00:58:26,049 --> 00:58:27,209
She was born here.

510
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,011
(Arabic)

511
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:36,715
- We do not know.

512
00:58:37,894 --> 00:58:39,418
- But if known.

513
00:58:42,666 --> 00:58:44,657
(Shouts in Arabic)

514
00:58:45,769 --> 00:58:49,000
- Her mother is a disgrace.

515
00:58:57,714 --> 00:59:00,046
(Arabic)

516
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:06,883
- Marwan's family was
struck with shame.

517
00:59:07,023 --> 00:59:09,014
The war came.

518
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:16,296
- Uh, I'm looking Wahab.

519
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:17,923
(Arabic)

520
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,038
- She does not know Wahab.

521
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:31,042
- I can not help you.
Sorry, I'm tired.

522
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:33,405
(Arabic)

523
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:44,083
- If you're the girl
Nawal Marwan,

524
00:59:45,262 --> 00:59:48,288
you're not welcome here.

525
00:59:48,431 --> 00:59:49,921
Go home.

526
00:59:54,471 --> 00:59:56,336
(Arabic): Looking
for your father,

527
00:59:56,506 --> 00:59:59,304
but you do not know
who is your mother.

528
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:17,516
(Explosions in the distance)

529
01:00:29,472 --> 01:00:30,962
(Shots)

530
01:00:53,163 --> 01:00:54,653
(Blast Off)

531
01:01:24,194 --> 01:01:26,185
(Explosions and gunfire)

532
01:02:06,569 --> 01:02:09,561
(A woman sings in
foreign language)

533
01:02:33,263 --> 01:02:36,391
- I arrived at the end of the massacre
in the refugee camp of Deressa.

534
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:39,768
Everything was burning.

535
01:02:41,638 --> 01:02:44,471
I looked for my son amid
waves of blood.

536
01:02:45,108 --> 01:02:49,306
I do not want this console
quej'ai seen and heard.

537
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:52,743
- You say to be against
our enemy.

538
01:02:53,483 --> 01:02:56,680
It does not make you our friend.

539
01:02:58,188 --> 01:03:00,748
Chamseddine Why would
he trust you?

540
01:03:02,025 --> 01:03:04,323
- The father of my son was
a refugee from Deressa.

541
01:03:04,494 --> 01:03:06,462
My son has been swallowed
by the war.

542
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:10,124
I have nothing to lose.

543
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:15,027
My hatred is great toward
the Nationalists.

544
01:03:16,172 --> 01:03:19,471
- This is not what you wrote
in the journal Charbel.

545
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:25,037
- My uncle thought Charbel encourage
peace with words and books.

546
01:03:26,616 --> 01:03:28,174
I believed.

547
01:03:30,687 --> 01:03:32,518
Life has taught me
something else.

548
01:03:35,325 --> 01:03:37,122
- What do you do now?

549
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:43,358
- Teach to the enemy what
life has taught me.

550
01:04:18,768 --> 01:04:20,759
(Arabic)

551
01:04:27,277 --> 01:04:29,268
(Chirping birds)

552
01:04:32,048 --> 01:04:33,538
(Sigh)

553
01:04:37,387 --> 01:04:39,548
- Okay. Very good.

554
01:04:39,722 --> 01:04:42,555
You've just forgotten it. There.

555
01:04:45,562 --> 01:04:47,291
(Twitter and bird chirps)

556
01:04:47,463 --> 01:04:49,260
(Arabic): So the French?

557
01:04:50,733 --> 01:04:53,395
- I ... I am much better, Dad.

558
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:55,037
- They say''a lot''or''best''

559
01:04:55,138 --> 01:04:57,868
but never both at the same
time, my darling.

560
01:05:00,743 --> 01:05:03,541
(Arabic): I want my son speaks
several languages.

561
01:05:03,713 --> 01:05:06,580
I want him to understand the other
without an intermediary.

562
01:05:18,094 --> 01:05:19,584
(Phone)

563
01:05:33,009 --> 01:05:35,671
- How are you, Nawal?
It Nouchine.

564
01:05:36,846 --> 01:05:40,179
- Good evening, Nouchine.
How's your mother?

565
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:44,150
- My mother is going very well.
10 o'clock tomorrow.

566
01:05:46,256 --> 01:05:47,951
- Tomorrow.

567
01:06:12,482 --> 01:06:13,972
(Sigh)

568
01:06:37,507 --> 01:06:38,997
Marhaba.

569
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,250
(Chirping birds)

570
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,158
- Hello, beautiful.

571
01:07:05,335 --> 01:07:06,427
- Good morning.

572
01:07:06,869 --> 01:07:08,598
- Then you go out
with nousjeudi?

573
01:07:08,771 --> 01:07:09,760
- No.

574
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,372
- Friday?

575
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:12,599
- No.

576
01:07:12,775 --> 01:07:13,707
- Saturday?

577
01:07:13,876 --> 01:07:15,173
- No.

578
01:07:16,746 --> 01:07:18,873
- We are patient, we!

579
01:07:19,082 --> 01:07:20,515
- Me too.

580
01:07:22,285 --> 01:07:23,775
(Laughter guards)

581
01:07:29,225 --> 01:07:30,715
(Sigh)

582
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:35,397
Never forget:

583
01:07:35,565 --> 01:07:37,556
''Always''is always''S''.

584
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,821
(Arabic)

585
01:08:27,116 --> 01:08:30,108
(Panting)

586
01:08:30,286 --> 01:08:32,277
(Shouts in Arabic)

587
01:08:39,762 --> 01:08:40,751
- Bitch.

588
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:59,470
(Breath jerky)

589
01:09:06,722 --> 01:09:08,121
(Blast Off)

590
01:09:08,224 --> 01:09:09,714
(Panting)

591
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:25,894
- The prison of Kfar
Ryat was sentenced

592
01:10:26,068 --> 01:10:28,935
several reports by Amnesty
International.

593
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,548
Here is the women's section.

594
01:10:41,117 --> 01:10:42,778
The cells are larger.

595
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:46,082
Some prisoners remained
there until 15.

596
01:10:55,598 --> 01:10:58,931
- It has existed since when?
- At the time of the killings.

597
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:00,899
Just after the war began.

598
01:11:01,003 --> 01:11:03,733
They have 600 political
prisoners jailed.

599
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:07,806
You can come in, eh?

600
01:11:07,944 --> 01:11:09,468
I'll take a picture.

601
01:11:21,457 --> 01:11:23,186
- You know this woman?

602
01:11:24,126 --> 01:11:25,093
- No.

603
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:27,424
- It was taken here.

604
01:11:29,332 --> 01:11:30,356
- I do not know.

605
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:32,660
It's really long, you know?
Me ...

606
01:11:32,802 --> 01:11:35,771
- Maybe you know someone
who worked here.

607
01:11:37,573 --> 01:11:39,302
(Chirping of insects)

608
01:11:39,508 --> 01:11:40,998
(Arabic)

609
01:11:57,159 --> 01:11:59,150
(Chirping birds)

610
01:12:15,745 --> 01:12:16,973
(Arabic): Hello.

611
01:12:24,186 --> 01:12:25,380
- Hello.

612
01:12:28,758 --> 01:12:31,192
- Looking Harrsa Fahim.

613
01:12:34,864 --> 01:12:37,856
- I am a school janitor.

614
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,900
- Yes, but before?

615
01:12:40,036 --> 01:12:42,436
- Before, hum!

616
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:45,438
That was before I was
school janitor.

617
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:48,873
It's been a long time I'm
caretaker of the school.

618
01:12:51,113 --> 01:12:53,047
- You know this woman?

619
01:12:53,215 --> 01:12:54,842
She was in Kfar Ryat.

620
01:12:57,787 --> 01:13:01,052
- I am a school janitor.
Bess! That's it.

621
01:13:01,223 --> 01:13:02,554
(Deep breath)

622
01:13:04,126 --> 01:13:06,253
- I am looking for someone
who knew her.

623
01:13:06,395 --> 01:13:08,863
Someone who could
tell me about it.

624
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,867
This is my mother.

625
01:13:16,072 --> 01:13:18,939
- This is the woman who sings.

626
01:13:19,075 --> 01:13:20,201
Number 72.

627
01:13:22,378 --> 01:13:24,812
It was she who murdered
militia leader

628
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:26,414
the Christian Right.

629
01:13:27,616 --> 01:13:29,777
They made him pay dearly.

630
01:13:29,919 --> 01:13:32,752
Very, very expensive.
Fifteen years.

631
01:13:32,888 --> 01:13:35,083
(Arabic)

632
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,660
It was called the
Woman who sings

633
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:41,956
because she sings all the time.

634
01:13:43,065 --> 01:13:45,090
- Han, you are sure it is?

635
01:13:46,168 --> 01:13:49,001
- I spent 13 years
at the monitor.

636
01:13:49,138 --> 01:13:50,730
(Arabic)

637
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,607
You've already spent 13 years
overseeing someone, you?

638
01:13:56,612 --> 01:13:58,443
(Sigh)

639
01:13:58,581 --> 01:14:01,141
They did everything
to make it bend.

640
01:14:02,785 --> 01:14:06,846
In the end, it was
still standing,

641
01:14:06,989 --> 01:14:09,082
She looked ...

642
01:14:10,126 --> 01:14:11,957
Ah! Never seen it.

643
01:14:12,128 --> 01:14:14,460
She never bent.

644
01:14:14,597 --> 01:14:17,430
It was infuriating.

645
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:20,624
(Inspiration)

646
01:14:20,803 --> 01:14:22,668
(Arabic)

647
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,302
And he sent Abu Tarek.

648
01:14:27,476 --> 01:14:28,465
- Who's that?

649
01:14:29,812 --> 01:14:31,302
(Chirping birds)

650
01:14:38,554 --> 01:14:40,681
- Tarek Abou ...

651
01:14:40,823 --> 01:14:41,790
(Sigh)

652
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:45,383
You know, sometimes it
is better perhaps

653
01:14:45,528 --> 01:14:48,053
do not know everything.

654
01:14:48,197 --> 01:14:50,165
- Sir, I live with anyway.

655
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:52,657
Continue.

656
01:14:54,203 --> 01:14:55,397
- Tarek Abou ...

657
01:14:55,538 --> 01:14:56,698
(Sigh)

658
01:14:56,839 --> 01:15:00,331
Abu Tarek was a specialist
in torture.

659
01:15:00,509 --> 01:15:02,670
He raped her repeatedly

660
01:15:02,845 --> 01:15:05,746
to break it before it emerges,

661
01:15:05,881 --> 01:15:08,679
for she stops singing.

662
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:15,850
For strength, she
became pregnant.

663
01:15:17,426 --> 01:15:19,360
It was like that.

664
01:15:19,528 --> 01:15:21,689
Never forget.

665
01:15:21,864 --> 01:15:25,322
72 pregnant by Abu Tarek.

666
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:28,863
They waited ...

667
01:15:29,004 --> 01:15:31,495
she gives birth in prison

668
01:15:31,607 --> 01:15:34,576
then they let her go.

669
01:15:35,845 --> 01:15:37,745
(Sigh)

670
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,678
- The child?
Did you see the child?

671
01:15:42,885 --> 01:15:46,286
- There was a doctor
who sometimes came.

672
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:49,382
I think it's crazy.

673
01:15:49,558 --> 01:15:52,891
Others say he has a restaurant
in Tel Aviv ...

674
01:15:53,062 --> 01:15:55,030
(Arabic)

675
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:56,563
That's bullshit.

676
01:15:56,699 --> 01:15:59,395
He went mad when he died.

677
01:15:59,568 --> 01:16:02,935
The nurse her, I know.

678
01:16:03,072 --> 01:16:05,233
She lives in Daresh.

679
01:16:08,277 --> 01:16:09,767
- At Daresh.

680
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:19,819
Listen, Simon, Calisse!

681
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:23,152
I Calisse, there, shut up, OK?
Shut your mouth!

682
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,783
Mom, she was in prison.
Simon, mom, she ...

683
01:16:25,928 --> 01:16:26,917
(Sobs)

684
01:16:27,062 --> 01:16:28,927
Mom, she was raped.

685
01:16:30,432 --> 01:16:32,491
Our brother, she was in prison.

686
01:16:34,303 --> 01:16:36,168
I need you there.

687
01:16:52,955 --> 01:16:55,321
(Voice of a man who
spoke in Arabic)

(Sings Radiohead Like

696
01:19:35,451 --> 01:19:38,784
- It, Simon, it contracts
the notary Amyotte

697
01:19:38,954 --> 01:19:39,943
from 1868 to 1892.

698
01:19:40,089 --> 01:19:43,422
His son took over, Edward,
until 1925.

699
01:19:43,525 --> 01:19:45,857
All contracts written by hand.

700
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:48,758
My grandfather, Charles,
my father, Henry.

701
01:19:48,864 --> 01:19:50,331
And me.

702
01:19:50,466 --> 01:19:53,162
Yeah, well, it stops there
because as you know,

703
01:19:53,302 --> 01:19:54,667
I am the last of the Lebel.

704
01:19:54,803 --> 01:19:57,203
I'll show you the
will of a man ...

705
01:19:57,339 --> 01:19:58,328
(Sigh)

706
01:20:00,142 --> 01:20:01,973
... which took several lives.

707
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:06,179
His heirs have discovered

708
01:20:06,315 --> 01:20:08,146
he had three wives
at the same time.

709
01:20:08,283 --> 01:20:09,307
One here, one in Miami,

710
01:20:09,485 --> 01:20:12,147
and another in Honduras,
where he did business.

711
01:20:13,555 --> 01:20:17,389
There, there ...
you've lost three children
in the file there.

712
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:18,493
There are eight.

713
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:20,855
That is sport, my man.

714
01:20:22,664 --> 01:20:24,529
Look. Hum!

715
01:20:26,568 --> 01:20:29,059
Death is never the
end of a story.

716
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:30,899
There are still traces.

717
01:20:33,342 --> 01:20:35,071
If you want to find
your brother,

718
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:37,644
he will have to go back into
the past of your mother.

719
01:20:37,746 --> 01:20:40,340
- John, I'll fetch my
sister, that's all.

720
01:20:40,482 --> 01:20:41,414
- I mind that.

721
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:43,745
Two, three small business
to take care,

722
01:20:43,886 --> 01:20:45,353
then it will take no time.

723
01:20:45,521 --> 01:20:47,250
Well, prepare your business

724
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:48,651
we should go in ...

725
01:20:48,757 --> 01:20:50,657
My passport ...

726
01:20:50,759 --> 01:20:54,195
-''We''?
Do not you worry that you already
done enough like this?

727
01:20:54,329 --> 01:20:57,526
- Exactly, that's not the
time to let you down.

728
01:20:59,501 --> 01:21:01,196
Am a man of you, Simon.

729
01:21:01,336 --> 01:21:03,531
I know that you need me.

730
01:21:06,341 --> 01:21:07,933
- We'll get it, then come back.

731
01:21:08,076 --> 01:21:09,441
- Promised.

732
01:21:09,578 --> 01:21:11,603
Then, promise, Mr. Marwan,

733
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:14,910
a notary is on the order
of the sacred.

734
01:21:23,725 --> 01:21:25,215
(Breathing hard)

735
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:31,889
(Inaudible)

736
01:21:33,936 --> 01:21:35,426
(Rail)

737
01:21:38,707 --> 01:21:40,197
(Inaudible)

738
01:22:40,502 --> 01:22:42,493
(Singing in Arabic)

739
01:24:10,892 --> 01:24:13,019
(Arabic): Sing now.

740
01:24:13,895 --> 01:24:15,385
(Panting)

741
01:24:36,752 --> 01:24:38,743
(Sobs)

742
01:24:43,592 --> 01:24:45,082
(Cree)

743
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:56,260
(Arabic)

744
01:25:07,682 --> 01:25:09,172

(Shout)

747
01:25:19,828 --> 01:25:22,194
- Gently, gently.

748
01:25:24,332 --> 01:25:25,697
He leaves.

749
01:25:26,101 --> 01:25:27,500
We see the head.

750
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:29,034
Grows.

751
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:31,263
Go, girl.

752
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,631
(Cree and effort)

753
01:25:37,512 --> 01:25:39,002
(Sigh)

754
01:25:39,614 --> 01:25:41,206
The first came out.

755
01:25:42,651 --> 01:25:44,346
(Groans)

756
01:25:47,656 --> 01:25:49,146
(Wail)

757
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:05,401
Rest now ...

758
01:26:06,508 --> 01:26:07,873
I'm proud of you.

759
01:26:09,811 --> 01:26:11,836
Get ready for the second.

760
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:13,345
(Chirps)

761
01:26:29,931 --> 01:26:31,421
(Runoff)

762
01:26:41,276 --> 01:26:42,538
Stop.

763
01:26:42,777 --> 01:26:44,108
Donne.

764
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,212
- What are you doing?

765
01:26:46,548 --> 01:26:48,778
- Thou asjets in the
river as usual.

766
01:26:50,585 --> 01:26:51,882
- It's dangerous.
- No.

767
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:55,956
You've done your duty.:
Thou asjets in river.

768
01:26:56,124 --> 01:26:57,751
I want to take care of them.

769
01:26:58,226 --> 01:27:00,786
These are the children of
the woman who sings.

770
01:27:20,782 --> 01:27:23,910
- Oh, this country is a war
zone to another, eh!

771
01:27:24,085 --> 01:27:25,143
It's not complicated.

772
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:27,778
If the notary had existed
at the time of Noah,

773
01:27:27,923 --> 01:27:29,083
we would not be there.

774
01:27:29,224 --> 01:27:31,988
We need only find the
original contracts.

775
01:27:32,127 --> 01:27:35,756
That's up to you, that's up to you.
And a right of passage there.

776
01:27:35,897 --> 01:27:36,886
And we do talk more.

777
01:27:36,998 --> 01:27:38,431
Everyone would be happy.

778
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:41,398
- The Notary has existed
only 1000 years, Simon.

779
01:27:41,503 --> 01:27:43,164
- That's the problem.

780
01:27:43,305 --> 01:27:45,432
It should have been
there at first.

781
01:27:45,574 --> 01:27:48,304
- Thank you again for your
help, Me Maddadi.

782
01:27:48,443 --> 01:27:50,968
- The pleasure is all
mine, my dear fellow.

783
01:27:51,112 --> 01:27:52,773
I search result

784
01:27:52,914 --> 01:27:54,848
that you have requested
via email.

785
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:57,611
Simon is my towel on
the seat beside you.

786
01:27:57,752 --> 01:28:00,585
Could you give it to
me Lebel, please?

787
01:28:00,689 --> 01:28:03,624
- You are very nice, but the
lag and everything ...

788
01:28:03,758 --> 01:28:06,022
I think I'll wait until later.

789
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:07,355
- But I'll summarize.

790
01:28:07,495 --> 01:28:09,122
For the father, it is
rather difficult

791
01:28:09,297 --> 01:28:11,197
because I can not find
the death certificate.

792
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:12,300
For Brother ...

793
01:28:12,434 --> 01:28:14,299
- Excuse me, but what
are we talking here?

794
01:28:14,469 --> 01:28:16,130
- I asked for help, Simon.

795
01:28:16,304 --> 01:28:19,034
Maddadi me kindly give us a hand

796
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:20,505
to speed things up.

797
01:28:20,642 --> 01:28:23,941
- I told you, John,
we came for Jeanne.

798
01:28:25,313 --> 01:28:27,975
- Your sister is the person
in your family

799
01:28:28,149 --> 01:28:29,548
easiest to find.

800
01:28:32,287 --> 01:28:34,482
(Deep breath)

801
01:28:36,725 --> 01:28:39,193
- I'm so glad you're here.

802
01:28:39,327 --> 01:28:41,488
- Me too.

803
01:28:43,665 --> 01:28:45,155
(Sigh)

804
01:28:48,036 --> 01:28:50,004
- OK, that's the name
of the nurse

805
01:28:50,171 --> 01:28:52,002
which helped to give birth
mother in prison.

806
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:53,698
We can go today.

807
01:28:54,709 --> 01:28:57,007
- Jeanne, that's enough.

808
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,848
- Here, you shut up,
then you follow me.

809
01:29:01,016 --> 01:29:03,917
It's your job to find our
brother is not mine!

810
01:29:04,052 --> 01:29:06,350
Then, if you do not
for her or for you,

811
01:29:06,521 --> 01:29:08,216
ben crunches, do it for me!

812
01:29:14,396 --> 01:29:16,193
It is at the American hospital.

813
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:20,691
(Door)

814
01:29:22,337 --> 01:29:24,100
I'm glad you're here, John.

815
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:26,173
- Me too, my owl, too.

816
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:29,540
- If she sleeps, he must return.

817
01:29:53,968 --> 01:29:55,458
Ms. Maika?

818
01:29:57,939 --> 01:29:59,429
(Arabic)

819
01:30:24,226 --> 01:30:27,389
- ...
Lebel, Joan Marwan,
Marwan Simon.

820
01:30:27,563 --> 01:30:28,928
- Bonjour, Madame!

821
01:30:29,064 --> 01:30:30,554
Thank you for having us.

822
01:30:30,732 --> 01:30:33,565
We seek someone you know.

823
01:30:33,702 --> 01:30:35,932
Nawal Marwan you know?

824
01:30:36,071 --> 01:30:38,062
(Arabic)

825
01:30:52,621 --> 01:30:54,486
(Panting)

826
01:31:04,099 --> 01:31:06,966
You worked in the prison
of Kfar Ryat as a nurse?

827
01:31:07,102 --> 01:31:09,093
(Arabic)

828
01:31:17,112 --> 01:31:19,103
(Sobs)

829
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:23,748
- She says she knows your mom.

830
01:31:24,953 --> 01:31:27,183
- You helped our mother to
give birth in prison?

831
01:31:27,322 --> 01:31:29,313
(Arabic)

832
01:31:31,793 --> 01:31:33,124
- Yes.

833
01:31:33,295 --> 01:31:35,286
(Arabic)

834
01:31:39,768 --> 01:31:43,465
- Madame, the child seeks Nawal
Marwan was in prison.

835
01:31:43,639 --> 01:31:45,038
Can you help us?

836
01:31:47,142 --> 01:31:48,541
(Arabic)

837
01:31:48,677 --> 01:31:52,010
- She worked in the prison
of Kfar Ryat.

838
01:31:53,148 --> 01:31:55,708
She accompanied her
during childbirth.

839
01:31:57,152 --> 01:31:59,143
She gathered the children.

840
01:32:05,961 --> 01:32:08,623
Then she was given back
to the woman who sings

841
01:32:08,730 --> 01:32:10,664
when leaving prison.

842
01:32:11,867 --> 01:32:13,994
Nawal Marwan gave
birth to twins.

843
01:32:16,905 --> 01:32:18,372
Hush, hush, hush.

844
01:32:20,475 --> 01:32:22,340
Hush, hush, hush.

845
01:32:46,201 --> 01:32:47,668
(Deep breath)

846
01:33:00,382 --> 01:33:02,373
(Panting)

847
01:34:00,075 --> 01:34:00,208
(Panting)

848
01:34:00,208 --> 01:34:01,436
(Panting)

849
01:34:01,576 --> 01:34:03,567
(Chirping birds)

850
01:34:13,255 --> 01:34:15,246
(Arabic)

851
01:34:31,206 --> 01:34:33,197
(Panting)

852
01:34:41,149 --> 01:34:42,810
(Arabic)

853
01:35:11,913 --> 01:35:13,813
(Gunshot)

854
01:35:20,322 --> 01:35:22,313
(Arabic)

855
01:35:59,227 --> 01:36:00,558
(Gunshot)

856
01:36:11,406 --> 01:36:14,398
(Call to prayer)

857
01:36:17,145 --> 01:36:19,136
(Klaxons)

858
01:36:28,924 --> 01:36:31,586
- You really know the
woman who sings?

859
01:36:31,726 --> 01:36:34,752
You do not know what
it means to me.

860
01:36:35,931 --> 01:36:37,899
- Nawal Marwan worked for me

861
01:36:37,999 --> 01:36:39,591
for 18 years as secretary.

862
01:36:39,734 --> 01:36:41,964
My wife and I, we had
taken a liking

863
01:36:42,103 --> 01:36:43,593
for herself and her children.

864
01:36:44,606 --> 01:36:45,937
But I confess that I find

865
01:36:46,107 --> 01:36:48,598
I knew it not really the end.

866
01:36:48,743 --> 01:36:50,267
(Sigh)

867
01:36:51,279 --> 01:36:53,440
Ready?
- Ready.

868
01:37:05,493 --> 01:37:06,983
- Hmm ...

869
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:11,121
I Maddadi conducted research
at my request

870
01:37:11,299 --> 01:37:14,462
to find traces of your brother
and your father.

871
01:37:19,975 --> 01:37:21,602
- For the father, Abu Tarek,

872
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:24,474
I still have not found
a death certificate.

873
01:37:24,646 --> 01:37:26,773
The country has a lot missing.

874
01:37:26,881 --> 01:37:29,111
It may be moved abroad.

875
01:37:29,217 --> 01:37:32,516
That's what happened with
this kind of characters.

876
01:37:32,654 --> 01:37:34,053
They are dead or gone.

877
01:37:34,189 --> 01:37:35,315
You have to see.

878
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:37,651
- Maybe it's better that way.

879
01:37:38,693 --> 01:37:41,059
- For the brother ...

880
01:37:41,196 --> 01:37:43,494
your client, Ms. Nawal Marwan,

881
01:37:43,631 --> 01:37:45,496
comes from the village
of Der Om.

882
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:49,899
She handed the child to a midwife
who is named Elham

883
01:37:50,038 --> 01:37:53,838
who herself has returned to
the orphanage in Kfar Kout

884
01:37:54,009 --> 01:37:56,341
in May 1970.

885
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:00,546
The main work was to
trace the records.

886
01:38:00,682 --> 01:38:03,242
Many documents have been
lost in the war.

887
01:38:04,252 --> 01:38:06,846
But I found the records

888
01:38:06,988 --> 01:38:09,252
which were recovered and given

889
01:38:09,391 --> 01:38:13,521
by the Sisters of Charity
at the National Archives.

890
01:38:13,661 --> 01:38:17,358
In May 1970, the midwife
Der Om, Elham

891
01:38:17,532 --> 01:38:20,365
file a male child for adoption.

892
01:38:20,502 --> 01:38:25,166
This is the only boy in the
orphanage filed this month.

893
01:38:25,273 --> 01:38:26,604
Look.

894
01:38:26,741 --> 01:38:29,904
It was registered under
the name Nihad.

895
01:38:31,746 --> 01:38:33,873
Dates match.

896
01:38:34,015 --> 01:38:35,505
That's him.

897
01:38:36,518 --> 01:38:39,681
- Ha! It's your brother! Nihad.

898
01:38:40,722 --> 01:38:42,212
(Sigh)

899
01:38:43,224 --> 01:38:45,215
- Orphanage Kfar Kout,

900
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:46,418
Nihad May.

901
01:38:46,561 --> 01:38:49,621
It is his name for the records.

902
01:38:49,764 --> 01:38:50,958
Nihad month of May.

903
01:38:51,099 --> 01:38:53,533
It gave a temporary name

904
01:38:53,635 --> 01:38:54,966
with the month of arrival.

905
01:38:55,103 --> 01:38:58,129
There was no adoption
during this period.

906
01:38:58,273 --> 01:39:00,070
It was the beginning of the war.

907
01:39:00,241 --> 01:39:02,971
The orphanage was destroyed
four years later.

908
01:39:04,245 --> 01:39:06,907
We must ask that destroyed
the orphanage in Kfar Kout

909
01:39:07,048 --> 01:39:09,915
to know what happened
with the children.

910
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:15,583
Between you and me, with what
happened in the region ...

911
01:39:16,591 --> 01:39:18,081
there is not much hope.

912
01:39:19,561 --> 01:39:21,586
- It is probably also dead.

913
01:39:21,729 --> 01:39:23,788
- I'm not saying he is dead.

914
01:39:23,932 --> 01:39:26,059
I say we lost track of him.

915
01:39:27,769 --> 01:39:29,600
- They are both dead.

916
01:39:29,737 --> 01:39:32,171
We open the envelopes,
then that's it.

917
01:39:32,307 --> 01:39:34,138
- That I will not, Simon.

918
01:39:34,275 --> 01:39:36,106
This kind of thing is sacred.

919
01:39:37,112 --> 01:39:39,774
(Me Maddadi): This commit rape.

920
01:39:39,948 --> 01:39:42,143
- Luckily, I have a history.

921
01:39:44,853 --> 01:39:46,946
Excuse me.

922
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:50,683
- We still worth exploring.

923
01:39:50,825 --> 01:39:54,090
But it is a little radical.

924
01:39:55,130 --> 01:39:56,097
Warlord

925
01:39:56,197 --> 01:39:58,825
which demolished the orphanage
at that time still alive.

926
01:39:58,967 --> 01:40:01,026
And he may know what happened

927
01:40:01,169 --> 01:40:03,364
Nihad these children belonged.

928
01:40:03,505 --> 01:40:04,699
- It's been an eternity.

929
01:40:04,839 --> 01:40:06,500
- You must understand

930
01:40:06,641 --> 01:40:09,838
that this period is a
series of reprisals

931
01:40:09,978 --> 01:40:13,505
which fit one another in
an inexorable logic,

932
01:40:13,648 --> 01:40:15,138
as additions.

933
01:40:17,485 --> 01:40:19,453
A warlord is exactly

934
01:40:19,554 --> 01:40:21,715
the type of man who
has a long memory.

935
01:40:21,856 --> 01:40:24,188
And he remembers it, believe me.

936
01:40:25,627 --> 01:40:27,458
Wallat Chamseddine,

937
01:40:27,562 --> 01:40:28,995
is his name.

938
01:40:33,301 --> 01:40:34,666
- It is found where it?

939
01:40:34,802 --> 01:40:37,794
- We find it. He finds you.

940
01:40:40,675 --> 01:40:42,700
But we can try something.

941
01:40:44,546 --> 01:40:47,208
Do you like tea, Mr. Marwan?

942
01:40:51,219 --> 01:40:53,187
- It's your turn.

943
01:40:53,321 --> 01:40:55,585
(Klaxons off)

944
01:40:56,658 --> 01:40:58,387
(Me Maddadi): You will go

945
01:40:58,526 --> 01:41:00,517
in the refugee camp Deressa.

946
01:41:00,695 --> 01:41:02,162
You will come to tea

947
01:41:02,263 --> 01:41:03,525
anywhere in the camp

948
01:41:03,698 --> 01:41:05,563
with the person you invite.

949
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:08,692
And you say you are the son
of the woman who sings

950
01:41:08,836 --> 01:41:10,701
and are looking Nihad May.

951
01:41:10,872 --> 01:41:12,999
You can not go there alone.

952
01:41:14,275 --> 01:41:16,368
I'll find someone

953
01:41:16,511 --> 01:41:18,035
to accompany you.

954
01:41:40,134 --> 01:41:41,897
- Welcome to Deressa.

955
01:41:45,573 --> 01:41:48,064
(Chirping birds and hubbub)

956
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,971
(Arabic)

957
01:42:50,471 --> 01:42:52,302
- Ha!
Ha! You know where you
are going, Simon?

958
01:42:52,473 --> 01:42:53,872
- I know.

959
01:43:00,948 --> 01:43:02,939
(Arabic)

960
01:43:17,699 --> 01:43:19,690
(Kisses)

961
01:43:20,234 --> 01:43:21,462
(Arabic): How are you?

962
01:43:22,804 --> 01:43:24,294
- Name of God, you've grown!

963
01:43:24,472 --> 01:43:27,236
- I finished my e
gineering studies.

964
01:43:27,408 --> 01:43:32,038
I do not find work, alorsje
am the taxi driver.

965
01:43:32,213 --> 01:43:34,238
- What brings you here?

966
01:43:34,415 --> 01:43:39,478
- I am with foreign visitors, who
asked me to bring them here.

967
01:43:41,356 --> 01:43:43,221
- Welcome, come.

968
01:43:43,391 --> 01:43:45,723
- No, thank you, you're
in a hurry.

969
01:43:45,893 --> 01:43:47,724
- Please, come.

970
01:43:53,034 --> 01:43:55,764
- He invites us to tea.

971
01:43:55,903 --> 01:43:57,029
- Oh, good!

972
01:44:05,346 --> 01:44:07,337
(Drone of aircraft)

973
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:14,119
(Arabic)

974
01:44:14,255 --> 01:44:18,089
- Uh, I wonder why you
come to Deressa.

975
01:44:21,229 --> 01:44:23,720
- I am looking for someone
named Nihad May.

976
01:44:23,898 --> 01:44:25,889
(Arabic)

977
01:44:33,074 --> 01:44:36,066
- He does not know Nihad May.

978
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:39,407
He asks me what are your names.

979
01:44:46,754 --> 01:44:49,587
- My mother comes from the village
of Der Om, in the South.

980
01:44:49,724 --> 01:44:51,885
(Arabic)

981
01:45:02,837 --> 01:45:04,930
My mother is the
woman who sings.

982
01:45:30,331 --> 01:45:32,424
Yes, that's fine. Done.

983
01:45:37,605 --> 01:45:39,163
Wait what?

984
01:46:12,507 --> 01:46:14,475
- Sarwan Marwan?
- Yes.

985
01:46:14,575 --> 01:46:16,907
- We are here to offer help.

986
01:46:17,044 --> 01:46:19,342
You will be back in an hour.

987
01:46:20,581 --> 01:46:22,071
- I can tell my sister?

988
01:46:22,216 --> 01:46:25,242
- No, you come back in
an hour, I promise.

989
01:46:26,721 --> 01:46:29,189
- I put a shirt, a second.

990
01:46:31,993 --> 01:46:33,187
- He will call.

991
01:46:33,561 --> 01:46:34,926
- It's going to go.

992
01:46:35,596 --> 01:46:38,429
- Ever!
Do not worry, you can follow.

993
01:46:38,566 --> 01:46:42,002
Ah, I told you: the South,
a spark and it exploded.

994
01:46:42,203 --> 01:46:43,602
Oh, okay.

995
01:46:49,443 --> 01:46:50,933
(Alarm)

996
01:47:04,191 --> 01:47:06,182
(Chirping birds)

997
01:47:53,975 --> 01:47:55,465
(Sigh)

998
01:47:57,845 --> 01:48:01,110
(Arabic): You have greatly helped
us, we'll help our turn.

999
01:48:02,483 --> 01:48:04,007
You'll leave the country.

1000
01:48:04,185 --> 01:48:05,914
It'll be easier.

1001
01:48:06,087 --> 01:48:08,521
We will find you a
house and a job.

1002
01:48:09,457 --> 01:48:12,449
I want your life to be better.

1003
01:48:14,261 --> 01:48:17,025
We have many contacts
in America.

1004
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:21,028
You gotta go with your children.

1005
01:48:21,636 --> 01:48:24,469
I know they are alive.
Take them with you.

1006
01:48:27,642 --> 01:48:31,305
Children will help
you, you'll see.

1007
01:48:31,479 --> 01:48:32,639
(Swallowing)

1008
01:48:38,119 --> 01:48:41,054
- You can not ask me.

1009
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:45,188
- Your children are our
children, Nawal.

1010
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:47,486
Your family is our family.

1011
01:48:47,995 --> 01:48:49,189
Trust me.

1012
01:48:50,631 --> 01:48:53,566
I'll help you.

1013
01:48:53,734 --> 01:48:57,067
I'm here for you and
your children.

1014
01:49:15,356 --> 01:49:16,846
(Slam latch)

1015
01:49:46,587 --> 01:49:48,077
Hello, Sarwan.

1016
01:49:50,224 --> 01:49:53,887
Excuse my introduction, but
it is for your protection.

1017
01:49:56,063 --> 01:49:58,964
They call me Wallat Chamseddine.

1018
01:50:01,368 --> 01:50:05,702
Tell me, what can I do to
help, Sarwan Marwan?

1019
01:50:07,441 --> 01:50:09,204
- You knew my mother.

1020
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:11,938
- Let it worked for me.

1021
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:15,105
What can I do to help?

1022
01:50:19,086 --> 01:50:22,419
- I am looking for a
man named Nihad May.

1023
01:50:23,457 --> 01:50:25,584
- Why you are looking Nihad May?

1024
01:50:27,595 --> 01:50:28,653
- It's my brother.

1025
01:50:28,796 --> 01:50:31,287
My mother asked me to find him.

1026
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,831
- And how can you say

1027
01:50:34,969 --> 01:50:37,995
Nihad May is the son
of Nawal Marwan?

1028
01:50:40,775 --> 01:50:42,572
- My brother has been
placed for adoption

1029
01:50:42,676 --> 01:50:44,439
orphanage in Kfar Kout.

1030
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:48,749
We found the registry with
the original link.

1031
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:51,411
The dates ... Everything fits.

1032
01:50:51,519 --> 01:50:53,749
Nihad May is my brother.

1033
01:50:57,758 --> 01:50:59,589
(Sigh)

1034
01:51:00,628 --> 01:51:02,118
(Inaudible)

1035
01:51:24,618 --> 01:51:26,108
(Inaudible)

1036
01:51:36,997 --> 01:51:39,056
- Me and my friends, we attacked

1037
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:41,532
Christian village Kfar Kout ...

1038
01:51:42,536 --> 01:51:44,003
In response to attacks

1039
01:51:44,171 --> 01:51:47,004
that our brothers, refugees
were victims.

1040
01:51:48,642 --> 01:51:51,736
There was an orphanage
in Kfar Kout.

1041
01:51:52,813 --> 01:51:54,872
I saved the children.

1042
01:51:55,015 --> 01:51:57,142
I took them with us.

1043
01:51:57,251 --> 01:52:00,152
And Nihad was among them.

1044
01:52:00,254 --> 01:52:02,188
We have trained and prepared

1045
01:52:02,356 --> 01:52:04,551
for they are fighting
alongside us.

1046
01:52:05,759 --> 01:52:08,023
Nihad, he had a gift.

1047
01:52:08,195 --> 01:52:10,686
He was at hand.

1048
01:52:10,865 --> 01:52:14,028
And soon it became a
formidable fencer.

1049
01:52:15,336 --> 01:52:19,864
But he wanted to
find her mother.

1050
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:22,008
He has sought for months.

1051
01:52:23,444 --> 01:52:26,709
Nihad, I do not know what
he saw or heard.

1052
01:52:27,715 --> 01:52:29,205
He became ...

1053
01:52:30,384 --> 01:52:32,716
a crazy war.

1054
01:52:32,887 --> 01:52:36,789
He came to see me, he
wanted to be a martyr

1055
01:52:36,924 --> 01:52:39,392
so that his mother should see
her picture everywhere

1056
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:40,857
on the walls of the country.

1057
01:52:42,096 --> 01:52:43,723
But I refused.

1058
01:52:45,633 --> 01:52:47,624
He went back to Daresh.

1059
01:52:48,702 --> 01:52:50,863
He became a maverick,

1060
01:52:50,971 --> 01:52:53,235
the most dangerous region.

1061
01:52:53,407 --> 01:52:54,601
A real machine.

1062
01:52:54,742 --> 01:52:56,607
He pulls on everyone.

1063
01:52:56,744 --> 01:53:01,147
And then there was the
enemy invasion.

1064
01:53:02,549 --> 01:53:04,039
And one morning ...

1065
01:53:05,052 --> 01:53:06,986
They captured Nihad.

1066
01:53:07,121 --> 01:53:08,918
He killed seven gunmen.

1067
01:53:10,991 --> 01:53:12,754
They have not killed.

1068
01:53:12,893 --> 01:53:14,258
They formed

1069
01:53:14,395 --> 01:53:17,091
and sent to the prison
of Kfar Ryat.

1070
01:53:18,465 --> 01:53:20,160
- It has been in prison?

1071
01:53:20,301 --> 01:53:21,768
- Yes.

1072
01:53:24,138 --> 01:53:25,571
As executioner.

1073
01:53:25,673 --> 01:53:26,662
(Sigh)

1074
01:53:27,741 --> 01:53:29,641
- He worked with my father?

1075
01:53:29,777 --> 01:53:31,745
- No, it did not work

1076
01:53:31,845 --> 01:53:33,779
with Abu Tarek, your father.

1077
01:53:38,786 --> 01:53:40,276
(Uproar distant)

1078
01:53:48,262 --> 01:53:49,627
(Hits at the door)

1079
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:04,277
- Are you okay?

1080
01:54:08,949 --> 01:54:10,439
- One plus one ...

1081
01:54:11,452 --> 01:54:13,317
that makes two.

1082
01:54:13,454 --> 01:54:14,944
- What?

1083
01:54:17,992 --> 01:54:20,051
- One plus one makes two.

1084
01:54:21,061 --> 01:54:22,551
It can not make one.

1085
01:54:29,169 --> 01:54:30,966
- Hey, you have a fever.

1086
01:54:33,374 --> 01:54:34,864
- Jeanne?

1087
01:54:36,744 --> 01:54:39,372
One plus one, does it make one?

1088
01:54:46,153 --> 01:54:47,643
(Inspiration)

1089
01:54:54,161 --> 01:54:55,594
(Sobs)

1090
01:55:01,035 --> 01:55:02,900
- There are empty seats, there.

1091
01:55:03,037 --> 01:55:04,368
- Oh, go ahead if you want.

1092
01:55:30,964 --> 01:55:32,932
(Panting)

1093
01:55:35,702 --> 01:55:38,694
(Men who speak in Arabic)

1094
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:35,526
- Is it can help you, ma'am?

1095
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:45,638
- Excuse me.

1096
01:57:21,375 --> 01:57:22,865
(Sobs)

1097
01:57:56,009 --> 01:57:58,375
(W. Chamseddine): By
becoming a hangman

1098
01:57:58,512 --> 01:58:01,003
your brother has changed
its name.

1099
01:58:01,114 --> 01:58:03,674
He became Abu Tarek.

1100
01:58:06,587 --> 01:58:09,556
Nihad Abu Tarek is from May.

1101
01:58:13,794 --> 01:58:16,262
We know now that he
lives in Canada

1102
01:58:16,396 --> 01:58:18,421
under a new identity.

1103
01:58:18,565 --> 01:58:21,056
Nihad Harmanni.

1104
01:58:43,790 --> 01:58:45,280
(Horn)

1105
01:58:59,573 --> 01:59:01,063
- Mr. Harmanni?

1106
01:59:04,311 --> 01:59:05,278
- Yes?

1107
01:59:05,445 --> 01:59:06,776
(Shout gull)

1108
01:59:12,786 --> 01:59:14,276
- It's for you.

1109
01:59:15,756 --> 01:59:17,747
(Chirping birds)

1110
01:59:36,643 --> 01:59:38,133
(Horn)

1111
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:02,996
(Voice of Nawal): I am
writing trembling.

1112
02:00:03,170 --> 02:00:04,728
I recognized you.

1113
02:00:04,871 --> 02:00:07,499
You have not acknowledged.

1114
02:00:07,674 --> 02:00:09,539
It's a wonderful miracle.

1115
02:00:09,676 --> 02:00:11,337
I'm your number 72.

1116
02:00:11,478 --> 02:00:15,744
This letter will be delivered
by our children.

1117
02:00:15,882 --> 02:00:17,873
You will not recognize them

1118
02:00:18,018 --> 02:00:19,849
because they are beautiful,

1119
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:22,352
but they know who you are.

1120
02:00:24,424 --> 02:00:25,914
(Chirping birds)

1121
02:00:31,031 --> 02:00:33,261
Through them, I want to tell you

1122
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:35,368
you're still alive.

1123
02:00:35,535 --> 02:00:37,526
But soon, you'll be quiet.

1124
02:00:37,704 --> 02:00:39,194
I know.

1125
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:43,202
Because silence is
all to the truth.

1126
02:00:44,211 --> 02:00:47,271
Signed.: The whore 72.

1127
02:01:00,927 --> 02:01:03,589
I spoke to the son.

1128
02:01:03,730 --> 02:01:05,755
I do not talk to
the executioner.

1129
02:01:05,899 --> 02:01:08,868
Whatever happens, I will
always love you.

1130
02:01:08,969 --> 02:01:14,202
That's the promise I made you
at your birth, my son.

1131
02:01:14,307 --> 02:01:17,572
Whatever happens, I will
always love you.

1132
02:01:18,712 --> 02:01:21,112
I've searched my whole life.

1133
02:01:21,248 --> 02:01:23,739
I found you.

1134
02:01:23,884 --> 02:01:27,411
You, you could not recognize me.

1135
02:01:27,587 --> 02:01:30,385
You have your tattoo
on his right heel.

1136
02:01:30,490 --> 02:01:31,889
I've seen.

1137
02:01:31,992 --> 02:01:33,050
I recognized you.

1138
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:34,422
(Panting)

1139
02:01:34,561 --> 02:01:36,995
Etje found you beautiful.

1140
02:01:37,130 --> 02:01:40,497
I'll blow all the sweetness
of the world, my love.

1141
02:01:40,634 --> 02:01:44,126
Console yourself because nothing
is more beautiful

1142
02:01:44,271 --> 02:01:45,932
than being together.

1143
02:01:46,106 --> 02:01:47,767
You were born of love.

1144
02:01:47,908 --> 02:01:52,242
Your brother and your sister
are also born of love.

1145
02:01:53,914 --> 02:01:57,281
Nothing is more beautiful
than to be together.

1146
02:01:57,451 --> 02:02:00,443
Your mother, Nawal Marwan ...

1147
02:02:01,455 --> 02:02:03,821
prisoner number 72.

1148
02:02:07,294 --> 02:02:09,091

(Voice of Nawal): My love ...

1158
02:02:49,669 --> 02:02:51,569
Where does your story?

1159
02:02:52,839 --> 02:02:55,501
In your birth?

1160
02:02:55,675 --> 02:02:57,870
Then she starts in horror.

1161
02:02:58,011 --> 02:02:58,978
(Sigh)

1162
02:02:59,079 --> 02:03:02,207
At the birth of your father?

1163
02:03:02,349 --> 02:03:05,546
Then she begins a
great love story.

1164
02:03:07,587 --> 02:03:11,079
I say that your story
begins with a promise

1165
02:03:11,224 --> 02:03:13,658
that break the thread of anger.

1166
02:03:15,529 --> 02:03:18,862
Thanks to you, today I finally
managed to keep it.

1167
02:03:19,032 --> 02:03:21,000
The wire is broken.

1168

Etje can finally take
the time to rock ...

(Sobs)

1170
02:03:25,405 --> 02:03:27,566
you sing softly a lullaby

1171
