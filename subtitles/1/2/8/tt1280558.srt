1
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,727
I am retiring tomorrow.

2
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:52,128
Over the past few weeks,
many people have asked me...

3
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,632
...that Mr. Prakash Rathod
police commissioner of Mumbai...

4
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:01,412
...that which was the most challenging
and interesting case of your life.

5
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,216
I evaded this question.

6
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:10,186
Every time... but every time
I remembered only one case.

7
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,389
This case is not
registered in any file anywhere.

8
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:21,090
There is no record anywhere.
But it is in my mind and...

9
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:26,104
...in the minds of some people who were
involved in this case unwillingly.

10
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,164
That bastard.

11
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:34,103
That bastard just had guts to walk
into our lives and blow it apart.

12
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,443
It was a Wednesday.

13
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,307
Hello! Where are you going?

14
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,979
To file a FIR.

15
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,749
To the right. Room number 3.

16
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:33,859
Who hit you?
- My wife.

17
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:37,293
I wanted to file an FIR. - Then what
is there to be embarrassed about?

18
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,858
How?
- With a cooker.

19
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,699
I want to file a complaint.

20
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,931
Wait for a while. I will
call you. Have a seat.

21
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,037
Why did she hit you?

22
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,412
The problem was... that...

23
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,974
Come on. Speak up. There
are other people waiting.

24
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,418
I just told her that there
was more salt in the food.

25
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,021
She just flared up.

26
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,749
There was a cooker to her right.

27
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,851
She picked it and
hit me on my left side.

28
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:15,065
Sir please... just warn her once.
She keeps hitting me.

29
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,400
You should never ever say
such things to your wife.

30
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,403
Go home and say sorry.

31
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,336
Or else instead of salt she will
put something else in your food.

32
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,741
Did you understand?

33
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,909
Don't take it too seriously. Go on.

34
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,914
Sir, but file a report at least...
- Get lost!

35
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:39,950
Hey mister, hello...
Mr. Jammu Kashmir please come.

36
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,428
What happened?
- I lost my wallet.

37
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,102
How? What do you mean by how?
How do things get lost?

38
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,680
I mean, where was it lost?
- I don't remember.

39
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,544
When I checked it wasn't with me.

40
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,442
What were its contents?

41
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,979
A photograph of my wife,
driving license. PAN card.

42
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,854
Easy, easy. Sorry.

43
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,759
PAN card, ATM card, and credit card.

44
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:22,864
There was a railway pass.
Some cash. My wife's photograph.

45
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:26,132
You have already said that.
- What?

46
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,669
You have already told me
about your wife's photograph.

47
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:34,137
How much cash was in it?
- Around 300-350 rupees.

48
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,611
Where is the washroom?
- What's your name and address?

49
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:47,058
Rajesh Kumar Sharma.
301, Manasarovar Society.

50
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,884
S.V. Road, Borivali (west).

51
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,493
What's your telephone number?
- 9832465784.

52
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,501
Take this. Call up
tomorrow and enquire.

53
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,641
The washroom is to
the right over there.

54
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,101
Thank you.

55
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,243
Sir, it's always a number from
Karachi that flashes on my mobile.

56
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:19,582
Initially, he used to
address me as brother, sir or boss.

57
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,244
He said his name was Imtiaz.

58
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,888
He said he watches
my films many times...

59
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,084
...and that he was a
great fan of mine.

60
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,522
Then he called today and asked
me to pay up 25 lakh rupees.

61
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,588
Said it was an emergency.

62
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,594
Mr. Arjun Khanna,
what exactly did he say?

63
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,286
Hello!

64
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,887
Idiot, Why aren't you
signing Desai's film?

65
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:10,126
He is my special friend. If I don't
get any good news by noon today.

66
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:14,195
I will pack
- up your shooting forever.

67
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,568
And keep 25 lakh rupees on hand.

68
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,633
I will call you up later and
tell you whom to give it to

69
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,902
25 lakhs!

70
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,640
And why the hell do you
delay so much in taking the call?

71
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,908
Make sure that you pick it up
within two rings the next time.

72
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,725
Hello?
- Just checking.' Hang up now.

73
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,602
Where is Jai?

74
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,205
You know that I don't like your
traveling in the train with the baby

75
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,674
If I go by road I
will reach tomorrow.

76
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,679
Why do you go to your
mom's place so often?

77
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,619
This is the first time
I am going since she was born.

78
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,622
But she'd come to our
house just last week. - So?

79
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,623
She was also there the
week before that. - So?

80
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,622
This should stop... Or
else the sub-inspector in...

81
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,722
...your mom's area is a
good friend of mine.

82
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,762
Why are you so scared of my mom?

83
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,629
Am not scared. Just jealous of her...

84
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,298
...that she spends so much more
time with both of you, than I do.

85
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:26,106
Ok I will take your leave.
Bye. Take care. Bye.

86
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,640
Call me up. - Yes, I will
call up on reaching there.

87
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,384
Okay bye.
- Bye.

88
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,152
See you. Take care.

89
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,161
Just 20 rupees! Where is
your pollution certificate?

90
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,737
Where is your license? Look
you don't have license with you.

91
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,711
Now come on, give me Rs. 500.

92
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,680
Come on sir, take it. Keep it.

93
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:14,750
Hello sir.

94
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,285
What are you doing?

95
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,820
Sir, I have stopped asking.
But they keep bribing me willingly.

96
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,764
Ask him... Wasn't I telling
you not to give me anything?

97
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,392
Sir, what can I do if they
give it with so much love?

98
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,437
Too much of such
love has made you plump.

99
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,369
And you still want some more.
- Sorry sir.

100
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,435
How much did you take?
- 20 rupees!

101
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,433
Give it back!
- Take it.

102
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,875
Give him 20 more.
- What?

103
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,416
You should also share your
love with others. - Okay sir.

104
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,355
Did you just give me money?

105
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,724
Father was right and I was wrong.

106
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,793
Times have changed. The New
Age is here - All right, go on.

107
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:58,462
This is good! This is good!
This is good! This is good!

108
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:19,150
Ready to move in!
Three! Two! One! Go!

109
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,283
Thank you, Deepak.

110
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,754
This is the same
electric pole to which...

111
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,854
...a man had been stuck to for
15 minutes and still survived.

112
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,759
Yes. Shambu fell
down in this pothole...

113
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,428
...while returning
from work last evening.

114
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,870
Because of this live wire
he got stuck to this pole.

115
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,771
And it is a miracle
that he is still alive...

116
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,241
...after suffering
from electric shocks

117
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,335
...of such high voltage
for 15 mins. Consecutively.

118
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:46,917
So let's talk to Shambu
who's been through this.

119
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,514
Mr. Shambu, how do you feel?

120
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:51,881
I feel good.

121
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,783
Tell our viewers how
did you feel when...

122
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,262
...such high voltage shocks
were passing through your body?

123
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,833
Call for technical
snag in ten seconds.

124
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,962
Naina, repeat the question.

125
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,800
Tell us how did you feel when...

126
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:11,536
...high voltage shocks
were passing through you?

127
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,436
Great! I felt very good.

128
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,807
Now people call you
'The Electric man'.

129
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,876
How does that feel?

130
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,889
Very good.
- Cut it!

131
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,551
What is it, now?

132
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,487
We'll do it again in five minutes!

133
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:35,260
Give him something to say.
He seems to like everything.

134
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,163
He gets drunk and falls down.

135
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,835
The other day we
both drank together...

136
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,429
...and we both fell
together in the gutter but...

137
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,407
...nobody cared then. Now look
at him, he has become famous.

138
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,446
Get me out of here.

139
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,215
They beat me up everyday.

140
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:33,221
Two guys came in my cell
yesterday and beat me all over.

141
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,484
You'd said I would be
okay if I turned Informer.

142
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,220
But look what happened?

143
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,628
I was put to rot in here and
you were transferred to the ATS.

144
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,362
Arif, either get me out
of this place or kill me.

145
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,562
But don't leave me here.

146
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,365
My family is threatened everyday.

147
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:54,603
The constable who is supposed to
protect my family harasses my sister.

148
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,976
I have heard that you are going
to get transferred somewhere else?

149
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,245
I heard it too.

150
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,980
If the department doesn't care
about you why will it care for me?

151
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,926
Can I get a cup of tea?
- Right away sir.

152
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,661
You want to go to the hospital?
- Sure.

153
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,496
Stay there for some days.
I will take care of the rest.

154
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,435
You trust me, don't you?
- I have only you to trust.

155
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,953
Thank you, brother.

156
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,327
Who is on duty at your house?
- Badge number 1275.

157
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,394
Sir, I feel that
I am being targeted...

158
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,528
...because I belong
to the minority group.

159
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:57,499
Minority! Mr. Ajay Khanna, how can
you belong to a minority group?

160
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,974
The Khan's are in
majority in our film industry.

161
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,607
It's just Mr. Amitabh,
Abhishek and I on the other side.

162
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,576
That's true.

163
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,279
Sir.

164
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,686
Mr. Khanna, this is
sub-inspector Jai Singh.

165
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,721
He will handle your case. Be rest
assured, we will crack this soon.

166
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,259
Sir, I just hope
nothing will happen to me.

167
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,095
C'mon! You are a hero.

168
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,003
Does anything ever happen
to our heroes in our films?

169
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,736
Sometimes it does.

170
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,472
Just in case anything
happens to you then...

171
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,014
...I assure you that
we will not spare them.

172
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,475
Sir, what are you?

173
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,077
Relax! Go to work.
Nothing will happen to you.

174
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,418
Thank you sir. Thank you very much.
- It is okay.

175
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,358
My brother. My brother.

176
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,521
Thank you! Thank you.

177
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,732
Thank you, sir.
- Yeah, mention not.

178
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:05,036
These are our heroes. One phone
call and he gets a stomach ache

179
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,509
Some kids from Shanti nagar
are playing a prank on him.

180
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,045
Patwardhan knows them.

181
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:12,049
Ask him to stop them or else he
will be wasting our time needlessly.

182
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,242
Right sir.

183
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,054
Shambu, who is
responsible for this incident?

184
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,553
I feel they did a good job by
putting up an electric pole.

185
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,718
But they should not
have dug this hole.

186
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:28,360
The government should
think twice before digging...

187
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,596
...that a common man like me
can fall into this pothole.

188
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,771
Look around! Today there
are potholes everywhere.

189
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:37,132
I mean are there potholes in the
city or this city is in potholes?

190
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,808
This government should take
responsibility for these potholes.

191
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:43,279
So what do you feel? Why does
the government do such things?

192
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,640
The government likes to dig.

193
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,084
So this was Mr. Shambu a.k.a.
Electric man who...

194
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,349
...has given Death
itself a very big shock.

195
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,217
This is Naina Roy with
cameraman Raj for UTV news.

196
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:25,355
Sir... sir, why are you hitting me?

197
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:32,862
Sir, why are you hitting me?

198
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,215
Yes, tell me!
- Don't get annoyed but...

199
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,221
...I just found out
that I don't have...

200
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,223
...some ingredients to
make the rice pudding.

201
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,721
You know very well
Ishaan loves rice pudding.

202
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,486
While coming home bring
some almonds, raisins...

203
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,621
All right I will
bring all those things.

204
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,825
Don't forget to buy those tomatoes.
- No I won't.

205
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,234
I am sorry. Are you angry with me?

206
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:24,766
Just a bit. But then, I have the
whole city to vent it out.

207
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,478
When will you come back?
- Around 7 o'clock.

208
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,972
Come back and we'll talk.
- Yes.

209
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,325
The government should
think twice before digging...

210
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,493
...that a common man like me
can fall into this pothole.

211
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,693
Look around! Today there
are potholes everywhere.

212
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,031
I mean are there potholes in the
city or this city is in potholes?

213
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,036
This government should take
responsibility for these potholes.

214
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,589
Sir, please forgive me.

215
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,376
Hello.
- Is it Commissioner Prakash Rathod?

216
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,570
Who's this?

217
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,944
Mr. Rathod, don't
interrupt and just listen.

218
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:49,944
I have planted bombs at 5
different locations in the city.

219
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:54,758
All these bombs will
explode at 6.30 pm.

220
00:24:55,894 --> 00:25:00,388
But this can be avoided.
I will call you up 30 minutes later...

221
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:05,903
...with my demands and I want to talk
or negotiate with only one person.

222
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,701
Until then you can
decide on that person.

223
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:12,534
Hello!

224
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,419
Find out who had called on
my mobile just a while back.

225
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:24,613
Jai, where is the chief minister?

226
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,432
Hello.
- Miss Naina Roy?

227
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:35,557
Yes, who is this?

228
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:39,434
It doesn't matter.
I just wanted to ask you...

229
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:43,497
...whether you are
interested in some serious news.

230
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,973
What? Is this some kind...
- Just answer me Naina.

231
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,014
This is big. Are you interested?
Yes or no?

232
00:25:56,454 --> 00:26:00,015
Yes. - Then come to the Mumbai Police
headquarters with your cameraman.

233
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,622
This is going to be the most
important day in your life.

234
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,520
I will call you again.

235
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,057
Raj!

236
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,192
I know this is an unknown number.

237
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,733
Keep trying. I want to know
that number within 5 minutes.

238
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,140
And ask Khatri to tap my
mobile phone immediately. Okay.

239
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:21,206
Yes Tiwari, I am putting
him on the line. Right away.

240
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,946
Sir, it's Tiwari.

241
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,845
Mr. Tiwari!
- Yes, Mr. Prakash, tell me.

242
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:25,974
Where is the CM?

243
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,208
He is in Bandra to
attend an important meeting.

244
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,480
Put Mr. Patil on the line.

245
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,482
Mr. Patil is also in a meeting.
Tell me, what is the matter?

246
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,491
It is a very minor thing.
I cannot bother you with it.

247
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,752
Put Patil on the line.

248
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:38,553
Sir, I hope you understood.

249
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,029
Sir, he wants to talk to you.

250
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,156
Excuse me.
- Okay.

251
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:42,557
Yes, Mr. Prakash.

252
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,034
I don't know how but come to
my office within 15 minutes.

253
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,865
But... - Within 15 minutes.
It's an emergency.

254
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,604
Jai, tell Chouhan, Ramesh and
Aakash to come into the WAR Room.

255
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:50,866
Right sir.

256
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,507
Sir. It is a prepaid mobile number.

257
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:58,640
It is registered to
one Jignesh Sheth.

258
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,651
He lives in Malad. I have
informed Malad police station.

259
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,216
This number is
unreachable right now. - Okay.

260
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,250
Attention guys!

261
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,802
This matter should not
get out of this room.

262
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:04,841
Does anyone of you want to
call anybody or warn anyone?

263
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:05,974
No sir!

264
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,251
We have just 4 hours left.

265
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:18,119
Chouhan, talk to Abbas at intelligence
and find out what they have.

266
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:20,820
Tell them you need this
information for verification.

267
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,124
Yes sir!

268
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,603
Vatkar, find out from
our sources whether...

269
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,698
...there has been any
movement in any terrorist module.

270
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,340
Get me any information on explosives
being taken in and out of the city.

271
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,742
Get in touch with your informers.

272
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,937
Right sir.

273
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,709
Aakash, we need to trace
the call the next time.

274
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:38,840
Put your best men on the job.

275
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,108
Yes sir!

276
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:46,014
Mr. Rathod, how are you?
- I am fine. And you?

277
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,149
Fine. Tell me.

278
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,717
Just a while back I received
a call on my cell phone.

279
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:50,852
One man...

280
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,932
Oh god. Excuse me.

281
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,431
It could also be a crank call.

282
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,096
We can't take any chances.
Where is the CM?

283
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,231
He is on his way.

284
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,308
Hello!

285
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,810
Yes, Mr. Rathod. Who
is going to talk to me?

286
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:54,010
Mr. Roy. He will be here soon.
Until then you can talk to me.

287
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:58,052
I will only talk to the person who
has the authority to take decisions.

288
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,847
I will call you
again in five minutes.

289
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:05,228
By the way let me remind you
that you are wasting your own time.

290
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:10,194
Take my advice. You
shouldn't buy time on this.

291
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:16,432
Too short to trace. But this is not
the same number as the previous one.

292
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:17,832
Excuse me sir.

293
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,773
There was a call from
Malad police station.

294
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,847
Nobody named Jignesh
Sheth lives at that address.

295
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,282
Do one thing, tell Solanki to
alert all the police stations.

296
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,276
Sir, the CM is on the line.

297
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,391
Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

298
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,784
Who is this Roy?
- Nobody.

299
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,261
Who is negotiating
with him from our side?

300
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,525
Sir, you will. We will patch
his call to you from here.

301
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:47,336
Why? - Because you have the authority
and you know how to negotiate.

302
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,540
There is a lot of difference between
giving a Speech and Negotiating.

303
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,002
This is not a political rally.

304
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,511
What about Patil or Tiwari?

305
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,139
Oh my God!

306
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,549
Prakash, I have never seen you
running away from responsibility.

307
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,813
There is a reason for it.

308
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,819
If this man is telling the
truth then to stop him...

309
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,085
...we require a person
with unlimited authority.

310
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,057
There shouldn't be any
red tape or protocol.

311
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,955
He would need absolute
and complete freedom.

312
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:16,827
He should not be
questioned about anything.

313
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,832
And I know that this is
not possible and that's why...

314
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,566
...I was running away
from responsibility Sir.

315
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:27,307
Patil, this operation will
be headed by Prakash Rathod.

316
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:31,042
I don't want any complaints
from him. Do you understand?

317
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,240
I'll be there soon.

318
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,443
Yes, sir. Should we
inform the center?

319
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:38,387
This is our problem and we
have to solve it. - Okay sir.

320
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,991
Come on guys, back
to work, everyone.

321
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,220
Excuse me.
- Yeah.

322
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,334
Hello.
- Mr. Rathod?

323
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,867
Mr. Roy won't be here.
I will negotiate instead of him.

324
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,304
How can he come there
if he doesn't exist?

325
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:57,465
What do you want?

326
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:01,535
Ibrahim Khan, lqlak Ahmed,
Mohammed Zaheer and Khursheed Lala.

327
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,605
Who are these guys?

328
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:08,415
You yourself had caught two of them.
And the ATS got the other two.

329
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:09,978
I hope it is not difficult.

330
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:13,080
Why would it be? We are used to it.

331
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,415
First we put our lives at
stake and catch them and...

332
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,017
...then when we get a phone
call and we set them free.

333
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,892
You will do the same thing today.

334
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:24,425
They all are in different places
right now. I'll call you in an hour.

335
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:28,338
Till then it is yourjob to
get them together at one place.

336
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,905
On whose behalf are you doing this?

337
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,271
What is the name of
your organization?

338
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:37,613
Do you suspect that
this is a crank call?

339
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,307
I do.

340
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,917
Mr. Rathod, you must
know by now that...

341
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,922
...Jignesh Sheth had died
in the last bomb blast.

342
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,922
The next number
belonged to Sanjay Singh...

343
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,927
...who had died three months back.

344
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,923
The current number that
you will trace belongs to...

345
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,489
...Shabbir Ahmed who has
also died a long way back.

346
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:59,297
Any Tom, Dick and Harry can do this.

347
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,930
Yes I agree. But any Tom,
Dick and Harry...

348
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,940
...cannot blow away
the police station...

349
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:07,000
...which is just opposite
your Police headquarters.

350
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,003
What do you mean?

351
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,948
It means I have also planted a
bomb in the police station...

352
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:16,953
...opposite your
headquarters just to prove...

353
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:20,184
...my seriousness and
your helplessness.

354
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,962
You have 20 minutes to
find it. So go find it.

355
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,956
Or else an hour later I may
have to talk to someone else.

356
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,271
Mr. Prakash, can we go
out for half an hour.

357
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,970
Jai!
- Yes sir!

358
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,205
Are you afraid?
- No sir.

359
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,975
Are you married?
- Two years ago.

360
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,640
Do you have a kid?
- I have a 3-month-old daughter.

361
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,149
What happens if you die?
- I don't care.

362
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,448
I want that bomb found within
ten minutes. - You'll get it, sir.

363
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,394
Give me your radio.
- Sir.

364
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,003
Hello. - Naina Roy,
someone has planted a bomb...

365
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:14,670
...in the police station
opposite the headquarters.

366
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,582
I thought you'd be interested.
- Oh God!

367
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:23,509
Relax guys! This man
wants us to find the bomb.

368
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,689
He wants us to take him seriously.
He wants us to find it.

369
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:57,780
We just have one hour. I don't want
to talk to this man again.

370
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,048
Sir, Chouhan is on the line.

371
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:02,517
Chouhan, tell me.

372
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,060
Sir, the intelligence has
no information about this.

373
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,420
That's consistent.

374
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,625
Chouhan, step up security at airports,
rail stations and bus depots.

375
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,292
Search everything and everyone.

376
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:14,061
Send them in batches of 4
to the multiplexes as well.

377
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,072
I want you to cover up as
much ground as possible.

378
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,074
If someone asks tell them
it is just a police drill...

379
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,803
...or tell them it's the
CM's orders. Get on it now!

380
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,076
All units alert, sir.

381
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,241
Deshmukh, where is my bomb squad?

382
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,090
Aakash, call up Arif.
I want him here a. S. A. P.

383
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:40,096
And I want an update on
Ibrahim Khan, lqlak Ahmed...

384
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,222
...Mohammad Zaheer
and Khursheed Lala.

385
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:42,729
You've got ten minutes.
- Yes sir.

386
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,160
Then send them here!

387
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,836
Bomb squad! Come in!
Bomb squad! Come in!

388
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,337
Has nobody seen Baburao?
Yeah Mhatre, come in.

389
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:30,605
Copy that.

390
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,621
What is it?
- Sir, it is RDX.

391
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,525
Come here! A bomb was
placed right under nose!

392
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,291
What the hell were you doing?
Who is the shift in-charge?

393
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,494
Sir, there was a shift
change just half an hour ago.

394
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,627
I don't know anything.

395
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:55,171
Find him in 5 minutes and
send him to me. - Okay sir.

396
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,901
Sir! We have located
the bomb. It is RDX.

397
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,608
He had planned to
trigger it with a cell phone.

398
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:00,735
Good.

399
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,912
Sir, please come this way.
I have solid information.

400
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,176
There has been a
pull-up from the underworld.

401
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,241
He had supplied 6 kgs of
RDX couple of days back.

402
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:09,410
He has not started talking yet.

403
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:10,715
On threatening him
he said he has taken...

404
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,187
...his painkillers already just
this morning. - That's a new one.

405
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,588
Sir, I don't know anything!

406
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,633
Did I ask you anything?
Did I ask you anything?

407
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:28,870
Did I ask you anything?
Did I ask you anything?

408
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,407
Did I ask you anything?
Did I ask you anything?

409
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:42,208
Nobody has confirmed
this information but...

410
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,584
...suddenly there is a lot of
activity in the police station.

411
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,885
You can see the bomb squad
and the sniffer dogs here.

412
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,219
They have just come out.

413
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:51,284
But we have been denied
any information about it.

414
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,223
We would like to inform
our viewers once again that...

415
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,231
...we had received information...

416
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,527
...about the bomb
via a telephone call.

417
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,759
Seems that the bomb has
been found and diffused.

418
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,862
We have not received
any confirmation yet.

419
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:03,839
But we will keep trying.

420
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:07,241
From Mumbai this is Naina Roy with
cameraman Raj for UTV news. - Over.

421
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,843
I want the forensic report
immediately in the WAR room.

422
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:10,972
Sir!
- Okay sir.

423
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:18,312
Thank you.

424
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:26,258
Mhatre come in. Copy.

425
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,396
Sir, the Psycho has arrived.
Someone's going to die today.

426
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,271
Hello.
- Are you busy?

427
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,769
Yes. Not really.

428
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:41,574
We have reached here safely.

429
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,940
How is mom?
- She is fine.

430
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:45,506
Give it to me.

431
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,443
What is the matter?
Are you worried about something?

432
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:52,013
Not at all.
- I'll call you before leaving.

433
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:54,420
Okay. Take care. Bye.

434
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,355
There was no direct contact with me.

435
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:57,821
I only gave the delivery.

436
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,523
I got a message to
deliver that bag to Rafiq.

437
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:06,030
He was Rafiq's customer.
I asked Rafiq who he was.

438
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:09,463
He said, your place is
behind and asked me to shut up.

439
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:11,970
Where can I find Rafiq?

440
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,502
Sir, I don't know.
If I had known I would tell you.

441
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,677
Believe me. Sir, I would...

442
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:31,327
Bohri Market. 4th Lane.

443
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:34,055
Where are you these days?

444
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,032
I am with the ATS.
You got me transferred.

445
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,331
Yes. Arif, I want that man and
the information that he has.

446
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,667
Vatkar will tell you where
to find him. Don't kill him.

447
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:42,797
I just need the information.

448
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,335
Okay sir.
- Okay.

449
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:47,007
Yes.
- Sir, the bomb has been diffused.

450
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:49,471
Who was on duty?
- Prashant.

451
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,409
Tell him to go home. He will receive
his termination letter tomorrow.

452
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,844
Tell Kailash to take over.

453
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:56,483
The media is here. UTV news.

454
00:40:58,355 --> 00:40:59,913
Bring them upstairs.
- Right sir.

455
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,991
Ibrahim Khan. He has
links with the Al-Qaeda.

456
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,364
He was
head-of-operations in India since 92.

457
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,799
This is his
designation on their website.

458
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:16,896
He has started 45
madrasas in the country...

459
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,875
...where little kids are
taught the meaning of Jihad.

460
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,376
On his capture they
will be weakened and if...

461
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,006
...he is set free then they
will be completely rejuvenated.

462
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,373
This is their second
attempt to free him.

463
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,543
He is extremely dangerous.

464
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:38,122
Lqlak Ahmed. Al Qaeda again.
Right hand of Ibrahim Khan.

465
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,387
He is a former ISI agent.
The theory is that...

466
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,399
...when you nabbed him
he wanted to get caught.

467
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,560
So that it would be
easy to free Ibrahim Khan.

468
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,397
He was directly or
indirectly involved in all...

469
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,838
...the terrorists attacks in
India in the last three years.

470
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,466
He is equally dangerous if not more.

471
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:59,741
Mohammad Zaheer. He is the
number 2 agent of Laskar in India.

472
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,785
He is a former ISI as well
as former Al Qaeda member.

473
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,743
He was a software engineer.

474
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,015
Due to systematic
brainwashing he went to Pakistan.

475
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,148
From there he went to Afghanistan.

476
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,418
He acquired his training over there.

477
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,483
He has designed a lot
of websites for them.

478
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:14,152
One of his websites is
called www.destroyindia.com

479
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,989
Very basic but very effective.

480
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,658
It registered record number
of hits the day it launched.

481
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:21,066
He is in our C-Zone
hospital since last week.

482
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:22,769
He complained of chest pains.

483
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:30,504
Khursheed Lala. He is an arms pimp.

484
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:33,573
He is not connected to just one
organization but with all of them.

485
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:36,820
If you need arms and
explosives then this is your Guy.

486
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,185
He will supply any
quantity you want.

487
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:43,454
No matter if it is 1993 or 2006.
Lala is behind the bars or free.

488
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,524
He doesn't leave a trail.

489
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:48,463
Sir, you may remember that
even when you arrested him...

490
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,466
...we only found a blue-print of...

491
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,468
...the Mumbai city
and a revolver on him.

492
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,662
Very soon he will be out on bail.

493
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:57,832
Sir, Here is a speculation.

494
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,672
Look at this. We don't know
his name but he is everywhere.

495
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,011
He has succeeded to
remain out of sight.

496
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,978
Our intelligence agencies
have no information about him.

497
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,076
There are only rumours.

498
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:12,546
Some say he is their CEO and others
say he is the chief strategist.

499
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,619
Sir, he is one among the crowd.

500
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:18,222
Even his wife doesn't
know what he really does.

501
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,494
This man could be behind this call.

502
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:43,245
He may belong to Laskar,
Al Qaeda or some other outfit.

503
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,511
We don't know whether he
is in the country or not.

504
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,884
There must be a couple of
people with him in this operation.

505
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:50,524
They have already
targeted the stock exchange...

506
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,528
...buses and local trains.

507
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,791
I suspect this time they
will go a step further.

508
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,523
That they have come so close
to the police headquarters...

509
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:58,795
...has business written all over it.

510
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,533
Aakash, this man is in the city.
We have to catch him.

511
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,798
Sir, what should we do
about the other four?

512
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,540
We are always two steps behind
them and if they are freed...

513
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,668
Let them be where they are.

514
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,536
It doesn't make any
sense to free Lala now...

515
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:11,672
...he is going to get free as is.

516
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,017
And by doing this Lala will be
regarded a certified terrorist.

517
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,176
Maybe they need Lala right now.

518
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:17,812
Maybe.

519
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:21,148
Uncle! Three tea.

520
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:23,287
Hey, send money to me.

521
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,589
When did you receive the first call?

522
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,615
Ok Alright then you and
your cameraman will remain...

523
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,213
...in custody until you
come out with the truth.

524
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,623
He called up at around 2 pm and...

525
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,854
...he asked me to come here.

526
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,627
He also said that this would be...

527
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,631
...the most important day of my life.

528
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,661
He is using you.

529
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:12,999
He is watching our
situation and our panic Live on TV.

530
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,661
You are his bloody eyes.

531
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:49,703
Sir, he is around 50.
Tall man. Wears a spectacle.

532
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,065
He looks like a clerk.

533
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,706
There is an under
construction building...

534
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:57,406
...in Malad west behind
Pritam nagar. Om constructions.

535
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:59,113
I had delivered the
goods on the 12th floor.

536
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,707
Vatkar!
- Yes sir. - Take him away.

537
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:11,222
Hello. Sir, this is Arif.
Yes I got it.

538
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,728
There is an under
construction building in Malad.

539
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,826
Patkar is bringing
Rafiq to the headquarters.

540
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,291
Should I send Jai?
- There's no need.

541
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:20,361
I will nab him and get
him to speak to you.

542
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:31,939
What was your name again?

543
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,107
Naina.

544
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,409
Naina, I want you to do me a favour.

545
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:40,746
Sir, until you don't tell me
everything I can't help you.

546
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:45,061
Okay. Come here.

547
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:50,195
This matter should be
only between you and me.

548
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:18,283
Three. Two. One. Go.

549
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,798
We have just
received information that...

550
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,800
...four terrorists whose
names are Ibrahim Khan...

551
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,802
...lqlak Ahmed, Mohammad
Zaheer and Khursheed Lala...

552
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,862
...are being shifted to
some other location.

553
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,872
The police says it is
because of security reasons.

554
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,136
Right now we have
Senior Inspector Jai Singh...

555
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:35,803
...who will give us full
information about this matter.

556
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:39,811
What is the reason behind shifting
these four to some other location?

557
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,818
There are some security reasons.
We have orders to do so.

558
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,819
But why such an order?

559
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,386
We have received orders to do so.

560
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,549
Can you tell us whether there is
any threat to them and from whom?

561
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,817
It is because of
some security reasons...

562
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:54,420
...that we have
received orders to shift them

563
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:59,057
As you can see, the police is not
giving us any further information.

564
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,832
And they are
evading our questions...

565
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:04,100
...by calling it a security reason.

566
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:07,038
From Mumbai this is Naina Roy
with cameraman Raj for UTV news.

567
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:08,435
Cut it!

568
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:15,851
Sir, please don't do this again.
My wife watches these news channels.

569
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:16,977
That was good Jai.

570
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,312
Thank you Naina.

571
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,959
Once again India approached America
with regards to Pakistan issue.

572
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,901
The government is spending
crores of rupees to save...

573
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:20,916
...but due to legal reasons,
they are...

574
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:59,683
Now, for the latest news let's
move to our correspondent Naina Roy...

575
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:10,962
What is the reason behind shifting
these four to some other location?

576
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,696
There are some security reasons.
We have orders to do so.

577
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:15,969
But why such an order?

578
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:18,002
We have received orders to do so.

579
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,183
Arif, tell me.

580
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,285
Sir, there is nobody here.
But he wanted us to come here.

581
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:40,989
There are tags of 'Do
not disturb' in here.

582
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,732
Come back.
- Yes sir.

583
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:46,534
Jai
- Yes sir.

584
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,632
We have to shift these four
terrorists to a single location.

585
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,070
Start the process.
- Sir.

586
00:53:46,822 --> 00:53:48,483
Mr. Rathod, Time is running out.

587
00:53:48,824 --> 00:53:50,621
How much longer are we going
to hide this from the public?

588
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:52,519
What should we tell the public?

589
00:53:53,094 --> 00:53:55,460
We have no other
choice than to catch him.

590
00:53:56,364 --> 00:53:58,491
He is regularly
monitoring us through Naina Roy.

591
00:54:05,373 --> 00:54:07,898
If we sound an alert
then he will know...

592
00:54:13,014 --> 00:54:16,450
Hello!
- Hello. - Yes tell me.

593
00:54:16,651 --> 00:54:19,381
Sir, this is Sapna from HDFC
Bank's credit card division.

594
00:54:19,454 --> 00:54:21,547
We are issuing you a
credit card for free.

595
00:54:21,623 --> 00:54:24,387
We have a new scheme which benefits
you with personal loan, housing loan...

596
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:26,518
I am not interested.
Don't ever call me.

597
00:54:26,595 --> 00:54:29,120
If you don't want it then say so.
Why are you getting rude Sir?

598
00:54:38,573 --> 00:54:41,133
Hello.
- Thank you very much.

599
00:54:41,409 --> 00:54:43,673
It's all right.
What else do you need?

600
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:46,877
Money! Private plane! What else?

601
00:54:47,616 --> 00:54:51,552
No thanks. I can
arrange for those things.

602
00:54:52,654 --> 00:54:57,023
Just put these four men in
a van and bring them to me.

603
00:54:57,759 --> 00:55:02,526
There is new strip on runway
number 4 at the Juhu Aviation Base.

604
00:55:02,597 --> 00:55:04,565
It is not operational for use yet.

605
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,867
I want these men brought
there at exactly 5 o'clock.

606
00:55:08,904 --> 00:55:11,429
Only two officers
should accompany them.

607
00:55:12,173 --> 00:55:15,040
Both should carry cell
phones with loudspeaker facility.

608
00:55:15,644 --> 00:55:18,477
Because I will need
confirmation that they are okay.

609
00:55:19,748 --> 00:55:24,447
I should also tell you that
this area is already rigged so...

610
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:30,116
...no snipers, no
commandoes and no surprises please.

611
00:55:30,191 --> 00:55:31,590
No funny business.

612
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,988
I want to know something.

613
00:55:39,935 --> 00:55:40,993
Ask away.

614
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:43,594
You and your organization
are under what misconception?

615
00:55:44,205 --> 00:55:46,196
You are always
hiding from the police.

616
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:49,669
Why don't you come in the open and
finish this matter once and for all?

617
00:55:52,948 --> 00:55:58,978
Mr. Rathod, we are cowards.
Are you happy now?

618
00:56:01,122 --> 00:56:03,886
Don't waste your time in
trying to get me aggravated.

619
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:05,483
There is a face behind every voice.

620
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,618
I don't have a face.

621
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:08,492
That's what you think.
- No! I know it.

622
00:56:08,563 --> 00:56:12,499
What is the guarantee that you will
tell me the location of the bombs?

623
00:56:12,567 --> 00:56:16,003
Guarantee! Do you think
I am selling you a product?

624
00:56:16,071 --> 00:56:19,165
No. If I had thought so I would not
ask you this question.

625
00:56:19,975 --> 00:56:21,499
Thousands of lives are at stake.

626
00:56:21,576 --> 00:56:24,636
Do you have any other
choice than to trust me?

627
00:56:27,115 --> 00:56:29,015
I will call you again at 5.

628
00:56:32,954 --> 00:56:34,012
Aakash, tell me.

629
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:35,147
We have a multiple trace.

630
00:56:35,223 --> 00:56:37,589
Mulund, Santacruz, Karachi,
Singapore and South Africa.

631
00:56:37,726 --> 00:56:39,523
This is unique. The
call is bounced off...

632
00:56:39,594 --> 00:56:41,528
...and manipulated
without being disconnected...

633
00:56:41,596 --> 00:56:43,689
...from different sim cards and
landlines of different locations.

634
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:45,626
The number switches to
another every minute.

635
00:56:45,867 --> 00:56:48,859
This is only possible if you
route your phone through a system.

636
00:56:49,004 --> 00:56:51,973
Whoever is doing this
is a very trained man

637
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,530
So you can't trace him?

638
00:56:53,608 --> 00:56:55,735
Sir, to do this we need
some other kind of an expert.

639
00:56:55,944 --> 00:56:57,605
For example.
- We need a hacker.

640
00:56:57,712 --> 00:57:00,613
Then get one. Check the
booking list of Juhu Aviation.

641
00:57:00,782 --> 00:57:03,046
Find which private plane
has been booked and for whom.

642
00:57:03,118 --> 00:57:05,951
Yes, sir. - Sir, there is
a sub-inspector outside.

643
00:57:06,021 --> 00:57:07,147
He has seen the man.

644
00:57:07,822 --> 00:57:12,589
Sir, I remember very well.
He had a black bag with him.

645
00:57:13,228 --> 00:57:15,219
He had come to file a
report about his missing wallet.

646
00:57:15,296 --> 00:57:16,627
What were you doing there?

647
00:57:17,565 --> 00:57:20,295
Sir, there was so much
security what else could I do?

648
00:57:20,568 --> 00:57:22,035
This is his number and address.

649
00:57:22,103 --> 00:57:24,970
I had tried his number. Am
getting a, 'does not exist' message.

650
00:57:25,106 --> 00:57:27,233
I have asked the Borivali
police to verify the address.

651
00:57:27,308 --> 00:57:29,037
This is not his address.
He is not such a fool.

652
00:57:29,577 --> 00:57:32,569
Take him to a sketch artist.
Make his sketch and show him.

653
00:57:32,647 --> 00:57:34,046
Where is Rafiq?
- He is in Room number 12.

654
00:57:34,115 --> 00:57:37,050
Show the sketch to Rafiq
and verify it. - Right sir.

655
00:58:07,282 --> 00:58:09,682
Hello. I want you to go to the
main gate of Juhu Aviation...

656
00:58:09,751 --> 00:58:13,084
...at exactly 5 o'clock.
- No.

657
00:58:14,622 --> 00:58:17,682
Excuse me! I didn't hear that.

658
00:58:17,826 --> 00:58:19,054
You are using me.

659
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:22,188
If you are not interested then
you should've told me before.

660
00:58:22,263 --> 00:58:24,094
There is no dearth
of people like you.

661
00:58:24,165 --> 00:58:27,100
I am indirectly helping you.
I am being party to some...

662
00:58:27,168 --> 00:58:30,069
Come on! Come on! Don't
flatter yourself, Naina.

663
00:58:31,272 --> 00:58:32,637
If in a cricket match
between India and Pakistan...

664
00:58:32,707 --> 00:58:37,144
...India loses then nobody
blames the sports channels.

665
00:58:37,212 --> 00:58:38,839
This is not a cricket match!

666
00:58:39,047 --> 00:58:40,378
Yes or no!

667
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,147
I have a dozen
phone numbers with me.

668
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:46,380
There are a lot of news
hungry people out there.

669
00:58:46,654 --> 00:58:47,780
Yes or no!

670
00:58:53,928 --> 00:58:54,986
Yes.

671
00:58:55,096 --> 00:59:00,864
Good. Be at the main gate of
Juhu Aviation at 5 o'clock.

672
00:59:32,433 --> 00:59:33,695
Prakash, what is the plan of action?

673
00:59:33,768 --> 00:59:35,827
People are on it. But until we
don't have a break through...

674
00:59:35,904 --> 00:59:38,202
...we have to do what he says.

675
00:59:38,706 --> 00:59:42,802
This is ridiculous! Law and
order has become a mere bystander.

676
00:59:44,946 --> 00:59:46,777
Prakash, why aren't we
able to do anything about it?

677
00:59:46,915 --> 00:59:47,973
We have such a big force,
we have the intelligence bureau...

678
00:59:48,049 --> 00:59:49,846
...we have RAW and the ATS.

679
00:59:51,419 --> 00:59:53,284
Why do we always become so helpless?

680
00:59:54,756 --> 00:59:57,850
We can't involve the
media or sound an alert.

681
00:59:58,326 --> 01:00:01,295
I just can't believe this.
We have become just useless.

682
01:00:01,462 --> 01:00:02,895
Sir, we are doing our best.

683
01:00:02,964 --> 01:00:05,194
But your best isn't good enough.

684
01:00:06,734 --> 01:00:08,065
I think we should call
in the army and the...

685
01:00:08,136 --> 01:00:09,330
They won't be of any help.

686
01:00:09,737 --> 01:00:11,227
Sir!
- Tell me.

687
01:00:12,173 --> 01:00:15,836
I have heard that man. I think what
Mr. Prakash is doing is right.

688
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:19,079
Instead of questioning his decisions
it would be better if we help him.

689
01:00:19,347 --> 01:00:21,838
And he is competent to
deal with this crisis.

690
01:00:24,118 --> 01:00:26,086
Which two officers are
going to accompany them?

691
01:00:26,487 --> 01:00:28,250
Arif Khan and Jai Singh.

692
01:00:28,456 --> 01:00:32,256
Prakash, you have senior
experienced officers and you are...

693
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,318
You have Solanki...
- Please trust me.

694
01:00:35,864 --> 01:00:38,355
Prakash, there should not be
any bomb blasts in Mumbai today.

695
01:00:38,433 --> 01:00:39,491
There won't be any bomb blasts.

696
01:00:39,767 --> 01:00:41,428
I don't want to hand
over the four men to him.

697
01:00:41,502 --> 01:00:42,867
That I will try.

698
01:00:43,771 --> 01:00:45,864
Excuse me. Yes, tell me.

699
01:00:47,175 --> 01:00:48,267
Ok.

700
01:00:56,918 --> 01:00:58,249
Sir, the Borivali address is wrong.

701
01:00:58,386 --> 01:00:59,444
There is no such
building with that name.

702
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,078
Where is Arif?
- He is at the armory.

703
01:01:09,898 --> 01:01:11,889
Whose face did you
first see when you woke up?

704
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,892
My own.

705
01:01:13,968 --> 01:01:15,026
I am not surprised.

706
01:01:16,137 --> 01:01:17,968
Are you ready?
- Yes sir!

707
01:01:31,552 --> 01:01:33,247
From here you will go
directly to TS Mills.

708
01:01:33,821 --> 01:01:36,016
The four men will be
handed over to you over there.

709
01:01:36,557 --> 01:01:39,924
The Special Task Force is picking
them up from their current locations.

710
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:41,321
Here are the transfer orders.

711
01:01:50,204 --> 01:01:53,935
Ibrahim Khan.
- Let's go.

712
01:03:19,927 --> 01:03:21,087
He will make a conference call.

713
01:03:21,396 --> 01:03:23,023
There is a loudspeaker
facility in this phone.

714
01:03:23,264 --> 01:03:25,095
You can listen to our conversation.

715
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:27,657
There are three routes
to reach Juhu Aviation.

716
01:03:27,935 --> 01:03:30,369
You will take the quickest
one which is by the highway.

717
01:03:30,538 --> 01:03:35,271
There will also be driver who will
drop all of you there. - Yes sir!

718
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:37,344
I don't think they will
make a rescue attempt.

719
01:03:37,445 --> 01:03:39,538
Neither do I think they
will risk a public shootout.

720
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,443
There is a danger to
their lives in doing it.

721
01:03:41,682 --> 01:03:44,048
This is not a pre-planned
operation. It's an extempore!

722
01:03:44,285 --> 01:03:48,051
So, that's it guys. Just
keep your cool. All the best.

723
01:03:48,689 --> 01:03:51,123
And come over to my place in the
evening. We'll have a drink together.

724
01:03:51,959 --> 01:03:53,017
Sir!
- Okay.

725
01:04:01,702 --> 01:04:08,107
Jai!
- Sir.

726
01:04:09,477 --> 01:04:11,968
After everything is
over maybe you have to...

727
01:04:12,046 --> 01:04:19,214
...do something... about Arif.
You know what I mean.

728
01:04:20,121 --> 01:04:21,179
Understood sir.

729
01:04:33,067 --> 01:04:34,193
Who is this kid?

730
01:04:34,502 --> 01:04:36,367
Sir, his name is Anuj.
He is a hacker.

731
01:04:36,671 --> 01:04:39,105
He helps us very often
to crack cyber crimes.

732
01:04:40,007 --> 01:04:41,065
Is he that qualified?

733
01:04:41,142 --> 01:04:43,633
He is a college drop out but...
- Anuj!

734
01:04:46,747 --> 01:04:49,511
Do you understand what this equipment
and this setup is all about?

735
01:04:50,017 --> 01:04:52,508
No sir. All this
equipment is outdated.

736
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:55,079
You are still using
NCC 3423 models while...

737
01:04:55,156 --> 01:04:58,592
...the S-series has been
launched three months back.

738
01:04:59,026 --> 01:05:01,017
I need some time.

739
01:05:01,095 --> 01:05:02,221
Can you handle it?

740
01:05:03,664 --> 01:05:06,690
Hey babe! Yeah, I am running
a little late honey!

741
01:05:07,401 --> 01:05:08,527
Will catch you in half an hour!

742
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:11,538
Okay. Love you. See you.

743
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:16,305
Women! Sorry, what were you saying?

744
01:05:16,444 --> 01:05:17,570
Can you handle the job?

745
01:05:18,312 --> 01:05:20,371
Definitely. I am a
drop out by choice.

746
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,813
Hello.
- Okay sir.

747
01:07:23,471 --> 01:07:24,529
Yes sir.

748
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,173
Get in touch with Chouhan.
Send this sketch to...

749
01:07:27,241 --> 01:07:30,233
...every police station and
every agency by fax or email.

750
01:07:30,378 --> 01:07:32,437
Next check our records.
And then get in touch with...

751
01:07:32,513 --> 01:07:35,846
...the Interpol and the FBI.
I want any information on this man.

752
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:38,214
Yes sir. - Babu, wait
here for the verification.

753
01:07:45,192 --> 01:07:46,489
Sir.
- What is the status?

754
01:07:46,794 --> 01:07:47,852
We are on schedule.

755
01:07:47,928 --> 01:07:49,657
Any problem?
- Not at all, sir.

756
01:07:49,897 --> 01:07:52,331
Call me up when you reach there.
- Yes sir.

757
01:08:07,214 --> 01:08:09,944
What is your name?
- I don't need to tell you.

758
01:08:12,219 --> 01:08:13,277
You are right.

759
01:08:16,691 --> 01:08:17,817
My friend!
- What?

760
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:21,325
What do you think
is happening to us?

761
01:08:24,498 --> 01:08:26,557
Ibrahim bhai, looking
at their scared faces...

762
01:08:26,634 --> 01:08:29,535
...I feel we are going to get freed.

763
01:08:30,971 --> 01:08:32,962
And I also think...

764
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:46,343
Fire! It reminds me of my youth.

765
01:08:46,987 --> 01:08:53,984
I was also like you. Too stubborn
to be afraid of death.

766
01:08:57,998 --> 01:09:02,298
I was six years old when my father
got into an enmity with a few men.

767
01:09:03,738 --> 01:09:06,639
These men kidnapped
me from the school.

768
01:09:07,007 --> 01:09:08,736
They asked for a ransom
in exchange of my life.

769
01:09:09,276 --> 01:09:13,770
My father paid the ransom.
But they were still greedy.

770
01:09:14,382 --> 01:09:18,978
They beat me up. I was almost dead.

771
01:09:21,522 --> 01:09:25,014
When they got tired they tied a
rope to my leg and hung me on a tree.

772
01:09:25,693 --> 01:09:27,854
I called out to them.
One of them looked back.

773
01:09:28,295 --> 01:09:32,527
I screamed that if you have to then
at least hang me to a mango tree.

774
01:09:35,302 --> 01:09:38,362
He started to laugh.
He got me down...

775
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:42,398
...patted me on my
head and sent me home.

776
01:09:44,044 --> 01:09:45,306
I lived.

777
01:09:46,847 --> 01:09:51,409
Four years later I killed them
by hanging them to the same tree.

778
01:10:00,661 --> 01:10:01,992
Can we kill this guy right here?

779
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:33,417
Yes!

780
01:10:34,895 --> 01:10:36,886
We are on our way.
- Where are you?

781
01:10:37,064 --> 01:10:39,532
At the railway station and
about to the catch the train.

782
01:10:40,367 --> 01:10:44,463
I don't know why but there is
too much checking at the stations.

783
01:10:44,638 --> 01:10:46,970
It's just a drill. How is Kajal?

784
01:10:47,641 --> 01:10:52,010
Kajal is asleep. Where are you?
- I am outdoors.

785
01:10:53,647 --> 01:10:56,377
We will reach home before you.

786
01:10:57,718 --> 01:11:00,118
Okay.
- I will hang up now.

787
01:11:01,121 --> 01:11:03,589
Anu...
- I love you too.

788
01:11:04,124 --> 01:11:07,093
I will call you when I get home.
Okay? Bye.

789
01:11:08,062 --> 01:11:09,120
Bye.

790
01:12:38,218 --> 01:12:39,480
Come on!

791
01:12:42,222 --> 01:12:43,484
Come on!

792
01:12:49,029 --> 01:12:50,155
Arif...
- Yes sir.

793
01:12:51,065 --> 01:12:52,123
Sir, we are there.

794
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:53,496
Stay put. I will call back.

795
01:12:59,073 --> 01:13:00,131
Stand properly.

796
01:13:27,868 --> 01:13:29,597
Hello.
- Mr. Rathod.

797
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:31,532
Did they reach there?

798
01:13:31,605 --> 01:13:32,663
Yes.

799
01:13:33,073 --> 01:13:34,631
I would like to speak to them.

800
01:13:41,048 --> 01:13:43,642
What is the name of your officer?
- Arif Khan.

801
01:13:49,289 --> 01:13:52,747
What happened?
- Nothing.

802
01:13:59,066 --> 01:14:00,556
Hello. - Arif, put the
phone off loudspeaker mode...

803
01:14:00,634 --> 01:14:03,102
...someone wants to speak to you.
- Yes sir.

804
01:14:05,172 --> 01:14:06,639
Arif is on the line. Speak to him.

805
01:14:07,107 --> 01:14:10,736
Arif, I want to speak to my friends.

806
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,706
They are listening. Speak up.

807
01:14:15,315 --> 01:14:17,783
Greetings Mr. Khan.
- Greetings to you.

808
01:14:18,152 --> 01:14:20,177
Are you safe?
- Yes I am.

809
01:14:20,587 --> 01:14:26,150
I have been ordered to find out
you guys are real and not imposters.

810
01:14:27,628 --> 01:14:32,088
And to find if the police has not
hatched a conspiracy to fool us.

811
01:14:32,599 --> 01:14:33,657
That's why you will tell me...

812
01:14:33,734 --> 01:14:35,793
...your name and your
initials one by one.

813
01:14:37,071 --> 01:14:39,335
No need to go into the details.
Just a hint will do.

814
01:14:41,241 --> 01:14:44,699
Ibrahim Khan. Mumbai 93. I am proud.

815
01:14:46,613 --> 01:14:49,776
Lqlak Ahmed.
Gujarat 2002. I am proud.

816
01:14:50,684 --> 01:14:54,848
Mohammad Zaheer.
Mumbai 2006. I am proud.

817
01:14:55,723 --> 01:14:58,817
Khursheed Lala. 92
to 2006. I am proud.

818
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,294
Your initials are indeed wonderful.

819
01:15:03,363 --> 01:15:06,890
Arif, put the phone on
handset mode and give it to Khan.

820
01:15:11,972 --> 01:15:15,635
Hello. - Mr. Khan, did
they give you any injection...

821
01:15:15,709 --> 01:15:18,872
...or did they make you eat anything?

822
01:15:18,946 --> 01:15:20,709
No. Just that we are handcuffed.

823
01:15:20,781 --> 01:15:25,377
They will be unlocked soon.
Give the phone back to the officer.

824
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:33,226
Speak up. - Arif, there
are two benches ahead of you.

825
01:15:36,163 --> 01:15:37,721
You will leave my
four men over there.

826
01:15:38,398 --> 01:15:40,662
You will free their hands
and without looking back...

827
01:15:40,734 --> 01:15:43,760
...you and your friend
will walk away from there.

828
01:15:44,304 --> 01:15:46,932
You will get in your van and
go back to the police station.

829
01:15:47,941 --> 01:15:50,239
You have only ten minutes,
starting now.

830
01:15:50,677 --> 01:15:52,736
I don't have to remind you
that if you do something foolish...

831
01:15:52,813 --> 01:15:54,838
...then thousands of
lives will be lost.

832
01:15:57,251 --> 01:15:59,685
Mr. Rathod, I will call
you after Arif leaves and...

833
01:15:59,753 --> 01:16:03,780
...give you the exact
locations of the bombs.

834
01:16:06,393 --> 01:16:07,792
Do as he says.

835
01:16:08,896 --> 01:16:09,954
Yes sir.

836
01:16:53,173 --> 01:16:54,731
FBI, Interpol or our Intelligence.

837
01:16:54,808 --> 01:16:56,833
Neither of them have any
information about this man.

838
01:16:57,077 --> 01:16:59,773
We have no choice. We can kill
these guys some other time.

839
01:17:02,282 --> 01:17:04,773
Prakash, how can we
justify their disappearance?

840
01:17:05,752 --> 01:17:07,344
There was a snag in the
security so they escaped.

841
01:17:07,754 --> 01:17:08,914
You can suspend me over this.

842
01:17:09,089 --> 01:17:12,217
Prakash, you are...
- Excuse me sir. It was a local call.

843
01:17:12,759 --> 01:17:15,284
If he calls the next time I can
point out his exact location.

844
01:17:15,762 --> 01:17:19,289
Are you sure? - Definitely.
He is good. But not the best.

845
01:17:20,367 --> 01:17:21,425
Okay.

846
01:17:25,772 --> 01:17:28,104
Arif, remove his handcuffs.

847
01:17:28,976 --> 01:17:30,773
This is not right.
If they escape and...

848
01:17:30,844 --> 01:17:32,505
...they don't tell us
about the bombs then...

849
01:17:33,247 --> 01:17:34,874
Arif, it's Mr. Rathod's orders.

850
01:17:35,182 --> 01:17:38,913
No Jai. Free the other three.
Let's take him with us.

851
01:17:38,986 --> 01:17:40,044
We will leave him
only when we know...

852
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,781
...the exact locations of the bombs.

853
01:17:41,855 --> 01:17:42,913
I will call up Mr. Rathod.

854
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:44,953
I will not release him
even if sir asks me to.

855
01:17:45,392 --> 01:17:47,451
Arif, are you crazy?
Someone might be watching us.

856
01:17:47,527 --> 01:17:49,154
Then he will call us
when he sees us leave.

857
01:17:49,229 --> 01:17:51,789
Arif!
- Don't argue! Let's go!

858
01:17:51,865 --> 01:17:54,265
Arif!
- You are making a mistake.

859
01:17:54,801 --> 01:17:56,792
What did you say?
- You are making a big mistake.

860
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:58,269
I like to make mistakes.

861
01:18:04,211 --> 01:18:05,542
Come on!
- Let me go.

862
01:18:11,084 --> 01:18:12,415
What will they do to Ibrahim bhai?

863
01:18:12,819 --> 01:18:14,912
Nothing. We will
get him freed later.

864
01:18:15,555 --> 01:18:16,852
Khursheed bhai, what
should we do next?

865
01:18:17,224 --> 01:18:19,886
We will wait. Someone
will come to take us away.

866
01:18:38,512 --> 01:18:39,877
Arif!
- What is it now?

867
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:41,272
I can hear a phone ringing.

868
01:18:45,185 --> 01:18:46,243
Take a look.

869
01:18:59,266 --> 01:19:00,324
Pick it up.

870
01:19:20,554 --> 01:19:25,890
Let me go! Let me go!

871
01:19:25,959 --> 01:19:33,365
Let me go! Wait!

872
01:19:47,914 --> 01:19:50,439
Take him.

873
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,229
Now give me the
locations of the bombs.

874
01:20:08,368 --> 01:20:11,132
First call up Arif
and give me his status.

875
01:20:11,204 --> 01:20:12,398
I want to listen to his response.

876
01:20:15,675 --> 01:20:18,405
Hold him. Hello.

877
01:20:18,478 --> 01:20:19,672
Arif, what is the progress?

878
01:20:19,946 --> 01:20:22,244
Sir, I am confused.
Something else is going on here.

879
01:20:22,682 --> 01:20:25,412
Means? - The plan was not to
free them but to kill them.

880
01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:27,447
A bomb was planted in that area.

881
01:20:27,687 --> 01:20:30,554
As soon as we left,
the bomb exploded.

882
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:32,021
Both the benches were rigged.

883
01:20:34,461 --> 01:20:35,621
It means, all four of them...

884
01:20:35,695 --> 01:20:39,187
No. I had left only Zaheer,
lqlak and Lala over there.

885
01:20:41,468 --> 01:20:42,958
To secure the
information about the bombs...

886
01:20:43,036 --> 01:20:45,027
...I had kept Ibrahim with me.

887
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,140
Yes he is with us. He is alive.

888
01:20:58,585 --> 01:20:59,643
What is happening?

889
01:20:59,719 --> 01:21:01,243
Arif is right, Mr. Rathod!

890
01:21:02,622 --> 01:21:05,989
Arif, put the phone
off loudspeaker mode.

891
01:21:06,059 --> 01:21:08,050
I want Ibrahim to listen
to what I am going to say.

892
01:21:18,505 --> 01:21:20,996
I did not want to save
Ibrahim Khan, lqlak Ahmed...

893
01:21:21,074 --> 01:21:23,133
...Mohammad Zaheer and
Khursheed Lala but...

894
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:24,609
...I wanted to kill them.

895
01:21:27,581 --> 01:21:31,073
And in fact you will complete
my job, today and right now.

896
01:21:34,421 --> 01:21:35,683
Sorry, I did not understand you.

897
01:21:35,755 --> 01:21:38,383
Mr. Rathod, what do you do if
a cockroach enters you house?

898
01:21:39,059 --> 01:21:40,754
You do not make it your pet,
you just kill it.

899
01:21:42,028 --> 01:21:45,691
These pests were spoiling my
house and now I want to clean it.

900
01:21:48,235 --> 01:21:50,032
Who are you?

901
01:21:50,103 --> 01:21:52,628
I am someone who is afraid to get
into a bus or a train these days.

902
01:21:55,775 --> 01:21:59,040
I am someone whose wife
thinks is going to war...

903
01:21:59,112 --> 01:22:01,239
...while I am
actually going to my work.

904
01:22:01,648 --> 01:22:03,081
She is afraid that I may not return.

905
01:22:03,783 --> 01:22:05,717
She calls up every two hours.
To find if I had my tea.

906
01:22:05,785 --> 01:22:07,047
To find if I have lunched.

907
01:22:08,421 --> 01:22:10,787
Actually she wants to find
out whether I am still alive.

908
01:22:13,193 --> 01:22:17,220
I am someone who sometimes gets
stuck in the rain or in the blasts.

909
01:22:19,132 --> 01:22:21,726
I am someone who suspects
the person carrying a rosary.

910
01:22:21,801 --> 01:22:25,168
I am also the one who is afraid
to grow his beard and wear a cap.

911
01:22:26,106 --> 01:22:28,165
If I buy a shop I am
afraid to choose a name as...

912
01:22:28,241 --> 01:22:32,541
...someone might see the name
and burn it during the riots.

913
01:22:35,182 --> 01:22:37,241
No matter which two
parties are fighting...

914
01:22:37,317 --> 01:22:38,579
...I am the first one to get killed.

915
01:22:42,088 --> 01:22:46,354
You must have seen a crowd.
Choose a person from it.

916
01:22:47,294 --> 01:22:48,352
I am that person.

917
01:22:49,329 --> 01:22:54,824
I am just the stupid common
man wanting to clean his house.

918
01:22:55,268 --> 01:22:57,566
How did this common
man suddenly wake up?

919
01:22:58,371 --> 01:23:00,601
And that too with six kgs of RDX?

920
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,398
Has that got you worried now?

921
01:23:03,743 --> 01:23:06,143
Do you want me to live my
life and die every moment of it?

922
01:23:08,315 --> 01:23:10,215
Mr. Rathod, this did not
happen all of a sudden!

923
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:12,214
I just did not get
the time to do it.

924
01:23:14,187 --> 01:23:16,849
In the process of earning my
daily bread this work got neglected.

925
01:23:17,123 --> 01:23:18,556
But it's better late than never.

926
01:23:19,626 --> 01:23:21,787
That remaining
cockroach will also die today.

927
01:23:21,861 --> 01:23:24,193
Why just these four?
There are others as well.

928
01:23:25,131 --> 01:23:27,292
I drew a lottery and
I got their names.

929
01:23:27,867 --> 01:23:30,131
Are you trying to say that
if we don't kill Ibrahim...

930
01:23:30,203 --> 01:23:34,196
...then you will kill
thousands of innocent people?

931
01:23:34,274 --> 01:23:37,334
Sooner or later they
are going to die and...

932
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:40,243
...people like
Ibrahim will kill them.

933
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:43,148
The last time they
were killed in a train...

934
01:23:43,216 --> 01:23:44,877
...this time it will
be somewhere else.

935
01:23:46,353 --> 01:23:49,288
They will keep on killing until
we learn to give a solid reply.

936
01:23:49,823 --> 01:23:52,519
Who are you?
- What do you mean?

937
01:23:52,826 --> 01:23:54,657
I mean are you a Hindu or a Muslim?

938
01:23:56,296 --> 01:23:58,787
This has nothing to
do with my religion.

939
01:23:59,165 --> 01:24:00,223
There is.

940
01:24:00,767 --> 01:24:04,760
I told you, I am just
a stupid common man.

941
01:24:04,904 --> 01:24:07,236
Stupid common man!
- Right.

942
01:24:08,174 --> 01:24:10,904
Are you afraid of getting
caught and getting killed?

943
01:24:13,313 --> 01:24:16,680
Maybe. - Be definite.
You are or you aren't? - I am.

944
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:19,182
Just remember this fear.
And don't think you will...

945
01:24:19,252 --> 01:24:21,846
...escape punishment by putting
this garb of a stupid common man.

946
01:24:22,188 --> 01:24:24,748
The thing you are trying to prove...
- I am not trying to prove anything.

947
01:24:24,824 --> 01:24:30,194
I just want to remind you
that people are very angry.

948
01:24:30,263 --> 01:24:32,231
Please stop testing their patience.

949
01:24:33,433 --> 01:24:37,301
We are resilient by
force not by choice.

950
01:24:38,505 --> 01:24:40,939
It took me just four
weeks to render you helpless.

951
01:24:43,243 --> 01:24:46,371
Do you suppose the people who kill
us are more intelligent than us?

952
01:24:46,946 --> 01:24:50,211
Type 'bomb' in any
internet search and you will get...

953
01:24:50,283 --> 01:24:54,344
...hundreds of websites
showing you how to make them.

954
01:24:54,421 --> 01:24:57,288
All the information is
accessible and that too for free.

955
01:24:59,225 --> 01:25:02,592
Do you know a washing soap
is also a potential bomb?

956
01:25:04,831 --> 01:25:09,427
I feel there is no better
product made for the common man.

957
01:25:11,237 --> 01:25:14,502
The problem with us is
that we get used to all this.

958
01:25:16,743 --> 01:25:18,233
If one such incidence occurs we
watch it on all the channels...

959
01:25:18,311 --> 01:25:21,508
...we send smses, we call up people.

960
01:25:21,648 --> 01:25:23,240
We get happy that we
are safe and then...

961
01:25:23,316 --> 01:25:27,844
...instead of fighting against the
situation we start to adjust with it.

962
01:25:29,889 --> 01:25:34,690
But we have our compulsions.
We have to maintain a family.

963
01:25:36,996 --> 01:25:40,989
That's why we appoint a
government to run the nation.

964
01:25:42,335 --> 01:25:47,398
All of you. The government,
the police force, intelligence...

965
01:25:47,474 --> 01:25:49,772
...is capable of carrying
out this pest control.

966
01:25:49,843 --> 01:25:51,276
But you are not doing it. Instead
you are just supporting their...

967
01:25:51,344 --> 01:25:52,470
...cause by not doing
anything stringent.

968
01:25:55,615 --> 01:25:57,446
Why are you not
nipping them in the bud?

969
01:25:59,285 --> 01:26:02,482
It takes you ten years
to prove a person guilty.

970
01:26:02,856 --> 01:26:05,518
Don't you think this is a
question mark on your ability?

971
01:26:07,994 --> 01:26:12,363
All this should stop. This
whole bloody system is flawed.

972
01:26:15,301 --> 01:26:17,360
If you don't clean
up this mess then...

973
01:26:17,437 --> 01:26:18,631
...we will have to do
something about it.

974
01:26:19,973 --> 01:26:23,966
I know there will be an
imbalance in our civilized society.

975
01:26:24,043 --> 01:26:25,374
But what can we do?

976
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:29,305
Mr. Rathod, I am convinced the
train blasts were not just...

977
01:26:29,382 --> 01:26:32,613
...a terrorist activity
but it was a question.

978
01:26:34,053 --> 01:26:35,384
The question was, we are
going to keep killing you...

979
01:26:35,455 --> 01:26:38,481
...what can you do? Yes!

980
01:26:39,325 --> 01:26:40,485
They've asked us this question.

981
01:26:42,061 --> 01:26:45,326
First on a friday then
they repeated it on tuesday.

982
01:26:45,398 --> 01:26:47,798
I am just replying on a Wednesday.

983
01:26:49,369 --> 01:26:52,429
Your, add-salt-to-taste philosophy,
is absolutely wrong.

984
01:26:52,939 --> 01:26:53,997
This is not the correct approach.

985
01:26:54,073 --> 01:26:56,337
I know. But right now
I am not concerned...

986
01:26:56,409 --> 01:26:58,434
...about the
approach but the results.

987
01:26:58,778 --> 01:27:01,338
Did someone of yours
die in these blasts?

988
01:27:01,448 --> 01:27:07,011
Why? Should I wait until someone
close to me dies in such a dirty way?

989
01:27:07,086 --> 01:27:09,418
And only then will you feel
that this step is justified?

990
01:27:14,093 --> 01:27:15,424
If you want to know then listen.

991
01:27:17,096 --> 01:27:20,964
There was someone
close to me on that train.

992
01:27:24,904 --> 01:27:26,462
A kid... must be around 21 years.

993
01:27:29,108 --> 01:27:30,439
Don't know his name.

994
01:27:32,378 --> 01:27:34,107
Used to meet me everyday in
the first class compartment.

995
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:40,383
While getting into the train he
used to greet me with a hello...

996
01:27:40,453 --> 01:27:43,013
...and I used to return the courtesy.

997
01:27:43,389 --> 01:27:44,549
There were many such people.

998
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:47,387
We did not know each other's names...

999
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:48,791
...Just knew each
other through 'hellos'!

1000
01:27:50,730 --> 01:27:52,391
With a smile he had shown me...

1001
01:27:52,465 --> 01:27:54,490
...his engagement
ring just a day before.

1002
01:28:05,411 --> 01:28:06,469
He was very happy.

1003
01:28:10,416 --> 01:28:12,680
The next day I missed the
train and I escaped death.

1004
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:15,078
But he didn't.

1005
01:28:17,156 --> 01:28:18,418
After that when I went by train...

1006
01:28:18,491 --> 01:28:19,924
...there was nobody whom I knew.

1007
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,525
The compartment was
full of strangers.

1008
01:28:32,572 --> 01:28:34,631
So you are doing this
for those dead people.

1009
01:28:34,874 --> 01:28:39,777
No. I am not that
emotional and sentimental.

1010
01:28:40,847 --> 01:28:49,551
I always knew what loss is.
I have seen my relatives die.

1011
01:28:50,056 --> 01:28:54,755
But this is unacceptable.

1012
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:00,628
None of these b...
pardon my language...

1013
01:29:01,668 --> 01:29:06,002
But none of these bastards
will decide when I should die.

1014
01:29:08,207 --> 01:29:13,110
They are proud of '92
and '93 and of 2006.

1015
01:29:14,948 --> 01:29:18,111
They are proud of Gujarat,
Mumbai, Delhi and Malegoan.

1016
01:29:18,184 --> 01:29:21,210
I am proud of myself that
I am killing such people.

1017
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:25,485
I am not a saviour.

1018
01:29:25,558 --> 01:29:27,583
And I am not doing this
for anyone else but myself.

1019
01:29:29,829 --> 01:29:31,888
I only want that when my
child goes out he should...

1020
01:29:31,965 --> 01:29:36,595
...travel without fear on buses,
trains or anywhere else.

1021
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:38,228
I cannot understand you.

1022
01:29:38,504 --> 01:29:43,669
That's because my reasons
and demands are a bit strange.

1023
01:29:45,712 --> 01:29:47,907
Maybe.
- Be definite. Yes or no.

1024
01:29:50,583 --> 01:29:51,641
Yes.

1025
01:29:52,251 --> 01:29:54,583
If they kill 200 of
us then it is okay...

1026
01:29:54,654 --> 01:29:58,249
...but if I kill only 4
of them then it's strange?

1027
01:30:01,194 --> 01:30:02,593
This is not your fault.

1028
01:30:02,829 --> 01:30:04,763
This is what is
expected of a common man.

1029
01:30:04,831 --> 01:30:09,700
Live, tolerate and
die like a common man.

1030
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:14,535
Take yourself for example till the
time you did not know who I am...

1031
01:30:14,607 --> 01:30:18,134
...you were afraid of me
and taking me seriously.

1032
01:30:18,211 --> 01:30:20,202
And now that I have told
you I am a common man...

1033
01:30:20,279 --> 01:30:22,839
...you've got back some
confidence in your voice.

1034
01:30:23,016 --> 01:30:25,541
You must be thinking
this not a terrorist but...

1035
01:30:25,618 --> 01:30:29,179
...just a common man. I will easily
catch him. - No, that is not so.

1036
01:30:29,555 --> 01:30:33,821
It better not be because all the
bombs are still where they were.

1037
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,959
Mr. Rathod. Arif.

1038
01:30:36,562 --> 01:30:38,621
Now everything depends on you two...

1039
01:30:38,698 --> 01:30:39,995
...whether this would
be my last call or not.

1040
01:30:43,236 --> 01:30:46,967
Ten minutes later Naina Roy will
reach there with her cameraman.

1041
01:30:47,607 --> 01:30:49,837
There will also be a doctor
and an ambulance with them.

1042
01:30:50,576 --> 01:30:54,672
I want confirmed reports on
TVthat Ibrahim Khan is dead.

1043
01:30:56,315 --> 01:30:57,577
If this happens then
I will immediately...

1044
01:30:57,650 --> 01:30:59,948
...tell you where the bombs are.

1045
01:31:02,088 --> 01:31:05,683
But if it doesn't then you are
responsible for what happens next.

1046
01:31:15,601 --> 01:31:18,661
Arif, I'll call you back.
- Yes sir.

1047
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:25,675
Now what will you do?

1048
01:31:27,013 --> 01:31:29,811
First I will clean my ear.
I am finding it hard to hear.

1049
01:31:32,018 --> 01:31:33,713
Sir, I want you to
take this decision.

1050
01:31:38,291 --> 01:31:40,816
Do we have any other
choice than to do what he says?

1051
01:31:42,628 --> 01:31:43,686
No sir.

1052
01:31:44,363 --> 01:31:47,764
But it is wrong.
- That it is.

1053
01:31:51,104 --> 01:31:52,298
What else can I do?

1054
01:31:53,372 --> 01:31:54,634
We can do nothing.

1055
01:31:59,178 --> 01:32:00,236
What is all this?

1056
01:32:00,379 --> 01:32:02,108
Child, what is 2 + 2?

1057
01:32:02,648 --> 01:32:03,706
What?

1058
01:32:03,783 --> 01:32:06,843
Ten minutes from now you
will go to runway number 4 and...

1059
01:32:06,919 --> 01:32:09,387
...cover a very important news.

1060
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:12,652
Didn't I promise this would be...

1061
01:32:12,725 --> 01:32:15,023
...the most
important day of your life?

1062
01:32:16,963 --> 01:32:18,089
Go see for yourself.

1063
01:32:18,397 --> 01:32:20,661
Did you just address me as a child?

1064
01:32:20,733 --> 01:32:23,201
You have heard right. Bye.

1065
01:32:28,407 --> 01:32:31,843
He is a traitor! He knows nothing.

1066
01:32:32,411 --> 01:32:35,812
The matter is about our community.
Yours and mine.

1067
01:32:36,149 --> 01:32:37,878
It is about my brothers
and sisters and our home.

1068
01:32:38,684 --> 01:32:43,712
It is about our rights! If we
are together nobody can harm us.

1069
01:32:44,423 --> 01:32:46,789
Didn't we teach the Americans
and British a very good lesson?

1070
01:32:47,226 --> 01:32:48,284
Nobody could stop us.

1071
01:32:48,427 --> 01:32:50,292
But you made a
mistake by coming to India.

1072
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:53,694
A common man got a
bit upset and now...

1073
01:32:53,766 --> 01:32:56,200
...not only is he stopping you
but he is killing you as well.

1074
01:32:56,269 --> 01:32:57,327
I am not afraid to die...

1075
01:33:01,207 --> 01:33:04,370
I do not fear death. Why am I alive?

1076
01:33:05,111 --> 01:33:06,271
For a Cause.

1077
01:33:06,712 --> 01:33:09,408
And for that cause I am
willing to sacrifice myself.

1078
01:33:10,917 --> 01:33:16,446
But then I want to
live to wage this battle.

1079
01:33:17,123 --> 01:33:20,320
And for my brothers and sisters,
my community...

1080
01:33:22,929 --> 01:33:24,055
Why are you laughing?

1081
01:33:25,064 --> 01:33:27,225
I see that you are afraid of death.

1082
01:33:29,368 --> 01:33:33,168
This is an accident.
- Yes sir, this is an accident.

1083
01:33:34,974 --> 01:33:38,239
I must get a detailed report of
this accident by tomorrow morning.

1084
01:33:39,078 --> 01:33:40,136
Personally.

1085
01:33:40,746 --> 01:33:41,804
You will get it.

1086
01:33:59,232 --> 01:34:00,790
Sir!
- Heads!

1087
01:34:02,235 --> 01:34:03,293
Yes sir.

1088
01:34:26,459 --> 01:34:27,517
You should've told me first.

1089
01:34:27,827 --> 01:34:29,419
We don't have time. Look over there.

1090
01:34:47,546 --> 01:34:49,844
Did you trace the call?
- I am tracing it.

1091
01:34:59,558 --> 01:35:04,928
Sir, let him go. I was wrong.
He's not just good. He is the best.

1092
01:35:12,838 --> 01:35:16,137
Sir, I am not sure this is the man.

1093
01:35:16,509 --> 01:35:21,879
How similar is he? - I can...
- Is he at least 1 percent similar?

1094
01:35:23,349 --> 01:35:24,407
Sir...

1095
01:36:19,505 --> 01:36:22,906
Deepak, right now I am at
the Juhu Aviation Base where...

1096
01:36:22,975 --> 01:36:28,003
...four terrorists were
killed while trying to escape.

1097
01:36:28,147 --> 01:36:30,206
The names of these
terrorists are Khursheed Lala...

1098
01:36:30,282 --> 01:36:33,649
...lqlak Ahmed, Mohammad
Zaheer and Ibrahim Khan.

1099
01:36:33,919 --> 01:36:34,977
Naina Roy...

1100
01:36:46,999 --> 01:36:48,990
Mr. Rathod!
- Tell me.

1101
01:36:49,135 --> 01:36:52,434
I did not plant any other bomb.

1102
01:36:53,205 --> 01:36:55,571
I know that.
- Nice talking to you sir.

1103
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:58,167
In this operation a police inspector
has been seriously injured.

1104
01:37:58,404 --> 01:37:59,666
His name is Arif Khan.

1105
01:38:00,005 --> 01:38:02,098
You can see him right now
going into the ambulance.

1106
01:38:02,274 --> 01:38:04,333
And now we have with us
Inspector Jai Singh who...

1107
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:07,038
...will give us all the
information about this incident.

1108
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:09,070
Sir, tell us how did this happen?

1109
01:38:09,348 --> 01:38:12,010
As a routine process
we were shifting...

1110
01:38:12,084 --> 01:38:16,020
...these terrorists to another place.

1111
01:39:02,701 --> 01:39:04,566
Excuse me!
- Yes.

1112
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:09,335
What's the time?
My watch is not working.

1113
01:39:10,643 --> 01:39:11,701
5.30.

1114
01:39:12,678 --> 01:39:14,077
Your bag seems quite heavy.

1115
01:39:14,146 --> 01:39:15,204
Excuse me.

1116
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:19,311
Yes, tell me.

1117
01:39:19,518 --> 01:39:21,076
Have you left or not?

1118
01:39:21,153 --> 01:39:22,711
I was just leaving
when I met someone.

1119
01:39:22,788 --> 01:39:24,483
Who is it? A friend of yours?

1120
01:39:24,557 --> 01:39:25,615
I don't know yet.

1121
01:39:25,691 --> 01:39:28,387
Please come home. It's getting late.
- I am on my way.

1122
01:39:29,495 --> 01:39:32,430
Sorry. Were you saying something?

1123
01:39:33,132 --> 01:39:34,759
I was saying your
bag seems quite heavy.

1124
01:39:35,401 --> 01:39:37,426
Can I drop you somewhere?
That's my vehicle.

1125
01:39:38,837 --> 01:39:40,236
That police jeep?

1126
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:44,366
Yes.
- No thanks. I live nearby.

1127
01:39:45,311 --> 01:39:46,369
Are you sure?
- Sure.

1128
01:39:53,385 --> 01:39:54,443
Prakash Rathod.

1129
01:40:00,125 --> 01:40:01,183
I am...

1130
01:40:02,861 --> 01:40:04,192
He told me his name...

1131
01:40:04,263 --> 01:40:07,289
...but I can't tell
that name to anybody...

1132
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,600
A man recognizes
the religion by name.

1133
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:13,866
We all knew that a common man
is disturbed by these things.

1134
01:40:14,607 --> 01:40:19,340
But never ever imagined that a
common man can go to such stage.

1135
01:40:20,412 --> 01:40:22,277
One common man had the guts.

1136
01:40:23,148 --> 01:40:25,742
This incident and this case
is not registered in any file.

1137
01:40:26,218 --> 01:40:29,278
There is no record anywhere,
but it is in my mind...

1138
01:40:29,355 --> 01:40:34,190
...and some people who were
involved in this case unwillingly.

1139
01:40:34,627 --> 01:40:37,687
I don't know if it
is right or wrong...

1140
01:40:37,763 --> 01:40:41,255
...but personally speaking,
whatever it was. It was good.
