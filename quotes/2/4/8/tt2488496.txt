Han Solo: What was your job when you were based here?
Finn: Sanitation.
Han Solo: Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?
Finn: I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.
Han Solo: People are counting on us. The galaxy is counting on us.
Finn: Solo, we'll figure it out. We'll use the Force.
Han Solo: That's not how the Force works!
Han Solo: Chewie... we're home.
Rey: This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs?
Han Solo: Twelve!
Han Solo: Fourteen.
Finn: What should we do with her?
Han Solo: Is there a garbage chute... or trash compactor?
Rey: You will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.
FN-1824: What did you say?
Rey: You will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.
FN-1824: I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum.
Rey: You will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.
FN-1824: I will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.
Rey: And you'll drop your weapon.
FN-1824: And I'll drop my weapon.
Han Solo: This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him.
Rey: Why did he leave?
Han Solo: He was training a new generation of Jedi. There was nobody else left to do it, so he took the burden on himself. Everything was going great, until... one boy, an apprentice, turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible. He just walked away from everything.
Finn: Do you know what happened to him?
Han Solo: There were a lot of rumors. Stories. People who knew him best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple.
Rey: The Jedi were real?
Han Solo: I used to wonder about that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo jumbo. A magical power holding together good and evil, the dark side and the light. Crazy thing is... it's true. The Force, the Jedi. All of it. It's all true.
Rey: Are you offering me a job?
Han Solo: I wouldn't be nice to you. Doesn't pay much.
Rey: You're offering me a job.
Han Solo: I'm thinking about it.
Finn: Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what we're walking into here...
Han Solo: Did you just call me Solo?
Finn: Sorry. Han. Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? Like, First Order sympathizers?
Han Solo: Listen, Big Deal. You got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Always.
Obi-Wan Kenobi: Rey? These are your first steps.
Rey: You. You're afraid. That you will never be as strong as Darth Vader.
Title card/crawl: Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence, the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the ashes of the Empire and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed. With the support of the REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is desperate to find her brother Luke and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy. Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret mission to Jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts...
Luke Skywalker: The Force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it. My sister has it. You have that power, too.
Finn: Can you fly a TIE Fighter?
Poe Dameron: I can fly anything.
Finn: You said poisonous gas.
Rey: I fixed that.
Finn: Can you unfix it?
Leia: You know, no matter how much we fought... I've always hated watching you leave.
Han Solo: That's why I did it. So you'd miss me.
Leia: I did miss you.
Han Solo: I've got a bad feeling about this.
Rey: I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy.
Finn: You remember me?
Captain Phasma: FN-2187.
Finn: Not anymore. The name's Finn and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge.
Han Solo: Bring it down. Bring it down.
Poe Dameron: Wha- why? Why are you helping me?
Finn: Because it's the right thing to do.
Poe Dameron: You need a pilot.
Finn: I need a pilot.
Maz Kanata: Han Solo!
Han Solo: Oh, boy.
Han Solo: Hey, Maz.
Maz Kanata: Where's my boyfriend?
Han Solo: Chewie's working on the Falcon.
Maz Kanata: I like that Wookiee.
Han Solo: Okay. How do we blow it up? There's always a way to do that.
Han Solo: Who had it? Ducain?
Rey: I stole it. From Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain.
Han Solo: Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him that Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good.
Kylo Ren: The droid... stole a freighter?
Kylo Ren: Forgive me. I feel it again... The pull to the light... Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again... The power of the darkness... And I'll let nothing stand in our way... Show me... Grandfather... and I will finish... what you started.
Rey: This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo?
Han Solo: I used to be.
Kylo Ren: That lightsaber... It belongs to me.
Finn: Come get it.
Chewbacca: Han Solo: Oh, really? You're cold?
Finn: Han Solo, the Rebellion general?
Rey: No, the smuggler!
Finn: Wasn't he a war hero?
Chewbacca: A-ah-nah.
C-3PO: Oh, my dear friend, how I've missed you.
Han Solo: You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me!
Finn: Hurt him? He almost killed me six times!
Finn: Which is fine!
Rey: What are you gonna do?
Han Solo: Same thing I always do. Talk my way out of it.
Han Solo: Yes, I do. Every time.
Finn: We came back for you.
Finn: What'd he say?
Rey: That it was your idea.
Rey: Thank you.
Finn: How did you get away?
Rey: I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it.
Han Solo: Escape now, hug later.
Leia: Rey. May the Force be with you.
General Hux: Supreme Leader. The fuel cells have ruptured. The collapse of the planet has begun.
Supreme Leader Snoke: Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren. It is time... to complete his training.
Maz Kanata: That lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him. And now, it calls to you.
Finn: I can do this. I can do this.
Rey: I can do this. I can do this.
Rey: Where do you come from?
Rey: Classified, really? Me too. Big secret.
Finn: Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm.
Poe Dameron: I am calm.
Finn: I'm talking to myself.
Maz Kanata: If you live long enough, you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run.
Finn: You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen. You don't know the First Order like I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run.
Maz Kanata: Hmm.
Rey: We'll see each other again. I believe that.
Rey: Thank you, my friend.
Han Solo: You changed your hair.
Leia: Same jacket.
Han Solo: No, new jacket.
Lor San Tekka: This will begin to make things right. I've traveled too far and seen too much to ignore the despair in the galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force.
Poe Dameron: Well, because of you, now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time.
Lor San Tekka: Oh, the General? To me, she is royalty.
Poe Dameron: Well, she certainly is that.
C-3PO: Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, C-3PO. You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm.
C-3PO: Look who it is, did you see who... Um...
C-3PO: Uh...
C-3PO: Um... Excuse me, Princ... General. Sorry. Come along, BB-8 quickly.
C-3PO: Yes. I must get my proper arm reinstalled.
Han Solo: Hey, can I try that?
Han Solo: I like this thing.
Finn: You can understand that thing?
Han Solo: And "that thing" can understand you, too, so watch it.
Finn: I'm not who you think I am.
Rey: Finn, what are you talking about?
Finn: I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a stormtrooper. Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know. And raised to do one thing. But my first battle, I made a choice. I wasn't gonna kill for them. So I ran. Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me.
Rey: Don't go.
Finn: Take care of yourself. Please.
Finn: I need help with this giant hairy thing!
Kylo Ren: We're not done yet.
Rey: You're a monster!
Kylo Ren: It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you.
Leia: Hope is not lost today... it is found.
Finn: All right, between us... I'm not with the Resistance, okay?
Finn: I'm just trying to get away from the First Order. But you tell us where the base is, I'll get you there first. Deal?
Finn: Droid, please!
Kylo Ren: TRAITOR!
Rey: Where am I?
Kylo Ren: You're my guest.
Rey: Where are the others?
Kylo Ren: Do you mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends? You'll be relieved to hear I have no idea.
Kylo Ren: You still want to kill me.
Rey: That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask.
Kylo Ren: Tell me about the droid.
Rey: He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.
Kylo Ren: It's carrying a section of a navigational chart. And we have the rest. Recovered from the archives of the Empire, but we need the last piece. And, somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger.
Leia: Can't believe I was so foolish to think I could find Luke and bring him home.
Han Solo: Leia.
Leia: Don't do that.
Han Solo: Do what?
Leia: Anything.
C-3PO: Princesses.
Han Solo: I'm trying to be helpful.
Leia: When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star.
Han Solo: You might need this.
Rey: I think I can handle myself.
Han Solo: I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. You know how to use one of those?
Rey: Yeah. You pull the trigger.
Han Solo: Little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn.
Maz Kanata: Dear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku... they're never coming back... But... there's someone who still could.
Rey: Luke.
Maz Kanata: The belonging you seek is not behind you... it is ahead. I am no Jedi, but I know the Force. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes... Feel it... The light... it's always been there. It will guide you. The saber. Take it.
Rey: I'm never touching that thing again. I don't want any part of this.
Supreme Leader Snoke: The scavenger... resisted you?
Kylo Ren: She is strong with the Force.
Han Solo: Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line.
Rey: Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake, too. Puts too much...
Han Solo, Rey: ...stress on the hyperdrive.
Han Solo: Move, ball.
Finn: Wasn't he a war hero?
Kylo Ren: You need a teacher. I can show you the ways of the Force.
Rey: The Force?
Kylo Ren: You're so lonely... So afraid to leave... At night, desperate to sleep... You imagine an ocean... I see it... I see the island... And Han Solo... You feel like he's the father you never had. He would have disappointed you.
Rey: Get out of my head.
Finn: Where are we going?
Poe Dameron: We're going back to Jakku. That's where.
Finn: No, no, no. We can't go back to Jakku. We need to get out of this system.
Poe Dameron: I gotta get my droid before the First Order does.
Finn: What, a droid?
Poe Dameron: That's right. He's a BB unit, orange and white. One of a kind.
Finn: I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important.
Poe Dameron: This one is, pal!
Finn: We gotta get as far away from the First Order as we can. We go back to Jakku, we die.
Poe Dameron: That droid has a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker.
Finn: Oh, you gotta be kidding me!
Kylo Ren: I will fulfill our destiny.
Rey: We need your help.
Han Solo: My help?
Rey: This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible.
Finn: He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.
Finn: You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion.
Finn: You know him.
Han Solo: Yeah. I knew him. I knew Luke.
Han Solo: Where'd you get this ship?
Rey: Niima Outpost.
Han Solo: Jakku? That junkyard?
Finn: Thank you! Junkyard.
Han Solo: Told you we should have double-checked the Western Reaches.
Han Solo: Watch the thrust. We're going out of here at lightspeed.
Rey: From inside the hangar? Is that even possible?
Han Solo: I never ask that question 'till after I've done it.
Han Solo: This is *not* how I thought this day was going to go.
Rey: Nice shooting.
Finn: Now that was some flying.
Rey: Thanks.
Finn: How did you do that?
Rey: I don't know.
Finn: No one trained you?
Rey: I've flown some ships, but I've never left the planet.
Finn: No one? That was amazing.
Rey: Your last shot was dead on.
Finn: You set me up for it.
Rey: You got him with one blast!
Finn: That was pretty good.
Rey: It was perfect.
Finn: It had me! But the door...
Rey: That was lucky.
Captain Phasma: You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all.
Finn: I disagree. What do we do with her?
Han Solo: Is there a garbage chute? Trash compactor?
Finn: Yeah, there is.
Poe Dameron: What's your name?
Finn: FN-2187.
Finn: That's the only name they ever gave me.
Poe Dameron: Well, I'm not going to call you that. Let's see... FN... I'm going to call you Finn. How about that
Finn: Yeah, Finn. I like that.
Chewbacca, Finn, Rey: NOOOO!
Rey: So you're with the Resistance?
Finn: Obviously. Yes, I am. I'm with the Resistance, yeah.
Finn: I am with the Resistance.
Rey: I've never met a Resistance fighter before.
Finn: Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different.
Rey: BB-8 says he's on a secret mission. He has to get back to your base.
Finn: Apparently, he has a map that leads to Luke Skywalker and everyone's after it.
Rey: Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth.
Han Solo: You think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata's our best bet.
Finn: We can trust her, right?
Han Solo: Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare.
Rey, Finn: At what?
Han Solo: Any of it.
General Hux: Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must.
Kylo Ren: How capable are your soldiers, General?
General Hux: I won't have you question my methods.
Kylo Ren: They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army.
General Hux: My men are exceptionally trained. Programmed from birth.
Kylo Ren: Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. Unharmed.
General Hux: Careful, Ren, that your personal interests not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke.
Kylo Ren: I want that map. For your sake... I suggest you get it.
Han Solo: Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... Every time you look at me you're reminded of him.
Leia: You think I want to forget him? I want him back.
Han Solo: There's nothing more we could have done. There's too much Vader in him.
Leia: That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both.
Han Solo: We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever any good at.
Leia: We both did.
Han Solo: We lost our son. Forever.
Leia: No. It was Snoke. He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You.
Han Solo: If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?
Leia: Luke is a Jedi. You're his father. There is still light in him, I know it.
Finn: I can disable the shields, but I have to be there. On the planet.
Han Solo: We'll get you there.
Leia: Han, how?
Han Solo: If I told you, you wouldn't like it.
Poe Dameron: That's my jacket.
Finn: Oh...
Poe Dameron: No, no, no, no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man, Finn.
Bala-Tik: Kanjiklub wants their investment back too.
Han Solo: I never made a deal with Kanjuklub!
Bala-Tik: Tell that to Kanjiklub.
Han Solo: Tasu Leech. Good to see you.
Tasu Leech: Wrong again, Solo. It's over for you.
Han Solo: Boys, you're both gonna get what I promised. Have I ever not delivered for you before?
Bala-Tik: Yeah.
Tasu Leech: Twice!
Han Solo: What was the second time?
Han Solo: Oh, don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.
Finn: Wait, what? Did you just say Rathtars? Hey! You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you?
Han Solo: I'm hauling Rathtars. Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang. Must have tracked us from Nantoon.
Rey: What's a Rathtar?
Han Solo: They're big and they're dangerous.
Finn: You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?
Rey: No.
Finn: Good.
Finn: How are we getting in?
Han Solo: Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through.
Finn: We're making our landing approach at lightspeed?
Rey: I don't know your name.
Finn: Finn, what's yours?
Rey: I'm Rey.
Kylo Ren: I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. Comfortable?
Poe Dameron: Not really.
Kylo Ren: I'm impressed. No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map.
Poe Dameron: You might want to rethink your technique.
Poe Dameron: I've always wanted to fly one of these things. Can you shoot?
Finn: Blasters, I can.
Poe Dameron: Okay, same principle. Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons, and mag pulse. Use the sight on the right to aim, triggers to fire.
Finn: This is very complicated.
Finn: That's one hell of a pilot!
Han Solo: Hey, where are you going?
Rey: Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump, too. If we don't prime that, we're not going anywhere.
Han Solo: I hate that guy.
Han Solo: Finn, be careful with those. They're explosives.
Finn: Now you tell me?
Kylo Ren: Where is it?
Poe Dameron: The Resistance will not be intimidated by you.
Kylo Ren: Where - is it?
Maz Kanata: I've had this for ages. Kept it locked away.
Han Solo: Where did you get that?
Maz Kanata: A good question - for another time. Take it. Find your friend.
Finn: Water. Water.
Jakku Merchant: No water.
Finn: Water.
Finn: Is there water?
Finn: What about you?
Rey: I've got to get back to Jakku.
Finn: Back to Jak-! Why does everyone want to go back to Jakku?
Supreme Leader Snoke: The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance, leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise!
Rey: What fight?
Maz Kanata: The only fight. Against the dark side. Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadow's spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them! All of us.
Poe Dameron: We've got company. You have to hide.
Lor San Tekka: You have to leave.
Rey: Get ready!
Finn: Okay. For what? Are we really doing this?
Finn: Rey, you're a pilot You can fly anywhere. Why go back? You got a family? You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?
Rey: None of your business, that's why!
Rey: Do they have blasters?
Finn: A lot of them.
Rey: This was a mistake.
Finn: Huge!
Rey: What do they look like?
Finn: They look like that!
Han Solo: That's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.
Finn: What are you doing? Solo, what is she doing?
Han Solo: I don't know; but, it ain't good.
Maz Kanata: Who's the girl?
Kylo Ren: The girl I've heard so much about. The droid - where is it?
Stormtrooper: Sir, Resistance fighters. We need more troops.
Kylo Ren: Pull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need.
Han Solo: I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here.
C-3PO: General, I regret to inform you, but, this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. And even worse, it matches no chartered system on record. We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke.
Kylo Ren: You know I can take whatever I want.
Supreme Leader Snoke: If what you say about this girl is true, bring - her - to - me.
Han Solo: We disable the shields. Can you work there? What have you got?
Finn: I can do it.
Han Solo: I like this guy.
Finn: I can disable the shields, but, I have to be there, on the planet.
Han Solo: We'll get you there.
Leia: Han, how?
Han Solo: If I told you, you wouldn't like it.
Chewbacca: Arrrrrrrrr!
Han Solo: If I get any higher, they'll see us!
Han Solo: The girl knows her stuff!
C-3PO: The map - it is complete!
Leia: Luke!
Han Solo: Ben!
Kylo Ren: Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Han Solo: Take off that mask. You don't need it.
Kylo Ren: What do you think you'll see if I do?
Han Solo: The face of my son.
Kylo Ren: Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish like his father, so I destroyed him.
Han Solo: That's what Snoke wants you to believe, but it's not true. My son is alive.
Kylo Ren: No. The Supreme Leader is wise.
Han Solo: Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you. You know it's true.
Kylo Ren: It's too late.
Han Solo: No, it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you.
Kylo Ren: I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me?
Han Solo: Yes. Anything.
Finn: What about that ship?
Rey: That one's garbage
Finn: The garbage will do
Poe Dameron: ...Do I talk first or you talk first? I talk first?
General Hux: Today is the end of the Republic. The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder. At this very moment in a system far from here, the New Republic lies to the galaxy while secretly supporting the treachery of the rogues of the Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate, to their cherished fleet. All remaining systems will bow to the First Order and will remember this as the last day of the Republic!
Kylo Ren: Look how old you've become.
Lor San Tekka: Something far worse has happened to you.
Kylo Ren: You know what I've come for.
Lor San Tekka: I know where you come from, before you called yourself "Kylo Ren".
Kylo Ren: The map to Skywalker. We know you found it. And now you're going to give it to the First Order.
Lor San Tekka: The First Order rose from the Dark Side. You did not.
Kylo Ren: I'll show you the Dark Side.
Lor San Tekka: You may try. But you cannot the truth that is your family.
Kylo Ren: You're so right.
Leia: Luke is a Jedi, but you are his father.
Han Solo: BEN!
Kylo Ren: Han Solo
Supreme Leader Snoke: There has been an awakening. Have you felt it?
Kylo Ren: Yes.
Supreme Leader Snoke: The dark side, and the light. The droid you seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon in the hands of your father, Han... Solo.
Kylo Ren: He means nothing to me.
Supreme Leader Snoke: Even the Knights of Ren have never faced such a test.
Kylo Ren: By the grace of your training I will not be seduced.
Supreme Leader Snoke: We shall see, Kylo Ren. We shall see.
