1
00:03:04,423 --> 00:03:09,702
Our bosun's mate.
Been on quite a bender tonight.

2
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:20,213
Who are those pigs?

3
00:03:33,543 --> 00:03:37,138
Their fireboat drill.
They're all from my boat.

4
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:02,863
Captain.

5
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:13,416
Marten's crew.
They move out at dawn.

6
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:25,222
It's time to find ourselves
a little French quail.

7
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:30,741
Do you know how to flush it out?

8
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:36,023
They're scared. They comfort
themselves in women and schnapps.

9
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:40,973
- What's going on here?
- Ready... Fire!

10
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:52,813
- Sir.
- My second officer.

11
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:59,741
This is Lieutenant Werner.
War correspondent.

12
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:06,900
He'll ship out with us, and report
the truth about life on a submarine.

13
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:12,698
- Welcome on board, Lieutenant.
- Good evening.

14
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:21,502
Come and have a drink with us.

15
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:27,935
- Good evening, Captain.
- Two beers, please.

16
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:47,458
Where's our friend Thomsen?
He should be celebrating his medal.

17
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:54,138
Have you talked to your wife?

18
00:05:57,063 --> 00:06:01,534
No calls to Germany
before 10 o'clock.

19
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,616
- Two beers.
- Thanks.

20
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:12,781
Captain.

21
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:20,335
My report from U96, sir.
All provisions and arms aboard.

22
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:24,462
- Thank you.
- One more thing, Captain.

23
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:32,934
On the way here
some of the crew molested me.

24
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:38,496
It was... quite outrageous.

25
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:42,771
- They stopped me and...
- You were initiated?

26
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:48,373
- Exactly.
- Me, too.

27
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:58,298
May I have your attention?
Silence would be appreciated!

28
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:04,254
I'd like to call on Lt. Thomsen,
our latest hero!

29
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:21,982
Thomsen is from the old guard.
He's always drunk now.

30
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:46,252
Quiet in this whorehouse!

31
00:07:53,983 --> 00:08:01,776
To our wonderful... abstaining...
womanless Fuhrer, -

32
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:08,178
- who rose gloriously
from an apprentice painter -

33
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,094
- to become the world's
greatest battle strategist.

34
00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:16,778
Isn't it true?

35
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:25,453
He's a great naval expert.
Who, in his infinite wisdom...

36
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:37,412
How does it go again?

37
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:43,499
Our great Fuhrer has been showing
their English bed-wetter...

38
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:48,100
...the cigar-chomping
asshole Churchill...

39
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:54,975
...where exactly to go
and stick his stinking cigars.

40
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,697
Excuse me.

41
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:40,220
I'll see you in the morning.
I must phone home.

42
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:58,776
Phillip, the old bunch has gone.

43
00:09:58,943 --> 00:10:06,338
Look at these new heroes.
All wind and smoke. Big mouths.

44
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:09,620
Yeah, yeah...

45
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:14,413
Cheeks together.
Balls in hand.

46
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:19,498
And the belief in our Fuhrer
in their eyes.

47
00:10:19,663 --> 00:10:22,735
They will know in time.

48
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:15,301
Combat! Conquer! Order!

49
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:35,377
Come on, Phillip.
Give me a hand. Help me get him up.

50
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:47,577
I wanted to really...
screw my brains out tonight, -

51
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:52,134
- but I'm not
in any condition to fuck.

52
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:10,733
That's Thomsen's boat.
Find anything wrong with our boat?

53
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:15,931
- The propeller plate was banged.
- I see.

54
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:22,815
- That explains the whining noise.
- We've got a brand new one.

55
00:12:54,383 --> 00:12:57,614
That's our boat.

56
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:05,655
Stand by for inspection! Attention!
Eyes left!

57
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:17,257
All hands present and accounted for.
The boat is clear for sea, Captain.

58
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:20,654
Thank you, Number One.

59
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:28,342
At ease.

60
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:48,096
Well, men...

61
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:52,697
- All set?
- All set, sir!

62
00:13:55,463 --> 00:14:01,015
We have a guest on board.
Lt. Werner.

63
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:07,941
A war correspondent.
He has even brought his camera.

64
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:20,852
He is writing about war heroes.
See you remember your manners.

65
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:27,053
- Aye-aye, sir!
- Harbour stations, men.

66
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:16,932
Sink them all!

67
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:43,960
Get those crates out of here!

68
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:46,418
This isn't a vegetable garden.

69
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:50,417
Fish store, where we maintain
and store the torpedoes.

70
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:54,735
- You're going to be in the papers!
- Thank you, men.

71
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:59,897
Follow me. Here we have the can.
Just one for 50 men.

72
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:05,774
The other one's full of provisions.
You can't eat shit. Logical, no?

73
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:13,497
Here's the Chief Petty Officer's
quarters. My home away from home.

74
00:16:13,663 --> 00:16:18,532
- I've brought plenty of books.
- You have it really cosy here.

75
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:23,652
- Where are you, Lieutenant?
- I hope you don't get sea sick.

76
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:29,853
Here's the radio and the hydrophone.
The eyes and ears of the boat.

77
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:35,700
Here's the control room.
The boat's command post.

78
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:42,098
Through here, Lieutenant.

79
00:16:43,183 --> 00:16:46,220
Wake up, you've got company.

80
00:16:46,383 --> 00:16:49,693
Good morning, Lieutenant.

81
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:53,936
The petty officers' bunk
sleeps 12 men.

82
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:57,698
Two to a bunk.
One sleeps while one is on duty.

83
00:16:57,863 --> 00:17:02,891
One man comes off watch and
climbs into the other man's stink.

84
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:08,342
You've got a bunk to yourself
since you're a guest on board.

85
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:12,781
- Here.
- This is your escape gear.

86
00:17:12,943 --> 00:17:18,575
- You can use it in the shower.
- The mask helps out with the stink.

87
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:22,452
Of Frenssen's feet!

88
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:26,013
Come on.

89
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:33,382
This is our galley.
And here's Johann, our phantom.

90
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:40,456
Johann, everything in order?

91
00:17:41,063 --> 00:17:46,615
- Permission to come up?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

92
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:10,140
It's better to take photos
on our return from the mission.

93
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,773
What do you mean?

94
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:17,731
They'll have grown beards by then.

95
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,858
The British will be ashamed
to see these shaven faces.

96
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:38,132
Pale-faced kids.
Innocents dragged from mama's skirt.

97
00:18:42,143 --> 00:18:46,182
Sailing with them
makes you feel so old.

98
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:53,736
It's like a children's crusade.

99
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:05,217
- Permission to pass, sir.
- Carry on.

100
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:09,171
<i>- Bon appetit.
- Thank you.</i>

101
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:36,820
- From Mexico, aren't you?
- Yes. South of Mexico City.

102
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:43,536
- Good there?
- Very nice. Good climate.

103
00:19:55,503 --> 00:20:01,817
- Quite a way.
- As a German, I had to come.

104
00:20:03,823 --> 00:20:09,580
- Did you work there?
- On my step-parents' plantation.

105
00:20:11,263 --> 00:20:15,700
- You're the boss's son?
- You could say so.

106
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:22,180
<i>- Stand by, first watch.
- Excuse me.</i>

107
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:27,737
Can I get by?

108
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:39,253
Permission to go on watch, Captain.

109
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:47,891
A new breed, our Mexican recruit.

110
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:55,661
A young machine.
He follows orders without question.

111
00:20:55,823 --> 00:21:01,295
He's so uptight he could
crack nuts with his butt cheeks.

112
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:17,014
- Permission to come up?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

113
00:21:17,183 --> 00:21:19,856
Stand by main vents.

114
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:30,415
- Shut out main engines!
- All hands forward!

115
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:37,216
All hands forward!
Come on, move it.

116
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:42,537
Come on, move! Move! Faster!

117
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:45,740
Get a move on, you guys!

118
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:52,579
It's an alarm, not a blasted cruise!
Get into diving positions!

119
00:22:09,183 --> 00:22:12,493
Blow negative tank.

120
00:22:14,343 --> 00:22:18,336
Stern planes ease to 10 degrees.

121
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:34,298
Not bad. Practice makes perfect.
It keeps you from getting rusty.

122
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:37,057
A practice drill.

123
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:44,179
- Level off, Chief.
- Bow up 15. Stern up 10.

124
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:47,540
Planes on zero.

125
00:22:49,663 --> 00:22:53,702
- Levelled off, sir.
- Shut all main vents.

126
00:22:54,863 --> 00:23:01,302
- Main vents shut.
- Dive. Let's see how she does.

127
00:23:02,983 --> 00:23:05,781
Bow planes down 15. Stern up 10.

128
00:23:14,303 --> 00:23:21,618
The boat is rated to 90 metres,
but of course we could go deeper.

129
00:23:31,663 --> 00:23:36,862
There's a limit somewhere.
We can only take so much pressure -

130
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:42,222
- before the boat will be crushed.

131
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:58,500
Check all valves.

132
00:24:01,703 --> 00:24:05,013
Check all valves.

133
00:24:05,183 --> 00:24:08,812
- The pressure.
- Yeah, sure.

134
00:24:16,143 --> 00:24:19,055
Deeper.

135
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:23,659
140 metres.

136
00:24:28,623 --> 00:24:33,743
- She must take this depth.
- 150.

137
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,340
160 metres.

138
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:52,892
- That'll do for now. Surface.
- Bow up 10. Stern up 5.

139
00:24:53,063 --> 00:24:56,214
Our journalist is sweating.

140
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:38,534
Your girl?

141
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:45,059
French girl?

142
00:25:51,143 --> 00:25:57,616
Do you know the flower shop
beside Caf A l'Ami Pierrot?

143
00:25:57,783 --> 00:26:01,662
- A l'Ami Pierrot.
- Sure, I know it.

144
00:26:01,823 --> 00:26:05,862
The two pretty salesgirls.
Jeannette and...

145
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,060
Francoise.

146
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:14,942
Nobody knows... but we're engaged.

147
00:26:15,103 --> 00:26:18,061
Unofficially.

148
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:26,860
Can I see?

149
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:33,256
Very pretty. Really.

150
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,614
What's wrong?

151
00:26:43,823 --> 00:26:47,213
She's pregnant.

152
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:54,452
Don't you know what that means?

153
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:58,696
If the resistance finds out?
A German baby.

154
00:26:58,863 --> 00:27:05,575
I told her,
but she wants to have it.

155
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:13,334
- She wants a baby.
- You've got problems, friend.

156
00:27:59,863 --> 00:28:06,018
Our masters spend all their time
finding Churchill new nicknames.

157
00:28:06,183 --> 00:28:08,902
What's the latest?

158
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:15,179
Drunken pig.

159
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:18,255
Fat boy.

160
00:28:18,423 --> 00:28:21,415
Paralytic.

161
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:26,577
For a drunken paralytic
he's putting up a damn good fight.

162
00:28:26,743 --> 00:28:32,340
We'll cut the swine to shreds.
That is my firm belief.

163
00:28:35,943 --> 00:28:42,815
Listen, smart guy. Mr. Churchill
is a long way from shreds.

164
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:49,021
I'd like to know how many
of his ships are getting through -

165
00:28:49,183 --> 00:28:53,415
- while we sit on our behinds
waiting for orders.

166
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:57,496
Our patrol planes.
Where are they, Herr Gring?

167
00:28:57,663 --> 00:29:04,535
The British have plenty of them.
Talking big is all he's good for.

168
00:29:09,143 --> 00:29:13,341
Big heroes.
Nothing but hot air... all of them.

169
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:28,098
Put that one down. It'll make
exciting reading in your epic.

170
00:29:31,143 --> 00:29:35,455
The Propaganda Ministry
will love it.

171
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:39,013
Music we need.

172
00:29:39,183 --> 00:29:44,576
Do you think our Hitler Youth leader
might put a record on for us?

173
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:51,297
The "Tipperary" song
if you have no objections.

174
00:29:59,183 --> 00:30:05,895
- That stuff makes me puke.
- Now we're in the Royal Navy.

175
00:30:16,383 --> 00:30:19,819
A record won't make you
into the king of England.

176
00:30:34,343 --> 00:30:38,416
- Shut the door, you lazy pig!
- Stupid jerk!

177
00:30:39,783 --> 00:30:45,733
They should use him as a doorstop,
his rear end's big enough.

178
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:52,900
One day he'll stick it in the can
and he'll never get it out again.

179
00:30:56,183 --> 00:31:01,416
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Lieutenant.

180
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:06,853
- It stinks in here.
- Sweaty feet and hair grease.

181
00:31:07,023 --> 00:31:11,414
Pilgrim's specialty.

182
00:31:16,983 --> 00:31:23,013
Smells just like old socks...
these rotten eggs.

183
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:31,379
- Baby poo-poo.
- Pilgrim needs a chicken house.

184
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:35,377
Right. Ducks in the bilge.
Sweet little ducklings.

185
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:40,617
We could fatten them up
with jam from your filthy feet.

186
00:31:40,783 --> 00:31:48,258
They'd have good fun
feeding on Frenssen's toe jam.

187
00:32:18,543 --> 00:32:22,661
Aid to cleanliness, four letters?

188
00:32:24,383 --> 00:32:27,898
Bath.

189
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:32,341
Thank you.

190
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:41,940
A desert animal with two humps?

191
00:32:43,943 --> 00:32:47,902
- Camel.
- Perfect.

192
00:32:57,143 --> 00:33:02,854
Intellectual starvation I would say.

193
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:14,016
It's completed, sir. Signal decoded.

194
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:24,979
One moment.

195
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:58,852
It could just about do it.
Five, six, seven...

196
00:34:00,263 --> 00:34:04,415
- Eight.
- New course, sir?

197
00:34:08,823 --> 00:34:11,621
One minute.

198
00:34:15,223 --> 00:34:18,932
What's the signal position, sir?

199
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:27,580
"Convoy square at AK 22,46."

200
00:34:27,743 --> 00:34:33,375
"Mean course: 60 degrees.
Speed: 8 knots. U-boat 37."

201
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:38,219
U-boat 37. That's Marten's boat
moving in to attack.

202
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:48,538
- Too far away. We'd never make it.
- Bad luck.

203
00:34:49,743 --> 00:34:54,692
Damn it!
When do we get some orders?

204
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:08,222
Come on, pull it out!
Slap more grease on it!

205
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:13,298
- For your journal?
- Yes, wonderful stuff.

206
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:16,455
You there, this way a moment.

207
00:35:16,623 --> 00:35:22,380
It's nicely greased with vaseline.
We're ready to ram it in!

208
00:35:22,543 --> 00:35:27,822
Can you just look this way?
Yes, good.

209
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:35,900
Not quite so fast. This way. Great!

210
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:41,854
Stay here in the foreground.
Let's have some with a different...

211
00:35:53,463 --> 00:35:56,455
Who did that?

212
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:01,297
Who did that?

213
00:36:46,543 --> 00:36:52,015
Tell me now...
Have you got any hairs up your nose?

214
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:57,900
- Why?
- I've got some up mine.

215
00:36:58,063 --> 00:37:02,022
Maybe we could knit them together.

216
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:15,019
"2nd November, 1941.
Dear Francoise... "

217
00:37:26,823 --> 00:37:33,171
"20th day at sea. "

218
00:37:33,343 --> 00:37:37,734
- Alarm!
- Alarm!

219
00:37:39,183 --> 00:37:44,098
- Hatch secured!
- All main vents open!

220
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:49,178
- Shadow off the starboard beam.
- Take her down 30 metres.

221
00:37:49,343 --> 00:37:54,656
Bring her up easy.
Planes on zero.

222
00:37:54,823 --> 00:38:00,659
- Anything on the starboard beam?
- Propeller sounds.

223
00:38:09,063 --> 00:38:12,021
110 degrees.

224
00:38:16,183 --> 00:38:19,812
Way aft of us.

225
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:31,572
Contact growing fainter.

226
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:42,374
Fading fast, sir.

227
00:38:47,543 --> 00:38:55,575
Right... we'd better stay down now.
Steer 120.

228
00:38:59,823 --> 00:39:05,819
A lone ship traveling fast.
We have no chance in this light.

229
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:33,062
"It's more than superficial to take
care in personal appearance. "

230
00:39:33,223 --> 00:39:38,581
"It denotes that the inner man
is wholesome and upstanding. "

231
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:45,660
"An officer should be unpretentious
in his dress and deportment. "

232
00:39:45,823 --> 00:39:50,658
"In the old days young officers
were treated indulgently in this. "

233
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:56,181
"Knowing they risked their lives,
their superiors... "

234
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:59,221
It's comfortable here.

235
00:39:59,383 --> 00:40:03,217
No mail. No telephone.

236
00:40:03,383 --> 00:40:09,572
A well-ventilated boat.
Solid wood panelling.

237
00:40:12,303 --> 00:40:17,536
Free food, too.
We're in clover here.

238
00:40:17,703 --> 00:40:21,742
Like fresh horse droppings.

239
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:27,978
They're rolling in clover, too.
No need to work.

240
00:40:28,143 --> 00:40:32,182
They're even allowed to smoke.

241
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:57,100
U-boat special cocktail.
Want some?

242
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,415
Stop that!

243
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:33,498
Our recent triumphs.

244
00:41:33,663 --> 00:41:37,542
"Dived to evade enemy aircraft. "

245
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:43,778
"Dived to avoid destroyer.
Depth charged. "

246
00:41:49,463 --> 00:41:53,297
The British
have stopped making mistakes.

247
00:42:00,343 --> 00:42:04,734
Cut off extra supply of fuel
to the engines!

248
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:13,933
Torpedo rooms...
check the gyro-angles.

249
00:42:20,423 --> 00:42:27,215
- Watch out!
- Check periscope alignment.

250
00:42:27,383 --> 00:42:32,980
- What's going on?
- Here we go, girls.

251
00:42:33,143 --> 00:42:38,422
U-32 has spotted a British convoy.
We should be there in 10 hours.

252
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:50,942
<i>U - 32 is operating against a convoy.
We are joining in the hunt.</i>

253
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:55,540
<i>Contact expected
any time after 18:00 hours.</i>

254
00:42:56,303 --> 00:42:59,693
These beauties
are ready for blast off.

255
00:43:01,343 --> 00:43:05,097
Over 30 freighters.

256
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:10,462
Berthold is waiting for us to
arrive. He's following the convoy.

257
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:18,212
For me it's the best thrill
with U-boats and sailing ships.

258
00:43:18,383 --> 00:43:21,500
Skimming across the sea.

259
00:43:21,663 --> 00:43:28,853
I've sailed on a schooner.
Roomy. Holds as big as churches.

260
00:43:35,703 --> 00:43:40,902
- That's a fine way to waste fuel.
- Lunatic!

261
00:43:47,263 --> 00:43:50,175
Damn this weather!

262
00:43:56,063 --> 00:44:00,500
We could pass the British completely
without seeing them.

263
00:44:02,143 --> 00:44:07,740
We should be within range.
Why doesn't Berthold signal us?

264
00:44:09,143 --> 00:44:13,978
Why haven't we heard from H.Q.?

265
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:20,538
Visibility is nil, sir.
It's useless!

266
00:44:26,223 --> 00:44:29,533
Prepare to dive!

267
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,773
Clear the bridge now!

268
00:44:41,143 --> 00:44:45,659
Diving positions.
Stand by main vents.

269
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:19,780
- Take her down 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 10. Stern down 5.

270
00:45:19,943 --> 00:45:25,973
Bow planes zero. Stern zero.

271
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:30,455
What's up? Why are we diving?

272
00:45:30,623 --> 00:45:33,342
A hydrophone check.

273
00:45:33,503 --> 00:45:38,293
In bad weather you can hear more
than you can see on the surface.

274
00:45:38,463 --> 00:45:43,981
Stern planes up 5.
Easy. Both planes zero.

275
00:46:15,423 --> 00:46:19,132
Can't you make a contact?

276
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:33,053
Nothing?

277
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:22,532
Captain, come here.

278
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:29,131
Contact bearing 060. Quite faint.

279
00:47:43,343 --> 00:47:46,779
Depth charges.

280
00:47:48,303 --> 00:47:52,216
They are blasting someone.

281
00:47:57,503 --> 00:48:01,621
What's the bearing from us now.

282
00:48:05,103 --> 00:48:09,699
Moving right. 045 degrees.

283
00:48:09,863 --> 00:48:13,538
Moving away from us.

284
00:48:17,983 --> 00:48:24,536
- Surface. Steer 330.
- All ahead two-thirds.

285
00:48:24,703 --> 00:48:30,494
Note this in our log book. Despite
bad weather, commencing operation.

286
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:06,655
Damn this stinking weather!
How does it look?

287
00:49:09,383 --> 00:49:17,336
- The enemy should be here.
- Freighter on the starboard bow.

288
00:49:22,383 --> 00:49:28,413
- Over there! 040 and closing.
- Damn it!

289
00:49:33,903 --> 00:49:40,695
That's no freighter.
Oh no! A destroyer!

290
00:49:41,343 --> 00:49:46,258
It's coming straight at us.
Clear the bridge.

291
00:49:51,743 --> 00:49:55,053
Take her down!

292
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:01,372
Diving stations.

293
00:50:03,663 --> 00:50:09,932
- Come to periscope depth.
- All planes up 10.

294
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:25,857
Steady at 2 metres.

295
00:50:29,703 --> 00:50:32,536
Both planes zero.

296
00:50:37,703 --> 00:50:41,981
Stern down 5.

297
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:46,057
Come up.

298
00:51:05,903 --> 00:51:09,976
- Stand by battle stations.
- Stand by battle stations.

299
00:51:10,143 --> 00:51:14,102
- Stand by battle stations.
- Out of the way, damn it!

300
00:51:14,263 --> 00:51:17,414
Gangway!

301
00:51:19,023 --> 00:51:22,572
Faster! Faster!

302
00:51:29,823 --> 00:51:33,099
Keep her level, Chief.

303
00:51:40,783 --> 00:51:47,336
- Flood tubes one to four.
- Flood tubes one to four.

304
00:51:48,183 --> 00:51:54,179
He wants to attack the destroyer.
Crazy in this weather.

305
00:51:56,103 --> 00:52:01,700
- Watch your depth, Chief.
- Bow planes up 2. Stern down 2.

306
00:52:04,943 --> 00:52:08,379
Come on.

307
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:14,493
Both planes come to zero.
13.5 metres.

308
00:52:16,223 --> 00:52:20,011
Open bow caps now.

309
00:52:32,063 --> 00:52:39,378
Enemy's speed: 10.
Range: 6,000.

310
00:52:39,543 --> 00:52:42,615
Depth: 2 metres.

311
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:49,052
Torpedo speed: 40.
Spread torpedoes one and three.

312
00:52:49,223 --> 00:52:52,454
Spread shots one and three.

313
00:52:53,223 --> 00:52:57,341
Tubes one through four are ready.

314
00:53:19,223 --> 00:53:24,251
Damn it! What happened to them?

315
00:53:39,343 --> 00:53:41,903
Close bow caps! Dive!

316
00:53:49,703 --> 00:53:54,458
Depth charges dropped.

317
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:11,294
- Get some fuses, quick!
- Check all valves and closures.

318
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:40,053
No serious damage.

319
00:54:43,143 --> 00:54:47,182
They must've spotted our periscope.

320
00:54:47,343 --> 00:54:52,815
- Control room all secure.
- Incredible in this sea.

321
00:55:19,223 --> 00:55:25,492
- Is it getting louder?
- It seems constant. Ahead of us.

322
00:55:29,463 --> 00:55:32,261
280.

323
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:46,573
280 minus 35...

324
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:59,382
- It's pulling further ahead. 295.
- Left full rudder.

325
00:56:02,063 --> 00:56:07,695
- Rudder is left full.
- Steer due north.

326
00:56:07,863 --> 00:56:11,856
- Deeper, Chief.
- Bow planes down 15. Stern up 10.

327
00:56:12,023 --> 00:56:18,656
- Pump 200 litres forward.
- Steering due north, sir.

328
00:56:20,663 --> 00:56:27,341
- 200 litres forward.
- Main motors ahead one-third.

329
00:56:32,303 --> 00:56:35,739
Now it gets psychological, friends.

330
00:57:32,663 --> 00:57:37,214
Easy, men.
There's more to come yet.

331
00:57:50,023 --> 00:57:54,016
Kill unnecessary lights.

332
00:57:59,063 --> 00:58:04,535
- Silent speed.
- Both main engines at 50 rpm.

333
00:58:04,703 --> 00:58:08,173
Both engines indicate 50 rpm.

334
00:58:21,303 --> 00:58:27,822
Contact coming closer.
Starboard bow. Closing fast.

335
00:58:27,983 --> 00:58:32,374
Main engines full ahead.
Right full rudder.

336
00:58:35,183 --> 00:58:38,619
Both main engines ahead full.

337
00:58:55,823 --> 00:59:00,021
They're coming straight for us.

338
00:59:08,463 --> 00:59:14,698
- He knows what he's doing. Deeper.
- Bow down 20. Stern up 5.

339
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:52,460
- Destroyer almost above us.
- Deeper, Chief. Quick.

340
00:59:59,183 --> 01:00:03,301
DEPTH GAUGE

341
01:00:10,223 --> 01:00:14,421
Don't be afraid.
It's only the pressure.

342
01:00:22,663 --> 01:00:27,020
- Deeper.
- Stern up 15.

343
01:00:48,903 --> 01:00:51,940
150 metres.

344
01:00:54,263 --> 01:00:57,221
Hurry!

345
01:00:58,783 --> 01:01:05,416
- Tighten that flange.
- Bring her up to 150 metres.

346
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:09,815
Forward up 20. Stern down. 10.

347
01:01:09,983 --> 01:01:17,378
Come on, Frenssen, quickly!
Get the damn thing tightened!

348
01:01:36,863 --> 01:01:42,893
Hull valves secured.
Both planes read zero.

349
01:01:45,463 --> 01:01:49,502
Level at 150 metres.

350
01:02:00,103 --> 01:02:05,621
Becoming louder.
She's turned around. 055.

351
01:02:14,703 --> 01:02:18,491
Go on, get it over.

352
01:02:22,983 --> 01:02:26,578
Contact closing fast.

353
01:02:33,823 --> 01:02:39,898
They are above us...
just above us.

354
01:03:06,343 --> 01:03:10,222
Contact fading to starboard.

355
01:03:19,663 --> 01:03:22,735
22.

356
01:03:29,103 --> 01:03:33,142
- 23.
- They are far away.

357
01:03:41,183 --> 01:03:44,732
Contact receding aft.

358
01:03:51,463 --> 01:03:55,376
I can barely hear it.

359
01:04:12,463 --> 01:04:17,139
- Now?
- It has passed us by.

360
01:04:28,183 --> 01:04:31,334
I think that will be all, this time.

361
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:41,215
- Silent speed.
- Both main engines 50 rpm.

362
01:04:43,623 --> 01:04:52,531
- Both main engines 50 rpm.
- All compartments report damage.

363
01:05:12,823 --> 01:05:15,940
From my private collection.

364
01:05:28,863 --> 01:05:32,822
- How is the engine room?
- Smashed up badly.

365
01:05:32,983 --> 01:05:37,977
- Will you be able to patch her up?
- I've already started.

366
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:44,059
Make it good. I've got a feeling
we're going to see some action.

367
01:05:55,063 --> 01:05:58,135
Nothing?

368
01:06:13,263 --> 01:06:19,293
- We've waited over an hour now.
- I guess we have shaken them off.

369
01:06:19,463 --> 01:06:26,141
Don't be too sure. He could
have stopped and be waiting -

370
01:06:26,303 --> 01:06:33,937
- to surprise us when we surface.
Not dumb, the British.

371
01:06:34,103 --> 01:06:38,301
Stay on silent speed.
When it's dark, we'll surface.

372
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:41,580
I see better in the dark.

373
01:06:41,743 --> 01:06:44,303
Captain.

374
01:06:47,743 --> 01:06:50,177
Thanks.

375
01:06:57,903 --> 01:07:03,819
- What's it like up top?
- It's dark.

376
01:07:05,783 --> 01:07:12,302
- Go up to 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 15. Stern up 5.

377
01:07:12,463 --> 01:07:16,502
90, 80...

378
01:07:16,663 --> 01:07:21,179
70, 60 metres.

379
01:07:21,783 --> 01:07:25,617
50. Coming up fast.

380
01:07:26,183 --> 01:07:33,214
- Sound check at 30.
- She's level at 30 metres.

381
01:07:43,943 --> 01:07:46,935
Well?

382
01:07:50,263 --> 01:07:53,619
Periscope depth.

383
01:07:57,623 --> 01:08:03,573
Bow up 3.
Stern down five.

384
01:08:07,303 --> 01:08:10,136
Zero.

385
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,177
- Surface.
- All set to blow.

386
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:22,742
Cut it out! All this damn noise!

387
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:34,220
- I've got bad news, men.
- What's up now?

388
01:09:35,863 --> 01:09:39,094
Our team is losing.

389
01:09:41,063 --> 01:09:44,612
5-0.

390
01:09:46,823 --> 01:09:50,418
Not a chance
of making the finals now.

391
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:54,019
It can't be! I don't believe it!

392
01:10:02,383 --> 01:10:05,693
Drop 'em!

393
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:30,018
You dirty little boy. Crabs!

394
01:10:30,663 --> 01:10:36,420
A whole army of them. They'll eat
your winkie down to the bone.

395
01:10:40,183 --> 01:10:43,778
Give him a go with gun powder!

396
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:52,132
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

397
01:11:14,663 --> 01:11:18,736
This meat needs a shave.

398
01:11:22,503 --> 01:11:27,497
What are those things
crawling about on your eyebrows?

399
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:32,100
- Pardon?
- You'd better see the medic.

400
01:11:32,263 --> 01:11:36,017
Crabs by the look of them.

401
01:11:41,383 --> 01:11:47,458
When the creatures begin to surface,
it's the fifth stage.

402
01:11:57,103 --> 01:12:03,099
- Get it all in the torpedo room.
- You two, give me a hand.

403
01:12:06,663 --> 01:12:10,941
Bosun,
do you know where the medic is?

404
01:12:11,103 --> 01:12:14,652
Yeah, in the bow compartment.

405
01:12:17,423 --> 01:12:21,860
- The more the merrier.
- Have the crabs got you, too?

406
01:12:39,263 --> 01:12:46,294
- Lieutenant!
- What?

407
01:12:46,463 --> 01:12:52,732
Take it easy! Calm down!
Have you gone crazy?

408
01:12:57,583 --> 01:13:02,213
Have you heard the latest?
Our Dufte is tying the knot.

409
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:08,901
- The stupid pig.
- Half the fleet have tried her.

410
01:13:09,063 --> 01:13:13,056
They should stick you in a zoo
with a chimpanzee.

411
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:19,617
- Here's the pictures of her!
- You dirty, rotten swine!

412
01:13:23,103 --> 01:13:27,893
Don't tell me this hag
lets you sleep with her.

413
01:14:04,783 --> 01:14:11,655
These boats are built to take it.
You should try a sailing ship.

414
01:14:12,663 --> 01:14:15,461
You hardly feel a thing down here.

415
01:14:25,743 --> 01:14:28,780
- Captain.
- Compass.

416
01:14:40,183 --> 01:14:44,222
She's heaving to starboard.
I can't keep on course.

417
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:48,697
No cause for concern.

418
01:14:51,543 --> 01:14:57,732
It's pointless, sir.
We're burning up fuel for nothing.

419
01:15:03,943 --> 01:15:06,855
Prepare to dive.

420
01:15:07,023 --> 01:15:11,653
Diving stations.
Stand by all main vents.

421
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:13,982
Nothing exciting out there?

422
01:16:16,383 --> 01:16:23,380
Position reports and very faint
SOS calls from enemy freighters.

423
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:30,701
When the rudder breaks
on one of those old tenders...

424
01:16:34,143 --> 01:16:37,772
...there's nothing to do but pray.

425
01:16:41,623 --> 01:16:48,540
The sea can't sink us, Hinrich.
No ships are as safe as our U-boats.

426
01:16:59,903 --> 01:17:02,701
Hinrich.

427
01:17:02,863 --> 01:17:09,177
Put the record on again.
You know the one.

428
01:18:17,783 --> 01:18:20,058
Watch out!

429
01:18:30,343 --> 01:18:32,493
Look out!

430
01:18:37,983 --> 01:18:40,543
Man overboard!

431
01:18:43,103 --> 01:18:45,901
Pilgrim!

432
01:18:49,423 --> 01:18:52,017
Hold on!

433
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:21,617
- Get his legs.
- I've got him. Make way!

434
01:19:22,903 --> 01:19:27,579
- His legs!
- Hurry, will you? Move!

435
01:19:28,343 --> 01:19:33,098
- Lay him out flat.
- Get his hood off quickly.

436
01:19:33,263 --> 01:19:36,335
Pilgrim.

437
01:19:36,503 --> 01:19:41,782
Bring the first-aid kit, damn it!

438
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,411
Prepare to dive.

439
01:19:53,303 --> 01:19:58,616
"Self-discipline is the only road
to military leadership... "

440
01:20:00,983 --> 01:20:05,420
Three ribs cracked
and a gash on the head.

441
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:08,655
He was lucky.

442
01:20:09,703 --> 01:20:16,097
What a rotten month.
Absolutely rotten.

443
01:20:17,423 --> 01:20:20,495
Mildew is good for you.

444
01:20:23,183 --> 01:20:29,053
It's the next best thing to...
fresh-grown lettuce.

445
01:20:31,823 --> 01:20:38,262
Anything that grows on this boat
we've got to be grateful for.

446
01:20:44,103 --> 01:20:47,857
It must be snowing already
back home.

447
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:57,016
Very funny.

448
01:20:58,623 --> 01:21:01,660
It's been years since I saw snow.

449
01:21:04,863 --> 01:21:08,253
- Can I look?
- Sure.

450
01:21:20,983 --> 01:21:23,497
Your wife?

451
01:22:25,503 --> 01:22:29,576
Look! There, in front!

452
01:22:34,103 --> 01:22:37,857
Captain, U-boat on port bow.

453
01:22:39,103 --> 01:22:42,698
It's one of ours.

454
01:22:45,663 --> 01:22:51,135
A German U-boat! Over there!

455
01:22:56,583 --> 01:23:00,098
You're right.

456
01:23:00,263 --> 01:23:04,973
- Both engines stop.
- Bring up the lights.

457
01:23:34,703 --> 01:23:38,332
Look, it's Thomsen!

458
01:23:39,263 --> 01:23:43,939
- All back.
- It's Thomsen!

459
01:23:57,743 --> 01:24:02,498
Good hunting, you old rascal!

460
01:24:10,383 --> 01:24:16,492
My God, Phillip!
So they pushed you out to sea again.

461
01:24:22,783 --> 01:24:26,417
Damn it! How can this happen?

462
01:24:28,903 --> 01:24:35,502
12 boats we've got on the Atlantic,
from Greenland to the Azores.

463
01:24:35,663 --> 01:24:41,135
But still we almost collide
with one of our own.

464
01:24:41,303 --> 01:24:45,979
60 metres. Boat is trimmed, sir.

465
01:24:48,263 --> 01:24:51,892
Something is wrong here.

466
01:24:53,783 --> 01:24:57,935
- Have you checked on our position?
- More or less.

467
01:24:58,103 --> 01:25:01,698
More or less is not good enough!

468
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:08,302
We've not had a sun shot in 14 days.
We've been drifting in this storm.

469
01:25:08,463 --> 01:25:12,138
It's hard to compute.

470
01:25:18,263 --> 01:25:25,613
If we make an error in our position,
and the others do the same, -

471
01:25:25,783 --> 01:25:30,095
- we end up playing collision games.
The route is wide open.

472
01:25:30,263 --> 01:25:35,860
The British could shove
the whole armada through.

473
01:25:36,023 --> 01:25:39,140
Yeah, yeah...

474
01:25:41,743 --> 01:25:46,578
Another story in the middle
of the ocean, Lieutenant.

475
01:25:46,743 --> 01:25:52,454
I hope you're making notes. Maybe
headquarters will listen to you.

476
01:25:52,623 --> 01:25:59,813
- You've more influence than I have.
- So... you believe that?

477
01:26:13,063 --> 01:26:19,980
Have you got your flashlight ready?
It's bound to be a false alarm.

478
01:26:27,143 --> 01:26:31,933
- What's up?
- A convoy.

479
01:26:45,223 --> 01:26:50,138
- Permission to come up?
- Permitted.

480
01:27:34,903 --> 01:27:41,456
Outward bound convoy. Five columns.
Very juicy.

481
01:27:44,823 --> 01:27:48,702
Any escorts in sight? Destroyers?

482
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:54,301
No, no screen.
They have no protection. Nothing.

483
01:27:59,263 --> 01:28:01,697
That's funny.

484
01:28:03,543 --> 01:28:08,663
They could be off
chasing one of ours.

485
01:28:15,063 --> 01:28:18,692
That damn moon!

486
01:28:20,903 --> 01:28:25,533
- How many of our boats are here?
- Five.

487
01:28:28,063 --> 01:28:31,055
Do we risk it?

488
01:28:33,023 --> 01:28:37,062
It's worth a try, Captain.

489
01:28:38,223 --> 01:28:40,862
Come left to 180.

490
01:28:41,023 --> 01:28:45,141
Left 5 degrees rudder.
New course: 180.

491
01:28:45,303 --> 01:28:48,852
Steady on course 180.

492
01:28:49,703 --> 01:28:53,662
Kriechbaum, what's your feeling?

493
01:28:55,903 --> 01:28:59,418
It'll work. We've got them.

494
01:29:10,703 --> 01:29:15,731
Prepare tubes one to four
for surface firing.

495
01:29:15,903 --> 01:29:21,023
- I'm going in.
- Master-sight to bridge.

496
01:29:23,703 --> 01:29:26,695
Tubes one to four flooded.

497
01:29:39,503 --> 01:29:44,099
All ahead full. Left full rudder.
Stand by to attack!

498
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:52,376
Watch the pressure
of the lubricating oil.

499
01:29:53,783 --> 01:29:58,573
- Bearing: 050.
- Locked on.

500
01:29:58,743 --> 01:30:01,576
<i>Range: 2,200 metres.</i>

501
01:30:01,743 --> 01:30:08,091
Those two over that way.
Then we'll drop on the big one.

502
01:30:08,263 --> 01:30:14,736
<i>- Targets identified.
- Open the bow caps.</i>

503
01:30:14,903 --> 01:30:21,422
Lock on tubes one and two.
New bow angle: 063.

504
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:25,542
Follow for bearing.

505
01:30:25,703 --> 01:30:31,972
Tubes one and two,
fire when matched.

506
01:30:32,143 --> 01:30:34,532
Tube one, fire!

507
01:30:36,783 --> 01:30:41,538
Tube two, fire!

508
01:30:41,703 --> 01:30:46,219
- Tube three, fire when matched.
- Tube three ready.

509
01:30:46,383 --> 01:30:49,932
Tube three, fire!

510
01:30:50,543 --> 01:30:57,255
Tube four ready.
Tube four, fire!

511
01:30:57,423 --> 01:31:00,301
Destroyer ahead!

512
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:06,461
Alarm!

513
01:31:06,623 --> 01:31:11,139
All men forward! Diving positions!

514
01:31:13,263 --> 01:31:16,653
Quick, keep it moving!

515
01:31:16,823 --> 01:31:21,499
- Clear the way.
- Move, move, move!

516
01:31:32,703 --> 01:31:37,060
- Battle stations!
- Out of the way.

517
01:31:37,743 --> 01:31:44,012
Bow planes up 10. Stern up 5.

518
01:31:44,783 --> 01:31:47,980
Keep quite!

519
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:52,371
Down 80 metres. Easy.

520
01:31:52,543 --> 01:31:57,856
Bow down 15. Stern up 10.

521
01:32:00,303 --> 01:32:05,696
- What about the torpedoes?
- Any minute now.

522
01:32:10,143 --> 01:32:13,533
Not long to go now.

523
01:32:13,703 --> 01:32:16,581
110...

524
01:32:23,303 --> 01:32:28,935
- 120.
- Those torpedoes don't run true.

525
01:32:29,103 --> 01:32:36,578
It was crazy to attack like that.
That destroy won't let us go.

526
01:32:37,743 --> 01:32:41,816
He'll try and hunt us down.

527
01:32:48,743 --> 01:32:54,181
- We hit the first.
- Out of the way. We hit her!

528
01:32:55,223 --> 01:32:58,135
Quiet!

529
01:33:19,583 --> 01:33:23,496
Time's up for the third torpedo.

530
01:33:28,063 --> 01:33:30,816
Number three.

531
01:33:45,343 --> 01:33:48,813
Now they are going to the bottom.

532
01:34:00,663 --> 01:34:04,576
It's the bulkheads.
They've collapsed.

533
01:34:21,103 --> 01:34:24,095
This is it.

534
01:34:27,703 --> 01:34:30,740
Now we have the payoff.

535
01:34:39,783 --> 01:34:46,222
Destroyer bearing 044.
Moving left. Fading, sir.

536
01:35:00,463 --> 01:35:05,378
Right full rudder.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.

537
01:35:05,543 --> 01:35:11,015
Rudder's right full.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.

538
01:35:11,183 --> 01:35:14,937
They're astern of us...

539
01:35:16,303 --> 01:35:20,091
...way astern of us.

540
01:35:22,463 --> 01:35:26,251
They're spitting
in the wrong direction.

541
01:35:33,743 --> 01:35:40,057
We haven't thrown them off yet.
I reckon they won't be too happy.

542
01:35:40,223 --> 01:35:46,822
Propeller noises bearing 270.
Closing.

543
01:35:47,743 --> 01:35:52,658
Both engines ahead one-third.

544
01:35:59,143 --> 01:36:04,900
- Both engines ahead one-third.
- Now we'll see.

545
01:36:30,463 --> 01:36:36,379
All ahead full.
Pump out 150 litres.

546
01:36:40,223 --> 01:36:43,852
Pump out 150 litres. Ahead full!

547
01:37:36,143 --> 01:37:41,979
Asdic detection system.
Ultrasonic.

548
01:37:46,903 --> 01:37:51,852
The filthy rotten swine!

549
01:38:03,343 --> 01:38:08,736
- What's the damage?
- Air shaft fractured.

550
01:38:12,863 --> 01:38:17,061
Quiet, boys.

551
01:38:18,343 --> 01:38:21,892
Nice and quiet now.

552
01:39:06,503 --> 01:39:11,258
- Hold that speed.
- 50 rpm.

553
01:39:12,143 --> 01:39:15,772
Left 15 degrees.

554
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:21,292
Steering left 15, sir.

555
01:39:33,663 --> 01:39:37,178
All ahead full!

556
01:39:38,863 --> 01:39:41,900
Let's get the hell out of here!

557
01:39:47,263 --> 01:39:53,213
- One of the valves is fractured!
- Isolate it!

558
01:39:56,943 --> 01:40:00,458
God! We're on fire!

559
01:40:00,623 --> 01:40:05,777
Cut the number two auxiliary!

560
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:13,178
Calm down for God's sake!

561
01:40:36,983 --> 01:40:44,412
- Chief, emergency ventilation.
- Switch on fans.

562
01:41:11,783 --> 01:41:17,176
She doesn't want to let go of us.

563
01:41:25,183 --> 01:41:30,132
What's going on? Running away?

564
01:41:43,823 --> 01:41:51,582
We really smashed them.
Did you hear those bulkheads burst?

565
01:42:03,903 --> 01:42:10,342
- What's her bearing?
- 065. Bearing constant.

566
01:42:13,583 --> 01:42:18,020
Deeper, Chief. Silent speed.

567
01:42:41,263 --> 01:42:44,221
Bearing?

568
01:42:45,263 --> 01:42:50,053
050. Growing louder.

569
01:43:01,263 --> 01:43:04,812
Yeah, yeah...

570
01:43:10,423 --> 01:43:13,301
Yeah, sure.

571
01:43:22,263 --> 01:43:26,734
Deeper still. Right 30 degrees.

572
01:43:26,903 --> 01:43:33,456
We'll try doubling back.
Keep them guessing.

573
01:43:40,303 --> 01:43:44,899
Bow planes steady. Stern up 10.

574
01:44:30,423 --> 01:44:34,621
Contact bearing 270.

575
01:44:36,223 --> 01:44:39,977
It's fading.

576
01:44:53,383 --> 01:45:00,016
- Right full rudder.
- Rudder is full right, sir.

577
01:45:00,663 --> 01:45:04,861
Steer 090.

578
01:45:21,543 --> 01:45:23,579
No!

579
01:45:25,223 --> 01:45:29,739
Second contact closing fast.
Bearing: 076.

580
01:45:32,663 --> 01:45:36,019
Damn them!

581
01:45:37,263 --> 01:45:40,972
Another one.

582
01:46:09,543 --> 01:46:14,333
- Deeper.
- Sir..?

583
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:19,218
Yes, deeper.

584
01:46:22,023 --> 01:46:25,379
Bow planes down 10. Stern up 7.

585
01:46:42,863 --> 01:46:46,902
190 metres.

586
01:46:55,583 --> 01:46:57,619
200 metres.

587
01:47:09,303 --> 01:47:11,658
210 metres.

588
01:47:19,463 --> 01:47:22,421
220 metres.

589
01:47:28,663 --> 01:47:31,655
230 metres.

590
01:47:41,983 --> 01:47:46,579
- The bolts are bursting!
- 10 metres rise.

591
01:47:46,743 --> 01:47:50,338
All ahead.

592
01:47:55,663 --> 01:47:58,700
Quiet, men!

593
01:48:25,823 --> 01:48:28,462
Quiet.

594
01:48:37,383 --> 01:48:42,662
Bring her up to 150 metres!
Full ahead!

595
01:48:44,863 --> 01:48:48,333
Full ahead both, sir.

596
01:48:48,503 --> 01:48:53,782
Left 20 degrees.
Steer 050.

597
01:48:53,943 --> 01:48:57,219
He is near his mark.

598
01:49:01,103 --> 01:49:04,539
The foundation bolts are loose!

599
01:49:34,703 --> 01:49:41,654
- I want accurate damage reports.
- Water's pouring in!

600
01:49:46,103 --> 01:49:52,053
- The engine room is leaking water!
- I'll go and take a look.

601
01:49:52,223 --> 01:49:55,340
Number One, take over.

602
01:49:57,383 --> 01:50:00,022
It's the exhaust flap.

603
01:50:00,183 --> 01:50:06,019
- The plunge bolts have sheared.
- The gaskets!

604
01:50:07,823 --> 01:50:11,577
Bring me new gaskets. Move it!

605
01:50:12,223 --> 01:50:17,616
- Torpedo hatch taking water.
- Give us some light.

606
01:50:20,903 --> 01:50:24,782
Crow bar!

607
01:50:29,423 --> 01:50:33,177
They'll soon be out of ammunition.

608
01:50:47,383 --> 01:50:50,978
The exhaust flap is secured, sir.

609
01:50:51,143 --> 01:50:57,662
- 50 metres. All ahead full.
- Torpedo hatch is secured.

610
01:51:11,663 --> 01:51:14,814
What's wrong, Johann?

611
01:51:20,263 --> 01:51:26,213
Get back to your battle station,
right now.

612
01:51:35,703 --> 01:51:41,778
Don't disobey my orders.
Do as you're told!

613
01:51:44,983 --> 01:51:48,692
I order you, Johann.

614
01:51:50,223 --> 01:51:53,852
Aft, Johann!

615
01:51:59,063 --> 01:52:05,332
Take him aft, boys.
Hold him down.

616
01:52:10,983 --> 01:52:14,339
He's under control.

617
01:52:52,743 --> 01:52:58,261
Who'd have thought it of Johann?

618
01:52:58,863 --> 01:53:04,335
Degrading. Shameful.

619
01:53:22,583 --> 01:53:27,373
Forget it, Hinrich.
We can hear them.

620
01:53:49,983 --> 01:53:51,701
That's it. Come on.

621
01:54:11,343 --> 01:54:14,221
170 metres.

622
01:54:16,703 --> 01:54:20,332
190 metres.

623
01:54:22,383 --> 01:54:25,056
200.

624
01:54:47,223 --> 01:54:52,695
- Man your stations.
- 220 metres!

625
01:54:52,863 --> 01:54:56,173
We're sinking!

626
01:54:56,703 --> 01:54:59,740
We're sinking!

627
01:56:02,423 --> 01:56:08,293
- Make a note for the war diary.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

628
01:56:09,543 --> 01:56:16,221
Stayed submerged for six hours
at silent speed.

629
01:56:16,383 --> 01:56:20,342
Satisfied
the destroyers have lost us.

630
01:56:21,543 --> 01:56:28,699
Intense glow in sky
observed at 210 degrees.

631
01:56:28,863 --> 01:56:33,778
Probably flames
from the tanker we hit.

632
01:56:40,583 --> 01:56:47,421
- We'll surface in ten minutes.
- Switch to red light.

633
01:56:53,343 --> 01:56:56,858
First watch, stand by for duty.

634
01:57:20,823 --> 01:57:23,895
You see, Lieutenant...

635
01:57:25,823 --> 01:57:29,498
...they didn't kill us.

636
01:58:32,383 --> 01:58:35,819
Her back's already broken.

637
01:58:37,863 --> 01:58:42,061
She is a tough one.
She won't go down.

638
01:58:43,903 --> 01:58:51,253
Let's finish her off.
A final shot. Prepare to fire.

639
01:58:52,303 --> 01:58:57,661
<i>Number one tube is flooded.
Ready for surface firing.</i>

640
01:58:57,823 --> 01:59:03,693
Target's speed: Zero.
Range: 650 metres.

641
01:59:03,863 --> 01:59:07,856
Depth: Four metres.
Torpedo speed: 30.

642
01:59:08,023 --> 01:59:12,414
Aiming point: Forward of aft mast.

643
01:59:12,583 --> 01:59:16,132
Tube one ready.

644
01:59:16,303 --> 01:59:19,693
Tube one... Fire!

645
02:00:01,023 --> 02:00:04,936
- There are still men on board.
- There!

646
02:00:15,423 --> 02:00:20,053
Why didn't their own ships
rescue them?

647
02:00:20,223 --> 02:00:22,942
They've had six hours.

648
02:00:48,063 --> 02:00:54,502
- They're swimming towards us.
- Both engines back two-thirds.

649
02:00:54,663 --> 02:00:58,133
We can't take prisoners.
You know that.

650
02:02:07,583 --> 02:02:11,292
May I clear the table, sir?

651
02:02:35,463 --> 02:02:38,739
Here, take it.

652
02:02:42,023 --> 02:02:46,335
- Some more signals, sir.
- Go ahead.

653
02:02:46,503 --> 02:02:51,054
"Three freighters sunk.
Convoy dispersed into groups. "

654
02:02:51,223 --> 02:02:56,741
Contact broken.
Closing course: 030. U-112.

655
02:02:58,103 --> 02:03:01,618
Wenzel... not bad.

656
02:03:01,783 --> 02:03:08,621
Kupsch is on the same convoy.
Stackmann torpedoed a 6,000 tonner.

657
02:03:11,143 --> 02:03:16,171
They're having a field day.
Any hope of joining them?

658
02:03:19,143 --> 02:03:24,501
Difficult. A minimum
of five hours away at full speed.

659
02:03:24,663 --> 02:03:29,020
- We can't make it.
- Yes, yes!

660
02:03:50,703 --> 02:03:54,218
Sir, when do we go back?

661
02:04:00,063 --> 02:04:05,581
When it's time for us to go back...
and not before, Kriechbaum.

662
02:04:36,503 --> 02:04:41,338
"Fired at 950 metres.
Targeted aft mast. "

663
02:04:41,503 --> 02:04:45,496
"Crew was still on board.
Swam toward U-96."

664
02:05:19,623 --> 02:05:22,854
Captain...

665
02:05:24,823 --> 02:05:31,171
- I wish to apologize.
- There's nothing to be said.

666
02:05:32,143 --> 02:05:38,821
You deserted your post at a critical
moment and disobeyed a direct order.

667
02:05:50,663 --> 02:05:56,818
You mean to say that
there has to be a court martial?

668
02:06:00,943 --> 02:06:05,539
- How many patrols have you done?
- Nine, sir.

669
02:06:11,303 --> 02:06:14,101
Why you, Johann?

670
02:06:16,943 --> 02:06:22,540
It was a mistake.
I didn't... It was...

671
02:06:22,703 --> 02:06:25,536
It...

672
02:06:28,423 --> 02:06:35,022
All of a sudden... As if...

673
02:06:37,943 --> 02:06:43,336
It won't ever happen again, sir.
You can depend on it.

674
02:06:44,783 --> 02:06:51,416
- I swear.
- All right, Johann.

675
02:06:52,863 --> 02:06:58,017
Then there's no court martial?

676
02:07:01,343 --> 02:07:05,052
Get some sleep.

677
02:07:17,943 --> 02:07:22,698
Decision, return to La Rochelle.

678
02:07:39,623 --> 02:07:42,535
Cipher officer.

679
02:07:47,623 --> 02:07:51,821
- Have you found the problem?
- It's the bulkhead conduit.

680
02:07:51,983 --> 02:07:55,419
Good, get it fixed.

681
02:07:56,903 --> 02:07:59,861
Good morning.

682
02:08:00,023 --> 02:08:04,255
Get moving.
There's a signal to be decoded.

683
02:08:11,143 --> 02:08:17,218
Suppose it's top secret.
Another wild goose chase.

684
02:08:17,383 --> 02:08:21,535
They're not much use to us.
This relic needs a refit.

685
02:08:21,703 --> 02:08:26,413
On the fuel we've got
we won't even make La Rochelle.

686
02:08:26,583 --> 02:08:31,373
We'll hoist a sail.
Don't worry, Chief.

687
02:08:33,103 --> 02:08:36,812
Decoded it yet?

688
02:08:38,303 --> 02:08:44,412
- What is it?
- Top secret. For the captain only.

689
02:09:07,543 --> 02:09:12,094
Very strange.
It's triple enciphered.

690
02:09:18,983 --> 02:09:23,738
Christmas in La Rochelle.
Real girls in Christmas stockings.

691
02:09:23,903 --> 02:09:29,421
Sexy little nurses
to comfort and kiss.

692
02:09:29,583 --> 02:09:34,941
- We'll have a ball!
- A Valkyrie, big and fat.

693
02:09:35,823 --> 02:09:41,500
<i>Now here this.
La Rochelle is out. I'm sorry.</i>

694
02:09:41,663 --> 02:09:48,899
<i>We have a new destination.
La Spezia Naval Base in Italy.</i>

695
02:09:49,063 --> 02:09:55,901
<i>We'll pick up fuel and supplies
at Vigo in Spain. That's all.</i>

696
02:09:58,583 --> 02:10:03,532
Swine. He must be crazy.

697
02:10:04,303 --> 02:10:08,933
- What a rotten trick.
- There goes our Christmas stocking.

698
02:10:09,103 --> 02:10:16,293
- No sexy little nurses.
- I'd like to kill those morons!

699
02:10:16,463 --> 02:10:21,662
- We'll have Christmas in Italy.
- We've got to get there first!

700
02:10:21,823 --> 02:10:25,862
- And so?
- Gibraltar!

701
02:10:26,023 --> 02:10:30,301
Use your brain, you idiot!
That strait...

702
02:10:33,503 --> 02:10:40,500
It's like the eye of a needle.
We'll never slip through there.

703
02:10:55,823 --> 02:11:02,854
The Mediterranean. It's madness.
It's swarming with combat ships.

704
02:11:03,023 --> 02:11:10,179
Stand by...
Zero. 25 degrees, 43.3 minutes.

705
02:11:12,183 --> 02:11:17,462
Gibraltar. It's the best chance
to get ourselves killed.

706
02:11:31,343 --> 02:11:36,417
When we reach Vigo,
you go ashore with the chief.

707
02:11:36,583 --> 02:11:41,737
- But, sir...
- I've already made the decision.

708
02:11:44,383 --> 02:11:49,662
I've got to find
a replacement for the chief.

709
02:11:50,703 --> 02:11:55,379
Our agents will smuggle you
out of Spain somehow.

710
02:11:55,543 --> 02:11:59,172
Dressed up as gypsies, for instance.

711
02:11:59,343 --> 02:12:04,975
- I thought I would be going...
- No arguments.

712
02:12:05,143 --> 02:12:11,059
It's all settled.
It's easier to get two of you out.

713
02:12:14,023 --> 02:12:18,255
I really believe
the chief needs a break.

714
02:12:29,463 --> 02:12:32,660
His wife is very ill.

715
02:12:35,063 --> 02:12:38,339
He must get home.

716
02:12:42,223 --> 02:12:45,693
I understand, sir.

717
02:12:59,023 --> 02:13:02,379
Tough break.

718
02:13:12,623 --> 02:13:18,858
When we reach Vigo, it's goodbye.
The captain's ordered me ashore.

719
02:13:20,463 --> 02:13:24,502
The chief leaves, too.

720
02:13:26,823 --> 02:13:31,897
I... could deliver
your mail for you.

721
02:13:39,583 --> 02:13:42,575
Yeah.

722
02:13:48,623 --> 02:13:52,172
There's quite a bunch of them here.

723
02:13:54,943 --> 02:13:58,697
Well, it's quite a romance,
isn't it?

724
02:14:37,223 --> 02:14:40,215
Equalize.

725
02:14:49,463 --> 02:14:54,139
- Help me out with the gear.
- Quiet, men!

726
02:14:54,303 --> 02:15:00,936
All ahead one-third.
Left 10 degrees rudder.

727
02:15:01,103 --> 02:15:06,131
Now we just have to find
this little barge.

728
02:15:06,303 --> 02:15:09,818
"SS Weser. "

729
02:15:09,983 --> 02:15:14,101
A German merchant ship.
She's got herself interned here.

730
02:15:14,263 --> 02:15:21,214
- With torpedoes, fuel and supplies.
- All for us, Kriechbaum.

731
02:15:21,383 --> 02:15:24,659
First-class service.

732
02:15:36,503 --> 02:15:40,018
Starboard engines stop.

733
02:15:40,903 --> 02:15:45,693
- We arrived.
- Port engines stop.

734
02:15:53,063 --> 02:15:56,658
Officers to bridge.

735
02:16:09,863 --> 02:16:12,855
Gentlemen...

736
02:16:17,383 --> 02:16:20,295
Three cheers
for our galant U-boat men.

737
02:16:32,663 --> 02:16:38,181
- You are most welcome, Captain.
- No, no...

738
02:16:39,423 --> 02:16:45,692
- This is our commander.
- My apologies, sir.

739
02:16:47,383 --> 02:16:52,138
A pleasure to have you aboard
the 'Weser", Captain.

740
02:16:52,303 --> 02:16:57,331
A hero.
I'm delighted to be so honoured.

741
02:16:57,503 --> 02:17:03,533
Gentlemen, here they stand,
our heroes of the deep.

742
02:17:04,223 --> 02:17:12,176
The grey wolves.
Our humble ship is honoured.

743
02:17:12,343 --> 02:17:15,460
Captain, lead the way.

744
02:17:15,623 --> 02:17:19,935
- Welcome on board.
- What a nice clean tugboat.

745
02:17:20,903 --> 02:17:28,173
We've done what we can for you.
I hope it's to your taste.

746
02:17:28,343 --> 02:17:32,131
Quite a table. Just like home.

747
02:17:32,303 --> 02:17:39,379
Fresh bread. Cakes. Fruit.
Sausage, our chef's specialty.

748
02:17:39,543 --> 02:17:44,139
We're waiting to hear your news.

749
02:17:44,303 --> 02:17:48,091
You can't imagine
what it means to us.

750
02:17:48,263 --> 02:17:51,619
It isn't easy here.
It's very frustrating.

751
02:17:51,783 --> 02:17:55,173
Sure, there's plenty to eat.
Fuel is no problem.

752
02:17:55,343 --> 02:18:02,499
Torpedoes are very tricky though...
but you're all set up.

753
02:18:02,663 --> 02:18:09,580
The Spaniards tolerate us, but
that's about all. Christmas cake.

754
02:18:11,623 --> 02:18:18,096
How many ship have you sunk?
I guess about...

755
02:18:18,263 --> 02:18:22,814
Oh, champagne. Take a glass.

756
02:18:23,343 --> 02:18:29,691
Gentlemen, raise your glasses.
Drink to our heroes.

757
02:18:29,863 --> 02:18:37,178
To the German U-boat service
and out beloved Fuhrer...

758
02:18:38,663 --> 02:18:43,179
We're not exactly at home...
if you understand what I mean.

759
02:18:43,343 --> 02:18:45,573
All the best.

760
02:18:50,103 --> 02:18:57,020
- There's plenty for everyone.
- Let's get down to business.

761
02:19:00,703 --> 02:19:07,097
Tell us all about it, Captain.
I'm bursting with curiosity.

762
02:19:07,263 --> 02:19:10,539
Those are fresh figs.

763
02:19:12,423 --> 02:19:15,381
Fresh figs!

764
02:19:17,063 --> 02:19:21,102
I've never had one.

765
02:19:24,303 --> 02:19:28,296
Yeah...

766
02:19:31,583 --> 02:19:36,577
This time we very nearly had it.

767
02:19:39,143 --> 02:19:45,412
Phenomenal. You see, gentlemen,
that's the stuff heroes are made of.

768
02:19:45,583 --> 02:19:50,498
Phenomenal, that's what it is.
I want to hear more, Captain.

769
02:19:50,663 --> 02:19:58,092
Give me your plate. Herring salad.
The chef's mother's own recipe.

770
02:19:59,543 --> 02:20:04,139
Just taste that. There's lots more.

771
02:20:04,303 --> 02:20:11,539
So...
what's it like to be under water -

772
02:20:11,703 --> 02:20:14,934
- while overhead
the enemy lies in wait?

773
02:20:15,103 --> 02:20:19,381
- It's dark.
- Dark?

774
02:20:19,543 --> 02:20:25,459
- Yes, and very quiet.
- Just as long as no one belches.

775
02:20:25,623 --> 02:20:31,016
- Why is that?
- I can explain what he means.

776
02:20:31,183 --> 02:20:34,414
We're often running at silent speed.

777
02:20:34,583 --> 02:20:39,976
- And that's why you can't belch!
- The men from Madrid are here.

778
02:20:40,143 --> 02:20:43,453
Seewald, we've been expecting you.
Captain, over here.

779
02:20:46,663 --> 02:20:51,339
The representative
of our naval attache here.

780
02:20:51,503 --> 02:20:54,859
I have some
communications from Berlin.

781
02:20:55,903 --> 02:20:59,612
First the documents
for the breakthrough.

782
02:21:00,583 --> 02:21:04,701
Then... this cable came.

783
02:21:15,303 --> 02:21:18,295
Chief, Lt. Werner.

784
02:21:21,743 --> 02:21:25,133
We are going for a little fresh air.

785
02:21:32,623 --> 02:21:36,855
- What's happening, Seewald?
- Bad news.

786
02:21:42,263 --> 02:21:47,496
Headquarters say no.
Our request has been denied, Chief.

787
02:21:50,543 --> 02:21:56,652
There's no replacement.
You'll stay too, Werner.

788
02:22:01,543 --> 02:22:04,535
I'm sorry.

789
02:22:06,783 --> 02:22:10,139
I guess it's just as well.

790
02:22:11,983 --> 02:22:16,977
Who knows what kind of idiot
they'd have sent you.

791
02:22:18,383 --> 02:22:22,376
One of those new found warriors
who's all wind and smoke.

792
02:22:27,863 --> 02:22:30,900
You could be right.

793
02:22:31,063 --> 02:22:34,578
They could have sent us
some senoritas.

794
02:22:34,743 --> 02:22:41,216
It's a good thing they didn't.
Spanish crabs. That's all we'd need.

795
02:22:41,383 --> 02:22:46,741
Get that chart table cleared.
I can't navigate on bananas.

796
02:22:46,903 --> 02:22:52,341
What do you think you're doing?
Get that fruit out of here.

797
02:22:54,303 --> 02:23:00,253
- Is that a Christmas tree?
- No, camouflage for the bridge.

798
02:23:02,303 --> 02:23:05,898
We're staying.
They won't replace us.

799
02:23:17,063 --> 02:23:20,135
I'm sorry, Ullman.

800
02:23:35,623 --> 02:23:41,255
7 miles from coast to coast.
A bit narrow.

801
02:23:43,263 --> 02:23:49,816
These are the only British dockyards
in the western Mediterranen.

802
02:23:51,743 --> 02:23:55,099
They are very heavily defended.

803
02:23:57,943 --> 02:24:02,255
The place will be crawling
with patrol boats.

804
02:24:02,423 --> 02:24:07,133
Anything that floats
will be on the water.

805
02:24:09,663 --> 02:24:15,056
This is where we have to go.
That's the situation.

806
02:24:27,223 --> 02:24:33,014
We move in under darkness.
On the surface.

807
02:24:36,703 --> 02:24:40,173
We'll see if we can slip through.

808
02:24:43,983 --> 02:24:47,658
As near to Gibraltar as we can get.

809
02:24:56,663 --> 02:25:02,340
Then dive down
and let ourselves drift through.

810
02:25:07,223 --> 02:25:10,533
And so...

811
02:25:12,383 --> 02:25:19,494
...dive and let the surface current
pull us through the Strait.

812
02:25:20,743 --> 02:25:24,577
It's an easy trick.

813
02:25:25,183 --> 02:25:31,179
Quiet as a shadow
and we burn less fuel.

814
02:25:39,743 --> 02:25:43,338
Well, Kriechbaum?

815
02:25:47,703 --> 02:25:51,332
Clever trick, Captain.

816
02:26:14,263 --> 02:26:17,573
Right, let's get going.

817
02:26:21,583 --> 02:26:25,178
All ahead two-thirds.

818
02:26:27,783 --> 02:26:32,220
The navigator and I stay up here.
Now clear the bridge.

819
02:26:48,063 --> 02:26:54,218
- Come right to 079.
- Course: 079.

820
02:27:02,543 --> 02:27:05,694
Half the British fleet is out there.

821
02:27:06,863 --> 02:27:13,132
Come left 20 degrees.
Change to main motors.

822
02:27:13,943 --> 02:27:19,700
It's very kind of the enemy
to show their navigation lights.

823
02:27:22,583 --> 02:27:27,418
Come left another 10.
Steer 050.

824
02:27:27,583 --> 02:27:30,222
Course: 050.

825
02:27:44,663 --> 02:27:49,418
Destroyer on port bow.
Range: 800.

826
02:27:49,583 --> 02:27:52,700
Going which way?
Is she closing?

827
02:27:59,463 --> 02:28:03,092
- No, she's heading away.
- That's good.

828
02:28:06,143 --> 02:28:09,818
Left full rudder. All ahead full.

829
02:28:09,983 --> 02:28:13,976
Rudder is left full.
All engines indicate ahead full.

830
02:28:16,143 --> 02:28:18,782
Steady as you go.

831
02:28:34,783 --> 02:28:41,416
- Come right. Course: 079.
- Course: 079.

832
02:28:41,583 --> 02:28:47,772
- All ahead two-thirds.
- Engines indicate ahead two-thirds.

833
02:29:08,903 --> 02:29:12,054
Right full rudder. Quick!

834
02:29:12,223 --> 02:29:15,260
- Right full rudder.
- Damn!

835
02:29:27,583 --> 02:29:30,893
Kriechbaum...

836
02:29:32,663 --> 02:29:35,541
Gibraltar.

837
02:29:56,223 --> 02:29:58,498
We'll dive in 10 minutes.

838
02:30:13,263 --> 02:30:16,175
Alarm!

839
02:30:20,743 --> 02:30:25,692
- Alarm!
- Don't dive! The captain's up top!

840
02:30:27,423 --> 02:30:33,134
Navigator wounded.
Start flooding!

841
02:30:33,303 --> 02:30:37,091
Stand by escape gear.
Ready to abandon ship!

842
02:30:37,703 --> 02:30:44,302
- Where's the escape gear?
- Calm down!

843
02:30:44,463 --> 02:30:47,057
Bring the medic!

844
02:30:47,223 --> 02:30:53,458
Both engines maximum power.
Hard starboard.

845
02:30:53,623 --> 02:30:59,858
Easy. Here, take this.
Okay, we'll fix you up.

846
02:31:04,263 --> 02:31:09,212
Faster! Faster!

847
02:31:17,343 --> 02:31:19,652
Compresses!

848
02:31:25,223 --> 02:31:30,775
- Out of the way!
- Silence on board!

849
02:31:30,943 --> 02:31:35,892
- The port engine belt is loose.
- Maintain full power, Chief!

850
02:31:36,063 --> 02:31:39,499
All the power you've got!

851
02:31:39,663 --> 02:31:45,420
- Where the hell's he going?
- Due south. The African coastline.

852
02:31:53,543 --> 02:31:56,137
Damn it!

853
02:31:58,303 --> 02:32:04,060
- Alarm!
- Ready to dive! All hands forward!

854
02:32:09,583 --> 02:32:15,374
- Move! Clear the way!
- 90 metres. Quick!

855
02:32:15,543 --> 02:32:19,775
Bow planes zero.
Stern planes up 5. Shut vents.

856
02:32:19,943 --> 02:32:24,858
- Bow planes out of action!
- Switch to manual.

857
02:32:25,023 --> 02:32:28,572
The bow plane has jammed on dive.

858
02:32:33,663 --> 02:32:37,815
Damn it! All engines stop.

859
02:32:37,983 --> 02:32:44,058
- All men go aft!
- Hurry!

860
02:32:46,543 --> 02:32:52,379
- Move! Pump everything aft.
- Auxiliary pump out of action.

861
02:32:52,543 --> 02:32:57,219
- Blow forward tanks!
- Forward tanks blown.

862
02:32:57,383 --> 02:33:04,858
- She's still going down.
- We've got to shed some weight.

863
02:33:06,623 --> 02:33:10,616
Keep him quiet!

864
02:33:10,783 --> 02:33:16,699
- Main pump out of action!
- Permission to blow?

865
02:33:16,863 --> 02:33:20,014
Hard astern full.

866
02:33:22,863 --> 02:33:27,983
- No effect.
- All right, blow.

867
02:33:28,143 --> 02:33:30,657
Blow forward ballast.

868
02:33:32,863 --> 02:33:35,138
Pull out!

869
02:33:37,463 --> 02:33:41,217
Damn you! Pull out!

870
02:33:41,383 --> 02:33:46,332
- All you've got, Chief!
- Blow all we've got.

871
02:33:50,743 --> 02:33:52,813
Pull up.

872
02:33:56,783 --> 02:33:59,855
Christ, please...

873
02:34:13,503 --> 02:34:16,859
We can't hold her.

874
02:34:21,423 --> 02:34:24,301
200.

875
02:34:27,143 --> 02:34:29,737
210.

876
02:34:32,463 --> 02:34:35,216
220 metres.

877
02:34:36,063 --> 02:34:40,375
230. 240.

878
02:34:50,663 --> 02:34:56,340
- My God!
- Lord, turn not away from me.

879
02:34:56,503 --> 02:34:58,858
Take away all our sins.

880
02:35:47,463 --> 02:35:50,614
A shovel full of sand.

881
02:35:52,183 --> 02:35:57,098
The gods left a shovel full of sand
to keep us up.

882
02:36:06,943 --> 02:36:13,132
280 metres
and she's still in one piece!

883
02:36:58,943 --> 02:37:03,255
Torpedo hatch taking water!

884
02:37:03,943 --> 02:37:10,018
- Torpedo hatch taking water!
- Motor room taking water.

885
02:37:14,663 --> 02:37:18,542
We're taking water!

886
02:37:20,143 --> 02:37:24,500
- What do you need?
- Some timber for sawing.

887
02:37:26,383 --> 02:37:32,094
- Exhaust valve okay?
- I need the saw.

888
02:37:32,263 --> 02:37:35,733
Give me that flashlight.

889
02:37:36,663 --> 02:37:42,533
- I need a wrench.
- Water coming in!

890
02:37:42,703 --> 02:37:46,457
Where are the tools?

891
02:37:46,623 --> 02:37:53,461
- Bring me the tools.
- Where are you going?

892
02:37:53,623 --> 02:37:58,743
- Switchboard out of action.
- Give me proper damage reports!

893
02:37:58,903 --> 02:38:04,739
- We can't stop the flooding.
- With so much damage, we've had it.

894
02:38:04,903 --> 02:38:09,977
- Where's the most damage?
- Below, sir.

895
02:38:10,143 --> 02:38:14,534
Check the damage
to the batteries. Quickly!

896
02:38:16,543 --> 02:38:20,855
- Tighten that bolt.
- I can't see.

897
02:38:21,023 --> 02:38:25,062
Push as hard as you can.
It's stuck tight.

898
02:38:25,223 --> 02:38:28,135
I can't wedge it.

899
02:38:28,303 --> 02:38:32,774
- Give me the hammer.
- Take the wrench!

900
02:38:36,903 --> 02:38:42,261
- Do you need more men aft?
- I'll ask the lieutenant.

901
02:38:42,423 --> 02:38:46,211
This damn thing! Hold my light!

902
02:38:48,823 --> 02:38:55,262
You stupid son of a pig!
We've got work to do!

903
02:38:55,423 --> 02:39:02,101
- Tools from the engine room.
- Where's that damn wrench?

904
02:39:05,303 --> 02:39:10,252
- Bring another wrench.
- Hold the light.

905
02:39:11,063 --> 02:39:18,219
The bearings have seized.
It just keeps rising!

906
02:39:18,383 --> 02:39:21,739
Tighten the seals.
Don't shear the bolts.

907
02:39:22,583 --> 02:39:29,341
- The cooling system is leaking.
- Tighten the seals down there.

908
02:39:32,543 --> 02:39:39,733
Give me that shoring.
Take it, quickly!

909
02:39:39,903 --> 02:39:45,296
It's flooded down here.
Get me the biggest one.

910
02:39:45,463 --> 02:39:48,819
That's the biggest we can find.

911
02:39:49,463 --> 02:39:52,023
Higher!

912
02:39:54,223 --> 02:39:57,579
- Where do we put him?
- Easy, men.

913
02:39:57,743 --> 02:40:02,214
Captain,
the chief's looking for you.

914
02:40:07,783 --> 02:40:12,903
We're taking water fast.
The cooling system is blocked.

915
02:40:13,063 --> 02:40:18,774
The compressors are dislodged.

916
02:40:18,943 --> 02:40:22,856
Damn! What about fuel leaks?

917
02:40:23,023 --> 02:40:29,178
I can't tell as yet. Many of
the battery cells are cracked.

918
02:40:29,343 --> 02:40:32,141
Chlorine gas.

919
02:40:34,503 --> 02:40:37,813
It's red. Acid in the bilge.

920
02:40:37,983 --> 02:40:42,613
See how many cells have cracked.
Get some battery straps.

921
02:40:42,783 --> 02:40:46,856
- Battery straps!
- Get that out of the way.

922
02:40:47,023 --> 02:40:53,053
The chief needs battery straps,
make it quick!

923
02:40:59,423 --> 02:41:04,338
- It's still coming in.
- Get me the hammer.

924
02:41:08,463 --> 02:41:12,058
- Here!
- Thanks, Lieutenant.

925
02:41:14,823 --> 02:41:19,419
Get it in!

926
02:41:20,983 --> 02:41:25,773
- Watch out. Coming through.
- Quiet.

927
02:41:25,943 --> 02:41:28,696
Easy.

928
02:41:33,263 --> 02:41:38,940
Tell the chief the water is up to
the torpedo hatch and rising.

929
02:41:45,623 --> 02:41:47,898
I need light.

930
02:41:48,063 --> 02:41:53,695
Who's working on those shaft seals.
Tell them to hurry up.

931
02:41:55,503 --> 02:42:01,976
- 24 battery cells cracked.
- What a hell of a mess.

932
02:42:02,143 --> 02:42:07,615
- Battery straps.
- Come here with those.

933
02:42:09,583 --> 02:42:13,337
Let's hope these are enough.

934
02:42:15,383 --> 02:42:21,094
Our only chance
is to bridge all the live cells.

935
02:42:23,663 --> 02:42:28,612
- It's no good. I can't see.
- More light.

936
02:42:29,183 --> 02:42:34,735
We've got to close the leaks
or it's all over for us.

937
02:42:40,583 --> 02:42:43,734
More to the right.

938
02:42:50,583 --> 02:42:56,579
- I need wire to bridge them.
- Wire for the battery cells.

939
02:43:04,983 --> 02:43:10,011
The chief needs wire.
Get moving. Did you hear me?

940
02:43:10,183 --> 02:43:16,099
We've got plenty of fancy torpedoes.
Each one is 25,000 marks.

941
02:43:16,263 --> 02:43:22,259
All they forget
is 50 pfennigs' worth of old wire!

942
02:43:22,423 --> 02:43:28,214
- Now what?
- The draining pump is jammed.

943
02:43:28,383 --> 02:43:31,978
- That's great.
- Captain.

944
02:43:32,143 --> 02:43:37,058
- Here.
- Better than nothing.

945
02:43:37,223 --> 02:43:39,942
Pliers!

946
02:43:42,343 --> 02:43:45,335
Captain...

947
02:43:50,343 --> 02:43:54,222
All the leaks have been stopped.

948
02:43:57,423 --> 02:43:59,983
Good, Johann.

949
02:44:02,703 --> 02:44:06,093
That's good.

950
02:44:09,343 --> 02:44:12,574
Now change your wet things, man.

951
02:44:22,103 --> 02:44:27,735
We must get rid of the water.
There just has to be a way.

952
02:44:27,903 --> 02:44:32,101
Into the control-room bilge
and then outside.

953
02:44:35,823 --> 02:44:41,693
- Give it to me.
- Careful, you jerk!

954
02:44:41,863 --> 02:44:46,539
- Hoist the bucket.
- Get a move on, boys.

955
02:44:49,983 --> 02:44:53,180
Keep the rhythm going.

956
02:44:53,743 --> 02:44:58,259
Put your backs into it.

957
02:44:58,423 --> 02:45:02,177
Step on it. Quick!

958
02:45:06,583 --> 02:45:12,419
- How's it going, Chief?
- Three more. Starboard side.

959
02:45:22,223 --> 02:45:27,456
- How does it look?
- Only three to go, sir.

960
02:45:39,143 --> 02:45:42,533
Make some room for the chief.

961
02:45:57,623 --> 02:46:03,619
- More hands needed aft.
- Take the men off watch.

962
02:46:04,223 --> 02:46:10,059
Captain... all of our compasses
are out of action.

963
02:46:11,903 --> 02:46:16,658
We've lost the sounding gear.
All radio contact is dead.

964
02:46:19,183 --> 02:46:25,179
- First-rate condition.
- Can we get up again?

965
02:46:30,543 --> 02:46:34,252
Do you think we have a chance, sir?

966
02:46:38,903 --> 02:46:42,259
Good question.

967
02:46:46,343 --> 02:46:52,373
A bit of air must still be in
the ballast tanks from the blowing.

968
02:46:54,463 --> 02:47:01,892
That should help us. We'll use all
the high-pressure air we have left.

969
02:47:04,183 --> 02:47:07,698
We'll try.

970
02:47:09,783 --> 02:47:17,701
The boat has to be lighter.
We've got to get the water out.

971
02:47:22,463 --> 02:47:26,058
<i>It must work!</i>

972
02:47:26,743 --> 02:47:30,213
Come with me aft.

973
02:47:36,183 --> 02:47:43,453
The ballast pump and the compressed
air could just force the water out.

974
02:47:43,623 --> 02:47:49,095
- The ballast pump?
- We're fixing it.

975
02:47:51,263 --> 02:47:57,782
We gamble on one count.
One blast and we...

976
02:47:57,943 --> 02:48:03,256
- There won't be a second chance.
- When?

977
02:48:03,423 --> 02:48:08,702
When the repairs are completed.
In about eight hours, sir.

978
02:48:08,863 --> 02:48:13,061
- CO2 content?
- 1.8%.

979
02:48:13,223 --> 02:48:17,580
- Will the oxygen last?
- No.

980
02:48:19,663 --> 02:48:26,455
Emergency issue.
All men not working turn in.

981
02:49:33,463 --> 02:49:38,776
- Will he pull through?
- It's difficult to say.

982
02:49:54,823 --> 02:49:58,452
He doesn't look too good.

983
02:50:34,823 --> 02:50:38,896
Well, Pilgrim...
is everything okay?

984
02:50:39,063 --> 02:50:43,136
We're getting it under control.
I think we're winning.

985
02:50:46,583 --> 02:50:52,374
- How is it looking aft?
- We've done what we can, sir.

986
02:50:53,583 --> 02:50:57,132
I guess it's time
I looked things over.

987
02:51:28,183 --> 02:51:31,220
You should be careful.

988
02:51:51,903 --> 02:51:56,374
- Can you make it?
- We'll make it.

989
02:51:57,863 --> 02:52:04,382
- How does it look?
- We'll soon be running.

990
02:52:11,983 --> 02:52:18,775
- How's it going?
- Two bearings to be changed.

991
02:53:11,623 --> 02:53:15,411
Chief...

992
02:53:21,463 --> 02:53:25,422
Do you want some glucose?

993
02:53:27,303 --> 02:53:30,375
How about some apple juice?

994
02:54:02,583 --> 02:54:08,260
They were crazy,
ordering us through the strait.

995
02:54:08,423 --> 02:54:11,779
It was going to go wrong...

996
02:54:15,983 --> 02:54:19,373
He knew it.

997
02:54:19,543 --> 02:54:22,933
The old man, he knew it.

998
02:54:26,863 --> 02:54:33,780
From the moment that radio signal
came through, he realized the risk.

999
02:54:36,503 --> 02:54:42,578
That's the reason
he ordered us ashore.

1000
02:54:46,743 --> 02:54:50,338
He knew there was very little hope.

1001
02:55:04,983 --> 02:55:11,616
He tried to fool us.
"An easy trick," he said.

1002
02:55:15,143 --> 02:55:19,341
"Dive and drift with the current. "

1003
02:55:23,383 --> 02:55:27,581
What a clever trick.

1004
02:55:28,183 --> 02:55:32,301
But it has to work.

1005
02:55:37,463 --> 02:55:40,978
Will we ever get out of this?

1006
02:55:49,423 --> 02:55:52,893
I really don't know.

1007
02:56:38,903 --> 02:56:45,058
- I'm sorry.
- You think it's hopeless now?

1008
02:56:48,023 --> 02:56:51,811
It's been 15 hours.

1009
02:56:58,383 --> 02:57:01,898
We'll never do it.

1010
02:57:21,863 --> 02:57:24,093
I'm sorry.

1011
02:57:31,943 --> 02:57:36,095
They made us all dream
for this day.

1012
02:57:40,063 --> 02:57:44,215
To be fearless and proud and alone.

1013
02:57:45,103 --> 02:57:50,700
They told us it would be
the test of our manhood.

1014
02:57:50,863 --> 02:57:58,816
To need no one and sacrifice all
for the fatherland and courage.

1015
02:58:02,343 --> 02:58:05,938
Is that not the way
they said it all?

1016
02:58:08,783 --> 02:58:14,619
I just want someone to be with.

1017
02:58:19,663 --> 02:58:23,861
The only thing I feel is afraid.

1018
02:59:11,263 --> 02:59:14,573
Situation report, sir.

1019
02:59:18,263 --> 02:59:22,859
The boat is in order.
The pump is clear.

1020
02:59:24,183 --> 02:59:31,055
Water in the trimming tanks can
be blown out with compressed air.

1021
02:59:32,023 --> 02:59:37,416
The compass is in order.
Echo sounder clear.

1022
02:59:38,143 --> 02:59:42,102
Maybe we'll be okay.

1023
02:59:52,143 --> 02:59:55,818
Good, Chief.

1024
02:59:58,383 --> 03:00:01,216
Good.

1025
03:00:09,143 --> 03:00:12,215
Go and take a rest now.

1026
03:00:18,623 --> 03:00:22,138
Just a few small problems left, sir.

1027
03:01:05,823 --> 03:01:13,776
You have to have good men.
Good men, all of them.

1028
03:01:17,663 --> 03:01:20,461
Now listen...

1029
03:01:20,623 --> 03:01:27,620
We're going to blow out the water
and try to get out of the sand.

1030
03:01:29,823 --> 03:01:36,615
If we make it to the surface,
it could still get pretty rough.

1031
03:01:37,703 --> 03:01:41,093
The traffic's heavy up there.

1032
03:01:44,583 --> 03:01:50,374
Pray the engines start
so we can get out of this mess.

1033
03:01:51,263 --> 03:01:58,419
With the condition the boat is in
we'll head straight for La Rochelle.

1034
03:02:00,503 --> 03:02:05,293
If we make it,
it's half a bottle of beer for each.

1035
03:02:09,503 --> 03:02:13,462
There's one thing on our side...

1036
03:02:14,583 --> 03:02:18,132
They won't be expecting us.

1037
03:02:23,943 --> 03:02:26,935
Well, men...

1038
03:02:27,863 --> 03:02:32,015
- All set?
- Aye-aye, sir.

1039
03:02:34,343 --> 03:02:38,177
- Surface contacts?
- Nothing near, Captain.

1040
03:02:38,343 --> 03:02:43,736
Get ready to surface.
Stand by escape gear. Red light on.

1041
03:02:44,623 --> 03:02:47,660
Battle stations.

1042
03:03:10,383 --> 03:03:14,296
- Let her blow.
- Blow all tanks.

1043
03:04:24,343 --> 03:04:27,141
She's rising.

1044
03:04:28,023 --> 03:04:32,096
- Easy.
- Starboard planes down 15.

1045
03:04:40,383 --> 03:04:46,458
- 270 metres!
- First watch, stand by.

1046
03:04:46,623 --> 03:04:49,342
260 metres.

1047
03:04:54,743 --> 03:04:57,701
250 metres.

1048
03:05:05,023 --> 03:05:07,901
240 metres.

1049
03:05:12,543 --> 03:05:15,455
230 metres.

1050
03:05:19,863 --> 03:05:22,536
220.

1051
03:06:15,183 --> 03:06:17,572
Start up engines?

1052
03:06:21,863 --> 03:06:27,096
- Go ahead. Both main engines.
- This is it, boys.

1053
03:06:35,463 --> 03:06:38,739
Yeah.

1054
03:06:52,263 --> 03:06:55,016
They're going!

1055
03:06:55,183 --> 03:06:59,859
I've never heard such sweet music
in all my life.

1056
03:07:02,463 --> 03:07:05,455
They're running!

1057
03:07:19,263 --> 03:07:22,892
They won't catch us this time.
Not this time!

1058
03:07:26,263 --> 03:07:31,383
Keep going and get us back.
That's an order!

1059
03:07:31,543 --> 03:07:35,172
Right full rudder.
Come to 320.

1060
03:07:35,343 --> 03:07:38,096
Jesus that's good!

1061
03:07:42,263 --> 03:07:48,133
They haven't spotted us.
They're snoring in their bunks.

1062
03:07:51,543 --> 03:07:57,095
They're drinking in the bar.
Celebrating our sinking!

1063
03:07:59,783 --> 03:08:03,458
Not yet, my friends!

1064
03:08:41,223 --> 03:08:46,377
- Boys, here's to home!
- And an end to the war.

1065
03:09:19,823 --> 03:09:23,213
Let's pray the engines hold out.

1066
03:09:25,503 --> 03:09:30,258
With a bit of luck...

1067
03:09:32,703 --> 03:09:36,298
...we'll make it back home.

1068
03:09:40,023 --> 03:09:46,337
<i>Third U-boat flotilla
welcome back home. Three cheers.</i>

1069
03:10:16,023 --> 03:10:19,333
Both engines stop.
Stern line out.

1070
03:10:44,223 --> 03:10:50,571
- Thank you, Hinrich.
- It's okay. The sun is shining.

1071
03:10:51,543 --> 03:10:55,058
Another two metres.

1072
03:10:56,343 --> 03:10:59,301
Okay, we have it.

1073
03:11:05,623 --> 03:11:09,457
- Nearly there.
- Wounded man coming ashore.

1074
03:12:34,463 --> 03:12:37,421
Get under cover!

1075
03:13:09,863 --> 03:13:14,983
- Bring a medic!
- Over here.

1076
03:13:15,143 --> 03:13:18,772
Medic!
