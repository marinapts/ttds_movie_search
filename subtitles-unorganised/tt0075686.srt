1
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,240
There's an old joke.

2
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,285
Two elderly women are
at a Catskill mountain resort.

3
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,618
One says, "The food at this place
is really terrible."

4
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,681
The other says,
"I know, and such small portions."

5
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,728
That's essentially
how I feel about life:

6
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:06,527
full of loneliness, misery,
suffering and unhappiness...

7
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,762
and it's all over
much too quickly.

8
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,600
The other important joke for me...

9
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,368
is one usually attributed
to Groucho Marx...

10
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:19,310
but it appears originally in Freud's
Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious.

11
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,609
It goes like this, I'm paraphrasing:

12
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:26,050
I never want to belong to any club that
would have someone like me for a member.

13
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,988
That's the key joke of my adult life
in terms of my relationships with women.

14
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:34,254
Lately the strangest things
have been going through my mind...

15
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:37,956
because I turned 40, and I guess
I'm going through a life crisis.

16
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,761
I'm not worried about aging.
I'm not one of those characters.

17
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,429
But I'm balding slightly on top. That's
about the worst you can say about me.

18
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,837
I think I'm going to get better
as I get older.

19
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,876
I think I'm going to be
the balding, virile type...

20
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,778
as opposed to the distinguished gray.

21
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,839
Unless I'm neither of those two.

22
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,407
Unless I'm one of those guys with saliva
dribbling out of his mouth...

23
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:04,116
who wanders into a cafeteria with a
shopping bag, screaming about socialism.

24
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:08,754
Annie and I broke up, and I still
can't get my mind around that.

25
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,389
I keep sifting the pieces
of the relationship through my mind...

26
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:17,334
examining my life and trying to
figure out where did the screw-up come.

27
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,338
A year ago we were in love.

28
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,604
It's funny. I'm not a morose type.
I'm not a depressive character.

29
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,413
I was a reasonably happy kid.

30
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,508
I was brought up in Brooklyn
during World War II.

31
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,015
He's been depressed.

32
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,523
- Suddenly he can't do anything.
- Why are you depressed, Alvy?

33
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:42,618
Tell Dr. Flicker.
It's something he read.

34
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,686
Something he read, huh?

35
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:49,030
- The universe is expanding.
- The universe is expanding?

36
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,900
The universe is everything,
and if it's expanding...

37
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:55,839
someday it will break apart,
and that will be the end of everything.

38
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:00,312
What is that your business?
He stopped doing his homework!

39
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,872
- What's the point?
- What's the universe got to do with it?

40
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,317
You're here in Brooklyn.
Brooklyn is not expanding!

41
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:11,380
It won't be expanding
for billions of years!

42
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:16,394
We've got to try and enjoy ourselves
while we're here! Huh?

43
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,533
My analyst says I exaggerate
my childhood memories...

44
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,072
but I swear I was brought up
underneath the roller coaster...

45
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,335
in the Coney Island section
of Brooklyn.

46
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,709
Maybe that accounts for my personality,
which is a little nervous.

47
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,513
I have a hyperactive imagination.
My mind tends to jump around a little.

48
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:42,043
I have some trouble
between fantasy and reality.

49
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,356
My father ran
the bumper-car concession.

50
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,121
There he is, and there I am.

51
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:51,652
I used to get my aggression out
through those cars.

52
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,527
I remember the staff
at our public school.

53
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,936
We had a saying,
"Those who can't do, teach...

54
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,271
and those who can't teach,
teach gym."

55
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:07,746
And those who couldn't do anything,
I think, were assigned to our school.

56
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,178
I must say, I always thought
my schoolmates were idiots.

57
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,188
Melvyn Greenglass
and his fat little face.

58
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,419
And Henrietta Farrell,
Miss Perfect all the time.

59
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:23,087
And Ivan Ackerman,
always the wrong answer. Always!

60
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,096
Seven and three is nine.

61
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,400
Even then I knew
they were just jerks.

62
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,960
In 1942 I had already discovered women.

63
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,499
He kissed me!

64
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,045
That's the second time this month!
Step up here.

65
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,104
- What did I do?
- Step up here.

66
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,775
- What did I do?
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

67
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,786
Why? I was just expressing
a healthy sexual curiosity.

68
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:51,312
Six-year-old boys
don't have girls on their minds.

69
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,551
I did.

70
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,527
For God sakes, Alvy, even Freud
speaks of a latency period!

71
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,759
I never had a latency period.
I can't help it.

72
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,164
Why couldn't you
have been more like Donald?

73
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,601
There was a model boy.

74
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,037
Tell the folks
where you are today, Donald.

75
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:10,633
I run a profitable dress company.

76
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,441
Sometimes I wonder where
my classmates are today.

77
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:18,382
I'm president
of the Pinkus Plumbing Company.

78
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,219
I sell talliths.

79
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:26,122
I used to be a heroin addict,
now I'm a methadone addict.

80
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,491
I'm into leather.

81
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,155
I lost track of most of my old
schoolmates, but I wound up a comedian.

82
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:37,259
They did not take me in the army.

83
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,999
I was 4-P.

84
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,668
In the event of war,
I'm a hostage.

85
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,680
You always only saw the worst
in people.

86
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,808
You never could get along
with anyone in school.

87
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,284
You were always out of step
with the world.

88
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,289
Even when you got famous,
you still distrusted the world.

89
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,020
I distinctly heard it.
He muttered under his breath, "Jew."

90
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,028
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

91
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,259
We were walking off the tennis court.
He was there and me and his wife.

92
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,357
He looked her,
then they both looked at me...

93
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,595
and under his breath
he said, "Jew."

94
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,638
You're a total paranoid.

95
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,606
How am I a paranoid?
I pick up on those kind of things.

96
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:20,305
I was having lunch with guys from NBC,
so I said, "Did you eat yet?"

97
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,010
Tom Christie said, "No. Jew?"
Not "Did you?"

98
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:28,349
Not "Did you eat?" but "Jew eat?"
You get it?

99
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,049
- Max...
- Stop calling me Max.

100
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:34,855
Why? It's a good name for you.
Max, you see conspiracies in everything.

101
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,452
No, I don't. I was in a record store.
Listen to this.

102
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:43,127
There's this tall, blond crew-cutted guy
and he's looking at me in a funny way.

103
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:46,103
He's saying, "Yes, we have a sale
this week on Wagner."

104
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,437
Wagner, Max.
I know what he's trying to tell me.

105
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,000
Very significantly, Wagner.

106
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,639
Right, Max. California, Max.

107
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,775
- Get the hell out of this crazy city.
- Forget it.

108
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,843
We move to sunny L.A.
All of show business is out there.

109
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,754
You keep bringing it up,
but I don't want to live in a city...

110
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,954
where the only cultural advantage is you
can make a right turn on a red light.

111
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,020
All right, forget it. Aren't you
going to be late for meeting Annie?

112
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,896
I'm meeting her in front of the Beekman.
I have a few minutes left, right?

113
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,943
Are you on television?

114
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,219
Yeah, occasionally.

115
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,988
What's your name?

116
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,995
You wouldn't know it.
It doesn't matter.

117
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:48,090
You're on Johnny Carson, right?

118
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,898
Once in a while.

119
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,495
What's your name?

120
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,940
- I'm Robert Redford.
- Come on!

121
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,207
Alvy Singer.
Thanks very much for everything.

122
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,342
This is Alvy Singer!

123
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,648
This guy's on television.
Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?

124
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,056
- Give me a break.
- This guy's on television.

125
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,060
I need the large polo mallet.

126
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,461
- Who's on television?
- This guy, on the Johnny Carson Show.

127
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:23,127
- Is this a meeting of the teamsters?
- What program?

128
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,170
- Can I have your autograph?
- You don't want my autograph.

129
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,173
I do! It's for my girlfriend.

130
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,266
Make it out to Ralph.

131
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,938
- Your girlfriend's name is Ralph?
- It's for my brother.

132
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,910
You're really Alvy Singer,
the TV star?

133
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,979
- Alvy Singer over here!
- It's all right, fellas.

134
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,753
Jesus, what did you do?
Come by way of the Panama Canal?

135
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,058
- I'm in a bad mood.
- I'm here with the Godfather cast.

136
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,260
- Learn to deal with it.
- I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech.

137
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,928
Please, I have a headache.

138
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,064
You are in a bad mood.
You must be getting your period.

139
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,131
I'm not getting my period! Jesus!

140
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,269
Every time anything out of the ordinary
happens, you think I have my period.

141
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,075
A little louder. I think one
of them may have missed it.

142
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:12,345
- Has the picture started?
- Two minutes ago.

143
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,613
That's it. Forget it.
I can't go in.

144
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,588
- Two minutes.
- We've blown it already.

145
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,057
I can't go in, in the middle.

146
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,061
In the middle? We've only missed
the titles. They're in Swedish.

147
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,063
You want to get coffee for two hours?

148
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:28,396
- Two hours? No. I'm going in.
- Go ahead. Good-bye.

149
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,197
While we're talking,
we could be inside.

150
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,172
Can we not argue in front of everybody?
I get embarrassed.

151
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:39,905
- All right. So what do you want to do?
- I don't know. Go to another movie?

152
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,243
- Let's see The Sorrow and the Pity.
- We've seen it.

153
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,409
I'm not in the mood to see
a four hour documentary on Nazis.

154
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,509
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:52,524
I've got to see a picture exactly
from start to finish, 'cause I'm anal.

156
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,560
That's a polite word
for what you are.

157
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:01,028
We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.
It is not one of his best.

158
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,159
It lacks a cohesive structure.

159
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:07,103
You get the feeling he's not absolutely
sure what it is he wants to say.

160
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:12,110
I've always felt he was essentially
a technical filmmaker.

161
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,272
Granted La Strada was a great film.

162
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,476
Great in its use of negative imagery
more than anything else.

163
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,816
- I'm going to have a stroke.
- Stop listening to him.

164
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,221
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.

165
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,727
All that Juliet of the Spirits
or Satyricon.

166
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,991
I found it incredibly indulgent.

167
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,261
He really is one of
the most indulgent of filmmakers.

168
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,632
Key word here is "indulgent."

169
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:42,936
- What are you depressed about?
- I missed my therapy. I overslept.

170
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,102
How can you possibly oversleep?

171
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,872
The alarm clock.

172
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,971
You know what a hostile gesture
that is to me?

173
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,040
I know. Because of our
sexual problem, right?

174
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:56,077
Everybody in line has to know
our rate of intercourse?

175
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,986
It's like Samuel Beckett.

176
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,891
I admire the technique,
but it doesn't hit me on a gut level.

177
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,725
- I'd like to hit him on a gut level.
- Stop it.

178
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:08,790
He's spitting on my neck
when he talks.

179
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,031
You know something else?
You're so egocentric that...

180
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,631
if I miss my therapy you can only think
of it in terms of how it affects you!

181
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,107
They're probably on their first date.

182
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,842
Probably met by answering an ad
in the New York Review of Books.

183
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,850
"Thirtyish academic
wishes to meet woman...

184
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:29,854
who's interested in Mozart,
James Joyce and sodomy."

185
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,856
What do you mean
"our sexual problem"?

186
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,449
I'm comparatively normal
for a guy raised in Brooklyn.

187
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,588
I'm sorry. My sexual problem.
Okay? My sexual problem!

188
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:42,828
I never read that. That was Henry James'
sequel to Turn of the Screw?

189
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,427
It's the influence of television.

190
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:51,272
Marshall McLuhan deals with it
in terms of it being a high intensity.

191
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,436
Do you understand?
A hot medium.

192
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:57,744
What I wouldn't give for a large sock
with horse manure in it.

193
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,617
What do you do when you get stuck
on a movie line with a guy like this?

194
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,781
Wait. Why can't I give my opinion?
It's a free country!

195
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,348
He can.
Do you have to give it so loud?

196
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,860
Aren't you ashamed
to pontificate like that?

197
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:14,229
The funny part is, you don't know
anything about Marshall McLuhan.

198
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,862
I happen to teach a class at Columbia
called "TV, Media and Culture."

199
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,738
I think my insights into Mr. McLuhan
have a great deal of validity.

200
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:27,575
Do you? That's funny, because I happen
to have Mr. McLuhan right here.

201
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:31,207
Just let me...
Come over here. Tell him.

202
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,274
I heard what you were saying.

203
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:37,846
You know nothing of my work.
You mean my whole fallacy is wrong.

204
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,188
How you ever got to teach a course
in anything is totally amazing!

205
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,888
If life were only like this.

206
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:51,499
June 14, 1940.
The German army occupies Paris.

207
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,666
All over the country,
people are desperate for food.

208
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,336
Those guys in the French Resistance
were really brave.

209
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,209
To have to listen
to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

210
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,149
I know. Sometimes I ask myself
how I'd stand up under torture.

211
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,209
You? You kidding?

212
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:12,280
The Gestapo would take away your charge
card, and you'd tell 'em everything.

213
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,383
That movie makes me feel guilty.

214
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,587
It's supposed to.

215
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,661
- Alvy, I...
- What?

216
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,031
What's the matter?

217
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,970
It's not natural.
We're sleeping in a bed together.

218
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,973
It's been a long time!

219
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,509
It's just, I mean...

220
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,239
I've got to sing tomorrow night,
so I have to rest my voice.

221
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,578
It's always some kind of an excuse.
You used to think I was very sexy.

222
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,380
When we first started going out,
we had sex constantly.

223
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,080
We're probably listed in
The Guinness Book of World Records.

224
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:47,023
It'll pass. I'm going
through a phase, that's all.

225
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,583
You've been married before.
You know how things can get.

226
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,531
You were very hot
for Allison at first.

227
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:00,734
You know that you're on right
after Chris Brown, in about 20 minutes.

228
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:02,796
Excuse me.
When do I go on?

229
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,865
Who are you?

230
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:07,377
Alvy Singer.

231
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:10,107
- I'm the comedian.
- Oh, comedian.

232
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:13,014
Oh, you're on next.

233
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:15,211
What do you mean "next"?

234
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,414
You're on right after this act.

235
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,219
- It can't be, because he's a comic.
- Yes.

236
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,728
- You're putting on two comics in a row?
- Why not?

237
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:27,162
No, I'm sorry. I'm not going to go on
after another comedian.

238
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:31,601
- It's okay.
- No. They're laughing. I'd rather not.

239
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,138
Will you relax, please?
They're going to love you.

240
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:37,265
I know. I prefer not to.
Look, they're laughing at him.

241
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:39,606
What are you telling me?
They'll laugh at him a few minutes.

242
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,738
Then I've got to get laughs, too.
How much can they laugh?

243
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:45,578
- They're laughed out.
- Do you feel all right?

244
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,777
Jesus.

245
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,789
- What's your name?
- Allison.

246
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:54,324
Yeah? Allison what?

247
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:56,485
Portchnik.

248
00:14:56,861 --> 00:15:00,592
- Portchnik? That's nice.
- Thank you.

249
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:07,561
So, you work for Stevenson
all the time?

250
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,735
- No. I'm doing my thesis.
- On what?

251
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,973
Political commitment
in 20th-century literature.

252
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:18,413
You're like New York Jewish,
left-wing, intellectual...

253
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:21,748
Central Park West, Brandeis University,
socialist summer camps...

254
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,983
and the father
with the Ben Shahn drawings...

255
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:28,184
really strike-oriented...

256
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:30,625
Stop me before I make
a complete imbecile of myself.

257
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:35,132
That was wonderful! I love being reduced
to a cultural stereotype.

258
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,692
Right. I'm a bigot,
but for the left.

259
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,800
I have to go out there.
Say something encouraging, quickly.

260
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:48,539
- I think you're cute.
- Yeah? Do you?

261
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:50,808
Go ahead.

262
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,561
I don't know why they would have me
at this kind of rally...

263
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:08,326
'cause I'm not essentially
a political comedian.

264
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,064
I interestingly had dated a woman...

265
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,232
in the Eisenhower administration,
briefly.

266
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:19,071
It was ironic to me...

267
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:23,142
'cause I was trying to do to her...

268
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:26,342
what Eisenhower's been doing
to the country for the last eight years.

269
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:32,582
I'm sorry.
I can't go through with this.

270
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:36,115
I can't get it off my mind!
It's obsessing me!

271
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:39,163
I'm getting tired of it.
I need your attention.

272
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,360
But it doesn't make any sense.
He drove past the book depository...

273
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,666
and the police said conclusively
that it was an exit wound.

274
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:51,107
So how is it possible for Oswald
to have fired from two angles at once?

275
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,235
It doesn't make sense!

276
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:57,970
I'll tell you this.
He was not marksman enough...

277
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:00,540
to hit a moving target at that range.

278
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:05,112
But if there was a second assassin...

279
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,750
- That's it!
- We've been through this.

280
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,386
They recovered the shells
from that rifle.

281
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,487
What are you saying now?

282
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:17,024
That everybody on the Warren Commission
is in on this conspiracy, right?

283
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,763
Why not?

284
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:23,001
- Earl Warren?
- Honey, I don't know Earl Warren.

285
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:25,042
Lyndon Johnson?

286
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,476
Lyndon Johnson is a politician!

287
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:32,141
You know the ethics those guys have.
It's a notch underneath child molester.

288
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,651
Then everybody's in on the conspiracy.

289
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:40,055
The FBI and the CIA and J. Edgar Hoover,
the oil companies...

290
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,458
the Pentagon, the men's-room attendant
at the White House?

291
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:46,691
I would leave out
the men's-room attendant.

292
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:52,135
You're using this conspiracy theory
as an excuse to avoid sex with me.

293
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:55,536
Oh, my God!
She's right.

294
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,802
Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik?

295
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:01,835
She was beautiful. She was willing.
She was real intelligent.

296
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:04,780
Is it the old Groucho Marx joke...

297
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:08,808
that I don't want to belong to any club
that would have me for a member?

298
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:12,445
- Alvy, don't panic!
- It's a mistake...

299
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,458
to bring a live thing in the house.

300
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,517
Don't do that.

301
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:20,121
Maybe we should call the police.
Dial 911. It's the lobster squad.

302
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:22,723
They're only baby ones.
For God sakes.

303
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,929
- If they're babies, you pick them up.
- All right! All right!

304
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,905
- Here you go!
- Don't give it to me.

305
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:32,272
Look! One crawled
behind the refrigerator.

306
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:36,177
It'll turn up in our bed at night.
Get out of here with that thing!

307
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:40,374
Talk to him.
You speak shellfish.

308
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:43,284
Hey, put it in the pot.

309
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:46,881
I can't. I can't put a live thing
in hot water.

310
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,222
What d'you think we were going to do,
take him to the movies?

311
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,387
Good. Oh, thank you.

312
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:54,454
Okay, it's in.
It's definitely in the pot.

313
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:57,296
Annie, there's a big lobster
behind the refrigerator.

314
00:18:57,368 --> 00:19:00,303
I can't get it out.
This thing's heavy.

315
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:04,273
Maybe if I put a dish of butter sauce
here, it'll run out the other side.

316
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:06,276
I'm going to get my camera.

317
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:08,938
I think if I could pry...

318
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:12,505
We should have gotten steaks, 'cause
they don't have legs and run around.

319
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:19,319
- Pick this lobster up. Hold it, please.
- You're going to take pictures now?

320
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,087
Alvy, it'll be wonderful.
Oh, lovely!

321
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:26,858
- It's disgusting.
- One more, please? One more.

322
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:28,364
Good!

323
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,891
Here's what I want to know.
Am I your first, big romance?

324
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:38,498
- Who was?
- There was Dennis from high school.

325
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:43,377
Local kid who'd meet you in front
of the movie house on Saturday night?

326
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:48,385
- You should've seen how I looked then.
- I can imagine. An astronaut's wife.

327
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,422
- Then there was Jerry, the actor.
- Look at you.

328
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:53,423
You're such a clown.

329
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:57,018
- I look pretty.
- You always do. But that guy with you!

330
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:01,623
Acting is like an exploration
of the soul. It's very religious.

331
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:05,226
Like a kind of
liberating consciousness.

332
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:07,567
It's like a visual poem.

333
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,698
Is he kidding with that crap?

334
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:12,106
Oh, right!

335
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:15,634
Right. I think I know exactly what
you mean when you say "religious."

336
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:18,443
- You do?
- Come on. I was younger.

337
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:20,450
That was last year!

338
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:23,487
It's like when I think of dying.
You know how I'd like to die?

339
00:20:23,554 --> 00:20:24,987
How?

340
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:28,150
I'd like to get torn apart
by wild animals.

341
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:31,992
- Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
- He was a terrific actor.

342
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:35,396
He's neat looking
and he was emotional.

343
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:37,696
I don't think you like
emotion too much.

344
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,602
Touch my heart with your foot.

345
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,503
I may throw up.

346
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:45,098
- He was creepy.
- Yeah!

347
00:20:45,176 --> 00:20:50,512
- You're pretty lucky I came along.
- Oh, really? La-de-dah!

348
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:54,415
If anyone ever told me
that I'd be taking out a girl...

349
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:56,544
who used expressions
like "la-de-dah"...

350
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:59,852
That's right. You really like
those New York girls.

351
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:03,325
- Not just. Not only.
- I'd say so. You married two of them.

352
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:04,690
There's Henry Drucker.

353
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:05,987
There's Henry Drucker.

354
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,191
He has a Chair in History
at Princeton.

355
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:12,464
The short man is Hershel Kaminsky.
He has a Chair in Philosophy at Cornell.

356
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,471
Two more chairs,
they got a dining room set.

357
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:17,975
- Why are you so hostile?
- I want to watch the Knicks on TV.

358
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:20,306
Is that Paul Goodman? No.

359
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:23,472
Be nice to the host,
because he's publishing my book.

360
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,676
Hi, Doug.
Douglas Wyeth...

361
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:29,413
The Foul Rag-and-Bone Shop
of the Heart.

362
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:31,182
I'm so tired
of spending evenings...

363
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:33,280
making fake insights
with people who work for Dysentery.

364
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,791
Commentary.

365
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:38,852
I heard Commentary and Dissent
had merged and formed Dysentery.

366
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,990
No jokes.
These are friends. Okay?

367
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:45,524
Cleveland Cavaliers losing
to the New York Knicks.

368
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:49,801
Here you are.
There's people out there.

369
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:52,672
Two minutes ago,
the Knicks are ahead 14 points...

370
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,235
and now they're ahead two points.

371
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,175
Alvy, what is so fascinating...

372
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:04,119
about a group of pituitary cases
trying to stuff a ball through a hoop?

373
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:06,315
What is fascinating
is that it's physical.

374
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,325
That's one thing about intellectuals:

375
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:12,022
They've proved you can be brilliant
and have no idea what's going on.

376
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:16,931
But, on the other hand,
the body doesn't lie as we now know.

377
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:19,827
Stop acting out.

378
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,032
It'll be great, because all those
Ph.D. s are in there discussing...

379
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:26,975
modes of alienation,
and we'll be in here quietly humping.

380
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:31,607
Don't. You're using sex
to express hostility.

381
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:36,517
"Why do you always reduce my animal
urges to psychoanalytic categories,"...

382
00:22:36,587 --> 00:22:39,613
he said as he removed her brassier.

383
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:45,692
There are people out there
from the New Yorker magazine!

384
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:48,789
My God!
What would they think?

385
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:58,508
- Damn siren!
- Don't get upset.

386
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:00,441
Damn it! I was so close!

387
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:03,207
Last night it was a guy
honking his car horn.

388
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:06,273
The city can't close down.

389
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,877
You want them to close the airport
so we can have sex?

390
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:12,616
I'm too tense.
I need a Valium.

391
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,682
My analyst says I should live
in the country and not in New York.

392
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,287
We can't have this discussion all
the time. The country makes me nervous.

393
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:23,231
You've got crickets. It's quiet.
There's no place to walk after dinner.

394
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:26,327
There's the screens
with the dead moths behind them.

395
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:29,396
You got the Manson family, possibly.
You got Dick and Perry.

396
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:34,468
Okay! My analyst just thinks I'm too
tense! Where's the goddamn Valium?

397
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:36,945
Okay, it's quiet now.
We can get started again.

398
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:39,778
I can't! My head is throbbing.

399
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,978
- You got a headache?
- I have a headache!

400
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,920
- Bad?
- Like Oswald in Ghosts.

401
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:47,389
- Jesus.
- Where are you going?

402
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:50,859
I'm going to take another in a series
of cold showers.

403
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,294
Max, my serve is going to send you
to the showers early.

404
00:23:53,364 --> 00:23:55,355
Right. To get back to what
we were discussing.

405
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:58,869
The failure of the country to get behind
New York City is anti-Semitism.

406
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:00,836
Max, the city is terribly run.

407
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:04,272
I'm not discussing politics
or economics. This is foreskin.

408
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:08,438
That's a convenient out. When some group
disagrees with you, it's anti-Semitism.

409
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,038
The rest of the country
looks upon New York...

410
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:15,017
like we're left-wing, communist, Jewish,
homosexual pornographers.

411
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,680
I think of us that way sometimes,
and I live here.

412
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:22,283
Max, if we lived in California, we could
play outdoors every day in the sun.

413
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,523
Sun is bad for you. Everything
our parents said was good is bad.

414
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:28,190
Sun, milk, red meat, college.

415
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:31,902
Egad, here he comes.

416
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:37,938
You know Alvy?
This is Janet.

417
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,604
- This is Annie Hall.
- This is Alvy.

418
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,274
- Who's playing with who here?
- You and me against them?

419
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:47,442
- That's not fair.
- I can't play too good.

420
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:48,985
I've had four lessons.

421
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,968
Well...

422
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,535
bye.

423
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:22,317
- You play very well.
- Oh, yeah? So do you!

424
00:25:22,386 --> 00:25:25,446
God, what a dumb thing to say.

425
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:30,392
You say "You play well," and right away
I have to say, "You play well."

426
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:32,622
Oh, God, Annie.

427
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,825
Well. Oh, well!

428
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,334
La-de-dah.

429
00:25:39,303 --> 00:25:41,271
You want a lift?

430
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:45,867
Oh, why?
You got a car?

431
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:48,741
No, I was going to take a cab.

432
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:51,304
Oh, no. I have a car.

433
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,284
You have a car?

434
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:58,278
If you have a car...

435
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,814
then why did you say, "Do you have
a car" like you wanted a lift?

436
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:06,889
Geez, I don't know.
I wasn't...

437
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:12,001
I got this VW out there.

438
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:13,770
What a jerk.

439
00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:16,736
Would you like a lift?

440
00:26:16,806 --> 00:26:20,970
- Sure. Which way are you going?
- Me? Oh, downtown.

441
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:23,011
I'm going uptown.

442
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:25,513
Oh, I'm going uptown, too.

443
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:29,210
- You said you were going downtown.
- Yeah, well...

444
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:31,719
I can go uptown, too.
I live uptown.

445
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:35,690
What the hell? It would be nice
having company. I hate driving alone.

446
00:26:36,726 --> 00:26:39,160
How long do you know Janet?
Where do you know her from?

447
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:41,856
- I'm in her acting class.
- You're an actress!

448
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:44,126
Well, I do commercials, sort of.

449
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,636
You want to watch the road?
You're not from New York, right?

450
00:26:47,703 --> 00:26:50,695
- Chippewa Falls.
- Right.

451
00:26:50,773 --> 00:26:52,832
- Where?
- Wisconsin.

452
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:56,640
- You're driving a tad rapidly.
- Don't worry. I'm a very good driver.

453
00:26:58,581 --> 00:27:00,981
- You want some gum?
- No, thanks.

454
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,542
- Where is it?
- Don't do that. No, no, watch the road.

455
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,451
I'll get it.
Concentrate, will ya?

456
00:27:06,522 --> 00:27:09,320
- I'll get you a piece.
- Listen. You drive?

457
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:12,486
Do I drive?
No, I got a problem with driving.

458
00:27:12,562 --> 00:27:14,621
- You do?
- Yeah.

459
00:27:14,697 --> 00:27:17,723
I got a license,
but I have too much hostility.

460
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:21,333
Nice car.
You keep it nice.

461
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:25,033
- Can I ask you, is this a sandwich?
- Oh, yeah.

462
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:34,079
I live over here. Oh, my God, look!
There's a parking space.

463
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:42,257
That's okay,
we can walk to the curb from here.

464
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:46,122
You want your tennis stuff?
You want your gear?

465
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:49,096
Yeah. That's good. Thanks.
Thanks a lot. Well.

466
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:50,598
Well.

467
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:54,469
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

468
00:27:54,537 --> 00:27:57,370
You're a wonderful tennis player...

469
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,965
and you're the worst driver
I've ever seen in my life.

470
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:03,808
Anyplace. Europe. Anyplace. Asia.

471
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,246
- I love what you're wearing.
- You do? Yeah.

472
00:28:06,315 --> 00:28:10,684
This tie is a present from Grammy Hall.

473
00:28:10,753 --> 00:28:13,244
Who? Grammy Hall?

474
00:28:13,322 --> 00:28:15,017
Yeah, my grammy.

475
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:18,254
What did you do, grow up in a
Norman Rockwell painting? Your grammy?

476
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:22,627
- It's pretty silly, isn't it?
- My grammy never gave gifts.

477
00:28:22,698 --> 00:28:25,633
She was too busy getting raped
by Cossacks.

478
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:27,931
Well, thank you again.

479
00:28:28,004 --> 00:28:29,562
Oh, yeah.

480
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:33,507
Listen. You want to come upstairs
and have a glass of wine or something?

481
00:28:33,576 --> 00:28:37,034
No, I mean you don't have to.
You're probably late and everything.

482
00:28:37,113 --> 00:28:39,445
No, that would be fine.
I wouldn't mind. Sure.

483
00:28:39,515 --> 00:28:44,145
I got time. I got nothing
until my analyst appointment.

484
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,279
You see an analyst?

485
00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:50,086
- Just for 15 years.
- 15 years?

486
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,684
I'm going to give him one more year,
and then I'm going to Lourdes.

487
00:28:52,762 --> 00:28:55,754
15? Nah, come on! Yeah? Really?

488
00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:59,299
Sylvia Plath. Interesting poetess
whose tragic suicide...

489
00:28:59,368 --> 00:29:03,168
was misinterpreted as romantic
by the college-girl mentality.

490
00:29:04,206 --> 00:29:07,869
Right. I don't know.
I mean, some of her poems seem neat.

491
00:29:07,944 --> 00:29:11,277
Neat? I hate to tell you this is 1975.

492
00:29:11,347 --> 00:29:13,747
"Neat" went out
at the turn of the century.

493
00:29:13,816 --> 00:29:16,114
Who are those photos on the wall?

494
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:18,881
Oh, you see...

495
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:23,051
that's my dad, that's Father,
and that's my brother, Duane.

496
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:26,026
Yeah, right.
And over there's Grammy Hall.

497
00:29:26,095 --> 00:29:29,030
- And that's Sadie.
- Who's Sadie?

498
00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:34,798
Well, Sadie met Grammy
through Grammy's brother, George.

499
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,202
George was real sweet.
He had that thing.

500
00:29:37,273 --> 00:29:42,711
What is that thing where you fall asleep
in the middle of a sentence?

501
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:44,712
- Narcolepsy.
- Right.

502
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:49,581
So anyway, George went to the union
to get his free turkey...

503
00:29:49,652 --> 00:29:53,315
because the union always gave George
this free turkey at Christmastime...

504
00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:56,916
because he was shell-shocked
in the first World War.

505
00:29:56,993 --> 00:30:00,986
Anyway, so George is standing in line...

506
00:30:01,063 --> 00:30:03,463
getting his free turkey...

507
00:30:03,532 --> 00:30:08,595
but the thing is he falls asleep,
and he never wakes up.

508
00:30:08,671 --> 00:30:11,367
So he's dead.

509
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,738
He's dead. Yeah.

510
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:15,333
Oh, dear.

511
00:30:15,411 --> 00:30:18,175
Well, terrible, huh?
Wouldn't you say?

512
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:19,976
Pretty awful.

513
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:23,382
It's a great story, though.
It really made my day.

514
00:30:23,452 --> 00:30:26,546
I think I should get out of here,
'cause I think I'm imposing.

515
00:30:26,622 --> 00:30:29,750
Really? Maybe...

516
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:34,125
- You don't have to.
- But I'm all perspired and everything.

517
00:30:34,196 --> 00:30:36,790
Didn't you take a shower at the club?

518
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:39,426
No, no. I never shower
in a public place.

519
00:30:39,502 --> 00:30:40,935
Why not?

520
00:30:41,003 --> 00:30:45,133
I don't like to get naked in front
of another man.

521
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:46,640
I see.

522
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:50,167
I don't like to show my body
to a man of my gender.

523
00:30:50,246 --> 00:30:52,874
- I see, I guess.
- You never know what's going to happen.

524
00:30:52,948 --> 00:30:56,281
- 15 years, huh?
- 15 years, yeah.

525
00:30:56,986 --> 00:30:58,419
God bless.

526
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:05,125
Well! Well...

527
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:09,327
You're what Grammy Hall
would call "a real Jew."

528
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:13,400
Thank you.

529
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,835
She hates Jews.
She thinks they just make money.

530
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:21,001
But she's the one, is she ever.
I'm telling you.

531
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:28,542
So, did you do
those photographs in there?

532
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:33,745
I dabble? Listen to me. What a jerk.
Yeah, I sort of dabble around,
you know.

533
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:38,053
You are a great-looking girl.
They're wonderful.
They have a quality.

534
00:31:38,127 --> 00:31:42,325
He probably thinks I'm a yo-yo.
Well, I would like to take
a serious photography course.

535
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:44,366
Photography's interesting because...

536
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:48,767
I wonder what she looks like naked.
it's a new art form. A set of aesthetic
criteria have not emerged yet.

537
00:31:48,838 --> 00:31:52,638
I'm not smart enough for him.
Hang in there.
You mean whether
it's a good photo or not?

538
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:57,668
I don't know what I'm saying.
She senses I'm shallow.
The medium enters in as a condition
of the art form itself.

539
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:02,717
God, I hope he doesn't turn out
to be a schmuck like the others.
Well, to me... I mean...
It's all instinctive.

540
00:32:02,785 --> 00:32:07,722
I just try to feel it, to get a sense
of it and not think about it so much.

541
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:13,319
Christ, I sound like FM radio. Relax.
Still, you need aesthetic guidelines
to put it in social perspective.

542
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:18,157
I don't know. I mean,
I guess you must be sort of late.

543
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:22,933
You know, I've got to get there
and begin whining soon.

544
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:24,996
Are you busy Friday night?

545
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:28,271
Me? Oh, no.

546
00:32:28,344 --> 00:32:31,575
Oh, I'm sorry, I have something.
What about Saturday night?

547
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:35,683
Nothing. No, no.

548
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:38,982
You're very popular, I can see.

549
00:32:39,054 --> 00:32:40,988
- I know.
- You have plague?

550
00:32:41,056 --> 00:32:43,581
I meet a lot of jerks.

551
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:45,650
I meet a lot of jerks, too.

552
00:32:45,728 --> 00:32:48,856
I'm thinking about
getting some cats.

553
00:32:48,931 --> 00:32:52,662
Wait a second! No, no!
Oh, shoot!

554
00:32:52,735 --> 00:32:57,195
Saturday night, I'm going to sing.

555
00:32:57,273 --> 00:32:59,764
You're going to sing? You sing?
No kidding!

556
00:32:59,842 --> 00:33:02,834
- This is my first time.
- Really? Where?

557
00:33:02,912 --> 00:33:05,176
I'd like to come.

558
00:33:05,247 --> 00:33:07,977
- I'm interested.
- No, no. I'm just a...

559
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:12,077
I'm auditioning at this club.
It's my first time.

560
00:33:12,154 --> 00:33:14,622
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly
what that's like.

561
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,523
You're going to like nightclubs.
They're really a lot of fun.

562
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:25,492
It had to be you

563
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:35,272
It had to be you

564
00:33:36,812 --> 00:33:41,715
I wandered around
And finally found

565
00:33:41,784 --> 00:33:48,280
This somebody who

566
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:54,920
Could make me be true

567
00:33:54,997 --> 00:34:00,162
Could make me be blue

568
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:05,231
And even be glad

569
00:34:05,307 --> 00:34:07,867
Just to be sad

570
00:34:09,211 --> 00:34:15,047
Thinking of you

571
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:18,448
I was awful! I'm so ashamed!
I can't sing.

572
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,613
So the audience was a tad restless.

573
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:23,988
What do you mean, "a tad restless"?
My God, they hated me!

574
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:26,459
No, they didn't.
You have a wonderful voice.

575
00:34:26,528 --> 00:34:28,519
- I'm going to quit.
- I'm not going to let you.

576
00:34:28,597 --> 00:34:31,088
- You have a great voice.
- Do you think so, really?

577
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:35,432
- Yeah! It's terrific.
- I never even took a lesson either.

578
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:38,962
- Listen, give me a kiss.
- Really?

579
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,703
Why not? Because we're just going
to go home later.

580
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:44,268
There's going to be all that tension.
We've never kissed before.

581
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:46,439
I'll never know when
to make the right move.

582
00:34:46,515 --> 00:34:49,279
We'll kiss now and get it over with,
and then we'll go eat. Okay?

583
00:34:49,351 --> 00:34:51,717
We'll digest our food better.

584
00:34:53,555 --> 00:34:56,793
Okay? Now we can digest our food.

585
00:34:56,926 --> 00:34:59,087
Corned beef, please.

586
00:34:59,162 --> 00:35:02,290
I'm having pastrami on white bread...

587
00:35:02,365 --> 00:35:05,334
with mayonnaise, tomatoes and lettuce.

588
00:35:08,137 --> 00:35:11,197
So, your second wife left you.

589
00:35:11,274 --> 00:35:13,936
Were you depressed about that?

590
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,639
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins
couldn't cure.

591
00:35:17,713 --> 00:35:21,581
- Your first wife, Allison.
- She was nice.

592
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:24,142
That was my fault.
I was too crazy.

593
00:35:28,057 --> 00:35:31,720
That was so nice!
That was nice.

594
00:35:31,794 --> 00:35:35,662
As Balzac said,
"There goes another novel."

595
00:35:36,766 --> 00:35:38,495
You were great.

596
00:35:38,568 --> 00:35:41,128
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

597
00:35:41,204 --> 00:35:45,368
- Yeah, I'm wrecked.
- You're wrecked.

598
00:35:45,441 --> 00:35:49,969
I mean it.
I'll never play the piano again.

599
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:53,174
It was, I don't know.
You really thought it was good?

600
00:35:53,249 --> 00:35:58,710
Good? Yes. No, that was the most fun
I've had without laughing.

601
00:35:58,788 --> 00:36:00,653
Here, you want some?

602
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:06,218
No, I don't use
any major hallucinogenics.

603
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:10,755
I took a puff about five years ago
at a party...

604
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:13,734
and tried to take my pants off
over my head.

605
00:36:16,405 --> 00:36:21,604
I don't do it very often.
It just sort of relaxes me.

606
00:36:24,013 --> 00:36:27,005
- You won't believe this, but...
- What?

607
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:33,322
I'm going to buy you these books...

608
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:36,688
because I think you should read them
instead of that cat book.

609
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:39,523
That's pretty serious stuff.

610
00:36:39,595 --> 00:36:42,029
I'm obsessed with death, I think.

611
00:36:42,098 --> 00:36:45,124
It's a big subject with me.
I have a pessimistic view of life.

612
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:47,567
You should know this about me
if we're going to go out.

613
00:36:47,637 --> 00:36:50,834
I feel that life is divided up
into the horrible and the miserable.

614
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:52,898
Those are the two categories.

615
00:36:52,975 --> 00:36:57,742
The horrible would be like terminal
cases and blind people, cripples.

616
00:36:57,813 --> 00:37:00,281
I don't know how they get through life.
It's amazing to me.

617
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:03,147
And the miserable is everyone else.

618
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:05,653
So when you go through life,
be thankful that you're miserable.

619
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:08,417
You're very lucky to be miserable.

620
00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:14,827
Look at that guy.
There's Mr. Miami Beach in the pink.

621
00:37:14,897 --> 00:37:17,661
He's just come back
from the gin rummy finals.

622
00:37:17,733 --> 00:37:19,564
He placed third.

623
00:37:19,635 --> 00:37:22,661
Look at these guys. That's hilarious.
They're back from Fire Island.

624
00:37:22,738 --> 00:37:25,605
They're sort of giving it
a chance romantically.

625
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:28,576
- Italian, right?
- Him? He's the Mafia.

626
00:37:28,644 --> 00:37:31,977
Linen supply business
or cement and contracting.

627
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:35,643
Oh, gee,
mess up my moustache wax.

628
00:37:35,718 --> 00:37:38,516
There's the winner of the Truman Capote
look-alike contest.

629
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:43,388
You are unbelievably sexy.
Yes, you are.

630
00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:47,327
You know what you are?
You're polymorphously perverse.

631
00:37:47,396 --> 00:37:49,921
What does that mean?
I don't know what that is.

632
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:52,934
You're exceptional in bed...

633
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:55,994
because you get pleasure in every part
of your body when I touch it.

634
00:37:56,072 --> 00:37:59,906
Like the tip of your nose, and if
I stroke your teeth or your knee caps...

635
00:37:59,976 --> 00:38:02,137
you certainly get excited.

636
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:06,545
You know what?
I like you, I really do.

637
00:38:06,615 --> 00:38:09,550
But do you love me?
That's the key question.

638
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:11,950
I know you've only known me
a short while.

639
00:38:12,021 --> 00:38:15,980
I think that's sort of...
Yeah, yeah.

640
00:38:16,058 --> 00:38:17,992
Do you love me?

641
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:23,521
Love is too weak a word for what...
I "lurve" you.

642
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,899
I "loave" you.
I "luff" you, with two "f"s.

643
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,131
Of course I do.
Don't you think I do?

644
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:32,299
I don't know.

645
00:38:34,176 --> 00:38:37,043
What do you mean? You're not going
to give up your own apartment, are you?

646
00:38:37,113 --> 00:38:39,047
- Of course.
- But why?

647
00:38:39,115 --> 00:38:41,379
I'm moving in with you, that's why.

648
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,510
- But you have a nice apartment.
- I have a tiny apartment.

649
00:38:44,587 --> 00:38:47,613
- I know it's small.
- And it's got bad plumbing and bugs.

650
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:52,593
Granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs.
You say that like it's a negative.

651
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:54,856
Bugs are...

652
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:58,798
- Entomology is a rapidly growing field.
- You don't want me to live with you.

653
00:38:58,868 --> 00:39:02,827
- I don't? Whose idea was it?
- Mine.

654
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:05,237
It was yours, actually.

655
00:39:05,307 --> 00:39:07,639
But I approved it immediately.

656
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,644
You think I talked you
into something.

657
00:39:09,712 --> 00:39:14,274
No. We live together,
we sleep together, we eat together.

658
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,648
Jesus, you don't want it to be
like we're married, do you?

659
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,678
- How is it any different?
- Because you keep your own apartment.

660
00:39:20,756 --> 00:39:23,281
It's there. We don't have to go to it,
deal with it...

661
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,456
but it's like a free-floating life raft
that we know that we're not married.

662
00:39:28,531 --> 00:39:31,022
That little apartment
is $400 a month, Alvy.

663
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,228
- That place is $400 a month?
- Yes, it is.

664
00:39:34,303 --> 00:39:37,397
It's got bad plumbing and bugs.
Jesus.

665
00:39:37,473 --> 00:39:41,466
My accountant will write it off
as a tax deduction. I'll pay for it.

666
00:39:41,544 --> 00:39:44,172
You don't think I'm smart enough
to be serious about.

667
00:39:44,246 --> 00:39:45,907
Don't be ridiculous.

668
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:50,247
Then why are you always pushing me
to take college courses like I was dumb?

669
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:52,480
Adult education is a wonderful thing!

670
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:55,820
You meet a lot of interesting
professors. It's stimulating.

671
00:40:08,437 --> 00:40:12,737
Does this sound like a good course:
"Modern American Poetry"?

672
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:15,777
Or, let's see...

673
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:19,941
maybe I should take
"Introduction to the Novel."

674
00:40:20,015 --> 00:40:22,643
Just don't take any course
where they make you read Beowulf.

675
00:40:22,718 --> 00:40:24,777
What?

676
00:40:24,854 --> 00:40:29,257
What do you think? Should we go
to that party in South Hampton?

677
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:32,783
No, don't be silly.
What do we need other people for?

678
00:40:32,862 --> 00:40:37,731
We should just turn out the lights
and play hide the "salam" or something.

679
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,769
Well, I'm going to get a cigarette,
okay?

680
00:40:40,836 --> 00:40:46,069
Grass, right? The illusion that it makes
a white woman more like Billie Holiday.

681
00:40:46,142 --> 00:40:49,305
- Have you ever made love high?
- Me? No.

682
00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:53,041
If I have grass or alcohol,
I get unbearably wonderful.

683
00:40:53,115 --> 00:40:56,107
I get too wonderful for words.

684
00:40:56,185 --> 00:41:00,121
I don't know why you have to get high
every time we make love.

685
00:41:00,189 --> 00:41:02,054
It relaxes me.

686
00:41:02,124 --> 00:41:04,684
You have to be artificially relaxed
before we can go to bed?

687
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,921
What's the difference, anyway?

688
00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:09,624
I'll give you a shot of Sodium
Pentothal. You can sleep through it.

689
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:13,065
Look who's talking! You've been seeing
a psychiatrist for 15 years.

690
00:41:13,135 --> 00:41:16,696
You should smoke some of this.
You'd be off the couch in no time.

691
00:41:16,772 --> 00:41:19,002
- Come on, you don't need that.
- What are you doing?

692
00:41:19,074 --> 00:41:22,771
- No, Alvy, please?
- You can live without it once.

693
00:41:24,747 --> 00:41:26,840
Wait, I got a great idea.

694
00:41:28,117 --> 00:41:32,781
Hang in there for a second.
I got a little erotic artifact...

695
00:41:32,855 --> 00:41:36,951
that I brought up from the city,
which I think is going to be perfect.

696
00:41:37,026 --> 00:41:40,860
There. Create a little
old New Orleans essence.

697
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:44,127
Now we can go about our business...

698
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,101
and even develop photographs
if we want to.

699
00:41:54,276 --> 00:41:57,040
- Is something wrong?
- No, why?

700
00:41:57,112 --> 00:42:00,047
I don't know.
It's like you're removed.

701
00:42:00,115 --> 00:42:02,083
No, I'm fine.

702
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:04,142
Really?

703
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,848
I don't know.
You seem sort of distant.

704
00:42:06,922 --> 00:42:08,981
Let's just do it, all right?

705
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:12,516
Was it my imagination or are you
just going through the motions?

706
00:42:12,628 --> 00:42:14,892
Alvy, do you remember
where I put my drawing pad?

707
00:42:14,997 --> 00:42:17,932
Because while you two are doing that,
I'm going to do some drawing.

708
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,264
That's what I call removed!

709
00:42:20,336 --> 00:42:23,328
You have my body.

710
00:42:23,405 --> 00:42:25,703
But I want the whole thing!

711
00:42:25,774 --> 00:42:27,708
I need grass.

712
00:42:27,776 --> 00:42:30,711
It ruins it for me if you have grass.

713
00:42:30,779 --> 00:42:34,112
I'm like a comedian, so if I get a laugh
from a person who's high...

714
00:42:34,183 --> 00:42:37,016
it doesn't count,
'cause they're always laughing.

715
00:42:37,086 --> 00:42:39,020
Were you always funny?

716
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:41,750
Is this an interview?
We're supposed to be making love.

717
00:42:41,924 --> 00:42:45,189
This guy is naturally funny.
I think he can write for you.

718
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:48,128
Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid,
he tells me you're really good.

719
00:42:48,197 --> 00:42:50,597
Let me explain how I work.
You can tell off the bat...

720
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:53,567
that I don't look like a funny guy
like some of the guys.

721
00:42:53,636 --> 00:42:56,002
You know they're going to tell you their
stories, you're going to fall down.

722
00:42:56,071 --> 00:42:58,835
But I gotta be really talented.
Material's got to be sensational for me.

723
00:42:58,907 --> 00:43:02,843
I work... I'm kind of classy.
Know what I mean?

724
00:43:02,911 --> 00:43:05,243
Let me explain.
I'll open with an opening song.

725
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:07,305
The music will start.

726
00:43:07,383 --> 00:43:10,181
I walk out.
Place looks wonderful from here

727
00:43:10,252 --> 00:43:12,982
You folks look wonderful from here

728
00:43:13,055 --> 00:43:15,649
And seeing you there
With a smile on your face

729
00:43:15,724 --> 00:43:18,090
Makes me shout
This must be the place

730
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,254
I stop, and then I open with some jokes.
That's where I need you.

731
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:25,061
I'll say, "I just got back from Canada.
They speak a lot of French.

732
00:43:25,134 --> 00:43:29,127
The only word to know is 'John Dark.' It
means the light's out in the bathroom.

733
00:43:29,204 --> 00:43:33,573
- I met a big lumberjack."
- Jesus, this guy's pathetic.

734
00:43:33,642 --> 00:43:37,305
Look at him mincing around.
Boy, thinks he's real cute.

735
00:43:37,379 --> 00:43:39,677
You want to throw up.

736
00:43:39,748 --> 00:43:42,740
If only I had the nerve
to do my own jokes.

737
00:43:44,486 --> 00:43:47,751
I don't know how much longer I can keep
this smile frozen on my face.

738
00:43:47,823 --> 00:43:49,791
I'm in the wrong business.
I know it.

739
00:43:49,858 --> 00:43:53,760
"But, cherie...

740
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:56,491
what will I do with this, eh?"

741
00:43:56,565 --> 00:44:00,558
He says, "Oh, Marie,
sometime you make me so mad!"

742
00:44:00,636 --> 00:44:02,661
They scream at that.
Write me something like that, will you?

743
00:44:02,738 --> 00:44:05,573
Kind of a French number.
Can you do it?

744
00:44:11,812 --> 00:44:13,905
Where am I?
I have to reorient myself.

745
00:44:13,981 --> 00:44:15,972
This is the University
of Wisconsin, right?

746
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:20,714
Because I'm always tense
when I'm playing a college.

747
00:44:20,788 --> 00:44:23,188
I have a bad history with colleges.
I went to New York University.

748
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:27,249
And I was thrown out of NYU
my freshman year...

749
00:44:27,328 --> 00:44:30,627
for cheating on my metaphysics final.

750
00:44:30,698 --> 00:44:35,032
I looked within the soul
of the boy sitting next to me.

751
00:44:35,102 --> 00:44:39,300
My mother, an emotionally high-strung
woman, locked herself in the bathroom...

752
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:42,467
and took an overdose
of mah-jongg tiles.

753
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:49,547
I was depressed at that time.
I was in analysis.

754
00:44:49,617 --> 00:44:53,417
I was suicidal, as a matter of fact,
and would have killed myself...

755
00:44:53,487 --> 00:44:56,149
but I was in analysis
with a strict Freudian.

756
00:44:56,223 --> 00:44:59,886
And if you kill yourself, they make you
pay for the sessions you miss.

757
00:45:03,731 --> 00:45:07,827
Alvy, you were just great.
I'm not kidding.

758
00:45:07,901 --> 00:45:10,699
College audiences are wonderful.

759
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:13,899
You know what? I think I'm starting
to get more of the references, too.

760
00:45:13,974 --> 00:45:18,104
Are you? The 12:00 show
is completely different than the 9:00.

761
00:45:18,178 --> 00:45:22,444
I'm looking forward to tomorrow. It'll
be nice. You'll meet Mother and Father.

762
00:45:22,516 --> 00:45:24,643
They'll hate me immediately.

763
00:45:25,753 --> 00:45:29,189
No, I don't think they're going
to hate you at all. Contrary.

764
00:45:29,256 --> 00:45:33,716
It's Easter. We'll sit down and eat.
I think they'll really like you.

765
00:45:42,903 --> 00:45:44,632
It's a nice ham this year, Mom.

766
00:45:46,874 --> 00:45:49,866
Grammy always does such a good job.

767
00:45:49,943 --> 00:45:51,740
Great sauce.

768
00:45:51,812 --> 00:45:54,280
It is.
It's dynamite ham.

769
00:45:59,853 --> 00:46:02,754
We went to the swap meet.

770
00:46:02,823 --> 00:46:05,917
Annie, Gram and I.
Got some nice picture frames.

771
00:46:05,993 --> 00:46:09,485
We really had a good time.

772
00:46:09,563 --> 00:46:13,932
Ann tells us you've been seeing
a psychiatrist for 15 years.

773
00:46:15,102 --> 00:46:17,093
Yes. I'm making excellent progress.

774
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:20,470
Soon, when I lie down on his couch,
I won't have to wear the lobster bib.

775
00:46:22,743 --> 00:46:26,406
- Duane and I went to the boat basin.
- We caulked hulls all day.

776
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,472
And Randolph Hunt was drunk as usual.

777
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:34,078
That Randolph Hunt!
You remember Randy Hunt, Annie.

778
00:46:34,154 --> 00:46:36,918
- He was in the choir with you.
- Oh, yes.

779
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:39,515
I can't believe this family.

780
00:46:39,593 --> 00:46:42,460
Annie's mother is really beautiful.

781
00:46:42,529 --> 00:46:46,226
And they're talking swap meets
and boat basins.

782
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:51,067
The old lady at the end of the table
is a classic Jew-hater.

783
00:46:51,138 --> 00:46:55,768
They really look American, healthy,
like they never get sick or anything.

784
00:46:55,843 --> 00:46:59,040
Nothing like my family.
The two are like oil and water.

785
00:46:59,413 --> 00:47:02,314
Ah, let him drop dead.
Who needs his business?

786
00:47:02,382 --> 00:47:08,014
- His wife has diabetes.
- Diabetes? Is that an excuse?

787
00:47:08,088 --> 00:47:12,491
The man is 50 years old
and doesn't have a substantial job.

788
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:14,288
Is that a reason to steal
from your partner?

789
00:47:14,361 --> 00:47:16,829
You don't know what
you're talking about.

790
00:47:16,897 --> 00:47:18,558
Defend him!

791
00:47:18,632 --> 00:47:21,294
Pass the brisket.

792
00:47:21,368 --> 00:47:23,928
Mo Moskowitz.
He had a coronary.

793
00:47:24,004 --> 00:47:25,938
You don't say!

794
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,170
How do you plan to spend the holidays,
Mrs. Singer?

795
00:47:29,243 --> 00:47:31,302
- We fast.
- Fast?

796
00:47:31,378 --> 00:47:34,643
No food.
You know, to atone for our sins.

797
00:47:34,715 --> 00:47:36,808
What sins?
I don't understand.

798
00:47:36,884 --> 00:47:38,749
Neither do we.

799
00:47:40,821 --> 00:47:43,585
Hi, Duane. How's it going?

800
00:47:43,657 --> 00:47:47,684
- This is my room.
- Oh, yeah? It's terrific.

801
00:47:47,761 --> 00:47:49,752
Can I confess something?

802
00:47:55,235 --> 00:47:58,500
I tell you this, because, as an artist,
I think you'll understand.

803
00:48:01,475 --> 00:48:04,467
Sometimes when I'm driving...

804
00:48:04,545 --> 00:48:06,513
on the road at night...

805
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:10,038
I see two headlights
coming toward me, fast.

806
00:48:10,117 --> 00:48:12,517
I have this impulse
to turn the wheel quickly...

807
00:48:12,586 --> 00:48:14,850
head-on into the oncoming car.

808
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:18,184
I can anticipate the explosion.

809
00:48:18,258 --> 00:48:22,422
The sound of shattering glass.

810
00:48:22,496 --> 00:48:26,899
The flames rising out
of the flowing gasoline.

811
00:48:29,603 --> 00:48:31,036
Right.

812
00:48:32,406 --> 00:48:38,140
I have to go now, Duane, because
I'm due back on the planet Earth.

813
00:48:38,212 --> 00:48:40,146
Don't let it be so long now.

814
00:48:40,214 --> 00:48:43,843
- Look up Uncle Billy, promise.
- He is adorable.

815
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:46,385
- You'll take them to the airport now?
- No. Duane can.

816
00:48:46,453 --> 00:48:49,217
- I haven't finished my drink.
- Yes, Duane is. I'll be right...

817
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:11,206
You followed me.
I can't believe it!

818
00:49:11,278 --> 00:49:13,246
- I didn't follow you.
- You followed me!

819
00:49:13,313 --> 00:49:16,840
Because I was walking a block behind
staring at you? That's not following.

820
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:20,580
- What's your definition of "following"?
- Following is different. I was spying.

821
00:49:20,654 --> 00:49:22,144
Do you realize
how paranoid you are?

822
00:49:22,222 --> 00:49:25,282
Paranoid? I'm looking at you, and you've
got your arms around another guy.

823
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,350
That is the worst kind of paranoid!

824
00:49:27,427 --> 00:49:30,794
I didn't start out spying. I thought I'd
surprise you, pick you up after school.

825
00:49:30,864 --> 00:49:34,732
You wanted to keep the relationship
flexible, remember? It's your phrase.

826
00:49:34,801 --> 00:49:36,860
You're having an affair
with your college professor!

827
00:49:36,937 --> 00:49:41,601
That jerk that teaches that crap course,
"Contemporary Crisis in Western Man."

828
00:49:41,675 --> 00:49:44,439
"Existential Motifs in Russian
Literature." You're really close.

829
00:49:44,511 --> 00:49:46,775
What's the difference?
It's all mental masturbation.

830
00:49:46,847 --> 00:49:49,475
Now we're getting to a subject
you know something about.

831
00:49:49,549 --> 00:49:52,518
Don't knock masturbation.
It's sex with someone I love.

832
00:49:52,586 --> 00:49:57,319
We're not having an affair. He's
married. He happens to think I'm neat.

833
00:49:57,391 --> 00:50:00,485
Are you 12 years old? That's one
of your Chippewa Falls expressions.

834
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,323
Who cares?

835
00:50:02,396 --> 00:50:06,059
Next he'll find you're keen and peachy.
Then he'll have his hand on your ass.

836
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:09,159
You've had hostility towards David
ever since I mentioned him.

837
00:50:09,236 --> 00:50:11,397
- You call your teacher David?
- It's his name.

838
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:15,066
It's a Biblical name, right?
Does he call you Bathsheba?

839
00:50:15,142 --> 00:50:19,306
Alvy, you're the one who never wanted
to make a real commitment.

840
00:50:19,379 --> 00:50:22,439
You don't think I'm smart enough.
We had that argument last month...

841
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:25,246
or don't you remember that day?

842
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,450
- I'm home!
- How'd it go?

843
00:50:29,523 --> 00:50:32,492
It was really weird,
but she's a very nice woman.

844
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,222
I didn't have to lie on the couch.
She had me sitting up.

845
00:50:36,296 --> 00:50:40,198
I told her about the family
and my feelings towards men...

846
00:50:40,267 --> 00:50:42,428
and my relationship with my brother.

847
00:50:42,502 --> 00:50:45,232
Then she mentioned penis envy.
Do you know about that?

848
00:50:45,305 --> 00:50:49,605
I'm one of the few males
who suffers from that. Go on.

849
00:50:49,676 --> 00:50:54,204
She said I was guilty about my impulses
towards marriage and children.

850
00:50:54,281 --> 00:50:58,877
Then, I remembered, when I was a kid, I
accidentally saw my parents making love.

851
00:50:58,952 --> 00:51:01,477
All this happened the first hour?
That's amazing.

852
00:51:01,555 --> 00:51:05,184
I've been going for 15 years.
I don't have nothing like that.

853
00:51:05,258 --> 00:51:07,522
I told her my dream,
and then I cried.

854
00:51:07,594 --> 00:51:11,121
You cried. I've never once cried.
That's fantastic to me.

855
00:51:11,198 --> 00:51:13,359
I whine.
I sit and I whine.

856
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:17,301
In my dream, Frank Sinatra is holding
this pillow across my face...

857
00:51:17,371 --> 00:51:19,305
and I can't breathe.

858
00:51:19,373 --> 00:51:21,603
He's strangling me.

859
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:24,576
Sure, because he's a singer,
and you're a singer. It's perfect.

860
00:51:24,644 --> 00:51:27,613
You're trying to suffocate yourself.
It makes perfect sense.

861
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:30,013
That's a perfect analytic insight.

862
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:33,678
She said your name was Alvy Singer.

863
00:51:33,754 --> 00:51:35,745
- What do you mean, me?
- Yeah, you.

864
00:51:35,822 --> 00:51:39,019
Because in the dream,
I break Sinatra's glasses.

865
00:51:39,092 --> 00:51:43,791
You never said Sinatra had glasses.
Are you saying I'm suffocating you?

866
00:51:43,864 --> 00:51:47,163
God, I did this really terrible thing
to him...

867
00:51:47,234 --> 00:51:51,864
because then when he sang,
it was in this real high-pitch voice.

868
00:51:51,938 --> 00:51:55,635
- What'd the doctor say?
- I should come five times a week.

869
00:51:55,709 --> 00:52:01,011
I don't think I mind analysis at all.
The question is, will it change my wife?

870
00:52:01,081 --> 00:52:03,743
- Will it change your wife?
- Will it change my life?

871
00:52:03,817 --> 00:52:07,309
- But you said "wife."
- No, I said "life."

872
00:52:07,354 --> 00:52:09,379
- No, you said "wife."
- "Life!" I said "life."

873
00:52:09,456 --> 00:52:13,222
She said "wife." You heard that,
because you were there. I'm not crazy.

874
00:52:13,293 --> 00:52:17,195
Then I told her I didn't think
you'd ever take me seriously...

875
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:19,698
because you don't think
I'm smart enough.

876
00:52:19,766 --> 00:52:23,930
Why do you bring that up? Because I
encourage you to take adult education?

877
00:52:24,004 --> 00:52:27,599
It's a wonderful thing. You meet
wonderful, interesting professors.

878
00:52:27,741 --> 00:52:31,677
Adult education is junk. The professors
are phony. How can you do it?

879
00:52:31,745 --> 00:52:34,612
I don't care what you say about David.
He's a fine teacher.

880
00:52:34,681 --> 00:52:39,448
And why are you following me around?
We should call this relationship quits.

881
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:42,613
That's fine. That's great.
I don't know what I did wrong.

882
00:52:42,689 --> 00:52:46,523
Somewhere she cooled off to me.
Is it something that I did?

883
00:52:46,593 --> 00:52:50,051
It's never something you do.
That's how people are. Love fades.

884
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,099
Love fades.
God, that's a depressing thought.

885
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:55,430
I have to ask you a question.
Don't go any further.

886
00:52:55,502 --> 00:52:58,994
With your wife, in bed, does she need
some kind of artificial stimulation...

887
00:52:59,072 --> 00:53:01,233
like marijuana?

888
00:53:01,308 --> 00:53:03,936
We use a large vibrating egg.

889
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:05,875
A large vibrating egg.

890
00:53:05,946 --> 00:53:09,973
I ask a psychopath,
I get that kind of answer. Jesus!

891
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:13,076
You look like a very happy couple.

892
00:53:13,153 --> 00:53:15,383
- Are you?
- Yeah.

893
00:53:15,455 --> 00:53:17,923
How do you account for it?

894
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:21,927
I'm very shallow and empty,
and I have no ideas...

895
00:53:21,995 --> 00:53:24,225
and nothing interesting to say.

896
00:53:24,297 --> 00:53:27,596
- I'm exactly the same way.
- I see.

897
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:30,659
That's interesting. So you've
managed to work out something?

898
00:53:30,737 --> 00:53:32,170
Right.

899
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:35,037
Thanks for talking to me.

900
00:53:35,108 --> 00:53:39,067
Even as a kid, I went for the wrong
women. I think that's my problem.

901
00:53:39,146 --> 00:53:41,307
When my mother took me
to see Snow White...

902
00:53:41,381 --> 00:53:45,841
everyone fell in love with Snow White,
and I fell for the wicked queen.

903
00:53:45,986 --> 00:53:49,251
- We never have any fun anymore.
- How can you say that?

904
00:53:49,322 --> 00:53:51,847
Why not? You're always
leaning on me to improve myself.

905
00:53:51,925 --> 00:53:54,291
You're upset. You must be
getting your period.

906
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:59,060
I don't get a period. I'm a cartoon
character. Can't I be upset sometimes?

907
00:53:59,132 --> 00:54:03,034
Max, forget about Annie.
I know lots of women you can date.

908
00:54:03,103 --> 00:54:05,128
I don't want to go out
with other women.

909
00:54:05,572 --> 00:54:08,234
Max, I've got a girl for you.
You are going to love her.
She's a reporter for Rolling Stone.

910
00:54:10,909 --> 00:54:12,900
There are more people here
to see the Maharishi...

911
00:54:12,977 --> 00:54:15,639
than there were
to see the Dylan concert.

912
00:54:15,713 --> 00:54:18,910
I covered the Dylan concert,
which gave me chills.

913
00:54:18,983 --> 00:54:24,353
Especially when he sang,
"She takes just like a woman...

914
00:54:24,422 --> 00:54:27,323
and she makes love
just like a woman.

915
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:29,360
Yes, she does.

916
00:54:29,427 --> 00:54:32,726
And she aches just like a woman...

917
00:54:32,797 --> 00:54:36,096
but she breaks
just like a little girl."

918
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:39,136
Up to that, the most
charismatic event I covered...

919
00:54:39,203 --> 00:54:41,831
was Mick's birthday when the Stones
played Madison Square Garden.

920
00:54:41,906 --> 00:54:43,533
That's just great.

921
00:54:43,608 --> 00:54:45,769
You catch Dylan?

922
00:54:45,843 --> 00:54:49,142
No, I couldn't make it.
My raccoon had hepatitis.

923
00:54:49,213 --> 00:54:51,147
You have a raccoon?

924
00:54:51,215 --> 00:54:52,648
A few.

925
00:54:52,717 --> 00:54:55,618
The only word for this
is "transplendent."

926
00:54:55,687 --> 00:54:59,453
- It's transplendent.
- I can think of another word.

927
00:54:59,524 --> 00:55:02,152
He's God.
I mean, this man is God.

928
00:55:02,226 --> 00:55:04,956
He's got millions of followers,
who would crawl across the world...

929
00:55:05,029 --> 00:55:06,997
just to touch
the hem of his garment.

930
00:55:07,065 --> 00:55:08,999
It must be a tremendous hem.

931
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:11,934
- I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
- Are you?

932
00:55:12,003 --> 00:55:16,201
I can't get with any religion that
advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look.

933
00:55:16,274 --> 00:55:18,572
There's God coming out
of the men's room.

934
00:55:18,643 --> 00:55:21,373
It's unbelievably transplendent!

935
00:55:21,446 --> 00:55:24,677
I was at the Stones' concert
when they killed that guy. Remember?

936
00:55:24,749 --> 00:55:27,809
Were you?
I was at an Alice Cooper thing...

937
00:55:27,885 --> 00:55:31,116
where six people were rushed
to the hospital with bad vibes.

938
00:55:32,156 --> 00:55:34,590
I hope you don't mind
that I took so long to finish.

939
00:55:34,659 --> 00:55:37,753
Me? No. Don't be silly.

940
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:43,366
I'm starting to get some feeling
back in my jaw now.

941
00:55:44,502 --> 00:55:47,938
Sex with you is really
a Kafkaesque experience.

942
00:55:49,407 --> 00:55:51,102
Thank you.

943
00:55:51,175 --> 00:55:53,643
I mean that as a compliment.

944
00:55:53,711 --> 00:55:58,114
I think there's too much burden
placed on the orgasm...

945
00:55:58,182 --> 00:56:01,481
to make up for empty areas
in life.

946
00:56:03,287 --> 00:56:05,255
Who said that?

947
00:56:07,992 --> 00:56:10,825
I don't know. I think
it may have been Leopold and Loeb.

948
00:56:15,867 --> 00:56:17,300
Hello.

949
00:56:22,373 --> 00:56:25,604
No. What's the matter?

950
00:56:27,211 --> 00:56:29,873
You sound terrible.

951
00:56:29,947 --> 00:56:32,313
No, what... Sure, I...

952
00:56:32,383 --> 00:56:34,613
What kind of emergency?

953
00:56:34,686 --> 00:56:38,486
No, stay there.
I'll come over right now.

954
00:56:38,556 --> 00:56:40,854
Just stay there.
I'll come right over.

955
00:56:40,992 --> 00:56:43,392
It's me. Open up.
Are you okay?

956
00:56:43,461 --> 00:56:46,055
What's the matter?
Are you all right?

957
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:48,496
There's a spider in the bathroom.

958
00:56:48,566 --> 00:56:52,297
- What?
- There's a big spider in the bathroom.

959
00:56:54,005 --> 00:56:57,964
You got me here at 3:00 a.m.
'cause a spider's in the bathroom?

960
00:56:58,042 --> 00:57:02,502
You know how I am about insects. I can't
sleep with that thing crawling around.

961
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,071
Kill it!
What's wrong with you?

962
00:57:05,149 --> 00:57:08,209
Don't you have Raid in the house?

963
00:57:08,286 --> 00:57:13,155
I told you a thousand times
to keep a lot of insect spray.

964
00:57:13,224 --> 00:57:15,590
- You never know who will crawl over.
- I know.

965
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,787
And a first aid kit
and fire extinguisher.

966
00:57:17,862 --> 00:57:20,330
Give me a magazine,
'cause I'm a little tired.

967
00:57:20,398 --> 00:57:23,629
You make fun of me,
but I'm prepared for anything.

968
00:57:23,701 --> 00:57:26,431
An emergency, a tidal wave,
an earthquake.

969
00:57:27,271 --> 00:57:30,763
What is this?
Did you go to a rock concert?

970
00:57:30,842 --> 00:57:32,275
Yeah.

971
00:57:32,343 --> 00:57:36,006
Really?
How'd you like it?

972
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:40,278
Was it heavy? Did it achieve
total "heavyosity"?

973
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,751
It was just great!

974
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:46,187
I've got an idea. Call the guy
who took you to the rock concert...

975
00:57:46,257 --> 00:57:48,691
and he can come and kill the spider.

976
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,388
I called you.
You want to help me or not?

977
00:57:51,462 --> 00:57:55,228
Since when do you read the National
Review? What are you turning into?

978
00:57:55,299 --> 00:57:58,462
I like to get all points of view.

979
00:57:58,536 --> 00:58:01,300
Wonderful. Get William F. Buckley
to kill the spider.

980
00:58:01,372 --> 00:58:04,398
You're a little hostile,
you know that?

981
00:58:04,475 --> 00:58:07,410
Not only that,
you look thin and tired.

982
00:58:07,478 --> 00:58:10,777
It's 3:00 in the morning.
You got me out of bed.

983
00:58:10,848 --> 00:58:13,942
I ran over. I couldn't get a taxi.
You said it was an emergency.

984
00:58:14,018 --> 00:58:16,077
I ran up the stairs.

985
00:58:16,154 --> 00:58:19,487
I was more attractive
when the evening began.

986
00:58:19,557 --> 00:58:22,526
Are you going with
a right-wing rock-and-roll star?

987
00:58:22,593 --> 00:58:25,426
Would you like
a glass of chocolate milk?

988
00:58:25,496 --> 00:58:30,263
- What am I, your son? I came over for...
- I've got the good chocolate.

989
00:58:30,334 --> 00:58:33,269
- Where's the spider?
- It's in the bathroom.

990
00:58:33,337 --> 00:58:37,330
Don't squish it. After it's dead,
flush it down the toilet, okay?

991
00:58:37,408 --> 00:58:40,844
I've been killing spiders
since I was 30. Okay?

992
00:58:45,383 --> 00:58:49,080
It's a very big spider.
A lot of trouble. There's two of 'em.

993
00:58:49,153 --> 00:58:51,587
I didn't think it was that big,
but it's a major spider.

994
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:56,355
- You got a broom or snow shovel?
- I left it at your house. I'm sorry.

995
00:58:56,427 --> 00:58:58,361
What are you doing?

996
00:58:58,429 --> 00:59:01,023
There's a spider in your bathroom
the size of a Buick.

997
00:59:08,706 --> 00:59:12,972
- You got black soap?
- It's for my complexion.

998
00:59:13,044 --> 00:59:16,172
Are you joining a minstrel show?

999
00:59:23,855 --> 00:59:25,288
Don't worry.

1000
00:59:34,465 --> 00:59:37,263
I did it. I killed them both.
What's the matter?

1001
00:59:37,335 --> 00:59:41,829
What are you sad about? Did you want me
to capture and rehabilitate 'em?

1002
00:59:41,906 --> 00:59:45,034
- Don't go, please.
- What do you mean?

1003
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:48,442
What's the matter?
Are you expecting termites?

1004
00:59:48,512 --> 00:59:50,776
What's the matter?

1005
00:59:50,848 --> 00:59:53,544
I don't know. I miss you.

1006
00:59:53,618 --> 00:59:56,416
Jesus! Really?

1007
01:00:03,327 --> 01:00:05,557
- Alvy?
- What?

1008
01:00:07,164 --> 01:00:11,225
Was there somebody in your room
when I called you?

1009
01:00:11,302 --> 01:00:14,931
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I thought I heard a voice.

1010
01:00:15,006 --> 01:00:19,033
I had the radio on.
I'm sorry, it was the television.

1011
01:00:24,982 --> 01:00:29,783
Let's never break up again.
I don't want to be apart.

1012
01:00:29,854 --> 01:00:34,518
I think we're both much too mature
for something like that.

1013
01:00:34,592 --> 01:00:37,425
Living together hasn't been so bad,
has it?

1014
01:00:37,495 --> 01:00:40,692
For me it's been terrific.
You know?

1015
01:00:40,765 --> 01:00:43,325
Better than either of my marriages.

1016
01:00:43,401 --> 01:00:47,770
There's something different about you.
I don't know what, but it's great.

1017
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:53,470
I think, if you let me,
I could help you have more fun.

1018
01:00:53,544 --> 01:00:56,638
I know it's hard. Yeah.

1019
01:00:56,714 --> 01:01:00,377
What if we go away this weekend?

1020
01:01:00,451 --> 01:01:04,012
Why don't we get Rob, and the three
of us would drive into Brooklyn?

1021
01:01:04,088 --> 01:01:06,750
We could show you the old neighborhood.
That'd be fun for you.

1022
01:01:06,824 --> 01:01:08,917
Yeah, I'd love it.

1023
01:01:09,894 --> 01:01:12,158
God, it's a great day!

1024
01:01:12,229 --> 01:01:15,995
Watch the road!
You'll total the car!

1025
01:01:16,067 --> 01:01:18,194
I've never been to Brooklyn.

1026
01:01:18,269 --> 01:01:20,863
- I can't wait to see the neighborhood.
- The neighborhood will be great.

1027
01:01:20,938 --> 01:01:24,169
- We could show her the schoolyard.
- I was a great athlete. Tell her.

1028
01:01:24,241 --> 01:01:26,903
I was all-schoolyard.

1029
01:01:26,978 --> 01:01:30,141
They threw him a football once.
He tried to dribble it.

1030
01:01:30,214 --> 01:01:31,806
I used to lose
my glasses a lot.

1031
01:01:31,882 --> 01:01:35,545
Look! That's my old house.
That's where I used to live.

1032
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:37,052
Holy cow!

1033
01:01:38,222 --> 01:01:41,350
You're lucky. Where I used to live
is now a pornographic equipment store.

1034
01:01:41,425 --> 01:01:43,655
I had some very
good memories there.

1035
01:01:43,728 --> 01:01:46,822
What good memories, your mother
and father fighting all the time?

1036
01:01:46,897 --> 01:01:49,457
And over the most ridiculous things.

1037
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,125
- You fired the cleaning woman?
- She was stealing!

1038
01:01:52,203 --> 01:01:54,728
But she's colored.
The colored have enough trouble!

1039
01:01:54,805 --> 01:01:57,330
- She was going through my purse.
- They're persecuted enough.

1040
01:01:57,408 --> 01:02:01,401
- Who's persecuting? She stole!
- So? We can afford it.

1041
01:02:01,479 --> 01:02:04,812
How can we afford it, on your pay?
What if she steals more?

1042
01:02:04,882 --> 01:02:07,976
She's a colored woman from Harlem.
She has no money.

1043
01:02:08,052 --> 01:02:11,988
She has a right to steal from us.
Who can she steal from if not from us?

1044
01:02:12,056 --> 01:02:14,684
- You're both crazy.
- They can't hear you.

1045
01:02:14,759 --> 01:02:17,455
Leo, I married a fool!

1046
01:02:17,528 --> 01:02:19,359
What's that?

1047
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:24,868
That's the welcome home party, 1945,
for my cousin Herbie.

1048
01:02:27,605 --> 01:02:31,041
Look. That over there
is Joey Nichols.

1049
01:02:31,108 --> 01:02:33,770
He was my father's friend. He was
always bothering me when I was a kid.

1050
01:02:33,844 --> 01:02:36,779
Joey Nichols.
See? Nickels.

1051
01:02:36,847 --> 01:02:40,146
See? Nickels.
You see? Nickels.

1052
01:02:40,217 --> 01:02:45,280
You can always remember my name.
Just think of Joey Five-Cents.

1053
01:02:45,356 --> 01:02:49,315
That's me.
Joey Five-Cents.

1054
01:02:49,393 --> 01:02:50,985
What an asshole.

1055
01:02:51,062 --> 01:02:54,395
The one who killed me the most
was my mother's sister, Tessie.

1056
01:02:54,465 --> 01:02:57,127
I was always the sister
with good common sense...

1057
01:02:57,201 --> 01:02:59,863
but Tessie was always the one
with personality.

1058
01:02:59,937 --> 01:03:02,929
When she was younger,
they all wanted to marry Tessie.

1059
01:03:03,007 --> 01:03:05,805
Do you believe Tessie
had the personality?

1060
01:03:05,876 --> 01:03:09,744
- She's the life of the ghetto no doubt.
- She was once a great beauty.

1061
01:03:09,814 --> 01:03:12,715
Tessie, they say you were the sister
with personality.

1062
01:03:12,783 --> 01:03:15,377
I was a great beauty!

1063
01:03:15,453 --> 01:03:19,480
- How did this personality come about?
- I was very charming.

1064
01:03:19,557 --> 01:03:21,718
There were many men
interested in you?

1065
01:03:21,792 --> 01:03:25,592
I was quite a lively dancer.

1066
01:03:25,663 --> 01:03:27,631
It's very hard to believe.

1067
01:03:27,731 --> 01:03:32,964
I had a really good day.
It was a fine way to spend my birthday.

1068
01:03:33,037 --> 01:03:36,200
- Your birthday isn't until tomorrow.
- But it's real close.

1069
01:03:36,273 --> 01:03:38,605
But no presents until midnight.

1070
01:03:42,313 --> 01:03:43,746
Happy birthday.

1071
01:03:43,814 --> 01:03:46,942
What is this? Is this a present?
Are you kidding?

1072
01:03:47,017 --> 01:03:49,747
Yeah. Why don't you try it on?

1073
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:54,348
- This is more like a present for you.
- It'll add ten years to our sex life.

1074
01:03:54,425 --> 01:03:56,325
Yeah. Forget it.

1075
01:03:56,393 --> 01:03:59,089
Here's a real present.

1076
01:03:59,163 --> 01:04:02,155
- What is this anyway?
- Check it out.

1077
01:04:06,537 --> 01:04:10,530
You knew I wanted this.
God, it's terrific!

1078
01:04:10,608 --> 01:04:14,009
Just put on the watch and that thing.
It'll be perfect.

1079
01:04:24,886 --> 01:04:28,822
Seems like

1080
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:33,520
Old times

1081
01:04:34,896 --> 01:04:38,388
Having you

1082
01:04:38,466 --> 01:04:41,196
To walk with

1083
01:04:41,269 --> 01:04:44,363
Seems like

1084
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:52,175
Old times

1085
01:04:53,714 --> 01:04:58,014
Having you to walk with

1086
01:04:59,554 --> 01:05:04,856
And it's still a thrill

1087
01:05:04,926 --> 01:05:10,228
Just to have my arms

1088
01:05:10,298 --> 01:05:12,766
Around you

1089
01:05:15,937 --> 01:05:20,033
Still the thrill

1090
01:05:20,107 --> 01:05:24,100
That it was the day

1091
01:05:24,178 --> 01:05:27,670
I found you

1092
01:05:27,748 --> 01:05:33,380
Seems like

1093
01:05:33,454 --> 01:05:37,948
Old times

1094
01:05:41,162 --> 01:05:46,395
Dinner dates and flowers

1095
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:54,240
Old times

1096
01:05:55,743 --> 01:06:01,079
Staying up all hours

1097
01:06:01,148 --> 01:06:06,381
Making dreams come true

1098
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:12,590
Doing things we used

1099
01:06:13,794 --> 01:06:17,195
To do

1100
01:06:19,133 --> 01:06:22,364
Seems like

1101
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:26,065
Old times

1102
01:06:30,311 --> 01:06:35,408
Here with

1103
01:06:37,351 --> 01:06:41,845
You

1104
01:06:48,529 --> 01:06:50,497
Thank you.

1105
01:06:50,598 --> 01:06:52,793
You were sensational.

1106
01:06:52,867 --> 01:06:56,268
I told you if you stuck to it,
you would be great and...

1107
01:06:56,337 --> 01:06:58,464
You were sensational.

1108
01:06:58,572 --> 01:07:01,905
Yeah, they were a terrific audience.

1109
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:05,571
It makes it easy for me,
because I can be...

1110
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:09,082
Excuse me.
Hi, I'm Tony Lacey.

1111
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:13,951
- We wanted to say we enjoyed your set.
- Yeah? Really?

1112
01:07:14,021 --> 01:07:17,013
I thought it was very musical.
I liked it a lot.

1113
01:07:17,091 --> 01:07:19,218
That's really nice.
Thanks a lot.

1114
01:07:19,293 --> 01:07:23,320
Are you recording?
Are you with any label?

1115
01:07:23,397 --> 01:07:26,662
Me? No, not at all.

1116
01:07:26,734 --> 01:07:30,966
I'd like to talk to you about that
sometime if you get a chance.

1117
01:07:31,038 --> 01:07:34,337
Possibly working together.

1118
01:07:34,408 --> 01:07:39,072
That's nice. This is Alvy Singer.
Do you know Alvy?

1119
01:07:39,146 --> 01:07:43,344
I don't, but I know your work.
I'm a big fan of yours.

1120
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:47,615
This is Shawn, Bob and Petronia.

1121
01:07:50,324 --> 01:07:53,225
We're going back to the Pierre...

1122
01:07:53,294 --> 01:07:56,354
and we're going to meet
Jack and Angelica for a drink.

1123
01:07:56,430 --> 01:07:59,593
If you'd like to come,
we'd love to have you.

1124
01:07:59,667 --> 01:08:03,296
We can sit and talk.
Not a big deal.

1125
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:06,272
Just relax, be very mellow.

1126
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:08,501
Remember we had that thing?

1127
01:08:08,576 --> 01:08:10,134
What thing?

1128
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,779
Remember we discussed that thing?

1129
01:08:16,584 --> 01:08:21,214
Oh, the thing!
Oh, the thing. Yeah.

1130
01:08:21,288 --> 01:08:25,657
Well, if it's inconvenient,
that's fine, too.

1131
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:30,356
We'll do it another time. If you're on
the coast, we'll get together there.

1132
01:08:30,431 --> 01:08:33,025
It was a wonderful set.
I really enjoyed it.

1133
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,432
Nice to have met you.
Good night.

1134
01:08:41,509 --> 01:08:44,478
What's the matter?
You want to go to that party?

1135
01:08:44,545 --> 01:08:47,207
I don't know.
I thought it might be fun.

1136
01:08:47,281 --> 01:08:49,476
It would be nice to meet
some new people.

1137
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:55,617
I don't think I could take a mellow
evening. I don't respond well to mellow.

1138
01:08:55,689 --> 01:08:59,352
If I get too mellow,
I ripen and rot.

1139
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:02,794
- It's not good for my...
- All right.

1140
01:09:02,863 --> 01:09:05,423
You don't want to go to the party.
What do you want to do?

1141
01:09:13,374 --> 01:09:16,969
That day in Brooklyn was the last day
I remember having a good time.

1142
01:09:17,044 --> 01:09:20,878
- We never have any laughs anymore.
- I've been moody and dissatisfied.

1143
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:24,008
- How often do you sleep together?
- Do you have sex often?

1144
01:09:24,085 --> 01:09:26,417
Hardly ever.
Maybe three times a week.

1145
01:09:26,487 --> 01:09:30,719
Constantly. I'd say three times a week.
Like the other night, Alvy wanted sex.

1146
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,782
She would not sleep with me
the other night.

1147
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:37,229
I don't know. Six months ago I would
have done it just to please him.

1148
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,232
I tried everything.

1149
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,792
I put on soft music
and my red light bulb.

1150
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:48,172
Since our discussions here, I feel
I have a right to my own feelings.

1151
01:09:48,242 --> 01:09:51,609
I think you would have been happy,
because I really asserted myself.

1152
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:54,147
The incredible thing is,
I'm paying for her analysis...

1153
01:09:54,215 --> 01:09:57,013
she's making progress,
and I'm getting screwed.

1154
01:09:57,084 --> 01:10:01,418
I feel so guilty,
because Alvy is paying for it.

1155
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:03,787
So I feel guilty
if I don't sleep with him.

1156
01:10:03,858 --> 01:10:07,726
But if I do sleep with him, it's like
I'm going against my own feelings.

1157
01:10:07,795 --> 01:10:11,891
- I'm not making any progress.
- I can't win.

1158
01:10:11,966 --> 01:10:14,127
Sometimes I think
I should live with a woman.

1159
01:10:14,268 --> 01:10:18,500
I don't believe it.
You guys have never snorted coke?

1160
01:10:18,572 --> 01:10:22,770
I always wanted to try,
but Alvy's very down on it.

1161
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:26,472
Don't put it on me. I don't want to put
a wad of white powder in my nose.

1162
01:10:26,547 --> 01:10:28,481
There's the nasal membrane.

1163
01:10:28,549 --> 01:10:32,144
- You never want to try anything new.
- How can you say that?

1164
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:37,020
I said you, I and that girl
from acting class should sleep together.

1165
01:10:37,091 --> 01:10:40,060
- That's sick.
- I know it's sick, but it's new.

1166
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:42,823
- You didn't say it couldn't be sick.
- Come on, Alvy.

1167
01:10:43,964 --> 01:10:46,694
- Do your body a favor. Try it.
- It'll be fun.

1168
01:10:46,767 --> 01:10:51,136
I'm sure it's fun, 'cause the Incas
did it. They were a million laughs.

1169
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,605
For your own experience.
You want to write. Why not?

1170
01:10:53,674 --> 01:10:57,667
It's great stuff, Alvy. A friend
just brought it in from California.

1171
01:10:57,745 --> 01:11:01,010
I didn't tell you.
We're going to California next week.

1172
01:11:01,081 --> 01:11:04,175
It's really a thrill, as you know.

1173
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:08,654
On my agent's advice, I sold out
and am going to do a TV appearance.

1174
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:11,190
That's not it at all.
Alvy's giving an award on TV.

1175
01:11:11,258 --> 01:11:13,692
You act like you're violating
a moral issue.

1176
01:11:13,761 --> 01:11:17,891
It's so phony. We have to leave New York
during Christmas. It kills me.

1177
01:11:17,965 --> 01:11:23,562
Listen, while you're in California,
could you score some coke for me?

1178
01:11:23,637 --> 01:11:28,768
Sure, be glad to. I'll just put it
in the hollow heel on my boot.

1179
01:11:28,842 --> 01:11:33,336
- How much is this stuff?
- About $2,000 an ounce.

1180
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:35,974
Really?
And what is the kick of it?

1181
01:11:46,994 --> 01:11:50,896
I've never been so relaxed
as I have been since I moved out here.

1182
01:11:50,965 --> 01:11:54,958
I want you to see my house.
I live next to Hugh Hefner.

1183
01:11:55,035 --> 01:11:59,199
And the women are like in Playboy,
but they can move their arms and legs.

1184
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:02,936
I can't get over that
this is really Beverly Hills.

1185
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:06,036
The architecture is really consistent.
There's French next to Spanish...

1186
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,673
next to Tudor next to Japanese.

1187
01:12:08,749 --> 01:12:10,683
It's so clean out here.

1188
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:14,517
Because they don't throw garbage away.
They make it into TV shows.

1189
01:12:14,588 --> 01:12:19,150
- Give us a break. It's Christmas.
- Can you believe this is Christmas?

1190
01:12:19,226 --> 01:12:22,889
It was snowing and really gray
in New York.

1191
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:25,591
Nice. Santa Claus
will have sun stroke.

1192
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:28,999
Max, there's no crime,
there's no mugging.

1193
01:12:29,036 --> 01:12:31,163
There's no economic crime...

1194
01:12:31,238 --> 01:12:34,401
but there's ritual,
religious cult murders.

1195
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,500
There's wheat-germ
killers out here.

1196
01:12:36,577 --> 01:12:39,205
While you're out here,
I want you to see my TV show.

1197
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,805
And we're invited
to a big Christmas party.

1198
01:12:52,926 --> 01:12:56,418
Charlie, give me a good laugh here.

1199
01:12:59,366 --> 01:13:01,391
A little bigger.

1200
01:13:01,468 --> 01:13:04,096
Do you realize how immoral
this all is?

1201
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:06,298
I've got a hit series.

1202
01:13:06,373 --> 01:13:08,364
But you're adding fake laughs.

1203
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:13,446
Give me a tremendous laugh here.

1204
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:15,607
We do the show live
in front of an audience.

1205
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,913
But nobody laughs,
because the jokes aren't funny.

1206
01:13:17,985 --> 01:13:20,545
That's why this machine is dynamite.

1207
01:13:24,491 --> 01:13:27,756
Give me a medium chuckle here...

1208
01:13:27,828 --> 01:13:30,820
and then a big hand.

1209
01:13:30,898 --> 01:13:33,765
Is there booing on that?

1210
01:13:33,834 --> 01:13:36,564
I don't feel well.

1211
01:13:36,637 --> 01:13:40,232
- What's the matter?
- I got very dizzy.

1212
01:13:40,307 --> 01:13:42,605
- I feel dizzy.
- Sit down.

1213
01:13:42,676 --> 01:13:44,109
Jesus.

1214
01:13:45,012 --> 01:13:47,981
You all right?
You want to lie down?

1215
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:51,074
No. My stomach felt
queasy all morning.

1216
01:13:51,151 --> 01:13:53,244
How about a ginger ale?

1217
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,016
No.
Maybe I'd better lie down.

1218
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:59,856
Try to get some of this down.
It's just plain chicken.

1219
01:14:01,528 --> 01:14:04,497
No, I can't eat this.
I'm nauseous.

1220
01:14:06,767 --> 01:14:10,498
If you could get me something
to get me through the next two hours.

1221
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:14,439
I have to go to Burbank
and give out an award on a TV show.

1222
01:14:14,508 --> 01:14:17,170
There's nothing wrong with you
as far as I can tell.

1223
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:20,441
You have no fever,
no symptoms of anything serious.

1224
01:14:20,514 --> 01:14:24,678
- You haven't eaten pork or shellfish.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry, Doctor.

1225
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:28,745
Alvy, that was the show. Everything
is fine. They found a replacement.

1226
01:14:28,822 --> 01:14:30,983
They're going to tape without you.

1227
01:14:31,058 --> 01:14:33,652
Jesus!
Now I don't get to do the TV show?

1228
01:14:35,295 --> 01:14:38,093
- I can't find any reason for this.
- Nothing at all?

1229
01:14:38,165 --> 01:14:42,192
- I could get a lab man up here.
- Hand me the salt, please.

1230
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:46,330
Perhaps it would be better
if we took him to the hospital.

1231
01:14:46,407 --> 01:14:47,840
The hospital?

1232
01:14:47,908 --> 01:14:51,345
- There's no other way to diagnose him.
- This is not bad, actually.

1233
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:59,883
Don't tell me we're going to have
to walk from the car to the house?

1234
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:02,979
My feet haven't touched pavement
since I reached Los Angeles.

1235
01:15:03,056 --> 01:15:06,856
I'll take a meeting with you
if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.

1236
01:15:06,927 --> 01:15:09,157
I took a meeting with Freddy.
Freddy took a meeting with Charlie.

1237
01:15:09,229 --> 01:15:11,925
- You take a meeting with him.
- All the good meetings are taken.

1238
01:15:11,998 --> 01:15:13,932
Right now it's only a notion.

1239
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,096
I think I can get money to make it into
a concept, then turn it into an idea.

1240
01:15:19,106 --> 01:15:20,903
Like this house, Max?

1241
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:23,534
Even wrote a road map
to get us to the bathroom.

1242
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:25,669
You should have told me
it was Tony Lacey's party.

1243
01:15:25,746 --> 01:15:27,441
What difference does that make?

1244
01:15:27,514 --> 01:15:29,448
I think he has a thing for Annie.

1245
01:15:29,516 --> 01:15:33,475
- No. He goes with that girl over there.
- Where?

1246
01:15:33,553 --> 01:15:36,579
- The one with the VPL.
- VPL?

1247
01:15:36,656 --> 01:15:39,682
Visible panty line.
She's gorgeous.

1248
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,957
She's a ten. That's great for you,
'cause you're used to two's, aren't you?

1249
01:15:43,029 --> 01:15:44,621
There are no two's.

1250
01:15:44,698 --> 01:15:47,326
You're used to the kind with shopping
bags walking through Central Park...

1251
01:15:47,401 --> 01:15:50,063
with the surgical masks on,
muttering.

1252
01:15:50,137 --> 01:15:52,970
How do you like this couple? They look
like they're from Masters and Johnson.

1253
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:57,032
Intensive care ward.
My God!

1254
01:15:57,110 --> 01:16:01,103
- I think she's giving me the eye.
- If she comes over, my brain will mush.

1255
01:16:02,449 --> 01:16:05,111
You're Alvy Singer, right?
Didn't we meet at EST?

1256
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:07,050
No, I was never to EST.

1257
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,214
- Then how can you criticize it?
- He didn't say anything.

1258
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:14,522
I came to get some shock therapy,
but there was an energy crisis.

1259
01:16:14,594 --> 01:16:17,392
- He's my food taster. Have you two met?
- How do you do?

1260
01:16:17,464 --> 01:16:20,558
- Do you taste for poisoned food?
- Yeah, he's great.

1261
01:16:20,634 --> 01:16:23,034
You guys are wearing white.
It must be in the stars.

1262
01:16:23,103 --> 01:16:27,005
- Uri Geller must be on the premises.
- We're going to operate together.

1263
01:16:27,073 --> 01:16:32,067
In about six weeks
we could cut the whole album.

1264
01:16:32,145 --> 01:16:34,545
I don't know.
This is strange to me.

1265
01:16:34,614 --> 01:16:37,640
You can stay here.
Use the whole wing in this house.

1266
01:16:37,717 --> 01:16:42,347
- Stay here?
- Really. Why are you smiling?

1267
01:16:42,422 --> 01:16:45,914
Not only is he a great agent,
but he really gives good leading.

1268
01:16:45,992 --> 01:16:50,452
This is a great house: saunas,
Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.

1269
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:54,796
You know who the original owners were?
Nelson Eddy then Legs Diamond.

1270
01:16:54,868 --> 01:16:58,201
- Then you know who lived here?
- Trigger.

1271
01:16:58,271 --> 01:17:01,672
Charlie Chaplin,
right before his un-American thing.

1272
01:17:03,176 --> 01:17:07,374
- But you guys are still New Yorkers.
- Yeah, I love it there.

1273
01:17:07,447 --> 01:17:12,475
I used to live there for years,
but it's so dirty now.

1274
01:17:12,552 --> 01:17:16,818
- I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
- This is a nice screening room.

1275
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:19,085
There's another thing about New York.

1276
01:17:19,159 --> 01:17:21,320
If you want to see a movie,
you have to stand on line.

1277
01:17:21,394 --> 01:17:23,760
It could be freezing or raining.
And here...

1278
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:26,321
We saw Grand Illusion here last night.

1279
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:29,368
That's a great film if you're high.
It's really funny.

1280
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:32,701
Come and see our bedroom.
We did a fantastic thing up there.

1281
01:17:32,772 --> 01:17:34,865
I'm cool.

1282
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:37,910
It's wonderful.
They eat and watch movies all day.

1283
01:17:37,978 --> 01:17:42,472
And gradually you get old and die. It's
important to make an effort sometimes.

1284
01:17:42,549 --> 01:17:44,881
- Do you think his girlfriend's pretty?
- She's great looking.

1285
01:17:44,951 --> 01:17:48,318
A little on the androgynous side.

1286
01:17:48,388 --> 01:17:50,322
I forgot my mantra.

1287
01:18:09,009 --> 01:18:11,273
That was fun.

1288
01:18:11,344 --> 01:18:14,472
I don't think California
is bad at all.

1289
01:18:14,548 --> 01:18:16,846
It's a drag coming home.

1290
01:18:16,917 --> 01:18:21,013
A lot of beautiful women.
It was fun to flirt.

1291
01:18:21,087 --> 01:18:23,214
I have to face facts.

1292
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:27,920
I adore Alvy, but our relationship
doesn't seem to work anymore.

1293
01:18:27,994 --> 01:18:31,725
I'll have the usual trouble
with Annie in bed tonight.

1294
01:18:31,798 --> 01:18:33,732
Why do I need this?

1295
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:38,737
If only I had the nerve to break up,
but it would really hurt him.

1296
01:18:38,805 --> 01:18:42,332
If only I didn't feel guilty
asking Annie to move out.

1297
01:18:42,409 --> 01:18:45,776
It'd probably wreck her,
but I should be honest.

1298
01:18:45,845 --> 01:18:48,575
Alvy, let's face it.

1299
01:18:48,648 --> 01:18:52,379
I don't think our relationship
is working.

1300
01:18:52,452 --> 01:18:55,478
I know. A relationship
is like a shark:

1301
01:18:55,555 --> 01:18:58,854
It has to constantly
move forward or it dies.

1302
01:18:58,925 --> 01:19:02,884
And I think what we've got
on our hands is a dead shark.

1303
01:19:02,963 --> 01:19:05,727
- Whose Catcher in the Rye is this?
- If it has my name on it...

1304
01:19:05,799 --> 01:19:07,960
I guess it's mine.

1305
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:13,802
You wrote your name in all my books,
'cause you knew this day would come.

1306
01:19:13,873 --> 01:19:17,331
You wanted to break up
just as much as I do.

1307
01:19:17,410 --> 01:19:21,346
No question. I think
we're doing the mature thing.

1308
01:19:21,414 --> 01:19:24,747
Look. All the books
on death and dying are yours.

1309
01:19:24,818 --> 01:19:27,252
And all the poetry books are mine.

1310
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:30,721
Denial of Death.
This is the first book I got you.

1311
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:32,724
Remember that day?

1312
01:19:32,792 --> 01:19:35,386
I feel like there's
a great weight off my back.

1313
01:19:37,097 --> 01:19:39,065
Thanks, honey.

1314
01:19:39,132 --> 01:19:44,502
I mean, no. I think it's important
for us to explore new relationships.

1315
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:49,668
There's no question about that, because
we've given this a more than fair shot.

1316
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:51,938
My analyst thinks this move
is key for me.

1317
01:19:52,012 --> 01:19:56,381
And I trust her,
because my analyst recommended her.

1318
01:19:56,449 --> 01:19:59,543
Why should I put you through
all my moods and hang-ups anyway?

1319
01:19:59,619 --> 01:20:03,146
You know what the beauty part is?
We can always come back together again.

1320
01:20:03,223 --> 01:20:05,384
- There's no problem.
- Exactly.

1321
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:10,088
I don't think many couples could handle
this, break up and remain friends.

1322
01:20:10,163 --> 01:20:12,859
This button is mine.
Remember?

1323
01:20:12,932 --> 01:20:16,663
These are yours. "Impeach Eisenhower."
"Impeach Nixon."

1324
01:20:16,736 --> 01:20:20,365
"Impeach Lyndon Johnson."
"Impeach Ronald Reagan."

1325
01:20:21,841 --> 01:20:25,333
I miss Annie.
I made a terrible mistake.

1326
01:20:25,412 --> 01:20:28,438
She's living in Los Angeles
with Tony Lacey.

1327
01:20:28,515 --> 01:20:32,076
If she is, then the hell with her. If
she likes that lifestyle, let her stay.

1328
01:20:32,152 --> 01:20:35,019
- He's a jerk for one thing.
- He graduated Harvard.

1329
01:20:35,088 --> 01:20:38,990
Harvard makes mistakes, too.
Kissinger taught there.

1330
01:20:39,959 --> 01:20:42,359
Don't tell me you're jealous?

1331
01:20:42,429 --> 01:20:44,556
Yeah. Jealous? A little bit.
Like Medea.

1332
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:48,294
Can I show you something?
I found this in the apartment.

1333
01:20:48,368 --> 01:20:53,169
Black soap. She used to wash her face
800 times a day with black soap.

1334
01:20:53,239 --> 01:20:55,230
Don't ask me why.

1335
01:20:55,308 --> 01:20:57,833
Why don't you go out with other women?

1336
01:20:57,911 --> 01:21:01,176
I tried,
but it's very depressing.

1337
01:21:01,247 --> 01:21:04,182
This always happens to me.
Quick! Get a broom!

1338
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:07,413
What are you making
such a big deal about?

1339
01:21:07,487 --> 01:21:10,183
They're only lobsters.

1340
01:21:10,256 --> 01:21:13,555
- You're adult. You can pick up lobsters.
- I'm not myself since I quit smoking.

1341
01:21:13,626 --> 01:21:16,891
- When did you quit?
- Sixteen years ago.

1342
01:21:16,963 --> 01:21:19,796
- What do you mean?
- Mean?

1343
01:21:20,934 --> 01:21:23,903
You stopped smoking 16 years ago.
Is that what you said?

1344
01:21:25,772 --> 01:21:28,104
I don't understand.

1345
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:30,802
Are you joking or what?

1346
01:21:42,088 --> 01:21:44,283
Central Park's turning green.

1347
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:49,226
I saw that lunatic we used to see
with the pinwheel hat...

1348
01:21:49,295 --> 01:21:51,695
and the roller-skates.

1349
01:21:51,765 --> 01:21:55,223
Listen, I want you to come back here.

1350
01:21:55,301 --> 01:21:58,702
Well, then I'm going to come out there
and get you.

1351
01:22:03,076 --> 01:22:05,374
What do you mean, where am I?
Where do you think I am?

1352
01:22:05,445 --> 01:22:09,643
I'm at the Los Angeles airport.
I flew in.

1353
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:12,549
I flew in to see you.

1354
01:22:12,619 --> 01:22:15,850
Can we not debate this
on the telephone...

1355
01:22:15,922 --> 01:22:18,755
because I've got a temperature...

1356
01:22:18,825 --> 01:22:22,994
and I'm getting my chronic
Los Angeles nausea again.

1357
01:22:23,127 --> 01:22:25,561
Wherever you want to meet.
I don't care.

1358
01:22:25,629 --> 01:22:27,597
I'll drive in.
I rented a car.

1359
01:22:28,766 --> 01:22:30,700
I'm driving.

1360
01:22:30,768 --> 01:22:33,703
What, is that such a miracle?
I'm driving myself.

1361
01:22:49,987 --> 01:22:52,854
I'm going to have the alfalfa sprouts...

1362
01:22:52,923 --> 01:22:56,586
and a plate of mashed yeast.

1363
01:23:16,147 --> 01:23:17,808
You look pretty.

1364
01:23:17,882 --> 01:23:21,511
No, I just lost a little weight,
that's all.

1365
01:23:25,923 --> 01:23:28,790
Well, you look nice.

1366
01:23:28,859 --> 01:23:32,693
I think we should get married.

1367
01:23:32,763 --> 01:23:34,230
Come on.

1368
01:23:36,067 --> 01:23:40,527
Why, you want to live out here?
It's like living in Munchkinland.

1369
01:23:40,604 --> 01:23:44,370
What do you mean?
It's perfectly fine out here.

1370
01:23:44,442 --> 01:23:47,843
Tony's very nice.

1371
01:23:47,912 --> 01:23:51,109
I meet people, go to parties
and play tennis.

1372
01:23:51,182 --> 01:23:53,946
That's a very big step for me.

1373
01:23:54,018 --> 01:23:57,146
I'm able to enjoy people more.

1374
01:23:57,221 --> 01:24:00,213
You're not going to come back
to New York?

1375
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:04,193
What's so great about New York? It's a
dying city. You read Death in Venice.

1376
01:24:04,261 --> 01:24:07,594
You didn't read Death in Venice
until I bought it for you.

1377
01:24:07,665 --> 01:24:11,066
That's right. You only gave me books
with the word "death" in the title.

1378
01:24:11,135 --> 01:24:13,501
Because it's an important issue.

1379
01:24:13,571 --> 01:24:16,563
You're incapable of enjoying life.
You know that?

1380
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:19,074
You're like New York City.
You're just this person.

1381
01:24:19,143 --> 01:24:21,737
You're like this island unto yourself.

1382
01:24:21,812 --> 01:24:24,906
I can't enjoy anything
unless everybody is.

1383
01:24:24,982 --> 01:24:29,351
If one guy is starving someplace,
it puts a crimp in my evening.

1384
01:24:31,789 --> 01:24:33,723
Do you want to get married?

1385
01:24:35,826 --> 01:24:38,989
No. We're friends.

1386
01:24:39,063 --> 01:24:41,759
I want to remain friends.

1387
01:24:43,834 --> 01:24:45,267
Check please.

1388
01:24:45,336 --> 01:24:48,328
You're mad, aren't you?

1389
01:24:48,405 --> 01:24:51,272
Yes, of course I'm mad,
because you love me. I know that.

1390
01:24:51,342 --> 01:24:53,867
I can't say that that's true
at this point in my life.

1391
01:24:53,944 --> 01:24:56,674
I really can't say that's true.

1392
01:24:56,747 --> 01:24:59,648
You know how wonderful you are.

1393
01:24:59,717 --> 01:25:03,585
You're the reason I got out of my room,
that I was able to sing...

1394
01:25:03,654 --> 01:25:07,988
and get more in touch with my feelings
and all that crap.

1395
01:25:08,058 --> 01:25:10,458
Listen, listen.

1396
01:25:11,729 --> 01:25:13,458
So what are you up to?

1397
01:25:15,866 --> 01:25:19,802
The usual. I'm trying to write.
I'm working on a play.

1398
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:24,233
Are you saying you're not coming back
to New York with me?

1399
01:25:25,543 --> 01:25:30,310
No. Look.
I gotta go.

1400
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:33,748
What do you mean?
I flew 3,000 miles to see you.

1401
01:25:33,817 --> 01:25:36,581
Air miles. Do you know
what that does to my stomach?

1402
01:25:36,654 --> 01:25:38,645
If you must know,
it's a hectic time for Tony.

1403
01:25:38,722 --> 01:25:40,713
- The Grammys are tonight.
- The what?

1404
01:25:40,791 --> 01:25:42,918
The Grammys. He's got a lot
of records up for awards.

1405
01:25:42,993 --> 01:25:45,689
They give awards for that music?
I thought just ear plugs.

1406
01:25:45,763 --> 01:25:49,324
Just forget it. Let's just
forget the conversation.

1407
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:52,494
They do nothing but give out awards.
I can't believe it.

1408
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:55,767
Greatest Fascist Dictator:
Adolph Hitler.

1409
01:26:26,003 --> 01:26:28,870
I know what you're going to say.
I'm not a great driver.

1410
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:32,102
- I have some problems with...
- May I see your license, please?

1411
01:26:32,176 --> 01:26:34,770
Just don't get angry.

1412
01:26:34,845 --> 01:26:38,713
I have my license here.
It's a rented car.

1413
01:26:40,684 --> 01:26:44,017
Don't give me your life's story.

1414
01:26:44,088 --> 01:26:46,352
Just pick up the license.

1415
01:26:46,423 --> 01:26:50,291
You have to ask nicely, because
I've had a rough day. My girlfriend...

1416
01:26:50,361 --> 01:26:52,829
Just give me the license, please.

1417
01:26:54,598 --> 01:26:57,396
Since you put it that way,
it's hard for me to refuse.

1418
01:26:57,468 --> 01:27:00,562
I have a terrific problem
with authority.

1419
01:27:00,638 --> 01:27:03,038
It's not your fault.
Don't take it personal.

1420
01:27:11,248 --> 01:27:13,808
So long, fellows.
Keep in touch.

1421
01:27:23,327 --> 01:27:27,161
Imagine my surprise
when I got your call.

1422
01:27:27,231 --> 01:27:30,462
Yeah. I had the feeling
I got you at a bad moment.

1423
01:27:30,534 --> 01:27:32,832
I heard high-pitched squealing.

1424
01:27:32,903 --> 01:27:34,370
Twins, Max.

1425
01:27:35,272 --> 01:27:37,331
Sixteen-year-olds.

1426
01:27:38,842 --> 01:27:42,573
Can you imagine the mathematical
possibilities of that?

1427
01:27:42,646 --> 01:27:46,138
You're an actor. You should be doing
Shakespeare in the park.

1428
01:27:46,216 --> 01:27:49,549
I did Shakespeare in the park.
I got mugged.

1429
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:53,021
I was playing Richard II. Two guys
with leather jackets stole my leotard.

1430
01:27:58,595 --> 01:28:01,894
Are we driving through plutonium?

1431
01:28:01,965 --> 01:28:05,423
Keeps out the alpha rays.
You don't get old.

1432
01:28:07,705 --> 01:28:11,038
You're a thinking person.
How can you choose this lifestyle?

1433
01:28:11,108 --> 01:28:13,838
What is so great about New York?

1434
01:28:13,911 --> 01:28:17,108
It's a dying city.
You read Death in Venice.

1435
01:28:17,181 --> 01:28:19,581
You didn't read Death in Venice
until I gave it to you.

1436
01:28:19,650 --> 01:28:21,982
You only give me books
with the word "death" in the title.

1437
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:25,954
- It's an important issue.
- You're incapable of enjoying life.

1438
01:28:26,023 --> 01:28:29,117
You're like New York.
You're an island.

1439
01:28:29,193 --> 01:28:32,822
Okay. If that's all that we've been
through together means to you...

1440
01:28:32,896 --> 01:28:36,559
it's better if we just said good-bye,
once and for all.

1441
01:28:36,633 --> 01:28:38,157
It's funny.

1442
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:40,635
After all the serious talks
and passionate moments...

1443
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:44,231
that it ends here, in a health food
restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.

1444
01:28:45,008 --> 01:28:47,408
Good-bye, Sally.

1445
01:28:47,478 --> 01:28:51,915
Wait.
I'm going to go with you.

1446
01:28:51,982 --> 01:28:53,950
I love you.

1447
01:28:57,354 --> 01:29:00,255
What do you want?
It was my first play.

1448
01:29:00,324 --> 01:29:03,384
You know how you're always trying to
get things to come out perfect in art...

1449
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:06,691
because it's real difficult in life.

1450
01:29:06,764 --> 01:29:11,326
Interestingly, however,
I did run into Annie again.

1451
01:29:11,402 --> 01:29:13,461
It was on the Upper West Side
of Manhattan.

1452
01:29:13,537 --> 01:29:17,268
She had moved back to New York.
She was living in Soho with some guy.

1453
01:29:17,341 --> 01:29:21,437
When I met her, she was dragging him
in to see The Sorrow and the Pity...

1454
01:29:21,512 --> 01:29:24,106
which I counted
as a personal triumph.

1455
01:29:24,181 --> 01:29:26,945
Annie and I had lunch
sometime after that...

1456
01:29:27,017 --> 01:29:31,044
and just kicked around old times.

1457
01:29:31,121 --> 01:29:35,251
Just to have my arms

1458
01:29:37,327 --> 01:29:39,352
Around you

1459
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,527
Still the thrill

1460
01:29:47,137 --> 01:29:50,402
That it was the day

1461
01:29:50,474 --> 01:29:52,772
I found you

1462
01:29:53,677 --> 01:29:56,942
Seems like

1463
01:29:59,183 --> 01:30:03,950
Old times

1464
01:30:06,557 --> 01:30:11,961
Dinner dates and flowers

1465
01:30:14,798 --> 01:30:16,823
Old times

1466
01:30:18,268 --> 01:30:21,135
After that, it got late
and we both had to go.

1467
01:30:21,205 --> 01:30:23,400
But it was great seeing Annie again.

1468
01:30:23,474 --> 01:30:26,204
I realize
what a terrific person she was...

1469
01:30:26,276 --> 01:30:29,143
and how much fun it was
just knowing her.

1470
01:30:29,213 --> 01:30:32,876
And I thought of that old joke.

1471
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:37,785
This guy goes to a psychiatrist
and says, "Doc, my brother's crazy.

1472
01:30:37,855 --> 01:30:40,449
He thinks he's a chicken."

1473
01:30:40,524 --> 01:30:42,822
The doctor says,
"Why don't you turn him in?"

1474
01:30:42,893 --> 01:30:45,953
The guy says,
"I would, but I need the eggs."

1475
01:30:46,029 --> 01:30:50,591
Well, I guess that's, now, how I feel
about relationships.

1476
01:30:50,667 --> 01:30:55,695
They're totally irrational,
crazy and absurd.

1477
01:30:55,772 --> 01:30:58,764
But I guess we keep going through it...

1478
01:30:58,842 --> 01:31:02,039
because most of us need the eggs.
