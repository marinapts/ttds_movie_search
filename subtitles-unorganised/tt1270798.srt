1
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:43,894
Mama!

2
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,962
Mother. What are you...

3
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,340
I thought you were a burglar.

4
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,301
I didn't mean to scare you, darling.
I was just getting a snack.

5
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,595
Go back to bed.

6
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,431
What's the matter?

7
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,892
Go on, back to bed.

8
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,437
I'll make you a hot chocolate.

9
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,398
Who are you?

10
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,946
And what have you done with my mother?

11
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:21,283
My mother has never set foot
in this kitchen in her life.

12
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:25,121
And she certainly never
made me a hot chocolate.

13
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,040
Unless you count
ordering the maid to do it.

14
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,269
You're not scared of me?

15
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,814
I always believed I couldn't be
the only one in the world.

16
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,275
The only person who was

17
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,402
different.

18
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,196
And here you are.

19
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,990
Charles Xavier.

20
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,578
Raven.

21
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,539
You're hungry and alone.

22
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,416
Take whatever you want.

23
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:14,003
We've got lots of food.
You don't have to steal.

24
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,922
In fact,

25
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,758
you never have to steal again.

26
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,399
Understand this, Erik...

27
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,361
These Nazis, I'm not like them.

28
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,993
Genes are the key, yes?

29
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,205
But their goals?

30
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,751
Blue eyes? Blond Hair? Pathetic.

31
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,883
Eat the chocolate.

32
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:02,927
It's good.

33
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,762
Want some?

34
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,058
I want to see my mama.

35
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:21,320
Genes are the key that unlocks
the door to a new age, Erik.

36
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,407
A new future for mankind.

37
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,577
Evolution.

38
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,746
You know what I'm talking about?

39
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,835
It's a simple thing I ask of you.

40
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:40,923
A little coin is nothing
compared to a big gate.

41
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,509
Is it?

42
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,979
Ja.

43
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,484
I tried, Herr Doctor.

44
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:04,864
I can't... I don't...

45
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,615
It's impossible.

46
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:14,290
The one thing I can say for the Nazis is their
methods seem to produce results.

47
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,169
I'm sorry, Erik.

48
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,432
Mama!

49
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,642
My darling.

50
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,644
How are you?

51
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,066
Here's what we're going to do.

52
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,361
I'm going to count to three...

53
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,324
...and you're going to move the coin.

54
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,370
You don't move the coin, I pull the trigger.

55
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,333
Understand?

56
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,836
One

57
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,421
Mama.

58
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,672
You can do it.

59
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,012
Two

60
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,266
Everything is all right.

61
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,700
Three.

62
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,932
Yes. Wonderful.

63
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,068
Excellent.

64
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,791
Nein!

65
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,197
Outstanding, Erik.

66
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,119
So we unlock your gift with anger.

67
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,540
Anger and pain.

68
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,794
You and me...

69
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,923
...we're going to have a lot of fun together.

70
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,374
Heterochromia.

71
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,545
A gentleman would at least
offer to buy me a drink first.

72
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:34,258
Norman, a pint of bitter for me
and a brandy for the lady, please.

73
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,759
- How did you know that?
- Lucky guess.

74
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,970
My name is Xavier. Charles Xavier.

75
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,263
- How do you do?
- Amy.

76
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,265
Heterochromia was
in reference to your eyes,

77
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,809
which I have to say are stunning.

78
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,561
One green, one blue.

79
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,813
It's a mutation.
It's a very groovy mutation.

80
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,481
I've got news for you, Amy.

81
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,108
You are a mutant.

82
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,862
First you proposition a girl,
and then you call her deformed.

83
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,114
How is that seduction technique
working for you?

84
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,282
I'll tell you in the morning.

85
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,493
No, seriously, though,
you mustn't knock it.

86
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,370
Mutation took us
from single-celled organisms

87
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,874
to being the dominant form
of reproductive life on this planet.

88
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,085
Infinite forms of variation
with each generation,

89
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,880
all through mutation.

90
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,841
Then let's reclaim that word.

91
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,472
- Mutant and proud.
- Chin-chin. Hey.

92
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,267
- I guess I have to buy my own drink.
- I'm sorry. One cola.

93
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,810
Charles here was just telling me

94
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,313
that I'm like one of the first
sea creatures that grew legs.

95
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,356
A tiny bit sexier.

96
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,401
I'm sorry. This is my sister, Raven.

97
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,777
- Hi.
- Amy.

98
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,405
- And what do you study?
- Waitressing.

99
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,453
Oh, look, you have heterochromia, too.

100
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,456
- Sorry, what?
- Look at her eye.

101
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,878
Right. Raven, get your coat, please.

102
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,047
Don't talk to me. You did that on purpose.

103
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,216
- I did not! Why would I do it on purpose?
- Yes, you did!

104
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,676
You know I can't control it sometimes
if I'm stressed or tired.

105
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,679
You seem to be doing
a perfectly good job right now.

106
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,556
- "Mutant and proud."
- What?

107
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:08,060
Or is it only with pretty mutations,
or invisible ones like yours?

108
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,728
But if you're a freak, you better hide.

109
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,980
You're being ridiculous.

110
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,149
I don't mean to sound like an old fart.

111
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,526
- Which you are.
- Sometimes.

112
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,404
But we've talked about this, Raven.

113
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,866
A small slip-up is one thing.
A big one does not bear thinking about.

114
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,375
"Mutant and proud."

115
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,004
"Mutant and proud"?

116
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,225
If only.

117
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,441
- Would you date me?
- Of course I would.

118
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,778
Any young man would be lucky
to have you. You are stunning.

119
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,029
Looking like this?

120
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,115
Like... What?

121
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,661
Blue?

122
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,292
- You're my oldest friend.
- I'm your only friend.

123
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,503
- Thank you for that.
- Well?

124
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,880
I'm incapable of thinking of you that way.

125
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,132
I feel responsible for you.

126
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,969
Anything else would just feel wrong.

127
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,555
- But what if you didn't know me?
- Unfortunately, I do know you.

128
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,015
I don't know what's gotten into you lately.

129
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,891
You're awfully concerned with your looks.

130
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,398
I'm sleepy. Will you read to me?

131
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,775
I can't. I have my thesis coming up.
I have to study.

132
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,737
Fine, read that.
Your thesis always sends me right off.

133
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,199
"To Homo neanderthalensis,
his mutant cousin, Homo sapiens,

134
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,409
"was an aberration.

135
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,497
"Peaceful cohabitation,
if ever it existed, was short-lived.

136
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:53,999
"Records show, without exception,

137
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,252
"that the arrival of the mutated
human species in any region

138
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,504
"was followed by the immediate extinction

139
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,257
"of their less-evolved kin."

140
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,516
Possession of that gold is illegal.

141
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,518
I should inform the police.

142
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,270
Let's not play this game.

143
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,356
Where did you get it?

144
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,274
A friend.

145
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,069
He recommended your bank most highly.

146
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,030
I see.

147
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,491
Do you know our terms, sir?

148
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,117
Yes.

149
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,038
And you should know mine.

150
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,293
This gold is what remains of my people.

151
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,796
Melted from their possessions.

152
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,881
Torn from their teeth.

153
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,841
This is blood money.

154
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,053
And you're going to help me find the
bastards responsible for it.

155
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,143
Don't touch that alarm.

156
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,900
I want Schmidt. Klaus Schmidt.

157
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,026
Where is he?

158
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,737
Our clients don't provide
addresses. We're not...

159
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,323
Not that sort of bank?

160
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,707
Metal fillings, eh?

161
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:18,750
Not gold.

162
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,293
Worried someone might steal them?

163
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,630
Argentina! Schmidt is in Argentina!

164
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,844
Villa Gesell! Please!

165
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,069
Thank you.

166
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,993
I would love to kill you.

167
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,291
So mark my words.

168
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,879
If you warn anyone I'm coming...

169
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,630
I will find you.

170
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,604
Another day at the office.

171
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,439
Is that Colonel Hendry?

172
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,857
The NATO guy?

173
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,400
Yeah.

174
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,736
Yes, it is.

175
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,238
Because that's three mob bosses,
the Italian ambassador

176
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,240
and the CEO of Lockheed.

177
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,201
They can't all be Communists.

178
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,745
This Hellfire Club,
it's got to be something else.

179
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,790
Do you see that?

180
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,001
Hello, girls.

181
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,086
Wow! Very nice.

182
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,173
What are you doing?

183
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:52,010
Using some equipment
the CIA didn't give me. Stay put.

184
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,098
- Colonel Hendry?
- Yes, ma'am.

185
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,268
Emma Frost. Sebastian Shaw's associate.

186
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,605
And where is Mr. Shaw?

187
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,067
We're having a party,
and here's the entertainment.

188
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,777
Come with me.

189
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,900
Hello, beautiful. How are you?

190
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,653
Hey, baby. You want to find a quiet place?

191
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,865
I am so sorry.
I've been booked by Colonel Hendry.

192
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,660
Excuse me.

193
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,391
You sure we can't get you a refill, Bob?

194
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,809
No.

195
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:27,897
So, I hear you blocked the proposal
to position Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

196
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,110
I expect you'll reconsider.

197
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,903
We've had this conversation.

198
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:38,116
You put our nukes in Turkey
or anywhere that close to Russia,

199
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,035
and you're looking at war.

200
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,620
Nuclear war.

201
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,237
I don't ask for favors, Colonel.

202
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,990
I express my expectations.

203
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,577
So, let me say it again.

204
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,830
I expect you'll reconsider.

205
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,833
The only thing I will reconsider

206
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,170
is having another glass
of that delicious champagne.

207
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,769
What the hell did you put in my drink?

208
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:08,039
You're thinking of running. Hiding.

209
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,041
We'd find you, Hendry.

210
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,961
There's not a fortress in the world
that could keep us out.

211
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,647
Magnificent. Isn't she, Bob?

212
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,902
Genetic mutation.
The evolution of the human genome.

213
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,446
Where's Azazel?

214
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,162
We don't want the Colonel to be late.

215
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,292
Comrade.

216
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,006
Missiles in Turkey
send a very clear message.

217
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,257
If we ever decide to fire them,

218
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,051
the Russian early-warning system
won't even have time to kick in.

219
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,845
This better be important, MacTaggert.

220
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,264
Whoa, slow down.

221
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,683
Are you smoking them funny cigarettes?
People don't disappear.

222
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,059
Colonel Hendry was there.

223
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,978
He was there, McCone, in the Hellfire Club.

224
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,563
Colonel Hendry?

225
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,648
I agree with you, General.

226
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,233
I've reconsidered my position

227
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,695
and I now believe we should
put Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

228
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,946
Colonel Hendry is here.

229
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:25,366
So unless he magically traveled
3,000 miles in the last 10 minutes,

230
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,953
listen to me, I suggest
that you stop wasting my time.

231
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,289
Looks like Hendry
wants to start World War III.

232
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,875
I got bigger things to deal with
right now, MacTaggert.

233
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,460
Sir, I...

234
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,712
- God!
- Have you lost your mind?

235
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,006
So, now what?

236
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,677
We find an expert on genetic mutation.

237
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,933
Professor of Genetics,
Charles Francis Xavier.

238
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,646
So, how does it feel to be a professor?

239
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,689
Don't call me that.
You don't get to be called a professor

240
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,399
until you actually have a teaching position.

241
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,526
I know, but it suits you.

242
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,319
Don't say that.
Do say, "Let's go have a drink."

243
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,655
- Let's go have a drink.
- Wonderful.

244
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,269
Afternoon, gentlemen.

245
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,395
Hot out there.

246
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,480
Beer, please.

247
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,256
- German beer.
- Of course.

248
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:07,468
Yes, it's Bitburger. You like it?

249
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,602
The best.

250
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,318
What brings you to Argentina?

251
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,364
The climate. I'm a pig farmer.

252
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,413
Tailor. Since I was a boy.

253
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,999
My father made
the finest suits in Dusseldorf.

254
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,045
My parents were from Dusseldorf.

255
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,672
What was their name?

256
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,507
They didn't have a name.

257
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,345
It was taken away from them...

258
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,971
by pig farmers...

259
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,515
...and tailors.

260
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,421
Blood and Honor.

261
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,590
Which would you care to shed first?

262
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,634
We were under orders...

263
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
Blood then.

264
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:34,514
Freeze, asshole.

265
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,099
Come on, shoot.

266
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,788
Who... what are you?

267
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,086
Let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster.

268
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,808
And I'm looking for my creator.

269
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,606
Drink! Drink! Drink!

270
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,575
Yeah!

271
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,042
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

272
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,295
I need another drink.
And you need another cola.

273
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,967
- Congratulations, Professor.
- Thank you very much.

274
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,635
It's much harder than it looks, actually.

275
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,970
No, on your presentation.

276
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,514
You were at my presentation?
How nice of you. Thank you very much.

277
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,682
Moira MacTaggert.

278
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,809
- Charles Xavier.
- Do you have a minute?

279
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:05,021
For a pretty little bean
with a mutated MCR1 gene?

280
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,647
I have five.

281
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:11,569
I say "MCR1,"
you would say "Auburn hair."

282
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,987
It's a mutation.

283
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,781
It's a very groovy mutation.

284
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,075
Mutation, right,

285
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,287
took us from single-celled organisms
to the dominant form...

286
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,082
You know what? This routine may
go over great with the co-eds,

287
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,793
- but I'm here on business.
- What?

288
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,421
- I really need your help.
- All right.

289
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,966
The kind of mutations that you were
talking about in your thesis.

290
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,094
I need to know
if they may have already happened.

291
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,138
In people alive today.

292
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,944
Professor?

293
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,280
I think we should just talk
when you're sober.

294
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,448
Do you have any time tomorrow?

295
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,578
Something tells me you already know
the answer to your question.

296
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:09,502
This is very important to me, and
if I can help you, I will do my utmost.

297
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,711
Thank you.

298
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,592
Still drinking champagne, Bob?

299
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,636
I will pass.

300
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,639
Okay, well, so much for the pleasantries.

301
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,601
I was wondering who you told
about our little arrangement.

302
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,061
No one.

303
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:32,066
- He's telling the truth.
- Good.

304
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,360
Well, I guess we're done here.

305
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,987
Let's wrap things up, shall we?

306
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,869
I knew better than to trust you.

307
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:47,456
Now, you let me walk out of here
with my money,

308
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:51,627
or I will pull this pin, and we all die.

309
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,089
Go ahead. Pull it.

310
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,049
I'll do it, I swear to God.

311
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,102
No, you won't.

312
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:13,983
But I will.

313
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,207
You're one of them?

314
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,083
Very astute of you, Colonel Hendry.

315
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,002
You want to guess what I can do?

316
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,088
I've got the power to absorb energy.
It keeps me young.

317
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,882
But that's the boring part.

318
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,719
The fun stuff is what I can do with it
once I've got it.

319
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,646
The advent of the nuclear age may have
accelerated the mutation process.

320
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,360
Individuals with extraordinary abilities
may already be among us.

321
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,486
Thank you very much.

322
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,113
MacTaggert, you really think
that some crackpot scientist

323
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:05,159
is going to make me believe in
sparkly dames and vanishing men?

324
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,329
You just bought yourself a one-way
ticket back to the typing pool.

325
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,830
This meeting is over.

326
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,376
Please sit down, Agent MacTaggert.

327
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,419
I didn't really expect you to believe me,

328
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,630
given that all you could think about
during my presentation was

329
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:21,092
what sort of pie they were serving
in the commissary.

330
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,177
It's apple pecan.

331
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,638
I haven't been entirely honest
with you, love. I'm sorry.

332
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,974
You see, one of
the many spectacular things

333
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:32,353
my mutation allows me to do
is that I can read your mind.

334
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:35,106
I've seen this before in a magic show.

335
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,110
Are you going to ask us to think of
a number between one and 10 now?

336
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,945
No, Agent Stryker. Although,

337
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,072
I could ask you about your son, William,

338
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,782
who you were thinking about,
which is very nice.

339
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,576
But I think I'd rather ask you
about the Jupiter missiles

340
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,745
America are currently placing in Turkey.

341
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:52,957
He's a goddamn spy.

342
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,751
You brought a goddamned spy
into this facility!

343
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,231
How's that for a magic trick?

344
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,528
Best I've ever seen.

345
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,156
I want them out of here.

346
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,075
And locked down
until I can figure out what to do.

347
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,328
My facility is off-site.

348
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,581
I'll take them.

349
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,834
I can't believe this.
You'd think the director of the CIA

350
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,044
would have a little more composure.

351
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,503
We should be going after Shaw right now.

352
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:42,048
But instead, he's out there
worrying about the wrong mutants.

353
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,674
What are we going to do, Levene?

354
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,719
Levene? Levene, what's wrong with you?

355
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,514
Absolutely nothing.

356
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,892
I've just frozen him for a moment
because I'd like to talk to you.

357
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,352
It's good, isn't it?

358
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:57,021
I'm as interested in this Sebastian Shaw
as you are.

359
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,941
If you still want my help, meet me on
the third floor of the parking garage.

360
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,153
I've always known that there
were people like you out there.

361
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,740
I've been the laughing stock
of this agency for years, but I knew it!

362
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,824
You are going to love my facility.

363
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,910
- That's going to have to wait.
- Why?

364
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,870
Agent MacTaggert has a lead
on Sebastian Shaw,

365
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,373
and if we don't move now,
apparently, we're going to lose him.

366
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,792
- What?
- Not only can he read minds,

367
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,377
he can communicate with them as well.

368
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,295
Moira and I have just had
a lovely conversation.

369
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,630
Yes, we did.

370
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,215
That is incredible!

371
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,052
But I cannot take you anywhere else
without permission from upstairs.

372
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,137
- Like to see one more magic trick?
- Okay.

373
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,640
- Get in the car.
- Good idea.

374
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,370
Herr Doktor.

375
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,793
Little Erik Lensherr.

376
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,003
He's here to kill you.

377
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,513
What kind of a greeting is that...

378
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,517
...after all these years?

379
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,279
Emma.

380
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,531
We don't harm our own kind.

381
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,702
Now it's a party.

382
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,330
This is the US Coast Guard.

383
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:42,460
Do not attempt to move your vessel.
Stay where you are.

384
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,634
They have a telepath.

385
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:59,185
I've lost Shaw. I've lost Shaw.
There's something blocking me.

386
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,352
This has never happened to me before.

387
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,730
I think there's someone like me
on that ship.

388
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,399
- Like you?
- I'm sorry, a telepath.

389
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,319
This is incredible. I could actually
feel her inside my mind. I'm very sorry,

390
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,779
but I don't think I'm gonna be
much help tonight. You're on your own.

391
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,253
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus!

392
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,550
Get inside.

393
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,390
Stop, stop, stop.

394
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,186
Charles! Are you okay?

395
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,437
There's someone else out there.

396
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:48,567
There.

397
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,113
Time to go.

398
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,420
Let go!

399
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,673
You have to let it go!

400
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,675
You've got to put someone in the water
to help him.

401
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,928
Let it go! You have to let it go!

402
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,702
You can't. You'll drown. You have to let go.

403
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,830
I know what this means to you,
but you're going to die.

404
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:29,043
Please, Erik, calm your mind.

405
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,181
Get off me! Get off!

406
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,516
Calm down! Just breathe. We're here!

407
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,727
- Who are you?
- My name is Charles Xavier.

408
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,772
You were in my head.
How did you do that?

409
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:54,151
You have your tricks, I have mine.
I'm like you. Just calm your mind.

410
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,821
I thought I was alone.

411
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,616
You're not alone.

412
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,828
Erik, you're not alone.

413
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,102
Welcome to my facility.

414
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,853
My mission has been to investigate

415
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,023
the application of paranormal powers
in military defense.

416
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,025
Or offense.

417
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,319
This guy Shaw, Schmidt,

418
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:40,072
whatever you want to call him,
he's working with the Russians.

419
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,533
- We might need your help to stop him.
- Marvelous.

420
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,577
So we're to be the CIA's
new mutant division, yes?

421
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:47,871
Something like that.

422
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:55,546
It's a supersonic.
The most advanced plane ever built.

423
00:36:56,965 --> 00:37:00,050
You should see it in real life. It's incredible.

424
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:04,054
Hank, these are the special new
recruits I was telling you about.

425
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,141
This is Hank McCoy, one of
our most talented young researchers.

426
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,894
How wonderful.
Another mutant, already here.

427
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,021
Why didn't you say?

428
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,231
Say what?

429
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,609
Because you don't know.

430
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,988
I am so, so terribly sorry.

431
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:27,244
- Hank?
- You didn't ask, so I didn't tell.

432
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,954
So, your mutation is what?

433
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,749
- You're super-smart?
- I'll say.

434
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,709
Hank here graduated Harvard
at the age of 15.

435
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,045
I wish that's all it was.

436
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,006
You're among friends now, Hank.

437
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,507
You can show off.

438
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,816
Splendid.

439
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,074
I'm sorry.

440
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,415
Ta-da!

441
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,548
You're amazing.

442
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,467
Really?

443
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,557
"The presence of US missiles in Turkey

444
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:34,186
"represents an unprecedented threat
to the people of the Soviet Union,"

445
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,648
warned Russian Foreign Minister Gromyko
earlier today.

446
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,193
But he was quick to insist
the Russians would not be the first

447
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,487
to initiate any military action.

448
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,406
Yeah, we'll fix that
as soon as we get to Russia.

449
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,034
Unless the CIA find us first.

450
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,286
I'll take care of them, too.

451
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:57,251
If that telepath gets inside your head,
he won't be as much fun as I am.

452
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,211
Already in hand, my love.

453
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,806
The Russians

454
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,102
made me this.

455
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,315
So, what am I thinking?

456
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,159
I don't know.

457
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,039
I was thinking
that you are the most exquisite thing

458
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,749
I have ever seen in my life.

459
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,922
And that this needs ice.

460
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,175
Fetch me some.

461
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,552
There's a good girl.

462
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:18,040
I promised myself I'd find a cure
ever since I was a little boy.

463
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:22,544
You have no idea what I'd give to feel

464
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,212
- normal.
- Normal.

465
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,428
Charles has never understood.

466
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,348
He's different, but he's never had to hide.

467
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:39,645
Hank, this serum that you're making,
it doesn't affect abilities, right?

468
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:42,689
Just appearance. It normalizes it.

469
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:43,857
Yeah.

470
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,360
Do you think it would work on me?

471
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,906
I can look into it, if you'd like.
It's the least I can do

472
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,200
after asking you to come down here
with such a weird request.

473
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:57,204
I have to admit, usually when guys
ask me out, they're not after my blood.

474
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,833
Sorry. I didn't intend to be forward.
I was just...

475
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,129
I was excited.
You know, the nature of your mutation.

476
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,299
If any genes hold the key
to changing appearance, it's yours.

477
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:13,679
Hank, you weren't being forward.
That's kind of what I meant.

478
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,764
No.

479
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,891
But I'm just sorry if you thought I was.

480
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,310
And I'm sorry that you weren't.

481
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,981
Go ahead. Take the blood.

482
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,244
Sorry. Did I hurt you?

483
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,540
Kinky.

484
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:47,379
By the way, if I looked like you,

485
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,047
I wouldn't change a thing.

486
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,367
From what I know about you,

487
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,786
I'm surprised you've managed
to stay this long.

488
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:22,789
What do you know about me?

489
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,042
Everything.

490
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,793
Then you know to stay out of my head.

491
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:30,922
I'm sorry, Erik,
but I've seen what Shaw did to you.

492
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,052
I've felt your agony.

493
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,513
I can help you.

494
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,730
I don't need your help.

495
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,982
Don't kid yourself.
You needed my help last night.

496
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,568
It's not just me you're walking away from.

497
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,490
Here you have the chance to be part
of something much bigger than yourself.

498
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,661
I won't stop you leaving. I could.

499
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,500
But I won't.

500
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,588
Shaw has got friends.

501
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,758
You could do with some.

502
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,558
Hank turned that radar installation
into a transmitter.

503
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:26,144
It's designed to amplify brainwaves

504
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,605
so it could enhance
your telepathic powers,

505
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,774
help us find other mutants for our division.

506
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,943
What if they don't want
to be found by you?

507
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,528
Erik.

508
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,029
You decided to stay.

509
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:43,203
If a new species is being discovered,
it should be by its own kind.

510
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,747
Charles and I find the mutants. No suits.

511
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,666
First of all, that's my machine out there.

512
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,669
Second of all, and much more
importantly, this is Charles' decision.

513
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,629
Charles is fine with the CIA being involved.

514
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,214
Isn't that right?

515
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:59,010
No. I'm sorry, but I'm with Erik.

516
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,222
We'll find them alone.

517
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,724
What if I say no?

518
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:09,187
Then good luck using your installation
without me.

519
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,911
I call it Cerebro.

520
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,956
- As in the Spanish for "brain."
- Yes.

521
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,418
Okay, so, the electrodes connect Charles
to the transmitter on the roof.

522
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:35,547
When he picks up a mutant,
his brain sends a signal through a relay

523
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,758
and then the co-ordinates
of their location are printed out here.

524
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,219
- You designed this?
- Yeah.

525
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,308
What an adorable lab rat
you make, Charles.

526
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,476
Don't spoil this for me, Erik.

527
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,979
I've been a lab rat.
I know one when I see one.

528
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:55,150
Okay, great.
Are you sure we can't shave your head?

529
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,319
- Don't touch my hair.
- Okay.

530
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,113
It's working!

531
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,510
For that, daddy-o, you get a private dance.

532
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,391
You cats know it's double for both, right?

533
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,310
No, that won't be necessary.
Although, I'm sure it'd be magical.

534
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:15,855
We were thinking more,
we'll show you ours

535
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,232
if you show us yours.

536
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,693
Baby, that is not the way it works
around here.

537
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,154
More tea, vicar?

538
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,573
Don't mind if I do.

539
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,703
My turn.

540
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,889
How would you like a job
where you get to keep your clothes on?

541
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,731
- Where to, fellas?
- Richmond, Virginia, please.

542
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,692
Right, so, you want the airport?
The station? What?

543
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,987
No, we were rather hoping
you would take us all the way.

544
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,530
That's a six-hour drive.

545
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:08,033
That will give us plenty of time to talk.

546
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,581
What does the government want
with a guy like Alex Summers?

547
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,708
I hope you're not planning
on putting him with others.

548
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:21,588
First guy I've ever met who
actually prefers solitary confinement.

549
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,349
Crazy, huh?

550
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,600
What?

551
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,643
You like fish. I like fish, too.

552
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,606
Maybe we should get a bite sometime,
talk about it?

553
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,360
I'd rather go out with the fish.

554
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,451
These fish?

555
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,472
- Excuse me, I'm Erik Lensherr.
- Charles Xavier.

556
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,474
Go fuck yourself.

557
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,371
- There's nothing on radar?
- Nothing.

558
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,415
- Sonar?
- Nyet.

559
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,376
Then we have a problem.

560
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,605
Beautiful, isn't it?

561
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,774
The reason we exist.

562
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,026
We are the children of the atom, my love.

563
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,528
We have a situation.

564
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:10,780
The telepath.

565
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:13,074
I shouldn't be able to feel him
at this distance.

566
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,577
It's like his reach is

567
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,744
amplified.

568
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,208
They're recruiting.

569
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:25,962
You go on to Russia. I'll handle them.

570
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,883
I can't stop thinking about
the others out there.

571
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,761
All those minds that I touched.
I could feel them.

572
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:39,184
Their isolation, their hopes,
their ambitions.

573
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,644
I tell you, we are at the start
of something incredible, Erik.

574
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:42,937
We can help them.

575
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:44,731
Can we?

576
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:49,194
Identification, that's how it starts.

577
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:53,990
And ends with being rounded up,
experimented on, eliminated.

578
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,867
Not this time.

579
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,203
We have common enemies.
Shaw, the Russians.

580
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,829
They need us.

581
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,414
For now.

582
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:08,379
We should think of code names.

583
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:10,798
We're government agents now,
we should have secret code names.

584
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,342
I want to be called Mystique.

585
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,261
Damn! I wanted to be called Mystique.

586
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,263
Well, tough. I called it.

587
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,559
And I'm way more mysterious than you.

588
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,355
Darwin, what about you?

589
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,649
Well, "Darwin" is already a nickname,

590
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,276
and, you know, it sort of fits.

591
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:31,736
Adapt to survive and all.

592
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,405
Check this out.

593
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,128
- That was incredible.
- Thank you.

594
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:53,675
- What about you?
- I'm going to be

595
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,759
Banshee.

596
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,636
Why do you want to be named
after a wailing spirit?

597
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,054
You might want to cover your ears.

598
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:17,824
- Your turn.
- My stage name is Angel.

599
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,160
- It kind of fits.
- You can fly?

600
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,162
And...

601
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,256
What's your name?

602
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:35,675
How about Big Foot?

603
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:39,137
You know what they say
about guys with big feet.

604
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,180
And yours are kind of small.

605
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:42,599
Okay, now.

606
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:45,852
Alex, what is your gift? What can you do?

607
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,646
It's not...

608
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,982
I just can't do it. I can't do it in here.

609
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,318
- Can you do it out there?
- Why don't you just do it out there?

610
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:57,030
- Come on!
- Alex! Alex! Alex!

611
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,453
That's the spirit!

612
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,622
Get down when I tell you.

613
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,540
"Get down when I tell you."

614
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,546
Get back.

615
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,094
Get back!

616
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,389
Whatever.

617
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:41,157
We have intel that Shaw is meeting with
the Russian Defense Chief in Moscow.

618
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:43,368
So go ahead. Say it.

619
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,870
I'm not here to say "I told you so."
You know why I'm here.

620
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,665
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Clearance to bring along your mutants.

621
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:52,168
Fight fire with fire. It makes sense.

622
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,170
Wait! You're okay with this?

623
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,006
Sending in a bunch of
untrained, unauthorized freaks?

624
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:01,594
These freaks are dedicated,
hardworking people.

625
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,180
Plane leaves for Russia in an hour.

626
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,182
I'm telling you,
these kids are not ready for Shaw.

627
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,308
I think they're gonna surprise you.

628
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:08,643
They're an exceptional bunch
of young people.

629
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:09,769
What the hell?

630
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,780
Come on! You can go harder than that.

631
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,535
Harder!

632
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,206
What are you doing?

633
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,714
Who destroyed the statue?

634
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,340
It was Alex.

635
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:40,717
No, Havok.

636
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,885
We have to call him Havok.
That's his name now.

637
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,723
And we were thinking,
you should be Professor X

638
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,975
and you should be Magneto.

639
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,477
Exceptional.

640
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,775
I expect more from you.

641
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,298
- We got a problem.
- What?

642
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,508
I'm so sorry. This wasn't on the map.

643
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:32,351
No matter what happens, act normally.
I'll take care of this, all right?

644
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,687
Now, listen to me...

645
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:40,234
- Where are you going?
- To our farm.

646
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,905
Open the back.

647
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,865
As you wish.

648
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,038
Easy, easy. Take it easy, chaps.

649
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,556
- Anything back there?
- Nothing. It's empty.

650
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,478
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

651
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:41,295
- Where is Shaw?
- I don't know.

652
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,674
But if she's a telepath and I read her,
she'll know we're here.

653
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,052
Let me try something else.

654
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,697
Shaw sends his apologies
but he's indisposed.

655
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,366
He asked me to come in his place.

656
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:14,704
And between you and I, honey,
I'm a lot better company.

657
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,913
Please, come in.

658
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,378
He's not coming.

659
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,091
So, what now, boss?

660
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,719
Now, nothing. We're here for Shaw.
Mission aborted.

661
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,554
- The hell it is.
- Erik.

662
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,307
She's his right-hand woman.
That's good enough for me.

663
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,019
The CIA invading the home of
a senior Soviet official. Are you crazy?

664
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,229
I'm not CIA.

665
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,480
Erik!

666
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:46,235
Your health.

667
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,450
So, you must be busy
planning your next move.

668
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:55,786
What with the Americans refusing to
remove their missiles from Turkey.

669
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:00,374
You know I can't talk about
those things, Miss Frost.

670
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,501
Emma.

671
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,381
And don't worry.

672
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,092
You don't have to say a word.

673
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,276
He's gonna start
World War III single-handed.

674
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,946
- We have to do something.
- Like what?

675
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,364
- We're moving out.
- You can't!

676
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,507
I'm sorry. I can't leave him.

677
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,730
For God's sake, Erik! Be calm.

678
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:06,148
Be calm.

679
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,401
Forget my face.

680
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:21,914
You are beautiful, so beautiful! Yes!

681
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,208
Pathetic.

682
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,676
Yes!

683
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:36,804
Nice trick.

684
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,599
Who are you?

685
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:45,688
Go to sleep.

686
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:56,115
You can stop trying
to read my mind, sugar.

687
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,036
You're never going to get anything
from me while I'm like this.

688
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:15,384
So, then, you can just tell us.

689
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:19,847
Where is Shaw?

690
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,313
Erik.

691
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,029
Erik, that's enough.

692
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:44,789
Erik, that's enough!

693
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,008
All yours.

694
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,554
She won't be shifting
into diamond form again.

695
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,015
And if she does, just give her a gentle tap.

696
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:32,294
We are the children of the atom.

697
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,297
Radiation gave birth to mutants.

698
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:39,760
What will kill the humans
will only make us stronger.

699
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,224
Beautiful, isn't it?

700
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:51,188
This is worse
than we previously imagined.

701
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,317
We're taking you with us.

702
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:57,486
CIA will want to question you themselves.

703
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,238
Oh, I doubt it.

704
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:02,408
They have bigger things
to worry about right now.

705
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,249
- Whoa!
- All right, all right.

706
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,334
Jesus, man, you are killing me.

707
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:15,504
Don't beat yourself up.
I've had a lot of spare time.

708
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,136
I didn't know the circus was in town.

709
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,763
Hey, come on, honey. Give us a little...

710
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,933
No? Come on, let's see the foot.

711
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,685
There it is. Come on, Big Foot, let's go.

712
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,104
Hey. Hey, come on. Hey.

713
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,485
They're just guys being stupid.

714
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,822
Guys being stupid, I can handle. Okay?
I've handled that my whole life.

715
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,366
But I'd rather a bunch of guys
stare at me with my clothes off

716
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:45,784
than the way these ones stare at me.

717
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,746
At us.

718
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,047
What was that?

719
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,801
I don't know. Something doesn't feel right.

720
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,020
No news of Shaw?

721
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:16,398
- Not a peep.
- Not even through that back channel?

722
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:29,995
What is that?

723
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,265
- We have an intruder in the main atrium.
- Where are the mutants?

724
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,101
If you take another step,
I'm gonna put you down.

725
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:55,437
Of course you will. But where do
I find the more evolved people?

726
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:57,606
Send back-up now!

727
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:03,862
Get back! Do not leave that room.
We're under attack!

728
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:05,948
Shoot! Shoot!

729
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:20,671
Where are the mutants?

730
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:23,215
Put that man down or we will open fire!

731
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,909
Stay here, my ass! Let's go!

732
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,126
- Get back!
- We can help! We can help!

733
01:04:58,853 --> 01:04:59,853
Wait!

734
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:01,772
You want the mutants?
They're right through that door.

735
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,233
Just let us normal people go.
We're no threat...

736
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,787
- Where is the telepath?
- Not here.

737
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:18,622
Too bad.

738
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,499
Well, at least I can take this silly thing off.

739
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:26,797
Good evening. My name is Sebastian Shaw.

740
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:30,175
And I am not here to hurt you.

741
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:31,718
Freeze!

742
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:33,679
Azazel.

743
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:40,602
My friends, there is a revolution coming.

744
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:44,022
When mankind discovers who we are,
what we can do,

745
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:45,858
each of us will face a choice.

746
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:48,110
Be enslaved

747
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,196
or rise up to rule.

748
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,408
Choose freely,
but know that if you are not with us,

749
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,201
then, by definition, you are

750
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,120
against us.

751
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,165
So, you can stay

752
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,710
and fight for the people
who hate and fear you,

753
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,673
or you can join me and live like kings.

754
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,472
And queens.

755
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:30,736
- Angel.
- Are you kidding me?

756
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:33,447
Come on.

757
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,365
We don't belong here.

758
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,826
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.

759
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:44,791
We have to do something.

760
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,935
Stop. I'm coming with you.

761
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:08,565
Good choice.

762
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,610
So, tell me about your mutation.

763
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,071
Well, I adapt to survive.

764
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,159
So, I guess I'm coming with you.

765
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:21,370
I like that.

766
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:29,044
- Alex!
- Get out!

767
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,545
Do it!

768
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:37,469
Protecting your fellow mutants?

769
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:39,805
That's a noble gesture.

770
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,974
Feels good.

771
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,398
Adapt to this.

772
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:35,360
Hello.

773
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:43,535
Once again, my sympathies for your
treatment at the hands of the CIA.

774
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,788
These Americans are ruthless.

775
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:52,502
Now they have their missiles
placed in Turkey...

776
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:57,758
...I expect you'll be planning new missile
sites of your own.

777
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:04,473
Somewhere you know the American
early-warning system won't help.

778
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:09,102
I hear Cuba is lovely this time of year.

779
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:12,356
And so close to Florida.

780
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,650
Missiles in Cuba?

781
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,613
You're serious?

782
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:23,241
We may as well declare war.

783
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,370
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.

784
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:31,249
You will make this happen.

785
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,336
Okay.

786
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,422
Let's see what KGB think about this.

787
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:45,514
Hello? General Armivolkoff.

788
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,186
It's nothing.

789
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:07,786
Raven?

790
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,627
We've made arrangements
for you to be taken home immediately.

791
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,254
- We're not going home.
- What?

792
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,631
He's not going back to prison.

793
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:20,882
He killed Darwin.

794
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,342
All the more reason for you to leave.

795
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,219
This is over.

796
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,304
Darwin's dead, Charles.

797
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:28,223
And we can't even bury him.

798
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,144
We can avenge him.

799
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,691
Erik, a word, please.

800
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:44,322
- They're just kids.
- No. They were kids.

801
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:46,741
Shaw has his army, we need ours.

802
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:53,915
We'll have to train.

803
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,626
All of us.

804
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:58,336
- Yes?
- Yeah.

805
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:01,047
Well, we can't stay here.

806
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:04,426
Even if they reopen the department,
it's not safe.

807
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,636
We've got nowhere to go.

808
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:10,348
Yes, we do.

809
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,310
The law says we've got to turn her over.

810
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,520
The law applies to human beings.

811
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:19,065
The same laws don't apply to mutants.
They're too dangerous.

812
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:23,278
In times like this,
security is more important than liberty.

813
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:26,031
- There is a war coming, John.
- Yes,

814
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:28,200
but a war with who?

815
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,382
Excellent question.

816
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,260
Though I wouldn't call it a war, exactly.

817
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:50,722
That suggests both sides stand
an equal chance of winning.

818
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,734
Captain, no sign of any American ships.

819
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,570
Maintain course, full ahead.

820
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:09,074
The Russians have sent
their warheads to Cuba.

821
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,326
We have a week
before the ship hits the coast.

822
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:15,539
Our fleet can be on this line
when the Russian missile ship arrives.

823
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:19,125
If that ship crosses the line,

824
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:22,254
they will have declared war
against the United States.

825
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,882
And we will have no choice but to
retaliate with a full nuclear response.

826
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,008
Do we agree?

827
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:35,225
Dispatch the 7th fleet.

828
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:38,812
This is yours?

829
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:41,106
No, it's ours.

830
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,992
Honestly, Charles. I don't know how
you survived, living in such hardship.

831
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:55,662
Well, it was a hardship softened by me.

832
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,250
Come on. Time for the tour.

833
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,140
Dear comrades...

834
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:21,938
The United States have dispatched
warships for Cuba.

835
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:26,943
This leaves us with no choice.

836
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:31,781
Comrade First Secretary...

837
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:35,243
We must send in our fleet.

838
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,914
Dispatch the fleet!

839
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:48,840
President Kennedy
has signed a formal proclamation

840
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:52,510
setting up a blockade
of all missiles bound for Cuba.

841
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,764
The Soviet Union reacted by terming it

842
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:59,768
"A step along the road to unleashing
a thermo-nuclear war."

843
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:11,696
You're sure?

844
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:13,948
I'm sure.

845
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,533
All right.

846
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,125
No. No, I can't. I'm sorry.

847
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,378
I can't shoot anybody point blank,
let alone my friend.

848
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,463
Oh, come on. You know I can deflect it.

849
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:29,923
You're always telling me
I should push myself.

850
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:35,178
If you know you can deflect it,
then you're not challenging yourself.

851
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:38,556
Whatever happened to the man
who was trying to raise a submarine?

852
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:43,103
I can't. Something that big?
I need the situation, the anger...

853
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,771
No, the anger is not enough.

854
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,232
It's gotten the job done all this time.

855
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,401
It's nearly gotten you killed all this time.

856
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:52,487
Come here.

857
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,531
Let's try something
a little more challenging.

858
01:14:56,242 --> 01:15:00,495
My stepfather took the possibility of
nuclear war quite seriously. This way.

859
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,706
That is why he had this bunker
built down here.

860
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:05,291
I thought we could use it
as a practice range of sorts.

861
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:07,252
You don't think I'm going to
blow through the walls?

862
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,546
He had this place built to
withstand a nuclear bomb.

863
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,047
I think it can handle you, Alex.

864
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:14,342
You know, when I do this,
bad things tend to happen.

865
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:18,513
That's because you can't control it.
It controls you.

866
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:21,057
That's why we're here, Alex.
It's why we're training.

867
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,815
What you're doing is incredible.
You're hitting a pitch with sound waves

868
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:31,526
that have the same resonant frequency
as the glass. That's why it shatters.

869
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,070
But this, it's like any other muscle
in the body.

870
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,114
You can control it.

871
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:40,285
"In each of us, two natures are at war."

872
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,162
Robert Louis Stevenson, Jekyll and Hyde.

873
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:43,246
Top marks.

874
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:45,290
The story wasn't really about
good and evil though, was it?

875
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:49,294
It was about man's animal nature
and his struggle to control it, to conform.

876
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:51,880
And it's that struggle
which is holding you back.

877
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:55,216
No, Jekyll was afraid of what
he could be capable of.

878
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,051
And you are, too.

879
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:59,471
If you're serious about me doing this,
you might want to get back.

880
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:00,972
All right.

881
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:03,016
- Shall I shut the door?
- Yeah.

882
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:08,396
Whenever you're ready.

883
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:15,945
Oh, my God!

884
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:21,826
I will teach you to control this, Alex.

885
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,415
And you're sure that this will work?

886
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,250
Anything is possible. I based the design...

887
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,669
Hank, stop talking. Come on.

888
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:33,838
Now, remember.
Scream as hard as you can.

889
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,840
You need the sound waves
to be supersonic.

890
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:38,009
Catch them at the right angle
and they should carry you.

891
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:40,428
They should carry me.

892
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:43,056
- That's reassuring.
- Good luck.

893
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,892
And don't forget to scream.

894
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:59,280
Now, if you want to beat me this time,
you have to set the beast free.

895
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:01,616
On your marks,

896
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:03,201
get set,

897
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:04,994
go!

898
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:21,386
Congratulations, my friend.

899
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,804
Robert Louis Stevenson
would have been proud.

900
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:26,683
Impressive, Hank.

901
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,476
With feet like those,
all you need is a red nose.

902
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,520
Right, Bozo?

903
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:32,647
- I'm done here.
- Thank you, Alex.

904
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:35,108
Come on, Hank.

905
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:48,580
If you're using half your concentration
to look normal,

906
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:52,292
then you're only half paying attention
to whatever else you're doing.

907
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:56,045
Just pointing out something
that could save your life.

908
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,175
You want society to accept you,

909
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:04,929
but you can't even accept yourself.

910
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,353
Sexy!

911
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:13,897
Well, this is just the prototype.

912
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:15,440
The real one will look considerably better.

913
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:18,526
It will be a whole suit. See, these
sensors measure your energy output.

914
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:21,279
This panel focuses it
and the excess is absorbed.

915
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:24,073
Try hitting the one in the middle.
Just the one in the middle, mind.

916
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:26,034
Good luck.

917
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:39,047
You got to see this. Your genes are
extraordinary, you know that?

918
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,757
Your cells age at half the rate
of a normal human.

919
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:43,676
When you're 40, you'll still
have the leucocytes of a teenager.

920
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:48,139
You have the most incredible
cellular structure I've ever seen.

921
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:54,395
And you truly believe I'll fly this time?

922
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,813
Unreservedly.

923
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:57,565
- I trust you.
- I'm touched.

924
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,442
- I don't trust him.
- Say nothing.

925
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,195
I'm gonna die!

926
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:04,197
Look, we're not going to
make you do anything you don't feel...

927
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:05,490
Here, let me help.

928
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:08,368
Erik!

929
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,099
What?

930
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:32,850
You know you were thinking the same.

931
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,019
Wonderful work, Hank.
Thank you very much.

932
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:36,896
All right, Alex, I want you to hit the "X".

933
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,357
And try not to hit me. There's a good chap.

934
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:42,944
- You're serious?
- I'm very serious.

935
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:45,279
I have complete and utter faith in you.

936
01:19:58,585 --> 01:19:59,669
Am I still a bozo?

937
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:03,089
Yes, Hank, you're still a bozo.

938
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:04,382
But nice job.

939
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:08,720
See that?

940
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:11,556
Try turning it to face us.

941
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:35,580
You know, I believe that true focus lies
somewhere between rage and serenity.

942
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,250
Would you mind if I...

943
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,328
What did you just do to me?

944
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:20,500
I accessed the brightest corner
of your memory system.

945
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:25,505
It's a very beautiful memory, Erik.
Thank you.

946
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:28,174
I didn't know I still had that.

947
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,469
There is so much more to you
than you know.

948
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:34,555
Not just pain and anger.

949
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,224
There is good, too. I felt it.

950
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:39,477
When you can access all of that,

951
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:42,730
you'll possess a power no one can match.

952
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:45,316
Not even me.

953
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,570
So, come on. Try again.

954
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:31,696
- Hey!
- Well done.

955
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,781
The President is about to make his address.

956
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:39,996
It shall be the policy of this nation
to regard any nuclear missile

957
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,749
crossing the embargo line
that surrounds Cuba

958
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:48,045
as an attack by the Soviet Union
on the United States

959
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:51,799
requiring a full retaliatory
response upon the Soviet Union...

960
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:54,260
- That's where we're going to find Shaw.
- How do you know?

961
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:58,014
Two superpowers facing off
and he wants to start World War III.

962
01:22:58,098 --> 01:22:59,807
He won't leave anything to chance.

963
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:01,809
So much for diplomacy.

964
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:04,270
I suggest you all get a good night's sleep.

965
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,397
...ultimately leads to war.

966
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:11,694
Tensions mount as
the Soviet missile ship nears Cuba.

967
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:16,616
All diplomatic efforts to avert
nuclear war have thus far failed.

968
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:21,078
As the American people ready themselves
for the likelihood of an atomic attack,

969
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:24,540
there are widespread reports
of panic-buying,

970
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:29,003
supermarkets cleared, as shelters
unused since the Second World War

971
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:31,589
are stocked for what may lie ahead.

972
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:36,260
In all its history,
America has never faced a greater threat.

973
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,095
The world is primed for war

974
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,723
and there's no one to stop me.

975
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:46,771
Come in.

976
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:49,273
Hey.

977
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,026
I have a surprise for you.

978
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:04,038
I isolated the right marker
in your DNA sample.

979
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:05,957
The serum works like an antibiotic,

980
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:09,210
attacking the cells
that cause our physical mutation.

981
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:12,004
It won't affect our abilities,
just our appearance.

982
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,300
Do you still want to do this?

983
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:19,804
Should we have to hide?

984
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:23,057
Well, you already do.

985
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:26,102
You're hiding right now,
like I have my whole life.

986
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:30,189
I don't want to feel like a freak all the time.
I just want to look...

987
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:32,316
- Normal.
- Yeah.

988
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:40,658
Hank, don't!

989
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:45,037
You're beautiful, Hank.

990
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:47,331
Everything you are, you are perfect.

991
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,296
Look at all of us.
Look at all we've achieved this week.

992
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,381
All we will achieve.

993
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:59,010
We are different.

994
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,512
But we shouldn't be
trying to fit into society.

995
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:05,766
Society should aspire to be more like us.

996
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:09,812
Mutant and proud.

997
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,610
It behooves me to tell you

998
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:21,949
that even if we save the world tomorrow,
and mutants are accepted into society,

999
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:25,453
my feet and your natural blue form

1000
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:27,496
will never be deemed beautiful.

1001
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,378
You look beautiful now.

1002
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:39,633
We need this cure.

1003
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:08,662
Cuba.

1004
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,331
Russia, America.

1005
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,333
It makes no difference.

1006
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:15,419
Shaw has declared war on mankind,
on all of us.

1007
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:16,504
He has to be stopped.

1008
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:19,632
I'm not going to stop Shaw.

1009
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:21,592
I'm going to kill him.

1010
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:27,348
Do you have it in you to allow that?

1011
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:35,439
You've known all along
why I was here, Charles.

1012
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:38,192
But things have changed.

1013
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:40,236
What started as a covert mission,

1014
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,030
tomorrow, mankind will know
that mutants exist.

1015
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:46,242
Shaw, us, they won't differentiate.

1016
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:47,910
They'll fear us.

1017
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,870
And that fear will turn to hatred.

1018
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:51,997
Not if we stop a war.

1019
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:55,376
Not if we can prevent Shaw.
Not if we risk our lives doing so.

1020
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:58,629
- Would they do the same for us?
- We have it in us to be the better men.

1021
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:00,673
We already are.

1022
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:02,383
We're the next stage of human evolution.

1023
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,510
- You said it yourself!
- No...

1024
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:06,387
Are you really so naive

1025
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:09,807
as to think that they won't
battle their own extinction?

1026
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:13,477
- Or is it arrogance?
- I'm sorry?

1027
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,938
After tomorrow,
they're going to turn on us.

1028
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:19,275
But you're blind to it, because
you believe they're all like Moira.

1029
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:21,652
And you believe they're all like Shaw.

1030
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:28,242
Listen to me very carefully, my friend.

1031
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:31,245
Killing Shaw will not bring you peace.

1032
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:35,499
Peace was never an option.

1033
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:23,005
No.

1034
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:25,883
No, no. No.

1035
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:56,705
Well,

1036
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,792
this is a surprise.

1037
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:01,544
The nice kind?

1038
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:07,007
Get out, Raven. I want to go to bed.

1039
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:09,552
Maybe in a few years.

1040
01:29:13,306 --> 01:29:15,140
How about now?

1041
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,605
I prefer the real Raven.

1042
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:28,946
I said the real Raven.

1043
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:39,206
Perfection.

1044
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:45,337
Could you pass me my robe?

1045
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,840
You don't have to hide.

1046
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,637
Have you ever looked at a tiger

1047
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:56,599
and thought you ought to cover it up?

1048
01:29:57,976 --> 01:29:59,476
No, but...

1049
01:29:59,686 --> 01:30:02,021
You're an exquisite creature, Raven.

1050
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:06,066
All your life,
the world has tried to tame you.

1051
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,527
It's time for you to be free.

1052
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:31,508
You know, sometimes I wonder
what my life would have been like

1053
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:33,886
if you hadn't found me here that night.

1054
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,429
Sorry, what? You...

1055
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:39,475
For God's sake, Raven!

1056
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:41,810
Where are your clothes?
Put some clothes on.

1057
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:43,771
That's not what you said
when you first saw me.

1058
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:48,108
But I guess pets are always cuter
when they're little, right?

1059
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:49,902
Raven, I don't know
what's gotten into you lately.

1060
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:52,029
I thought you'd be in a good mood.

1061
01:30:52,572 --> 01:30:58,035
Hank, he tells me that he's found
the answer to your cosmetic problem.

1062
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:01,914
Are you gonna tell me what's the matter
or do I have to read your mind?

1063
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,124
You promised me you would never do that.

1064
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:05,876
Until recently,

1065
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,796
I never had to use my power
to know what you were thinking, Raven.

1066
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,716
Charles, I used to think it was going
to be you and me against the world.

1067
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:16,136
But no matter how bad the world gets,
you don't want to be against it, do you?

1068
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:17,221
You want to be a part of it.

1069
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:41,078
What the hell happened here?

1070
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:51,338
Hank has been busy.

1071
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:53,590
Do we really have to wear these?

1072
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:56,427
As none of us mutated
to endure extreme g-force

1073
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:59,763
or being riddled by bullets,
I suggest we suit up.

1074
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:25,622
Where is Hank?

1075
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:28,917
I'm here.

1076
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:40,179
Hank?

1077
01:32:45,268 --> 01:32:48,437
It didn't attack the cells.

1078
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:51,982
It enhanced them.

1079
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:53,358
It didn't work.

1080
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:56,653
Yes, it did, Hank. Don't you see?

1081
01:32:56,946 --> 01:33:00,157
This is who you were meant to be.

1082
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:01,825
This is you.

1083
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,329
No more hiding.

1084
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:08,665
- You never looked better, man.
- Hank!

1085
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:12,753
Don't mock me!

1086
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:14,338
Hank, put him down immediately, please.

1087
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:15,881
Hank! Hank!

1088
01:33:18,885 --> 01:33:20,302
I wasn't.

1089
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,429
Even I got to admit you look pretty badass.

1090
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:24,431
I think I got a new name for you.

1091
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:26,391
Beast.

1092
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:30,479
You're sure you can fly this thing?

1093
01:33:30,647 --> 01:33:33,357
Of course I can. I designed it.

1094
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,120
Status of the cargo ship.

1095
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:50,749
Bearing 1-8-0 at 12 knots.

1096
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:54,837
Three minutes to the embargo line, sir.

1097
01:33:56,005 --> 01:33:58,757
God help them if they cross it.

1098
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:01,718
God help us all.

1099
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:05,597
- Sound general quarters.
- General quarters, general quarters!

1100
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:08,517
- All hands, man battle stations!
- Aye, sir.

1101
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:10,185
Set condition Zebra!

1102
01:34:10,895 --> 01:34:12,896
General quarters, battle stations.

1103
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:29,037
Captain, we already have our orders.
Why so eager for new ones?

1104
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:33,000
I lived through one war, comrade.

1105
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:36,545
I'd prefer not to start another.

1106
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:41,133
Battle stations! NOW!

1107
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:48,682
Gun Boss, target cargo ship bearing 1-8-0.

1108
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:53,604
Fleet reports all weapons ready.

1109
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:55,898
From the Kremlin, sir.

1110
01:34:56,441 --> 01:35:00,402
New orders. As of 1025 hours, the cargo
vessel Aral Sea is hereby ordered to...

1111
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:03,071
...reverse course
and return to port in Odessa.

1112
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:07,200
Aral Sea, come in.

1113
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:09,828
They are not responding.

1114
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:11,038
She's not turning around.

1115
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:13,916
Aral Sea, you are ordered to turn around.

1116
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:15,584
Do not cross the line.

1117
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:18,670
Target ready to be fired upon, sir.

1118
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:21,715
- Stand by to fire.
- Standing by, sir.

1119
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:36,813
It looks pretty messy out there.

1120
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:49,534
Aral Sea you are ordered to turn around.

1121
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:53,205
The crew of the Aral Sea are all dead.
Shaw's been there.

1122
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:54,748
He's still here, somewhere.

1123
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:56,750
He set the ship on course
for the embargo line.

1124
01:35:56,834 --> 01:35:59,711
If that ship crosses the line,
our boys are going to blow it up.

1125
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:01,421
And the war begins.

1126
01:36:01,839 --> 01:36:03,340
Unless they're not our boys.

1127
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:08,929
USS Independence,
this is Alexander Nevsky.

1128
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:10,764
We have lost control of our cargo ship.

1129
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:12,557
She has been instructed to stop.

1130
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:15,477
Do not fire! Repeat, do not fire!

1131
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:18,939
They have signaled the cargo ship
to turn around, sir.

1132
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:21,400
It's a ruse. Pay no attention!

1133
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:24,403
- Stand by to fire.
- Standing by to fire, sir.

1134
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:26,655
On my count. Five,

1135
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:28,532
four...

1136
01:36:50,847 --> 01:36:52,264
Hold on!

1137
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:02,774
Nyet.

1138
01:37:07,113 --> 01:37:09,072
- What was that?
- The Russians.

1139
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:10,574
They have fired on their own ship.

1140
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:12,868
A little warning next time, Professor.

1141
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:16,121
- Sorry about that. You all right?
- Yeah.

1142
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:18,331
Son of a...

1143
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,917
Give me CINCLANT on the horn.
I want a new set of orders.

1144
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:27,049
Congratulations, comrade.

1145
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:31,178
You just averted nuclear war!

1146
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:33,138
What?

1147
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:34,890
Take him to the brig.

1148
01:37:34,974 --> 01:37:38,643
What? What just happened?

1149
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:40,687
They say the comrade lost his mind.

1150
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:43,565
The Americans are applauding.

1151
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:48,111
They're here. That telepath is powerful.

1152
01:37:50,281 --> 01:37:52,949
We're moving to a back-up plan.

1153
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:56,203
That was inspired, Charles.

1154
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:58,288
Thank you very much,
but I still can't locate Shaw.

1155
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:00,415
He's down there. We need to find him now.

1156
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:01,541
Hank?

1157
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:03,919
Is there anything unusual
on the radar or scanners?

1158
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:05,629
No. Nothing.

1159
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:09,966
Well, then he must be underwater.
And obviously, we don't have sonar.

1160
01:38:12,512 --> 01:38:15,138
- Yes, we do.
- Yes, we do.

1161
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:20,977
They are ready for war.

1162
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,939
We just need to
strike another match to light the fuse.

1163
01:38:24,232 --> 01:38:27,067
And we still have
the most powerful weapon of all.

1164
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:28,860
Me.

1165
01:38:29,195 --> 01:38:34,116
Turn the nuclear reactor to 100% output
and make sure I'm not disturbed.

1166
01:38:37,495 --> 01:38:39,496
Hank, level the bloody plane!

1167
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:46,962
Whoa! You back right off.

1168
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:49,965
Beast, open the bomb bay doors!

1169
01:38:58,307 --> 01:39:01,268
Remember! This is a muscle.

1170
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:02,936
You control it!

1171
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:05,355
You'll be in here the entire time!

1172
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:07,107
We'll see you soon!

1173
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:10,694
On my mark! Three! Two!

1174
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:12,821
One! Go!

1175
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:31,715
Alert the fleet,
they may want to take their cans off.

1176
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:47,564
Banshee has got a location on Shaw.

1177
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:52,235
- Are you ready for this?
- Let's find out.

1178
01:40:56,008 --> 01:40:58,802
Remember, the point between rage

1179
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:01,263
and serenity.

1180
01:42:24,513 --> 01:42:25,680
Erik, take my hand!

1181
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:30,226
Hold on, guys. It's gonna get bumpy.

1182
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:47,035
Erik, take my hand!

1183
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:39,963
Moira? Moira, are you all right?

1184
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:41,840
Yeah, I'm okay.

1185
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:47,720
I read the teleporter's mind.

1186
01:43:47,805 --> 01:43:49,722
Shaw is drawing all the power
out of his sub.

1187
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:51,891
He's turning himself into
some kind of nuclear bomb.

1188
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:54,227
We got no time.
The Geiger count is going out of control.

1189
01:43:54,311 --> 01:43:55,437
Moira, this is what we're gonna do.

1190
01:43:55,521 --> 01:43:58,148
Get on the radio and tell them to
clear both fleets out immediately.

1191
01:43:58,232 --> 01:44:00,608
- I'm going in.
- Beast, Havok, back him up.

1192
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:02,694
Erik, I can guide you through
once you're in,

1193
01:44:02,778 --> 01:44:05,238
but I need you to shut down
whatever it is that's blocking me,

1194
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:07,323
then we just hope to God
it's not too late for me to stop him.

1195
01:44:07,408 --> 01:44:09,409
- Got it.
- Good luck!

1196
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:11,244
- Raven, stop!
- I'm going to help them.

1197
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:13,496
We don't have time for this.
If anything comes in that entrance,

1198
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:16,416
- you're taking care of it, yes?
- Fine.

1199
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:34,142
Beast!

1200
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:39,355
If we go, you go!

1201
01:44:42,902 --> 01:44:45,111
We believe Shaw is trying to detonate
some kind of bomb.

1202
01:44:50,367 --> 01:44:52,827
Erik, make for the middle of the vessel.

1203
01:44:52,912 --> 01:44:54,496
That's the point my mind can't penetrate.

1204
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,831
We have to assume
that that's where Shaw is.

1205
01:45:05,633 --> 01:45:07,550
Gangway! Gangway! Gangway!

1206
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:17,393
That's the nuclear reactor. Disable it.

1207
01:45:29,865 --> 01:45:31,824
Stop! Don't move!

1208
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:40,875
Get down!

1209
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:05,858
Erik, you're there. You've reached the void.

1210
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:08,570
He's not here, Charles. Shaw's not here!
He's left the sub!

1211
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:10,655
What? He's got to be there. He has to be!

1212
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:12,407
There's nowhere else he can be.
Keep looking.

1213
01:46:12,491 --> 01:46:16,119
And I'm telling you he's not.
There's no one here, God damn it!

1214
01:46:19,164 --> 01:46:20,873
Erik.

1215
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:22,792
What a pleasant surprise.

1216
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:24,419
Erik? Erik.

1217
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:28,840
So good to see you again.

1218
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:48,776
May I ask you something?

1219
01:46:48,861 --> 01:46:50,570
Why are you on their side?

1220
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:51,738
- He's gone.
- What?

1221
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:54,741
He's gone into the void!
I can't communicate with him there.

1222
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:57,410
Why fight for a doomed race
who will hunt us down

1223
01:46:57,494 --> 01:47:00,413
as soon as they realize
their reign is coming to an end?

1224
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:31,361
Yeah! Yes!

1225
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:46,292
I'm sorry for what happened in the camps.

1226
01:47:48,545 --> 01:47:50,380
I truly am.

1227
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:01,891
He's back!
Erik, whatever you're doing, keep doing it.

1228
01:48:01,975 --> 01:48:03,976
It's starting to work.

1229
01:48:04,061 --> 01:48:06,979
But everything I did, I did for you.

1230
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:09,107
To unlock your power,

1231
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:11,651
to make you embrace it.

1232
01:48:14,947 --> 01:48:16,114
It's working!

1233
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:18,574
I'm starting to see him,
but I can't yet touch his mind.

1234
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:35,758
You've come a long way
from bending gates.

1235
01:48:35,843 --> 01:48:37,552
I'm so proud of you.

1236
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:47,937
And you're just starting
to scratch the surface.

1237
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:51,357
Think how much further we could go

1238
01:48:51,442 --> 01:48:53,443
together.

1239
01:49:03,996 --> 01:49:05,121
Look out!

1240
01:49:12,379 --> 01:49:14,338
Stop! Azazel.

1241
01:49:29,646 --> 01:49:34,025
I don't want to hurt you, Erik. I never did.
I want to help you.

1242
01:49:34,276 --> 01:49:36,360
This is our time.

1243
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:38,237
Our age.

1244
01:49:38,906 --> 01:49:43,075
We are the future of the human race.

1245
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,703
You and me, son.

1246
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:48,289
This world could be ours.

1247
01:49:49,833 --> 01:49:53,795
Everything you did made me stronger.

1248
01:49:54,671 --> 01:49:57,381
It made me the weapon I am today.

1249
01:49:58,884 --> 01:50:00,885
It's the truth.

1250
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:04,180
I've known it all along.

1251
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:11,854
You are my creator.

1252
01:50:12,564 --> 01:50:14,065
Now, Charles!

1253
01:50:15,651 --> 01:50:17,485
- Are you okay?
- Moira, be quiet.

1254
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:19,362
I can only control this man for so long.

1255
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:34,836
- Sorry, Charles.
- Erik, please.

1256
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:37,463
- Be the better man.
- It's not that I don't trust you.

1257
01:50:37,548 --> 01:50:39,340
Erik, there will be no turning back!

1258
01:50:40,801 --> 01:50:42,218
No!

1259
01:50:42,928 --> 01:50:44,804
- Charles!
- Don't do this, Erik!

1260
01:50:52,145 --> 01:50:53,646
If you're in there,

1261
01:50:53,730 --> 01:50:56,774
I'd like you to know
that I agree with every word you said.

1262
01:50:59,444 --> 01:51:01,445
We are the future.

1263
01:51:03,365 --> 01:51:04,407
But,

1264
01:51:06,410 --> 01:51:07,743
unfortunately,

1265
01:51:08,579 --> 01:51:10,997
you killed my mother.

1266
01:51:19,089 --> 01:51:20,548
This is what we're going to do.

1267
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:23,009
No. Please, Erik, no.

1268
01:51:23,093 --> 01:51:26,929
I'm going to count to three
and I'm going to move the coin.

1269
01:51:28,974 --> 01:51:30,641
One.

1270
01:51:31,894 --> 01:51:33,644
Please, Erik.

1271
01:51:41,737 --> 01:51:43,279
Two.

1272
01:51:49,786 --> 01:51:51,537
Three.

1273
01:52:19,942 --> 01:52:25,863
The Russians share our concerns
and will join a strike on all the mutants.

1274
01:52:25,989 --> 01:52:27,990
We can end this threat for good.

1275
01:52:28,075 --> 01:52:29,951
We'll never have
another opportunity like this.

1276
01:52:30,035 --> 01:52:31,994
We have an agent on that beach.

1277
01:52:32,079 --> 01:52:33,955
One agent.

1278
01:52:34,039 --> 01:52:35,414
She's a good agent.

1279
01:52:35,499 --> 01:52:37,667
She's collateral damage.

1280
01:52:43,173 --> 01:52:46,550
Today, our fighting stops!

1281
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:12,201
Take off your blinders,
brothers and sisters.

1282
01:53:12,911 --> 01:53:14,704
The real enemy is out there.

1283
01:53:16,665 --> 01:53:18,708
I feel their guns moving in the water,

1284
01:53:19,167 --> 01:53:21,419
their metal targeting us.

1285
01:53:21,670 --> 01:53:24,046
Americans, Soviets,

1286
01:53:24,214 --> 01:53:25,756
humans.

1287
01:53:26,383 --> 01:53:28,968
United in their fear of the unknown.

1288
01:53:30,137 --> 01:53:33,889
The Neanderthal is running scared,
my fellow mutants!

1289
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:37,226
Go ahead, Charles.

1290
01:53:39,813 --> 01:53:40,980
Tell me I'm wrong.

1291
01:54:01,418 --> 01:54:04,211
Fleet Commander, this is X-Ray Bravo 7-0.

1292
01:54:04,296 --> 01:54:06,756
Respond. Over.

1293
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,133
The beach is secure. Call off the attack.

1294
01:54:09,426 --> 01:54:11,844
The beach is targeted
and ready to be fired upon, sir.

1295
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:14,263
- Stand by.
- Standing by, sir.

1296
01:54:14,431 --> 01:54:16,223
New orders. Fire on the beach.

1297
01:54:18,393 --> 01:54:20,269
Hello?

1298
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:23,439
Hello!

1299
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:33,032
Fire!

1300
01:55:21,623 --> 01:55:24,041
Erik, you said yourself,
we're the better men.

1301
01:55:24,751 --> 01:55:26,335
This is the time to prove it.

1302
01:55:30,048 --> 01:55:32,174
There are thousands of men
on those ships.

1303
01:55:32,259 --> 01:55:34,468
Good, honest, innocent men!

1304
01:55:34,553 --> 01:55:36,345
They're just following orders.

1305
01:55:38,306 --> 01:55:40,516
I've been at the mercy
of men just following orders.

1306
01:55:45,564 --> 01:55:47,106
Never again.

1307
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:52,820
Erik, release them!

1308
01:55:59,661 --> 01:56:01,412
No!

1309
01:56:07,502 --> 01:56:09,920
I don't want to hurt you. Don't make me!

1310
01:56:10,755 --> 01:56:11,881
Stand back!

1311
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:15,885
Charles, that's enough!

1312
01:56:20,932 --> 01:56:22,057
Erik, stop!

1313
01:56:32,485 --> 01:56:34,695
Gentlemen, it's been an honor
serving with you.

1314
01:56:34,905 --> 01:56:37,406
Comrades, thank you for your service.

1315
01:57:24,913 --> 01:57:26,205
I'm so sorry.

1316
01:57:26,289 --> 01:57:28,290
I said back off!

1317
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:32,127
You. You did this.

1318
01:57:36,132 --> 01:57:38,634
Erik. Please.

1319
01:57:40,804 --> 01:57:43,806
She didn't do this, Erik.

1320
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:45,933
You did.

1321
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:56,068
Us turning on each other,
it's what they want.

1322
01:57:56,569 --> 01:57:59,405
I tried to warn you, Charles.

1323
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:03,659
I want you by my side.

1324
01:58:03,743 --> 01:58:05,703
We're brothers, you and I.

1325
01:58:05,996 --> 01:58:09,206
All of us together, protecting each other.

1326
01:58:11,167 --> 01:58:13,502
We want the same thing.

1327
01:58:14,045 --> 01:58:16,005
My friend.

1328
01:58:16,464 --> 01:58:20,259
I'm sorry, but we do not.

1329
01:58:36,026 --> 01:58:39,820
Charles! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1330
01:58:39,904 --> 01:58:42,448
It's all right. It's all right.

1331
01:58:45,952 --> 01:58:48,287
This society won't accept us.

1332
01:58:49,372 --> 01:58:50,873
We form our own.

1333
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:54,126
The humans have played their hand.

1334
01:58:55,837 --> 01:58:58,380
Now we get ready to play ours.

1335
01:59:00,842 --> 01:59:01,884
Who's with me?

1336
01:59:13,563 --> 01:59:14,938
No more hiding.

1337
01:59:42,926 --> 01:59:44,218
You should go with him.

1338
01:59:44,886 --> 01:59:46,261
It's what you want.

1339
01:59:46,763 --> 01:59:49,181
You promised me
you would never read my mind.

1340
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:51,016
I know.

1341
01:59:51,101 --> 01:59:53,352
I promised you a great many things,
I'm afraid.

1342
01:59:54,437 --> 01:59:55,562
I'm sorry.

1343
02:00:00,902 --> 02:00:02,986
Take care of him.

1344
02:00:17,794 --> 02:00:20,921
And, Beast, never forget.

1345
02:00:21,631 --> 02:00:24,925
Mutant and proud.

1346
02:00:33,309 --> 02:00:35,102
Help me out, come on.

1347
02:00:35,603 --> 02:00:37,438
I'm gonna get you to a hospital.

1348
02:00:37,814 --> 02:00:39,231
Wait, Charles.

1349
02:00:39,315 --> 02:00:40,941
Charles, don't move, okay?

1350
02:00:41,025 --> 02:00:42,860
I won't.

1351
02:00:42,944 --> 02:00:44,820
Actually...

1352
02:00:48,116 --> 02:00:50,159
I can't feel my legs.

1353
02:00:51,161 --> 02:00:53,495
- What?
- I can't feel my legs.

1354
02:00:55,081 --> 02:00:57,124
I can't feel my legs.

1355
02:01:08,761 --> 02:01:10,512
In this week of Thanksgiving

1356
02:01:10,597 --> 02:01:12,598
there is much for which we can be grateful

1357
02:01:12,682 --> 02:01:16,101
as we look back to where we stood
only four weeks ago.

1358
02:01:16,186 --> 02:01:19,605
The unity of this hemisphere,
the support of our allies

1359
02:01:19,689 --> 02:01:22,524
and the calm determination
of the American people.

1360
02:01:22,609 --> 02:01:26,445
These qualities may be tested
many more times in this decade.

1361
02:01:29,616 --> 02:01:32,326
So, how many students
do you think you'll have here

1362
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:34,703
once you get the academy up and running?

1363
02:01:34,787 --> 02:01:36,955
As many as I can manage.

1364
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:38,874
Possibly more.

1365
02:01:41,503 --> 02:01:42,544
You know,

1366
02:01:43,505 --> 02:01:45,297
one day the government is going to realize

1367
02:01:45,381 --> 02:01:47,799
how lucky they were to have
Professor X on their side.

1368
02:01:49,594 --> 02:01:52,054
I suppose I am
a real professor now, aren't I?

1369
02:01:52,138 --> 02:01:53,472
Next thing you know, I'll be going bald.

1370
02:01:55,391 --> 02:01:57,893
We're still on the government's side, Moira.

1371
02:01:58,269 --> 02:02:00,521
We're still G-men. Just without the "G".

1372
02:02:01,272 --> 02:02:04,733
No. You're your own team now.

1373
02:02:04,901 --> 02:02:06,360
It's better.

1374
02:02:07,111 --> 02:02:09,363
You're X-Men.

1375
02:02:11,074 --> 02:02:13,075
Yes, I like the sound of that.

1376
02:02:13,993 --> 02:02:15,285
Moira?

1377
02:02:15,787 --> 02:02:19,665
For us, anonymity will be
the first line of defense.

1378
02:02:20,458 --> 02:02:21,917
I know.

1379
02:02:23,044 --> 02:02:27,548
They can threaten me
all they want, Charles.

1380
02:02:27,632 --> 02:02:30,509
I'll never tell them where you are.

1381
02:02:30,593 --> 02:02:32,427
Ever.

1382
02:02:32,512 --> 02:02:34,471
I know you won't.

1383
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:37,266
I know.

1384
02:02:44,774 --> 02:02:47,568
I remember the attack on HQ,

1385
02:02:47,652 --> 02:02:49,987
leaving to go somewhere else.

1386
02:02:50,071 --> 02:02:54,074
And then this morning, I woke up at home.

1387
02:02:54,158 --> 02:02:56,326
That's it.

1388
02:02:56,411 --> 02:02:59,913
All that time, wiped clean from your mind.
Just gone.

1389
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:02,374
He can do that?
You don't remember anything?

1390
02:03:03,126 --> 02:03:05,419
Sometimes I get fragments.

1391
02:03:05,587 --> 02:03:07,379
Like

1392
02:03:07,463 --> 02:03:09,506
trees,

1393
02:03:09,591 --> 02:03:11,008
sunlight.

1394
02:03:12,885 --> 02:03:16,179
- A kiss.
- Oh, Jesus.

1395
02:03:16,264 --> 02:03:19,474
Gentlemen, this is why
the CIA is no place for a woman.

1396
02:03:24,355 --> 02:03:25,480
What the hell was that?

1397
02:03:42,457 --> 02:03:45,167
I know we've had our differences.

1398
02:03:47,503 --> 02:03:49,671
Where's your telepath friend?

1399
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:52,424
Gone.

1400
02:03:52,508 --> 02:03:55,427
Left a bit of a gap in my life,
if I'm to be honest.

1401
02:03:55,511 --> 02:03:58,347
I was rather hoping you would fill it.

1402
02:04:02,644 --> 02:04:03,852
Join us.

1403
02:04:11,361 --> 02:04:12,694
Erik, I believe.

1404
02:04:16,616 --> 02:04:18,283
I prefer

1405
02:04:20,119 --> 02:04:21,745
Magneto.

1406
02:11:40,726 --> 02:11:41,726
English - US
