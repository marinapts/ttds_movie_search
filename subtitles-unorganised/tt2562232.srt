1
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,326
<i>How did we end up here?</i>

2
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,362
<i>This place is horrible.</i>

3
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,207
<i>Smells like balls.</i>

4
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,407
<i>We don't belong
in this shithole.</i>

5
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,566
Shit.

6
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,881
Hey, Sam.

7
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,724
<i>Dad, what kind of...
Shut up!</i>

8
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,410
<i>What kind of flowers
did you want?</i>

9
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,410
Alchemillas. Or something
that smells nice.

10
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,604
<i>Something soothing. It all
smells like fucking kimchi!</i>

11
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,724
That looks nice.
Anything but roses.

12
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,604
<i>I hate this job.</i>

13
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,765
Riggan,
everyone's set for 1-4.

14
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,251
<i>They're ready for you.</i>

15
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,082
<i>Riggan,
they're ready for you.</i>

16
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,410
Mr. Thomson.
Steve.

17
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,682
It's Daniel.
Okay.

18
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,443
Oh, hey, buddy.
How you doing?

19
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,082
Pretty good. Yeah, I'd be a lot
better if I could get, uh...

20
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,362
...Ralph to stop,
you know, acting.

21
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,681
He'll be fine.

22
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,003
And he was yelling,
"I love you,
I love you, bitch!"

23
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,929
What do you do
with a love like that?

24
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,647
That's not love
and you know it.

25
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,767
Why do you insist
on calling it love?

26
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,771
Say what you want,
but I know what it was.

27
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,520
What about you, Nick?
Does that sound like love?

28
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,609
Sorry I'm late.
Sound like love...

29
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,120
Look, I'm the wrong
person to ask.

30
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,363
I only heard the man's
name mentioned in passing.

31
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,449
I wouldn't know. You'd have
to know the particulars.

32
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,126
I think you're saying
love is absolute.

33
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,807
Yeah. The kind of love
I'm talking about is...

34
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,530
The kind of love
I'm talking about,

35
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,886
you don't try
and kill people.

36
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,009
It was love, Mel.
To Eddie, it was.

37
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,730
I don't care
what anyone says.

38
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,961
He was ready
to die for it.

39
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,806
Ask her what he did after
she left him.

40
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,521
He shot himself in the mouth,
but he screwed that up, too.

41
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,726
Poor Ed.

42
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,804
Poor Ed, my ass!
The guy was dangerous!

43
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,401
How did he screw up
shooting himself in the mouth?

44
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,325
He used to carry this .22.
We lived like fugitives then.

45
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,005
Ralph, Ralph, Ralph.

46
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,845
Fugitives are scared,
you know?

47
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,163
Fugitives are on the run.

48
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,847
Can you give me more of that?
You know, fear?

49
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,411
Great idea.

50
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,003
We lived like
fugitives then.

51
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,891
I never knew if he was going to
come out from behind a bush,

52
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,689
or a car,
and just start shooting.

53
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,083
The man was crazy!
He was capable of anything!

54
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,090
Christ,
what a nightmare.

55
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,169
He'd call me at
the hospital and say:

56
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,206
"Son of a bitch,
your clays are numbered!"

57
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,488
Too much?
It's a little bit too much.

58
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,040
I can tell, because you...
I just want to
give you a range.

59
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,205
Call 911!

60
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,851
Is he breathing?

61
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,122
Is blood coming
out of his ear?

62
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,361
Where are you going?

63
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,680
Did someone call 911?

64
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,961
Do not move him!
Wait for an ambulance!

65
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,043
Well, that's
a fucking lawsuit.

66
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,282
Where are you going?
The understudy'll be here.

67
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,727
Forget the understudy.
Cancel the first preview.

68
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,883
But it's a full house!
We'd have to refund...

69
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,371
Just do it.

70
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,201
How's Ralph?
He'll be fine.

71
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,130
Wait. Will you fucking wait?

72
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,050
Jake, it would
have been a disaster.

73
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,760
That guy's the worst actor
I've ever seen.

74
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,042
Bleeding's the most honest
thing he's done so far.

75
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,322
He's not that bad!

76
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,404
Okay, he's fucking terrible.

77
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,883
You have the press in your
dressing room in a few hours.

78
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,280
I'll make something up.
I'll think of something, riff.

79
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,446
Hold on.

80
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,242
That wasn't an accident.

81
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,321
What do you mean?

82
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,244
I made it happen.

83
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,925
Oh, okay.

84
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,571
Are you drunk?

85
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,083
Just find me an actor... a good actor.
Woody Harrelson!

86
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,925
<i>He's</i> doing
<i>the next Hunger Games.</i>

87
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,321
Um, Michael Fassbender.

88
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,409
He's doing the prequel
to the X-Men prequel.

89
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,682
How about, uh, Jeremy Renner?
Who?

90
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,925
Jeremy Renner!
He was nominated.
The Hurt Locker guy.

91
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,605
He's an Avenger.

92
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,686
Fuck! They put him in a cape, too?
I don't care.

93
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,445
Just find me someone.

94
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,287
Ralph will sue us. He will
sue us and he has a case.

95
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,611
Just make it go away.

96
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,602
Look, you're my attorney. You're my
producer. You're my best friend.

97
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,202
Now go out there and do
what you were born to do.

98
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,647
How do you suppose I do that?
How...

99
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,282
<i>Next, an exclusive
interview with Robert Downey, Jr...</i>

We gave <i>it</i> away.

107

<i>You listening to me?</i>

Breathing in,

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,002
Yeah, embrace it.

113
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,369
<i>But I'm not going away.
You know I'm right.</i>

114
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,044
<i>Look at that.</i>

115
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,882
<i>These people don't know
what you're capable of.</i>

116
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,646
Why would
somebody go from playing

117
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,041
the lead in
a comic book franchise...

118
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,564
...to adapting Raymond Carver
for the stage?

119
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,084
As you're probably aware,
Barthes said:

120
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,803
"The cultural work done in the
past by gods and epic sagas...

121
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,721
"...is now being done by laundry
detergent commercials...

122
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,401
"...and comic
strip characters."

123
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,843
This is a big leap
you've taken.

124
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,084
Yeah, it is.
Absolutely. Absolutely.

125
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,402
Like you said...

126
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,650
...that, uh,
Barthes said, uh...

127
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,241
Birdman, like lcarus...

128
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,046
Okay, hang on.
Who is this Barthes guy?

129
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,451
Which Birdman was he in?

130
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,411
Uh, Roland Barthes
was a French philosopher,

131
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,687
and if you knew anything
about the history of...

132
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,925
Now is it true you've been injecting
yourself with semen from baby pigs?

133
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,761
I'm sorry, what? As a method
of facial rejuvenation?

134
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,201
Where did you read that?

135
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,444
It was tweeted by
@prostatewhispers.

136
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,921
That's not true.

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,047
I know,
but did you do it?

138
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,281
No, I didn't do it.

139
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,720
Okay, I'll write
you're denying it.

140
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,123
Don't write anything.
Why would you write anything?

141
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,967
Don't write what she said.
I didn't put any baby pig...

142
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,966
Are you at all afraid that
people will say you're doing this play...

143
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,124
...to battle the impression
you're a washed-up superhero?

144
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,408
No, absolutely not.
That's why...

145
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,486
...twenty years ago,
I said no to Birdman 4.

146
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,485
<i>Birdman 4?
You do Birdman 4?!</i>

147
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,167
Thank you for coming out.
Thank you.

148
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,163
We're expecting
some great pieces.

149
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,643
The guys in publicity...

150
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,162
...want a Times feature,

151
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,811
which is the worst
idea right now.

152
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,561
What are you doing?

153
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,766
I don't want to look
at this anymore.

154
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,490
That was a present
from the crew.

155
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,040
Don't fuck with them...
they're union.

156
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,685
I don't care.

157
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,402
How'd it go?
Good.

158
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,364
They talk about Ralph?
He did it.

159
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,851
The motherfucker did it.

160
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,082
Threatened to sue us.

161
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,845
What'd you say?
Me?

162
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,606
I said, "Motherfucker,
are you threatening me?

163
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,762
"If I so much as get
a letter from a lawyer...

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,685
"...the press is getting
pictures off your computer."

165
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,081
What pictures?

166
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,364
He has a thing
for nuns in diapers.

167
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,526
Why do you care? Point
is, I made it go away.

168
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,205
That's great.

169
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,886
Yeah, it's fantastic,
except for one thing.

170
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,770
We have no actor.
Uh-huh.

171
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,201
And if we cancel the preview,
the press will smell blood.

172
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,727
We can't afford to
lose any more money.

173
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,291
What do you think
I should do?

174
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,885
We hired an understudy.

175
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,200
Use him.
No.

176
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,569
Riggan, listen to me. Please,
for the love of God, listen.

177
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,326
Our perfect dream actor is not going
to knock on that door and go,

178
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,562
"Hey, fellas,
when do I start?"

179
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,403
Can I talk to you?
What's up?

180
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,722
You find another actor?
No.

181
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,970
Mike's available.
Mike who?

182
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,446
I thought he was
doing the thing...

183
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,249
He quit. Or got fired.

184
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,321
Mike who?

185
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,402
Which is it, quit or fired?
With Mike, it's usually both.

186
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,324
Mike fucking who?
Shiner.

187
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,891
Yes!
Jake.

188
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,924
How do you know
Mike Shiner?

189
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,240
We share a vagina.

190
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,640
You think he'd do it?
Mmm-hmm.

191
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,484
How do you know?
He told me.

192
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,131
Jake.
Yes.

193
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,089
Ask me if he sells tickets.

194
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,401
Does he sell tickets?

195
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,324
A shitload. Ask me if the
theater critics love him.

196
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,800
Do theater critics
love him?

197
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,247
They want to spooge on him.

198
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,409
Right on his face.
Everything for a reason.

199
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,921
You think he'd come in
this evening?

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,809
I'll call and find out.

201
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,485
I'll call his agent.

202
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,161
Amazing, amazing.

203
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,644
Annie? Clear the theater,
send everyone to dinner

204
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,643
and give me some lights!

205
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,201
We've got
a put-in tonight.

206
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,361
Who?

207
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,005
You'll find out.

208
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,844
Intimidating, isn't it?

209
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,890
You have any idea
the people who have

210
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,009
walked on these boards
before you?

211
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,160
Geraldine Page.
Helen Hayes.

212
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,491
Jason Robards. Marlon Brando.
And now Riggan Thomson.

213
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,804
Thanks for coming
in on such short notice, Mike.

214
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,491
This is what I do.

215
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,164
You wrote this adaptation?

216
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,561
I did, yeah.
Ah.

217
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,009
And you're directing and starring.
That's ambitious.

218
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,321
Well, thanks.

219
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,007
Well, it's a good theater.

220
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,167
I can't speak for your play, but...
let's do a little bit of it.

221
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,600
Oh, I didn't expect
you to just jump right in.

222
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,320
It's first preview tomorrow night.
Let's get to work.

223
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,406
Well, feel free to take the script
up until you feel comfortable.

224
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,160
No, let's just do some of it.

225
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,521
Uh...

226
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,931
Take a look at page 20.

227
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,685
I'm good. I don't need it.

228
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,126
I don't need the script.
Give me a cue.

229
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,361
What?

230
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,284
Feed me a line.

231
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,681
Feed me a line.

232
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,841
Okay.

233
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,362
Okay, uh, let me think.

234
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,524
I'm the wrong person to ask.
I didn't actually know him.

235
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,961
I only heard his name mentioned
in passing. Mmm-hmm.

236
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,644
You'd have to know
the particulars.

237
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,048
But I think what you're
saying is love is absolute.

238
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,282
- Is that what I'm saying?
- Am I saying love is absolute?

239
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,203
Yes. Okay, yeah!
The kind of love

240
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,884
I'm talking about is absolute.

241
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,886
The kind of love I'm talking about,
you don't try to kill people!

242
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,804
How do you know the lines?

243
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,045
It's a thing I have. I don't
know, it's a gift. Wow.

244
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,404
Come on. I've been helping
Lesley get off book for a month.

245
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,041
These lines are right here.
That makes sense.

246
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,970
That's good.
Give me my cue again.

247
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,720
I'm the wrong person to ask.
I didn't actually know him.

248
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,725
I only heard his name
mentioned in passing.

249
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,406
You never know the particulars.
I think what...

250
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,483
Can I make a suggestion?

251
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,244
Do you mind?
No, not at all.

252
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,087
No, no, forget that.
Just stay with me.

253
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,086
"I'm the wrong person to ask," he
says, but what's the intention?

254
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,243
Is he fed up
with the subject?

255
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,004
Deflecting guilt
over the marriage?

256
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,447
And here's the thing... you
have four lines after that

257
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,245
that all say the same thing.
"I didn't know him."

258
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,807
"I only heard his name
mentioned in passing."

259
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,086
"I wouldn't know."

260
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,765
"You'd have to know
the particulars."

261
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,002
"Particulars" sounds
like my grandmother.

262
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,921
The point is, you don't know the guy.
We fucking get it.

263
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,611
Make it work with one line.

264
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,762
"I didn't even know
the man." Right?

265
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,930
Wait... You know
my lines, too, huh?

266
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,442
Can we not get hung up
on knowing lines?

267
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,602
Can we just work on this?
Tear it apart?

268
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,127
So why don't you just give
me that same thing again,

269
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,362
but cut it down. Try it.
Uh...

270
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,965
I'm the wrong person to ask...

271
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,124
Oh, no! That's the thing...
"I'm the wrong person to ask."

272
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,201
I think it's, "Fuck you."

273
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,807
"Fuck you.
Don't put me on the spot."

274
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,805
"Don't make me feel
self-conscious about my marriage

275
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,882
"while my wife is sitting..."

276
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,804
Right there.
"...right there."

277
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,487
Can I sit down for this?
Yeah, sit. Good idea.

278
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,327
So just give it to me as a
"Fuck you." Lay it on me.

279
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,971
Just do it. Give it to me.

280
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,561
Well, I'm thinking. Fuck me hard.
Just give it.

281
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,801
Come on!
Just do it!

282
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,088
Hey, I'm the wrong
person to ask!

283
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,083
I don't even know him.
What's your point?!

284
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,288
What's my point?
Yeah, what are you saying?

285
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,486
Spit it out!
on! on!

286
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,803
You're saying what? You're
saying love is absolute.

287
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,570
Yes! Yes!

288
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,769
The kind of love that I'm
talking about, it is absolute!

289
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,570
The kind of
love that I'm talking about,

290
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,846
you don't...

291
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,321
...you don't try
to kill people.

292
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,171
Yeah. Good.

293
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,080
I don't know...
what do you think, boss?

294
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,691
You want to do
this with me?

295
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,525
What do you think?

296
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,445
Everybody's back. Larry needs
to see him for a fitting.

297
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,286
I'll take that as a yes.

298
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,365
So, who are you?

299
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,921
That's Sam, my daughter. Oh.

300
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,691
Wow! That's amazing. You don't
look anything like each other.

301
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,046
What do you do?

302
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,522
Um... She's my assistant.
Works with me.

303
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,525
And does she talk
and speak?

304
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,291
She does. Yeah.

305
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,887
She can even sit or stay or roll
over, if you have any treats.

306
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,725
Welcome aboard, Mike!

307
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,040
Thank you, Captain.

308
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,731
Um, I'm Mike... Shiner.

309
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,291
Oh, I know who you are.

310
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,928
I, uh, saw you in Hothouse
at the Geffen.

311
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,047
You were great.

312
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,771
Oh, thank you.
Your ass is great.

313
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,721
Dude. Seriously?

314
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,165
That was just me...

315
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,402
Larry? Larry?

316
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,120
This is the theater,
sweetheart.

317
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,400
Don't be so self-conscious.

318
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,721
He's here.

319
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,241
Thank the Lord
and pass the biscuits.

320
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,321
I finally have
an actor to dress.

321
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,607
How are you, Larry?

322
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,921
Better now you're here.
Take off your clothes.

323
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,331
You're just going
to stand there?

324
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,086
This is the theater, honey.
Don't be so self-conscious.

325
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,325
We have to start from scratch
with less than 24 hours.

326
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,931
Here. Try these...

327
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,607
Holy shi...!
Where are your underpants?

328
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,002
Under the bed
at home, I think.

329
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,161
Uh...

330
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,923
No. Okay, okay.
Everything's too small.

331
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,611
You're not kidding.
Oh.

332
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,490
Whoa. That's nice.

333
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,927
Forgive him, Larry. Mike's
like my 5-year-old son.

334
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,600
Neither of them
has clean underwear.

335
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,127
Or pubic hair, I imagine.

336
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,680
I can alter the suit,

337
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,081
but we're going to have to
make new trousers and shirts.

338
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,446
And underwear.

339
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,443
What are you doing?
Waiting on Larry.

340
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,806
I'm finished!

341
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,361
Then I'm just standing here
with my cock out.

342
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,601
Well, get dressed.

343
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,291
Riggan's daughter
is hanging around...
she might walk in here.

344
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,766
You haven't seen her.

345
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,640
She's always around,
watching everyone,
like Little Miss Creepy.

346
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,486
I don't know if drugs
fried her brain or what...

347
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,882
...but I don't want
her running to her father

348
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,200
saying you
showed her your junk.

349
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,328
Then we should
ask her to leave.

350
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,810
Oh, God. Really?
Mmm-hmm.

351
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,484
- Sammy?
- It's Sam.

352
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,722
Sam... Lesley.

353
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,651
Listen, um, what I said...

354
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,884
Oh, don't worry about it.
He's a handful, huh?

355
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,403
How do you always manage to
find a new way to humiliate me?

356
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,563
Oh, to be fair,
you make it really easy.

357
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,171
What was she doing here?

358
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,084
She brought me down.
And stayed?

359
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,641
Well, she is a little...
something.

360
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,844
This is Broadway.
And I'm here, finally.

361
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,481
Now, please, do me a favor,
I'm begging you...

362
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,761
don't fuck it up!

363
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,241
Lesley.

364
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,729
Come here.
Come here.

365
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,443
Play with my balls.

366
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,087
Don't do it. Ow!

367
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,441
Just sign it.

368
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,800
Listen...
No, you listen to me!

369
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,921
I can't afford
to listen to you.

370
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,440
I have to go
shopping again.

371
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,766
Just sew something,
you old fuck!

372
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,365
Give him
whatever he wants!

373
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,680
It's four times what
we paid what's-his-name!

374
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,251
Go into the reserve.

375
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,766
It's gone! We spent it
on fog and fake trees...

376
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,041
It's a dream sequence.

377
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,645
...and dancing midgets!

378
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,131
You can't say
"midget" anymore.

379
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,691
The reserve is gone!

380
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,282
You didn't see
what I just saw.

381
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,722
I'm telling you,
this guy's the real deal.

382
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,961
I can feel it.

383
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,889
He's the actor
we've been waiting for.

384
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,928
Come on. Just get
the contract done.

385
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,480
Please, Jake.
I'll get the money.

386
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,970
Okay, I'll do it.

387
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,202
Stop smiling.
You're freaking me out.

388
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,811
Sorry. You're right.

389
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,050
Is it true? Shiner?

390
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,560
Holy shit.
When can I meet him?

391
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,801
He's with Larry now.

392
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,923
I'm going to Starbucks.
Want anything?

393
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,087
I'm good.

394
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,800
She has a great ass.
I have news for you, too.

395
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,162
Is it good or bad?
'Cause I really...

396
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,402
I missed my last two periods.

397
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,163
I think
it's really happening.

398
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,006
Wow.

399
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,243
Is that good or bad?
Riggan!

400
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,163
It's good. It's great.

401
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,323
Say something else.
Um...

402
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,001
Uh...

403
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,764
You sure it's mine?

404
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,685
Well, you know,
there's you,

405
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,683
there's Jake, the masseur
wore a condom...

406
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,843
...yeah, I'm pretty sure
it's yours.

407
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,366
Idiot.

408
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,207
Are you excited?
Yeah.

409
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,531
Me, too.

410
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,523
You're not funny!

411
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,887
What? Hey, what?

412
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,407
First preview tomorrow.

413
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,884
Here we go.

414
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,244
I rode with him in the
ambulance to the hospital.

415
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,324
I will never get
that image out of my head.

416
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,406
Right before he did it, his
eyes were so sad and lonely.

417
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,324
Did you have
to treat him?

418
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,004
I didn't have to,
but I did.

419
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,562
Music out.
Cue 34, 35 ready.

420
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,251
He was
in terrible shape.

421
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,766
His head swelled to twice
the size of a normal head.

422
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,082
He's good, huh?
He's incredible.

423
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,243
I think
he's drinking real gin.

424
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,601
What?

425
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,605
Ask Nick. I want you to ask
Nick if he thinks that's love.

426
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,525
Oh, honey,
can't we just go to dinner?

427
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,603
Mel,
don't get him started.

428
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,002
You don't know
how he's been lately.

429
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,162
He's been depressed.
I've been worried.

430
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,771
You've been what?

431
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,130
Let me tell you guys something about
real love. I'll tell you something.

432
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,602
We all should be ashamed

433
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,603
when we talk like we know
what we're talking about...

434
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,364
...when we talk about love.

435
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,602
Oh, for God's sake,
are you getting drunk?

436
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,520
I don't have to be drunk
to say what I think.

437
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,126
We're not drunk. We're having
a few drinks. Exactly.

438
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,930
You've had more than a few.

439
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,047
What, are you counting?

440
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,124
Leave her alone. If you're not
drunk, don't talk like you are.

441
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,725
Shut up!

442
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,521
Do me a favor.
For once in your life,

443
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,648
honest to God,
shut up for a minute.

444
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,645
Anyway, like I was saying...

445
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,805
...you want to know about real
love, there's this old couple...

446
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,327
...had a car wreck,
out on the interstate.

447
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,644
Some drunk kid plowed
his old man's pickup...

448
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,004
...right into their camper.

449
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,960
By the time I got down
to the hospital, this kid,

450
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,486
this fucking teenager,
was dead.

451
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,166
So we took the old couple
up to the O.R.

452
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,324
We worked like hell on them
through most of the night.

453
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,005
By the time we were done with
them, we just, you know...

454
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,688
...wrapped them
in full body casts.

455
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,001
The husband,
the old man...

456
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,527
...was depressed
for the longest time.

457
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,285
Even after I said to him,

458
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,762
"Your wife's going to pull
through", he was still depressed.

459
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,524
So, I went up to the mouth
hole and I asked him.

460
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,364
And he told me it was because
he couldn't see her...

461
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,203
...through the eyes.
Couldn't see his wife.

462
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,884
Can you imagine?

463
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,841
I'm telling you, this guy's
heart was breaking because...

464
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,967
Ugh...

465
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,123
...he couldn't turn
his goddamn head

466
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,725
and just look at
his goddamn wife.

467
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,405
Shit.

468
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,405
I mean,
it was killing this guy.

469
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,324
I am so tired of this.
Is this water?

470
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,880
It was killing him.

471
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,045
Did you replace
my gin with water, man?

472
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,326
Oh!

473
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,760
Mike, come on.

474
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,405
"Come on," what?
You're drunk.

475
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,087
Yes, I'm drunk. I'm supposed to be drunk!
Why aren't you drunk?

476
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,367
This is Carver!

477
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,120
He left a piece of his liver on the
table each time he wrote a page!

478
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,642
If I need to be drinking gin, who
the fuck are you to touch my gin?

479
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,604
You fucked with the period,

480
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,800
you fucked with the plot
so you'd get the best lines.

481
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,320
Leave me the fucking tools that I need!

482
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,762
Oh, come on, people,
don't be so pathetic.

483
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,446
Stop viewing the world through
your cell phone screen!

484
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,607
Have a real experience!

485
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,764
Does anybody give a shit about
the truth other than me?

486
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,367
This set is fake,
the bananas are fake.

487
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,011
There's nothing in
this milk carton!

488
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,761
Your performance is fake.

489
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,083
The only thing that's real on
this stage is this chicken.

490
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,681
So I'm going to work
with the chicken.

491
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,451
That was interesting.

492
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,761
Bring the curtain down.

493
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,610
That's good bird, man!

494
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,965
Get him out of here!

495
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,884
How do you
want me to do that?

496
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,441
Hey, wait.

497
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,449
I want him gone.
No!

498
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,131
We cannot do that!

499
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,531
Of course we can!
It's our show!

500
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,451
Listen to me.
No, you listen to me.

501
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,563
Get him the fuck
out of my play.

502
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,041
It was a preview!
Nobody gives a shit!

503
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,884
Nothing matters until
that old bat from

504
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,962
the New York Times
comes opening night!

505
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,201
We're getting rid of him.

506
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,962
Shut up! Shut up and
listen to me for once!

507
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,802
As soon as we announced he was
taking over, the advance doubled.

508
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,247
We can't afford to
lose any more money

509
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,970
and we can't
afford to lose Mike.

510
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,566
This is about being respected
and validated, remember?

511
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,801
That's what you told me!

512
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,481
That's how you got
me into this shit!

513
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,844
Now, you're the director.
Get him under control.

514
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,001
Fuck.

515
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,482
This isn't the '90s anymore.

516
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,844
Your zipper's down.

517
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,001
Fuck.

518
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,685
You were
really good, cabrón.

519
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,691
Mmm-hmm.

520
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,169
Out in front of the theater
in ten minutes!

521
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,810
Don't overthink it.

522
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,045
What the hell
was going on up there?

523
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,484
I didn't know you
were here tonight.

524
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,882
That guy's an asshole, huh?

525
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,891
What are you doing here?

526
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,044
Sam and I are going to grab a
bite after she's finished.

527
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,970
No, I mean here. Now.

528
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,244
Well, I know how much
this means to you.

529
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,487
Oh.

530
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,881
Thanks. I appreciate that.

531
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,890
So what's happening?

532
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,446
With the play?
You saw what.

533
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,806
No. You and Sam.

534
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,565
Oh, you know, it's great.

535
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,561
It's the same.

536
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,046
Do you talk to her?

537
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,202
Yeah, we talk.

538
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,484
It's just been so crazy
around here, you know?

539
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,364
You understand
where her head is at.

540
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,601
Of course.

541
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,002
She's trying to stay away
from everything and everyone

542
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,845
that got her into rehab
in the first place.

543
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,447
I know. I really do.
I get it.

544
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,523
That's all she's had,
so she's confused.

545
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,840
Yeah, I get it.

546
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,447
I know you're caught up
in all this stuff, but...

547
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,760
"Stuff"?
Uh...

548
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,770
You know what I mean.

549
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,567
Riggan, you don't have to be
a great father right now.

550
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,608
You just have to be one.

551
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,445
Oh, sorry.

552
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,610
How's that going?

553
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,885
I'd rather not talk about it.

554
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,451
You're drinking?

555
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,450
Yeah, I'm having a beer.

556
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,441
So...

557
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,805
...what's going on with you?

558
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,645
Me? Oh...

559
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,971
Nothing.

560
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,121
Everything's the same,
I guess.

561
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,724
I'm going back
to teaching.

562
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,961
Oh, yeah?

563
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,644
I'm thinking of refinancing
the Malibu house.

564
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,571
What? I'm sorry.

565
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm thinking of refinancing...

566
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,323
No, I heard you.
I just need a second.

567
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,482
That's going to
be Sam's house.

568
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,610
Why Would you...?
For this play?

569
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,650
I need the money.

570
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,844
Do you have any idea
how crazy that sounds?

571
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,006
What do you want me to say? My
health lasted longer than the money.

572
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,320
Go figure that out.

573
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,170
What's going on?

574
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,527
Riggan, look at me.

575
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,121
Uh...

576
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,001
I got a chance to
do something right.

577
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,011
I got to take it.
I got to.

578
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,206
It's funny. I was sitting
here, waiting for you...

579
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,967
...and all of a sudden, I couldn't
remember why we broke up.

580
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,045
You know, the last time
I flew here from L.A...

581
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,202
...George Clooney was sitting
two seats in front of me...

582
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,729
...with a nice pair of cufflinks
and that fucking chin.

583
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,409
We ended up flying through
this really, really horrible storm.

584
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,326
I mean, the plane was
rattling and shaking.

585
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,408
And all the people
on board are, you know, crying.

586
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,405
I mean, crying.
Praying, right?

587
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,404
I just sat there.

588
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,721
They're crying,
I sit there.

589
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,560
And I'm thinking,
"Oh, boy...

590
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,083
"...the next morning, when
Sam looks at the paper...

591
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,246
"...it's going to be Clooney's
face on the front page, not mine."

592
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,561
You know? Boom.

593
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,728
Did you know
Farrah Fawcett died

594
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,610
the exact same day
as Michael Jackson?

595
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,444
Is that crazy?

596
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,770
Why did we break up?

597
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,520
Because you threw
a kitchen knife at me...

598
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,969
...and an hour later, were telling
me how much you loved me.

599
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,366
Just because I didn't like that ridiculous
comedy you did with Goldie Hawn...

600
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,443
...did not mean
I did not love you.

601
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,849
That's what you always do...

602
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,366
you confuse love
for admiration.

603
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,689
It's your house...
do what you want with it.

604
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,569
Just be there
for our daughter.

605
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,131
I will.

606
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,962
You're not Farrah Fawcett,
Riggan.

607
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,961
<i>We should have done that
reality show... The Thomsons.</i>

608
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,161
Shut up.

609
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,571
<i>That would've been good.
Shut up!</i>

610
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,010
<i>Crazy, druggy, wise-ass daughter,
MILF-y wife with perky tits.</i>

611
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,322
<i>People would've
wanted to see that.</i>

612
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,562
<i>Shut up.
More than this piece of shit.</i>

613
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,847
Shut up!

614
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,410
The sun bed is here.

615
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,481
What does that mean?

616
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,845
It means there's a sun bed out
there being delivered to in here.

617
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,241
Who ordered a sun bed?

618
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,050
Mike. He said it's
for his character...

619
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,088
part of his process
and that shit.

620
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,522
He said he has
to be a redneck.

621
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,444
Son of a bitch.

622
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,851
Let's go. Walk.

623
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,082
Where are we going?
To get you coffee.

624
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,681
Did I do something to disrespect you?
Not yet.

625
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,685
I have a lot riding on this play.
Oh, is that right?

626
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,048
Yeah. People know
who I am, and...

627
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,601
Bullshit. They don't
know you, your work.

628
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,171
They know the guy
from the bird suit

629
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,971
who tells coy, slightly
vomitous stories on Letterman.

630
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,611
Well, I'm sorry
if I'm popular.

631
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,723
Popular?
I don't give a shit.

632
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,443
Popularity is the slutty little
cousin of prestige, my friend.

633
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,121
Okay, I don't even know what
the fuck that means. Mmm.

634
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,724
It means, my reputation is riding
on this, and that's worth a, a...

635
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,044
A lot. A lot, exactly!
Fuck you. Yes!

636
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,805
If this doesn't
work out for you,

637
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,644
you fuck off back to
your studio pals...

638
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,884
...and dive back into that cultural
genocide you guys perpetrate.

639
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,770
A douchebag's
born every minute!

640
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,491
That was P.T. Barnum's premise
when he invented the circus...

641
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,725
...and nothing has changed. You guys
know if you crank out toxic crap...

642
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,928
...people will line up
and pay to see it!

643
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,811
But long after you're gone,
I'll be on that stage...

644
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,809
...earning my living,
baring my soul,

645
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,400
wrestling with complex emotions,
'cause that's what we do.

646
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,405
Oh, so that's what
tonight was about?

647
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,840
You wrestling
with complex emotion?

648
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,482
Tonight was about seeing if it's
even alive, if it can bleed.

649
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,924
This isn't a backlot, Riggan, this is New
York City. This is how we do things.

650
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,525
Where are you going?

651
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,763
They have coffee here.

652
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,604
Thanks, Tommy.

653
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,205
They were laughing at us.

654
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,920
Tonight they were laughing,
tomorrow they'll be tweeting.

655
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,451
Who cares?

656
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,523
These are people
who pay half price

657
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,841
to watch us rehearse.
Stop caring.

658
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,281
This play's a drama.
It's about...

659
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,400
You don't know what the play's about.
I do know.

660
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,205
No, you don't. That's
what previews are for.

661
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,885
That's why they
call them previews.

662
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,442
That's where you figure out
what the play is.

663
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,291
Okay, look, look.
Listen to me.

664
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,006
You see the woman at
the end of the bar?

665
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,280
The one who looks like she
licked a homeless man's ass?

666
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,447
Yeah.

667
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,046
All that matters is what she writes
about us in 500 words in the Times.

668
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,487
That's, uh...
Tabitha Dickinson, yes.

669
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,327
The only opinion that matters
in New York theater is hers.

670
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,326
If she likes us, we run.
If she doesn't, we're fucked.

671
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,927
She does look like she
licked a homeless guy's ass.

672
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,525
Do me a favor.

673
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,649
Don't get your panties in a twist
over a preview, like some rookie...

674
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,404
...and don't tell me
how to do my job.

675
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,405
This is my town
and to be honest,

676
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,040
people don't give
a shit about you here.

677
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,606
- You're Riggan Thomson, right?
- Sorry to interrupt.

678
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,525
Would you mind having a
picture with us here?

679
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,525
Would you mind?

680
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,330
The button's on the bottom.

681
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,366
Who is this guy?
He used to be Birdman.

682
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,525
Oh, you're such a doll. Thank you.
You're so sweet.

683
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,490
Handsome.
Oh.

684
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,364
Okay, sweetheart,
come on.

685
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,691
Are we good here?

686
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,045
I'm going to go home.

687
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,883
All right.
See you tomorrow.

688
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,325
Oh...

689
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,724
I want to know something.

690
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,370
Why Raymond Carver?

691
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,884
I was a kid,
in high school...

692
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,727
...doing a play in Syracuse,
and he was in the audience.

693
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,408
And he
sent this back afterwards.

694
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,561
A little note.

695
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,087
"Thank you for an honest performance.
Ray Carver."

696
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,721
That's when I knew
I was going to be an actor.

697
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,921
Right there.

698
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,166
Oh.

699
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,765
What's so funny?

700
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,002
It's just on
a cocktail napkin.

701
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,401
So?

702
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,082
He was
fucking drunk, man.

703
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,243
You headed
to Hollywood, Mike?

704
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,761
No.

705
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,447
Hollywood's
heading here, Tabby.

706
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,603
Good luck with that.

707
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,522
"A man becomes a critic

708
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,931
"when he cannot
be an artist...

709
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,046
"...the same way a man becomes an
informer when he cannot be a soldier."

710
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,931
That's Flaubert, right?

711
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,443
He's a Hollywood clown
in a Lycra bird suit.

712
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,410
Yes, he is.

713
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,766
But tomorrow night
at 8:00...

714
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,805
...he's going out on that
stage and risking everything.

715
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,965
What will you be doing?

716
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,364
Don't you ever worry that
I'll give you a bad review?

717
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,450
I'm sure you will...

718
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,121
...if I ever give you
a bad performance.

719
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,811
Miss Dickinson.

720
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,804
Mr. Shiner.

721
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,210
What are you
still doing here?

722
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,646
Nothing.

723
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,201
Um, your costumes are hanging
in your dressing room.

724
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,891
Oh, great. Great.

725
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,566
Oh, I got that coconut water
you wanted.

726
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,087
If you want the face stuff,
it's not open till tomorrow.

727
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,207
What?

728
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,640
Uh...

729
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,724
I'm not sure that
I said thank you.

730
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,161
For what?

731
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,405
Everything. You've been doing
a really good job, honestly.

732
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,803
I've been so preoccupied
with all the...

733
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,087
Okay, well,
I just wanted to say that.

734
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,765
What is that?

735
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,091
That smell.

736
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,922
What is it?
Look at me. Look at me!

737
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,161
<i>What?
What?</i>

738
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,768
You've got to be shitting me.
Where is it?

739
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,762
Can we not
do this, please?

740
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,241
Dad?

741
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,285
Where is it?
I can't believe this.

742
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,811
Ugh.

743
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,691
What is this?

744
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,125
Chunky peanut butter.

745
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,127
This. This. What is that? Ah.

746
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,602
That's pot. Relax.

747
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,440
"Relax." You can't do this to me.
To you?

748
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,364
You know what
I'm talking about.

749
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,284
Oh, yeah, you!
What else is new?

750
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,640
Don't do that thing where you...
Make it about me? Never!

751
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,364
I'm trying to do
something important!

752
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,726
This is not important!

753
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,131
It's important to me!

754
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,046
Maybe not to you
or your cynical friends

755
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,441
whose only ambition
is to "go viral"...

756
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,805
...but to me...
God, this is my career!

757
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,960
It's my chance to finally do
work that means something.

758
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,202
That means
something to who?

759
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,484
You had a career, Dad, before
the third comic book movie.

760
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,963
Before people started to forget
who was inside that bird costume.

761
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,801
You are doing a play based on a
book written 60 years ago...

762
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,242
...for a thousand
rich old white people...

763
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,642
...whose only concern is where to
have cake and coffee afterwards!

764
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,401
Nobody gives
a shit but you!

765
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,007
And, let's face it, Dad...

766
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,890
...you are not doing this
for the sake of art,

767
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,566
you're doing it to
feel relevant again.

768
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,411
Well, guess what? There's
an entire world of people

769
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,403
who fight to be relevant
every single day!

770
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,523
And you act like
it doesn't exist.

771
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,081
Things that are happening
in a place you ignore...

772
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,529
...that has already
forgotten about you!

773
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,286
I mean,
who the fuck are you?!

774
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,522
You hate bloggers,
you mock Twitter.

775
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,842
You don't even
have a Facebook page!

776
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,604
It's you who doesn't exist!

777
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,002
You're doing this
because you're terrified,

778
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,202
like the rest of us,
that you don't matter.

779
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,284
And you know what?
You're right! You don't!

780
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,889
It's not important, okay?
You're not important...
get used to it!

781
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,881
Dad.

782
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,125
In the clays before Nick's
depression started to eat away at him...

783
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,725
...he never knew
I was pregnant,

784
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,121
and I never
intended to tell him.

785
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,689
I guess we make
choices in life,

786
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,127
and we choose to
live with them.

787
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,485
Or not.

788
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,289
I didn't want that baby.

789
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,724
Not because
I didn't love Nick,

790
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,121
and not because I didn't
love the idea of it...

791
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,803
...but just because I wasn't
ready to love myself.

792
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,323
There's a distance
to it all now.

793
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,008
A wistful distance, underscored
by a gentle breeze...

794
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,440
Actors in position.

795
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,641
...and the sound
of birds...

796
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,967
Music out.

797
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,088
...laughing at
the whimsy of it all.

798
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,164
Lesley?
What?

799
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,084
I think I'm hard.

800
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,767
No, it's just sometimes you don't
consider other people's feelings.

801
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,401
No, no. I'm getting
hard... feel that.

802
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,847
What?!
You've got to be kidding.

803
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,280
Let's really do it.
Let's fuck.

804
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,401
No, are you crazy?!

805
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,330
It'll be incredible!
It'll be real.

806
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,921
Cut it out!
I'm serious, Mike.

807
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,527
Don't call me Mike.
Call me Mel.

808
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,171
Get off!

809
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,522
Terri! Terri!

810
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,524
Terri, I know
you're in there!

811
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,842
Get off me! Get off!

812
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,771
- Ed?
- Why?

813
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,042
What are you doing here?
Just tell me why.

814
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,362
Take it easy, okay? I know this is hard.

815
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,443
Shut up! Shut...

816
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,362
Shut up! Just don't
do anything stupid.

817
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,205
Eddie, please!

818
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,363
What's the matter with me? Why do I
always have to beg people to love me?

819
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,882
Eddie, please,
give me the gun.

820
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,565
Look at me.

821
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,043
I was drowning.
I'm just not capable of...

822
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,045
You deserve to be loved,
Eddie. You do.

823
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,562
I just wanted to
be what you wanted.

824
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,644
Now I spend every
fucking minute praying

825
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,246
to be somebody else.
Somebody I'm not!

826
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,721
Anybody-

827
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,563
Just put the gun down, Ed.
She doesn't love you anymore.

828
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,571
You don't, do you?

829
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,086
No.

830
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,251
And you never will.

831
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,244
I'm sorry.

832
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,243
I don't exist.

833
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,085
I'm not even here.

834
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,610
None of this even matters.
I don't exist. I don't exist.

835
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,242
Ed...
I don't exist.

836
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,762
Ed! Eddie, Eddie, don't do that!

837
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,770
You're such an asshole!

838
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,680
What?
That's the best you've been.

839
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,286
Why would you do that?!
We were onstage!

840
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,205
What the fuck?! It's like
my head was a jar of Bolognese!

841
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,124
I'll fix the blood rig.

842
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,283
...They're fucking
in a motel room.

843
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,045
You can't get it up
in six months

844
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,804
and now you want to fuck me
in front of 800 strangers?!

845
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,123
I need it to feel real, okay?
I need that intensity.

846
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,442
Oh, fuck you!
Oh.

847
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,041
I was in the moment.
I thought you were, too.

848
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,485
I'm sorry.

849
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,644
I told you to stop,
you fucking animal.

850
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,210
You were brilliant.

851
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,482
What is wrong with you?!

852
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,847
I want your shit
out of the apartment.

853
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,006
What? Hey, no, wait.
Look, look, I'm sorry.
Can we just...

854
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,847
No, we can't, Mike!
Maybe up here,
you're Mr. Truth...

855
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,925
...but in the real world,
where it counts,
you're a fucking fraud!

856
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,162
How's that for truth,
you dick?!

857
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,362
What's wrong?
He's an asshole.

858
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,487
What'd he do now?

859
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,768
Oh, nothing, just try to fuck
me in front of the audience!

860
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,205
Oh, my God!
Right?

861
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,771
That's kind of hot!

862
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,044
Why don't I have
any self-respect?!

863
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,362
You're an actress, honey.

864
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,364
I'm pathetic!

865
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,885
Look at me.

866
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,569
You know, I've always dreamed
of being a Broadway actress...

867
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,363
...since I was a little kid.
And now I'm here, and I'm...

868
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,688
...I'm not
a Broadway actress,

869
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,411
I'm still
just a little kid.

870
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,726
And I keep waiting for someone
to tell me I made it.

871
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,404
You made it.

872
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,571
I did?

873
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,166
Sadly, it was with Mike Shiner on a
fake motel bed in front of 800 people.

874
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,731
Shut up.
Oh.

875
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,160
Hey, is she okay?

876
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,765
She'll be fine.

877
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,242
Look, none of this
is your fault, okay?

878
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,402
You're beautiful
and you're talented...

879
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,442
...and I'm lucky
to have you.

880
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,521
Okay?

881
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,445
Okay.

882
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,602
That was kind of sweet.

883
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,121
Yeah.

884
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,691
What's wrong?

885
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,810
Nothing. Two years, and he's never
said anything like that to me.

886
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,805
You're beautiful
and you're talented...

887
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,647
...and I'm lucky
to have you. Okay?

888
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,485
We're gross.

889
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,051
We are.

890
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,642
What are you doing?
Nothing.

891
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,490
Do it again.

892
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,411
Can we discuss this
like two mature artists?

893
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,005
What is the big deal about...

894
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,685
Fuck you!

895
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,525
You're not ready yet.
That's fine.

896
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,841
<i>Hmm.</i>

897
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,003
Fuck. Actresses.

898
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,522
They drive me
fucking crazy.

899
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,046
Riggan?

900
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,205
Your gun is ridiculous. I can see
the red plug in the barrel...

901
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,286
...so you look like a kid with a
plastic toy when you point it at me.

902
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,524
I don't feel
threatened at all.

903
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,443
Get a better one.
Have some self-respect.

904
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,521
Please.

905
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,046
Hey, apart from that, uh...

906
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,040
...I thought it was
a pretty fun crowd, huh?

907
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,722
I don't think
it's high enough.

908
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,571
Me, neither.

909
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,925
What are you
doing up here?

910
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,410
Uh, adrenaline.

911
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,484
I just got out of rehab.
It's the closest thing
I get to a drug.

912
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,524
You went to rehab?

913
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,321
Cool.

914
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,048
It wasn't all
Dr. Drew or anything,

915
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,090
but that dude from
American <i>Pie</i> was there.

916
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,361
Jump!

917
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,931
Eat me!

918
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,442
Okay, then jump on my face!

919
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,123
I love this city.

920
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,921
Yeah?

921
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,049
Why do you act like
a click all the time?

922
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,963
Do you just do it
to antagonize people?

923
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,805
Maybe.

924
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,044
You really don't give a shit
if people like you or not.

925
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,611
Not really.

926
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,130
That's cool.

927
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,125
Is it? I don't know.

928
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,961
What?

929
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,566
Let's play a game.

930
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,642
A game? What are you, eight?
Mmm-hmm.

931
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,644
What are you, 78?

932
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,963
Truth or dare.
Oh, come on.

933
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,890
Truth or dare?
Oh.

934
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,321
Truth.

935
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,328
When we first met, you made
a comment about my ass.

936
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,490
Why did you do that?

937
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,325
You have a terrific ass,
and I noticed that.

938
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,842
And I just commented on it.

939
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,682
Truth or dare?
Dare.

940
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,684
Really?
Yeah.

941
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,608
There's a bald guy and he's
going to walk right under you.

942
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,011
Spit on his head.

943
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,010
No.
You said dare.

944
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,766
Truth.
No, it's too late.

945
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,645
Happy?
Yeah.

946
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,848
Ew!

947
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,045
Truth or dare?

948
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,203
Truth.
You're boring.

949
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,442
The truth is
always interesting.

950
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,531
Uh...

951
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,042
You want to fool
around with me?

952
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,201
No.

953
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,361
Really?

954
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,281
Why not?

955
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,564
That's a second question.
It's a second part.

956
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,722
I'd be afraid
I couldn't get it up.

957
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,042
That didn't seem to be a
problem for you onstage.

958
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,721
Nothing is a problem
for me onstage.

959
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,969
I want to ask
another question.

960
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,087
You already did.

961
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,402
One more.
Go ahead.

962
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,404
If you weren't afraid, what
would you want to do to me?

963
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,401
I'd pull your eyes
out of your head...

964
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,445
That's sweet.

965
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,444
...and put them
in my own skull...

966
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,811
...and look around,
so I could see the street

967
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,769
the way I used to
when I was your age.

968
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,360
Good night.

969
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,002
Don't kill
the messenger.

970
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,844
He's an asshole.

971

<i>He's playing you-</i>

974
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,446

an egg on Broadway."

978

Where's the rest of it?
There is no rest of it.

979

Don't worry... it'll be used to
scoop up dog shit tomorrow.

00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,170
How can you be so calm?

981
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,526
What are my other choices?

982
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,127
Aren't you scared at all?
About what?

983
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,044
About being
humiliated out there!

984
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,600
It won't be the first
time I've been humiliated.

985
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,290
Well, of course it won't.

986
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,565
You're an asshole.

987
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,166
And by the way,
I'm not pregnant,

988
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,641
so there's one thing
not to worry about.

989
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,049

<i>He's stealing your show.
He thinks you're a joke.</i>

agree with him.</i>

993

<i>Maybe you are, Riggan. Maybe
that's what you are-a joke.</i>

994
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,606
Whoa! What the hell
is going on?

995
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,445
Get up!
Ow! That hurts!

996
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,011
Get up!
Back away!

997
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,160
So Carver's the reason
you became an actor, huh?

998
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,123
Listen, this is
my fucking show.

999
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,603
I did the work, I raised the
money and I arrange the press!

1000
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,890
Oh, Jesus. They called
me for an interview.

1001
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,283
I told them the first thing
that came into my head.

1002
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,523
We got the cover
of the Arts section!

1003
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,443
Fuck the Arts section!

1004
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,484
You told them the first thing
that came into your head?

1005
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,891
Right.

1006
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,088
You're Mr. Natural.
Mr. Fuck-the-scene-

at-my-massive-hard-on.

1008
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,760
That's truth.

1009
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,881
You think
it looked massive?

1010
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,531
Shut the fuck up.

1011
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,807
You don't get hard on my
stage unless I tell you to.

1012
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,487
Your stage? Oh, let me
tell you something.

1013
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,884
This stage has belonged
to a lot of great actors,
but you are not one of them.

1014
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,804
So you wrote
your own lines, huh?
Ow!

1015
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,491
I did, actually.

1016
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,246
You wrote a few
changes and mumbled,
you self-absorbed prick.

1017
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,731
I'm self-absorbed'?
Look at you.

1018
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,245
You nobody piece of shit!

1019
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,643
Nobody? My massive hard-on
got 50,000 views on YouTube.

1020
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,571
A cat playing with a dildo
gets more than that.

1021
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,490
I don't care.
Yes, you do! You care.

1022
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,161
I'm a theater actor. I don't
give a shit. You care.

1023
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,765
Everybody says,
"Oh, Mike is so honest.

1024
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,571
"Mike is so motherfucking
truthful!"
Ow!

1025
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,891
You said in the interview your
father was a drunk like Carver.

1026
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,530
Is that true?

1027
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,762
No. No.
'Cause my father was.

1028
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,004
My father was a mean fucking drunk.
You understand?

1029
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,242
He beat the shit out of us.

1030
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,283
But at least when
he was beating us...

1031
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:14,206
...he wasn't thinking about
taking us out to his toolshed.

1032
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,523
Because when
he got us out there...

1033
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,524
...that bastard
would smile and say:

1034
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,240
"You want to get on your
knees and unbuckle my belt,

1035
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,527
"or do I take it off
and use it on you?"

1036
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,203
After a while, I made myself numb, so...
But my...

1037
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,045
My little sister...

1038
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,729
- Okay. Okay.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1039
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,210
Oh, God.

1040
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,885
Uh, I didn't know.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1041
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,363
That's fucking horrible, man.
I'm sorry.

1042
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,807
It's also not true. See,
I can pretend, too. Oh!

1043
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,565
Don't fuck with me, Mike.

1044
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,406
You're a little bit crazy. You
should start using that onstage.

01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,890
Oh, please,
just stay dead.

1096
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,531
We are not <i>dead.</i>

1097
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,041
Stop saying "well"
There is no "we!"

1098
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:50,081
I'm not fucking you! I'm
Riggan fucking Thomson!

1099
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,405
<i>No, you're Birdman.</i>

1100
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,084
<i>Because without me,
all that's left is you...</i>

1101
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,244
...a <i>sad, selfish,
mediocre actor...</i>

1102
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:05,246
<i>...grasping at the last
vestiges of his career.</i>

1103
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,321
<i>What the hell did you do that for?
I liked that poster.</i>

1104
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,445
<i>It's always "we," brother.</i>

1105
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,202
Fuck you!!!
Shut the fuck up!

1106
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,771
Leave me alone!!

1107
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:35,129
You're fucking, so fucking annoying!
Shut up!!

1108
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,805
Hey. What's up?

1109
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,411
Um, well...

1110
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,806
...one hour till curtain.
Why don't you rest a bit?

1111
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,691
Yeah, I'm going to lay down.

1112
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,280
Almost there, buddy. Last preview.
Okay. Cool.

1113
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,931
How you doing?
Good. Great.

1114
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,602
The money came through. I just need
to transfer it into the account.

1115
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,131
Good. That's terrific.

1116
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,642
So... I'll go, uh, do that.

1117
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,285
Thanks for stopping by.

1118
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,163
You know I'm proud
of you, don't you?

1119
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,324
This took balls.

1120
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,007
And you did it, okay?
I know.

1121
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,166
I think we should
cancel the preview.

1122
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,847
I'm tired, dude. I can't
do this anymore, Jake.

1123
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,171
I can't.

1124
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,444
That's a joke, right?

1125
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,320
You know, I don't think this is for me.
The whole...

1126
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,641
They're laughing at me.

1127
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:44,846
There is a three-block line
of people waiting for you.

1128
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,209
It's a full house.
We're sold out!

1129
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,843
Really?
Yes!

1130
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,123
And the French
ambassador's coming.

1131
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,204
The Prince of Saudi Arabia's
bringing one of his wives.

1132
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,206
And I didn't want to tell you
this, but Martin Scorsees...

1133
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,884
...is casting his new film, and...
Don't tell anybody.

1134
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,202
No, I won't.
Okay?

1135
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,166
Okay?

1136
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,528
Okay. Yeah, yeah,
I can be ready.
I can be ready.

1137
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,564
Good.
Thank you.

1138
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,011
How is he?

1139
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,286
He'll be fine.

1140
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,686
Poor creature.

1141
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,604
Is it true? Scorsese?

1142
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,684
Yeah.
And the new Pope, too.

1143
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,202
You're an asshole, Jake!

1144
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,207
I'm the one
keeping this afloat!

1145
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,645
Are you okay?

1146
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,086
Yeah. Yeah.

1147
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,811
I think I cut
my hand shaving.

1148
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,569
Well, I just
wanted to say... I'm sorry.

1149
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,041
What for?

1150
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,049
I knew what
Mike was capable of

1151
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,963
and I brought him
in anyway.

1152
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,561
No, no, no.
You did good.

1153
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,244
Are you kidding?
You did great.

1154
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,726
Tomorrow's my first opening
night on Broadway.

1155
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,605
Mine, too.

1156
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,086
And I just want to let you know
that, no matter what happens...

1157
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,924
...I'm really
grateful to you.

1158
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,003
Oh, no, no, no.
Me, too.

1159
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,764
This is exciting.

1160
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,764
We have a full house.
Jake just told me.

1161
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,603
Yeah, it's great.

1162
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,809
Oh, God.

1163
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,006
For fuck's sake,
just jump already.

1164
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,004
How'd you know
I'd be up here?

1165
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:26,685
Well, I didn't know,
but I kind of hoped maybe.

1166
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,365
Where is Lesley?

1167
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,684
Lesley?
Uh, Lesley's moving on.

1168
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,850
Smart girl.

1169
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,884
Oh, thank you. I appreciate that support.

1170
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,202
You ready for
your last preview?

1171
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,081
Sure, yeah.

1172
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,691
Who did that to you?

1173
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,202
Could have been
anybody, I guess.

1174
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,726
Yes.

1175
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,361
I'm sort of hoping
it was Lesley.

1176
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,043
It wasn't Lesley.

1177
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,891
Oh, my God.

1178
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,362
Are you fucking kidding me? No.

1179
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,050
Jesus Christ!

1180
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,202
I think maybe
I deserved it.

1181
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,571
Fuck.

1182
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,571
Fuck.

1183
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,564
Tell me something.

1184
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,402
What is the worst thing
that he did to you?

1185
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,561
Seriously.

1186
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,729
He was never around.

1187
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,767
Yeah? I mean, so what?
That was it?

1188
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,766
No. It was how he tried
to make up for it...

1189
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,965
...by constantly trying to
convince me that I was special.

1190
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,083
Okay. Look.

1191
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,285
Look at me.

1192
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,090
He was right, though.

1193
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,760
About what?

1194
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,609
About your being special.

1195
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,601
You've been hanging
around here...

1196
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,888
...trying to make
yourself invisible

1197
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,446
behind this fragile
little fuck-up routine...

1198
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,125
...but you can't.

1199
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,285
You're anything but invisible.
You're big.

1200
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,124
You're kind of
a great mess.

1201
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,808
It's like a candle burning at
both ends, but it's beautiful.

1202
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,806
No amount of booze or weed or
attitude is going to hide that.

1203
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:36,123
I'm glad you're an actor and not a
writer, 'cause that was, like...

1204
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:38,971
...Oprah...

1205
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,651
...Hallmark...

1206
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,891
...R. Kelly bad.

1207
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,491
Yeah, well, I wasn't...

1208
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,606
Mmm...

1209
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,161
Truth or dare?

1210
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,002
Truth.
No.

1211
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,682
Truth.
No.

1212
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,011
Truth or dare?

1213
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,727
Do you have any idea
where you're going?

1214
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,644
Absolutely not.

1215
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,564
How do you do it?

1216
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:02,891
Do what?

1217
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,565
Go out there
every single night

1218
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,040
and pretend to be somebody else
in front of all those people?

1219
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,244
I don't pretend out there.
I told you.

1220
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,928
I pretend just about every
place else, but not out there.

1221
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,206
That's a shame.

1222
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,764
What are we doing here?

1223
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,091
What do you mean?

1224
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,401
I mean, what are
we doing here?

1225
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,764
By the time we got to
the hospital, the kid was dead.

1226
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,926
So we took the old couple
up to the O.R.

1227
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,124
We worked like
hell on them...

1228
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,922
...through most of the night.

1229
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:55,608
The husband, the old man, was
depressed for the longest time.

1230
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,601
Even after I told him
the wife would pull through,
he was still depressed.

1231
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,602
So I went up to the mouth
hole and I asked him.

1232
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:10,445
And he told me it was because
he couldn't see her...

1233
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,280
...the wife,
through the eye holes.

1234
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,210
Can you imagine?

1235
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,806
I'm telling you, this guy's
heart was breaking...

1236
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:23,126
...because he couldn't turn his
goddamn head to see his goddamn wife.

1237
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:24,801
So...

1238
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:29,325
...I guess the question
we should ask ourselves is...

1239
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,801
...what do we talk about
when we talk about love?

1240
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,684
Mel and I had been
together five years...

1241
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,163
...and I don't know how many
times I've heard "I love you,"

1242
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,520
but it wasn't
until that night...

1243
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,966
The blood rig
should be good now.

1244
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,168
Be ready to go
in two minutes.

1245
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,330
That was amazing!

1246
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,090
Yeah, good, right?

1247
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,691
It's actually going well.

1248
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,206
Yeah.

1249
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,125
I think we need to talk.

1250
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,440
No, no.

1251
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,524
Yeah, I guess
you're right...

1252
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,081
...but we will eventually,
because that's the only way

1253
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,447
I'll get a chance
to say I'm sorry.

1254
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,689
I really am sorry.

1255
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,364
We'd have made great parents.

1256
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,965
Horrible.
We'd have been...

1257
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,280
...awful.
We'd have raised...

1258
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,887
...a serial killer. Or Justin Bieber.

1259
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,568
I really wanted
to be a mom.

1260
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,886
But my body doesn't
seem to agree.

1261
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,484
When I imagined
myself on Broadway,

1262
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,801
I never saw
the dancing reindeer.

1263
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,405
Nice touch.

1264
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,562
In the clays before Nick's
depression started to eat away at him...

1265
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,723
...he had no idea
I was pregnant...

1266
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,722
...and I never intended
to tell him.

1267
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,685
I guess we make
choices in life,

1268
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,922
and we choose
to live with them.

1269
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,571
Or not.

1270
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,924
I didn't want that baby.

1271
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,767
Not because I didn't love
Nick, and not because

1272
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,411
I didn't love the idea
of it, but because...

1273
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,251
...I just wasn't ready
to love myself.

1274
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,161
There's a distance
to it all now.

1275
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:30,160
Hey, Jimmy,
you got a smoke?

1276
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,323
Jimmy! Jimmy!

1277
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:30,641
Jimmy!!

1278
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,171
Shit!

1279
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,841
Fuck!

1280
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,365
Fuck.

1281
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,603
Hey, aren't you
Riggan Thomson?

1282
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,330
Holy shit,
let me get an autograph.

1283
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,682
Don't be a click.
Give me an autograph.

1284
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,441
Dude, you rock!

1285
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,045
Birdman!

1286
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,045
Oh, shit!

1287
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,522
Oh, my God!
You know who that is?

1288
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,042
Oh,
can we take one picture!

1289
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,045
Just one picture!
Kids, get next to him!

1290
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,725
You suck!

1291
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,724
You suuuuck!!

1292
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,043
Hey, Birdman!

1293
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,404
Riggan, I'm missing him.

1294
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,724
It's the Bird-fucking-man!
Hey, come look at this guy!

1295
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,721
Birdman! Hey, Birdman,
whooo, look at that!

1296
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,490
Where you going, man?

1297
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,922
You look so old
in person.

1298
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,765
Fuck you!

1299
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,084
Sir! Sir!
Where are you going?

1300
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,085
Sir! Where are you...? Sir!

1301
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,440
What are you doing?

1302
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:14,450
Waiting for Jake. This is
my attorney, Mr. Roth.

1303
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:17,604
We're pursuing financial
remunerations for the injuries...

1304
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,205
I got a play to do!

1305
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,124
Sir, you can't go in there!

1306
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,284
Actors Equity is
a very strong union, sir!

1307
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,441
Knock, knock, knock!
Terri! Terri!

1308
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,961
<i>Ed?</i>

1309
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:43,211
What are you doing here?

1310
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,045
Why?! I just need
you to tell me why?

1311
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,964
Take it easy, Ed.
I know this is hard.

1312
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,884
Shut up! Fuck you!
Shut up!

1313
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,121
Shut up!

1314
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,970
Eddie, please!

1315
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,323
What's wrong with me?!

1316
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:03,486
Why do I always... beg
people to love me?

1317
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,646
Eddie, please,
just... just give me the gun.

1318
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,482
I just wanted to
be what you wanted.

1319
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,168
Now I spend
every fucking clay...

1320
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,482
...trying to be
somebody I'm not!

1321
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,081
Put the gun down. She doesn't love you!

1322
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,840
Eddie.

1323
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:25,009
Look at me.
I was drowning.

1324
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,165
I'm just not capable of that
kind of...

1325
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,844
You deserve to be loved,
Eddie. You do.

1326
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,162
I just wanted
to be what you wanted.

1327
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,001
Mr. Roth?
Okay, don't leave, please.

1328
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,169
Is that a threat?
What wheelchair?

1329
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,364
Okay, Mr. Roth, please hear me out.
Will you?

1330
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,921
Don't hang up.
Don't hang up.

1331
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,168
Give me 10 minutes
to grab my things,

1332
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,846
give me 10 minutes and
we can... Don't hang up.

1333
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,840
Goddamn it!
The motherfucker hung up!

1334
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,241
Dad.

1335
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,571
Dad!

1336
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,686
Are you... okay?

1337
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,921
Why?

1338
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,922
You seem sort of...

1339
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,248
No, I'm good, I'm good.

1340
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,482
This is good. You want some?

1341
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:58,921
No.

1342
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:04,082
Do you really think you'll be
ready for opening tomorrow?

1343
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,771
Yeah. Yep.

1344
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,602
Yeah, well, I mean...

1345
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,407
...previews were
pretty much a train wreck.

1346
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,767
We can't seem to get
through a performance...

1347
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:19,764
...without a raging fire or a
raging hard-on. I'm broke.

1348
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,964
I'm not sleeping,
like, you know... at all.

1349
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:27,968
And, uh, this play is kind
of starting to feel like...

1350
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:32,444
...a miniature, deformed version
of myself that just keeps...

1351
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,802
...following me
around and, like...

1352
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,285
...hitting me in the balls with,
like, a tiny little hammer.

1353
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,970
I'm sorry,
what was the question?

1354
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,651
Never mind.

1355
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,844
Tonight wasn't bad.

1356
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,480
I know.

1357
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,000
It was weird,
but it was kind of cool.

1358
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,160
Yeah, really?

1359
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,645
Yeah, I think
people liked it.

1360
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,007
What are you doing?
Homework?

1361
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,651
No, I don't...

1362
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,004
No, um...
When I was in rehab,
they made us do this.

1363
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,361
Really? What is it'?

1364
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,440
Um... These dashes represent
the six billion years

1365
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,720
that the Earth
has been around.

1366
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:11,169
So, each dash represents
a thousand years.

1367
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:15,729
And, um, this... is how long
humans have been here.

1368
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,682
150,000 years.

1369
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,284
I think they're
trying to remind us that

1370
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,006
that's all our ego and
self-obsession are worth.

1371
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,842
I was a shitty father,
wasn't I?

1372
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,850
No, you were...

1373
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,850
You were fine.

1374
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,680
That's right,
I was... l was just fine.

1375
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,531
I can't...

1376
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,761
Dad?

1377
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,370
Oh, shoot. I'm sorry.

1378
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,928
You just wiped out the
entire human race.

1379
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,200
There it goes. I'm sorry.

1380
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,041
Um...

1381
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,251
You're becoming
a trending topic.

1382
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:04,607
Really?

1383
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:09,568
I should probably tell you about
this before anybody else does.

1384

350,000 views in

01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,602
I'm going to
destroy your play.

1409
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,728
But you didn't even see it.

1410
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,290
Um, you know, did I do
something to offend you?

1411
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,204
Actually, you did.

1412
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,044
You occupied
a theater which

1413
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:52,361
might have been used on
something worthwhile.

1414
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:58,284
Okay. But you don't even know
if it's any good or not.

1415
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:02,804
That's true. I haven't read a word
of it, or even seen a preview...

1416
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,531
...but after
the opening tomorrow,

1417
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:08,127
I'm going to turn in the worst
review anybody has ever read.

1418
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,962
And I'm going to
close your play.

1419
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,324
Would you like to know why?

1420
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:17,805
Because I hate you,
and everyone you represent.

1421
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,961
Entitled, selfish,
spoiled children.

1422
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,486
Blissfully untrained,
unversed and unprepared...

1423
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,802
...to even attempt real art.

1424
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:33,006
Handing each other awards
for cartoons and pornography.

1425
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,005
Measuring your
worth in weekends?

1426
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,164
Well, this is the theater.

1427
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,209
You don't get to
come here and pretend

1428
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,009
you can write,
direct and act...

1429
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,765
...in your own
propaganda piece

1430
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,081
without coming
through me first.

1431
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,881
Ah.
So break a leg.

1432
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,404
Wow. So what has to
happen in a person's life

1433
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,403
for them to become
a critic, anyway?

1434
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,049
What are you writing,
a review?

1435
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,084
Huh? Is it any good?

1436
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:04,722
Is it bad?
Did you even see it?
Let me read it.

1437
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,763
I will call the police.

1438
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,640
No, you won't. Let's read
your fucking review.

1439
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,400
"Callow." Callow is a label.

1440
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:14,402
"Lackluster."
That's just a label.

1441
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,491
"Marginalia"? Are you kidding me?

1442
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,600
It sounds like you need
penicillin to clear that up.

1443
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,402
That's a label, too. These are all labels.
You just label everything.

1444
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,084
That's so fucking lazy.
You're a lazy fucker.

1445
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,601
You're a lazy...

1446
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,924
Do you know what this is?
Do you even know what it is?

1447
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,924
You don't. You know why?

1448
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,691
Because you can't
see this thing

1449
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,125
if you don't know
how to label it.

1450
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:43,331
You mistake those noises in
your head for true knowledge.

1451
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,965
Are you finished?
No.

1452
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,124
There's nothing in here about
technique, about structure...

1453
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,642
...about intention. It's just
a bunch of crappy opinions...

1454
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,964
...backed up by even
crappier comparisons.

1455
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,965
You write a couple paragraphs,
and you know what?

1456
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:01,289
None of this costs
you fucking anything.

1457
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:04,964
You risk nothing.
Nothing, nothing, nothing!

1458
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,282
Well, I'm a fucking actor.

1459
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,121
This play cost me everything.

1460
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,123
So I'll tell you what.
You take this fucking...

1461
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,801
...malicious, cowardly...

1462
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:25,484
...shittily written review and you
shove it right the fuck up...

1463
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,486
...your wrinkly... tight ass.

1464
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,926
You're no actor,
you're a celebrity.

1465
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,490
Let's be clear on that.

1466
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,842
I'm going to
kill your play.

01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,084

1478
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,924
...fools...

1479
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,084
A pint of whiskey,

his hour upon the stage...

1490

...and then is heard...

1491

...no more!

1492
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,804
It is a tale...

1493
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,966
...told by an idiot...

1494
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:55,124
...full of sound and fury...

1495

Was that too much?

1497

I was just trying
to give you a range.

1498

It's a little bit too much.
I can tell, because you...

I just want to
give you a range.

1500

1563
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,807
Yeah.

1564
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,091
I know where to go.

1565
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,601
Oh! Hey!

1566
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:02,325
Oh! on!

1567
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:13,881
Whoa!

1568
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,445
You <i>see?</i>

1569
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,841
<i>This is where you belong.</i>

1570
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,444
<i>Above them all.</i>

1571
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:45,091
Stop the music.

1572
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,491
I beg your pardon?

1573
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,040
Sir, you did not pay me!

1574
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:52,847
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

1575
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,004
This guy didn't
pay me. He's fucking crazy!

1576
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:31,880
Not a bad
first act, huh?

1577
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,046
Not bad at all.

1578
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,486
It's going really well.

1579
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:36,882
I didn't think
he could do Broadway.

1580
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,731
I never would
have expected it.

1581
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,440
If the 2nd act
is half as good...

1582
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,050
It's pretty glorious.

1583
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,248
What do we talk about when
we talk about Riggan Thomson?

1584
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,520
How long
is the intermission?

1585
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,244
Birdman can act.

1586
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:06,841
Whoa.

1587
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,401
I just came to say hello.

1588
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,889
It's going great out there.
You're so good.

1589
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,689
I mean it. I really mean it.

1590
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:17,924
<i>Places
for the final scene, Riggan.</i>

1591
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,400
Do you need to...?

1592
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,120
No, it's fine.
Just sit here for a second.

1593
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,362
Look at all these roses.

1594
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,840
I hate roses.

1595
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:26,081
And you hate roses.

1596
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,287
Are you okay? You seem...

1597
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:34,288
I don't know,
you seem abnormally calm.

1598
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,770
I am calm.

1599
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,603
I'm great, actually.

1600
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,321
You know...

1601
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:48,524
I got this little voice...
talks to me sometimes.

1602
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,644
Tells me the truth.

1603
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,291
It's comforting.

1604
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,802
Kind of scary,
but it is comforting.

1605
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,248
I'm going to pretend I
didn't hear you say that.

1606
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:58,481
Okay.

1607
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,803
You wouldn't believe
the crowd outside.

1608
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,804
They said some people
paid up to $500 a ticket.

1609
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,481
Really?

1610
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:07,681
Hey-

1611
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,163
Can I tell you
something funny?

1612
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,723
Remember our last
anniversary party?

1613
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,088
Seriously? You want
to ruin a nice moment?

1614
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:18,491
Do you remember?

1615
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,927
You fucked Janet
Rossbach in our bed.

1616
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,240
Skip over that part.

1617
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,481
Oh, gladly.

1618
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,968
You threw all the guests
out of the house...

1619
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,168
...and you threw all
the furniture out the window.

1620
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,120
I remember. Locked
yourself in the bathroom.

1621
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,004
Why are we
talking about...?

1622
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:33,605
I drove out to...

1623
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,411
...Malibu.

1624
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:40,166
I just sat on the beach for a
while, looking out at the ocean.

1625
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:41,441
Riggan.

1626
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:43,330
And I walked...

1627
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:45,523
...straight into the water.

1628
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:52,522
And then I tried
to drown myself.

1629
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:00,206
I was up to my chest
when I felt the first one.

1630
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,329
On my back,
it was like somebody was

1631
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,210
holding a frying pan to
me and really burning.

1632
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,967
And then they were on my
chest and all over my legs.

1633
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:12,406
The water was full
of jellyfish.

1634
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:15,921
They were all over me.

1635
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,766
I had to fight my way
out of the water
and went up to the beach.

1636
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:23,607
I was rolling around
like a maniac in the sand...

1637
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:25,645
...crying.

1638
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:29,288
You said it was a sunburn.

1639
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:33,444
I know.
And you believed me.

1640
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,127
To be honest,
I didn't give a shit.

1641
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:45,965
I love you.

1642
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:50,926
And I love Sam.

1643
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,126
I know.

1644
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:58,440
I really wish I hadn't
videotaped her birth.

1645
01:37:58,800 --> 01:37:59,961
Why?

1646
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,281
'Cause...

1647
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,482
...I missed
the moment, really.

1648
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,211
I don't have it.

1649
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,647
I should have just been
there with the two of you.

1650
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:12,806
You know... just
the three of us.

1651
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:17,491
But I wasn't.

1652
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:20,843
I wasn't even
present in my own life,
and now I don't have it...

1653
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:22,810
...and I'm never
going to have it.

1654
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,605
You have Sam.

1655
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:26,170
Not really, I don't.
I mean, she's...

1656
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,323
No, she's just
going through...

1657
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:30,529
No, I get it,
I understand.

1658
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,329
She needed to have a dad...

1659
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,524
...and instead she got
this guy who was a...

1660
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,650
...three-day
viral sensation.

1661
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,006
It is so pathetic,
I can't...

1662
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,202
There are things
more pathetic than that.

1663
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:43,601
Yeah, like?

1664
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:45,011
That moustache.

1665
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,328
<i>Riggan, we are in the motel.</i>

1666
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,370
<i>Last scene has started.
You're not here.</i>

1667
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,682
<i>Last chance for "places."</i>

1668
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:00,208
You better get
back to your seat.

1669
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:25,208
Twenty little leopards
laughed at two lofty lions.

1670
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,564
Twenty little leopards
laughed at two lofty lions.

1671
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:32,725
Twenty little leopards
laughed at two lofty lions.

1672
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:06,442
Break a leg, Mr. Thomson.

1673
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,764
Let me put the blood rig on.

1674
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:45,011
Riggan!

1675
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:55,841
Terri!

1676
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:57,521
Terri!

1677
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,011
Eddie! What are you
doing here?

1678
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:03,204
Why? I just want
you to tell me why.

1679
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,522
- Shut up!
- Eddie, please!

1680
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,124
What's the matter with me?

1681
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:12,046
Tell me. Why do I always have
to beg people to love me?

1682
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:14,044
Eddie, please,
give me the gun.

1683
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:17,204
It was me. I was drowning.
I'm just not capable of...

1684
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,888
You deserve to be loved,
Eddie. You do.

1685
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:26,206
I just wanted to
be what you wanted.
What you wanted.

1686
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,602
Now I spend every
fucking minute trying

1687
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,808
to be something else,
something I'm not.

1688
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,724
Just put
the gun down, Ed.

1689
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,404
She doesn't
love you anymore.

1690
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,564
You don't, do you?

1691
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,041
No.

1692
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:41,246
And you never will.

1693
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:43,405
I'm sorry.

1694
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,444
Ah.

1695
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:56,251
I don't exist.

1696
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,570
I'm not even here.

1697
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,410
I'm not even here.

1698
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:06,241
Bang!

1699
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:19,601
Bang!

1700
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:14,885
Is he up?

1701
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:16,730
He just woke up.

1702
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,209
I thought I lost you, buddy.

1703
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:28,167
What the hell happened?

1704
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:31,404
I was watching you onstage
and all of a sudden...

1705
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:34,883
...you had that goofy look in your
eye and you just...

1706
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:36,725
What is wrong with you?
He tried to...

1707
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:41,204
I'm happy! He's alive! My
best friend is alive! And...

1708
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,883
...he's the fucking
man of the hour.

1709
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,241
What is that?

1710
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:46,401
You have to be shitting me.

1711
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:47,921
Read it.

1712
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:51,249
I don't believe this.
"The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"?

1713
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:52,521
Read it.

1714
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,251
"By Tabitha Dickinson."

1715
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:55,606
Read it out loud!

1716
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:58,402
"Thomson has

01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,369
"The blood that has
been sorely missing

1723
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:14,046
"from the veins
of American theater..."

1724
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,442
You're happy about this?

1725
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,728
Happy?
I'm fucking euphoric!

1726
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:22,451
This is the kind of review that
turns people into living legends!

1727
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:24,404
He shot the nose
off his face!

1728
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:26,409
He got a new nose!

1729
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,960
And if doesn't like that one,
we'll get him a new one!

1730
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,442
We'll use Meg Ryan's guy.
Who cares?

1731
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:33,927
They're lighting candles
for him in Central Park.

1732
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,365
Turn on the TV.

1733
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:38,361
<i>...a vigil for
actor Riggan Thomson.</i>

1734
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:42,122
They're praying for him all over the
country. He did it. You did it!

1735
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:46,283
I've been reborn, brother.
And I can see the future.

1736
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,688
This play is going to
last forever.

1737
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:50,728
It's going to open
in London, Paris.

1738
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,371
The studio will call,

1739
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:53,726
we're going to get
book deals... you'll see.

1740
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:55,405
So you can see the future?

1741
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:56,811
Yeah, I can!

1742
01:45:57,640 --> 01:46:00,803
How about that, huh? Did
you see that coming?
Oh.

1743
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,650
Why aren't you
saying anything?

1744
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:06,483
This is what you wanted,
wasn't it?

1745
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,843
Riggan, this is
what you wanted.

1746
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,161
Yeah.

1747
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,322
Yeah, this is what I wanted.

1748
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:16,528
Okay, listen.
You're going to get hit

1749
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:19,484
with a "brandishing
a weapon" charge.

1750
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,240
If anybody talks to you about
it, it was an accident.

1751
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,170
Is that what this was?

1752
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:27,162
An accident?
An accident.

1753
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:28,921
Did you intend
to shoot yourself!

1754
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:33,370
You motherfuckers, this is a hospital!
Get the fuck out of here!

1755
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:35,842
This is a hospital!

1756
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:39,011
Get the fuck out,
you assholes!

1757
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:42,250
Out! This is
a personal matter!

1758
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:43,685
A personal matter!

1759
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:48,521
Hey, Sam!
What did you feel like

1760
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,921
the night your father
tried to kill himself?

1761
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:19,245
Lilacs.

1762
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:29,404
Are you laughing?

1763
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:31,085
What's so funny?

1764
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:34,404
I can't smell them.

1765
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,285
What are you doing?

1766
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:43,771
Posting a photo of you
on your Twitter page.

1767
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,240
I have a Twitter page?

1768
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:47,084
Yeah, I set it up today.

1769
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,045
- Let me see.
- No way.

1770
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,451
You look hideous.

1771
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,808
Oh, wow, thank you.
I appreciate it.

1772
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,166
I'm just kidding.

1773
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:56,920
No, I'm actually not.
You do look hideous.

1774
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:01,443
You got 80,000 followers
in less than a day.

1775
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:02,921
Really?

1776
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,126
I'm going to scare
the shit out of them.

1777
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:05,521
Let me look at it.

1778
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:06,601
Mmm-mmm. It's done.

1779
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:13,611
Uh, I'm going to get
a vase for the flowers.

1780
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:18,921
Oh.

1781
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:32,321
Ah.

1782
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,201
Ah.

1783
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:43,961
Ah.

1784
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:17,087
Bye-bye... and fuck you.

1785
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:46,321
Dad?

1786
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,481
Dad?

1787
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:52,241
Dad?
