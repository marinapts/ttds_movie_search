1
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:07,136
Fear, treachery, blood lust.

2
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,654
Thousands of years ago
these were the...

3
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:12,292
forces that ruled our world

4
00:01:12,316 --> 00:01:15,885
A world where prey were
scared of predators.

5
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,865
And predators had an
uncontrollable...

6
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:23,506
biological urge to maim, and maul, and...

7
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:25,307
Awww!

8
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:28,305
Blood! Blood! Blood!

9
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:36,418
And.. death!

10
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:38,734
Ahhh...

11
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:45,107
Back then, the world
was divided in two.

12
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:49,114
Vicious predator,
or meek prey.

13
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:58,550
But over time, we evolved,
and moved beyond or primitive savage ways.

14
00:01:58,574 --> 00:02:02,954
Now predator and prey
live in harmony.

15
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:07,420
And every young mammal
has multitudinous opportunities.

16
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:11,670
Yeah, I don't have to cower
in a a herd anymore.

17
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:15,329
Instead, I can be an astronaut.

18
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:22,709
I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore.
Today I can hunt for tax exemptions.

19
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,809
I'm gonna be an actuary.

20
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:32,556
And I can make the world a better place.
I am going to be...

21
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:35,824
A police officer!

22
00:02:37,644 --> 00:02:41,370
Bunny cop? That is the most
stupidest thing I ever heard!

23
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:46,755
It may seem impossible to small minds.
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.

24
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:53,605
But, just 211 miles away,
stands the great city of Zootopia.

25
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,938
Where our ancestors first joined
together in peace.

26
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:03,135
And declared that anyone
can be anything!

27
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:06,943
Thank you and good night.

28
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:10,859
Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
and me got to be so darn happy?

29
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:11,856
Nope

30
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,694
Well, we gave up on our dreams,
and we settled. Right, Bon?

31
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,049
Oh, yes. That's right, Stu.
We settled hard.

32
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:20,029
You see, that's the beauty
of complacency, Jude.

33
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:22,343
If you don't try anything
new, you'll never fail.

34
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:23,892
I like trying, actually.

35
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:27,844
What your father means, hon, is that it's
gonna be difficult, impossible even...

36
00:03:27,868 --> 00:03:30,991
- for you to become a police officer.
- Right. There's never been a bunny cop.

37
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,088
- No.
- Bunnies don't do that.

38
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,019
- Never.
- Never.

39
00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:35,914
Well... Then I guess
I'll have to be the first one.

40
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:40,513
Because I am gonna make
the world a better place!

41
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:44,287
Or, heck, you know. You wanna talk
about making the world a better place,

42
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:46,272
no better way to do it than
becoming a carrot farmer.

43
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:50,476
Yes! Your dad, me,
your 275 brothers and sisters.

44
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:52,425
- We're changing the world.
- Yeah.

45
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,373
- One carrot at a time.
- Amen to that.

46
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:57,125
Carrot farming is a noble profession.

47
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:02,868
You get it, honey?
I mean, it's great to have dreams.

48
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:06,144
Yeah, just as long as you
don't believe in them too much.

49
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,955
Where the heck'd she go?

50
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:13,507
Give me your tickets right now,
or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt.

51
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:15,293
Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!

52
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:17,994
Baah, baah!
What are you gonna do, cry?

53
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:22,931
- Hey! You heard her. Cut it out.
- Nice costume, loser.

54
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:27,065
What crazy world are you living in
where you think a bunny could be a cop?

55
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:31,456
- Kindly return my friend's tickets.
- Come and get them. But watch out.

56
00:04:31,457 --> 00:04:34,851
Cause I'm a fox, and like you said
in your dumb little stage play,

57
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:39,492
us predators used to eat prey.
And that killer instinct's still in our denna.

58
00:04:39,516 --> 00:04:43,186
- Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's pronounced DNA.
- Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

59
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:45,878
You don't scare me, Gideon.

60
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:48,092
Scared now?

61
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:50,194
Look at her nose twitch,
she is scared.

62
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:54,140
Cry, little baby bunny!
Cry... Ow...

63
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:58,990
Oh, you don't know
when to quit, do you?

64
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:00,058
Huh!

65
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:09,180
I want you to remember this moment
the next time you think you will ever be...

66
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:13,480
anything more than just a
stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny.

67
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:20,645
- That looks bad.
- Are you okay, Judy?

68
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:24,243
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
Here you go.

69
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:27,865
- Wow, you got our tickets!
- You're awesome, Judy.

70
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:31,326
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't know
what he's talking about!

71
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:35,630
Well, he was right
about one thing.

72
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:38,813
I don't know when to quit.

73
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:40,172
ZOOTOPIA POLICE ACADEMY

74
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:45,484
Listen up, cadets. Zootopia has 12
unique ecosystems within its city limits.

75
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:49,893
Tundratown, Sahara Square,
Rainforest District, to name a few.

76
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:53,438
You're gonna have to master all of
them before you hit the streets.

77
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:56,805
Or guess what?
You'll be dead!

78
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:59,508
Scorching sandstorm.

79
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:03,569
You're dead, bunny bumpkin.

80
00:06:03,602 --> 00:06:06,748
One thousand foot fall.

81
00:06:06,772 --> 00:06:09,114
You're dead, carrot face.

82
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:12,386
Frigid ice wall.

83
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,508
You're dead, farm girl.

84
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:17,700
Enormous criminal.
You're dead.

85
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:20,184
Dead. Dead. Dead.

86
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:26,302
Ohhh...!

87
00:06:26,326 --> 00:06:29,914
Filthy toilet.
You're dead, fluff butt.

88
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:33,247
Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny.

89
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:38,151
- There's never been a bunny cop. Never.
- Just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny.

90
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,830
As mayor of Zootopia, I am proud
to announce that my mammal inclusion...

91
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:11,878
initiative, has produced its first
police academy graduate.

92
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:17,281
Valedictorian of her class,
ZPD's very first rabbit officer...

93
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:21,278
Judy Hopps.

94
00:07:23,217 --> 00:07:24,910
Assistant Mayor Bellwether, her badge.

95
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:27,585
- Oh, yes, yes!
- Thank you.

96
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:34,337
Judy, it is my great privilege to officially
assign you to the heart of Zootopia...

97
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:37,183
Precinct One.
City Center.

98
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,938
- Yeh!
- Yeh!

99
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:41,096
Congratulations Officer Hopps.

100
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,629
I won't let you down.

101
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:44,436
This has been my dream
since I was a kid.

102
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,381
You know, it's a real proud
day for us little guys.

103
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:48,920
Bellwether, make room, will you?

104
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:51,149
Okay, Officer Hopps.
Let's see those teeth!

105
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:52,726
Officer Hopps, look here.

106
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:59,785
- We're real proud of you, Judy.
- Yeah, and scared too.

107
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:02,067
- Yes.
- Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo.

108
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:05,819
I mean, Zootopia.
So far away, such a big city.

109
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:08,535
Guys, I've been working for this
my whole life.

110
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:12,221
We know. And we're just a little
exited for you, but terrified.

111
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:14,849
The only thing we have to
fear is fear itself.

112
00:08:14,873 --> 00:08:17,045
And also bears. We have
bears to fear, too.

113
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,433
- Say nothing on lions, and wolves.
- Wolves?

114
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,161
- Weasels.
- You played cribbage with a weasel once?

115
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:22,574
Yeah, he cheats like
there's no tomorrow.

116
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:24,269
You know what?
Pretty much all predators.

117
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:26,163
- And Zootopia is full of them.
- Oh, Stu.

118
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:28,366
And foxes are the worst.

119
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,843
Yeah, actually, your father
does have a point there.

120
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:33,520
It's in their biology.
Remember what happened with Gideon Grey?

121
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:37,977
When I was nine. Gideon Grey was
a jerk who happens to be a fox.

122
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:39,848
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.

123
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,024
Sure, yeah, we all do, absolutely.
But just in case,

124
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:44,848
we made you a little
care package to take with you.

125
00:08:44,849 --> 00:08:47,444
- I put some snacks in there.
- This is fox deterrent.

126
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:49,271
- Yeah, it's safe to have that.
- This is fox repellant.

127
00:08:49,272 --> 00:08:50,715
The deterrent and the
repellant, that's all she needs.

128
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,977
- Check this out!
- Oh, for goodness sake!

129
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:54,752
She has no need for
a fox taser, Stu.

130
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:56,783
Oh, come on.
When is there not a need for a fox taser?

131
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:59,523
Well, okay, look, I will take this...
To make you stop talking.

132
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:01,562
Terrific!
Everyone wins!

133
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:05,125
Arriving, Zootopia Express.

134
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:09,014
Okay, gotta go.
Bye!

135
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:18,674
Mmm. I love you, guys.

136
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:20,254
Love you, too.

137
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:24,527
- Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks.
- Oh, Stu. Pull it together.

138
00:09:24,551 --> 00:09:26,575
Bye everybody!

139
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:31,363
Bye Judy, I love you!
Bye!

140
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:36,352
Bye!

141
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:44,878
YOU ARE NOW LEAVING
BUNNYBURROW.

142
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:18,530
I'm Gazelle.
Welcome to Zootopia.

143
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:23,604
And welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms.
Luxury apartments with charm.

144
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:27,470
Complementary delousing once a month.
Don't lose your key!

145
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:28,997
Thank you.

146
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:32,289
- Oh, hi! I'm Judy, your new neighbor!
- Yeah? Well, we're loud.

147
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:34,715
Don't expect us to apologize for it.

148
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:39,652
Greasy walls.

149
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:41,479
Rickety bed.

150
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:45,709
Crazy neighbors.

151
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,016
I love it!

152
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:09,183
Come on!
He bared his teeth first!

153
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:12,253
- Excuse me!
- Hmm?

154
00:13:12,277 --> 00:13:14,034
Down here!

155
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:16,977
- Hi.
- O... M... Goodness!

156
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:18,772
They really did hire a bunny.

157
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:22,876
Ho-whop! I gotta tell you,
you're even cuter than I thought you'd be.

158
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,032
Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know,
but a bunny can call another bunny "cute",

159
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:30,701
but when other animals
do it, that's a little...

160
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:35,216
Ohhh. I am so sorry!
Me, Benjamin Clawhauser.

161
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,543
The guy everyone thinks is just
a flabby donut-loving cop, stereotyping you.

162
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,263
- Oh.
- No, it's okay.

163
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,690
Oh. You've actually got...
there's a...

164
00:13:43,714 --> 00:13:45,950
- A what?
- In your neck. The fold.

165
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:50,088
- The... this...
- Oh, there you went, you little dickens!

166
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,419
Hehehe, I should get to roll call,
so which way do I...

167
00:13:53,443 --> 00:13:56,587
- Oh, ball pen's over there to the left.
- Great. Thank you!

168
00:13:56,588 --> 00:14:00,042
Oh... That poor little bunny's gonna
get eaten alive.

169
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:15,531
Hey! Officer Hopps.
You ready to make the world a better place?

170
00:14:19,824 --> 00:14:21,905
Attention!

171
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:28,347
All right. All right.
Everybody sit.

172
00:14:28,862 --> 00:14:31,361
I've got three items
on the docket.

173
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:36,713
First, we need to acknowledge
the elephant in the room.

174
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,392
Francine.
Happy birthday.

175
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:43,100
Oh.

176
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:46,752
Number two. There are some new recruits
with us I should introduce,

177
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:50,366
but I'm not going to because...
I don't care.

178
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:55,207
Finally, we have 14 missing mammal cases.

179
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:59,630
All predators. From a giant polar bear
to a teensy little otter.

180
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:03,284
And City Hall is right up
my tail to find them.

181
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:07,899
This is priority number one.
Assignments.

182
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,252
Officers Grizzoli, Fragmire, Delgato.

183
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:13,800
Your team take missing mammals
from the Rainforest District.

184
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:18,837
Officers McHorn, Rhinowitz, Wolfard.
Your teams take Sahara Square.

185
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:23,539
Officers Higgins, Snarlov, Trunkaby.
Tundratown.

186
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:29,085
And finally, our first bunny,
Officer Hopps.

187
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:32,441
Parking duty.
Dismissed.

188
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,748
Parking duty?

189
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:38,214
Chief?
Chief Bogo?

190
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:42,065
Sir. You said there were
fourteen missing mammal cases.

191
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,027
- So?
- So I can handle one.

192
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:47,262
You probably forgot but, I was
top of my class at the academy.

193
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:49,820
Didn't forget.
Just don't care.

194
00:15:49,844 --> 00:15:51,721
Sir, I'm not just
some token bunny.

195
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:54,953
Well then, writing a hundred
tickets a day should be easy.

196
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,575
A 100 tickets. I'm not
gonna write 100 tickets.

197
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:05,585
I'm gonna write 200 tickets.
Before noon.

198
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:14,906
FREQUENT STOPS

199
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:52,385
Ah!

200
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,953
Boom!
Two hundred tickets before noon!

201
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:10,331
201.

202
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,569
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!

203
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:14,914
Huh!

204
00:17:27,598 --> 00:17:28,997
Hmm.

205
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:41,464
Where'd he go?

206
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,162
Listen. I know what you're doing
skulking around during daylight hours,

207
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:02,663
but I don't want any
trouble in here. So hit the road!

208
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:05,053
I'm not looking for
any trouble either, sir...

209
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:09,969
I simply wanna buy a Jumbo-Pop.
For my little boy.

210
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,708
You want the red,
or the blue, pal?

211
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:22,053
Oh.
I'm such a...

212
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:24,512
- Oh, come on, kid. Back up. Listen, buddy.
- What?

213
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,488
There aren't any fox ice cream joints
in your part of town?

214
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:31,120
No, no. There are, there are.
It's just, my boy,

215
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,697
this goofy little stinker,
he loves all things elephant.

216
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:36,029
He wants to be one
when he grows up.

217
00:18:36,053 --> 00:18:38,174
Isn't that adorable?

218
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:41,638
Who the heck am I to crush
his little dreams, huh? Right?

219
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,832
Look, you probably can't read, fox,
but the sign says

220
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:50,339
We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone!
So beat it.

221
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,763
You're holding up the line.

222
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:56,490
Hello.
Excuse me.

223
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:59,721
Hey, you're gonna have to wait your
turn like everyone else, meter maid.

224
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:01,739
Actually, I'm an officer.

225
00:19:01,763 --> 00:19:03,424
Just have a quick question.

226
00:19:03,448 --> 00:19:05,575
Are your customers
aware they're getting

227
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,112
snot and mucus with
their cookies and cream?

228
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,715
What are you talking about?

229
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,207
Well. I don't wanna
cause you any trouble,

230
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:17,994
but I believe scooping ice cream with an
ungloved trunk is a class 3 health code violation.

231
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:21,204
Which is kind of a big deal.

232
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:23,979
Of course I could let you off with
a warning if you were to glove those trunks

233
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:27,253
and... I don't know...
finish selling this...

234
00:19:27,254 --> 00:19:30,845
nice dad and his son a...
What was it?

235
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,300
A Jumbo-Pop.
Please.

236
00:19:33,324 --> 00:19:35,662
A Jumbo-Pop.

237
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:40,682
- $15.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

238
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:42,798
Oh no, are you kidding me...

239
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:45,806
I don't have my wallet!

240
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,127
I'd lose my head if it
weren't attached to my neck.

241
00:19:48,128 --> 00:19:51,039
That's the truth. Oh, boy.
I'm sorry, pal.

242
00:19:51,063 --> 00:19:53,090
Gotta be about the
worst birthday ever.

243
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:57,299
Please don't be mad at me.
Thanks anyway.

244
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:04,319
Keep the change.

245
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,888
Officer, I can't thank you enough.
So kind. Really. Can I pay you back?

246
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:10,448
Oh, no.
My treat.

247
00:20:10,472 --> 00:20:15,052
It's just, you know it burns me up to see folks
with such backward attitudes towards foxes.

248
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:20,678
I just want to say you're a great
dad and just a real articulate fella.

249
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,704
Oh.
Well, that is high praise.

250
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:25,682
It's rare that I find
someone so non-patronizing.

251
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:27,926
- Officer?
- Hopps. Mr...?

252
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,003
Wilde.
Nick Wilde.

253
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,486
And you, little guy. You wanna
be an elephant when you grow up?

254
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:37,446
You be an elephant.
Because this is Zootopia.

255
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,127
Anyone can be anything.

256
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:42,355
Ahh.
I tell him that all the time.

257
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:44,283
All right, here you go.
Two paws.

258
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:48,406
Yeah. Oh, look at that smile,
that's a happy birthday smile!

259
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,362
All right, give her a little
bye-bye toot-toot.

260
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:53,092
Toot-toot.

261
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:55,781
- Bye, now!
- Goodbye!

262
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:13,613
Oh.
Hey, little toot-toot...

263
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:53,819
"ORGANIC" $2

264
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:57,543
PAWPSICLE
"ORGANIC" *$2

265
00:21:57,993 --> 00:22:00,329
LEMMING BROTHERS BANK

266
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,132
Get your Pawpsicles.

267
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:03,275
Oh!

268
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:27,571
- Lumber delivery.
- What's with the color?

269
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:31,363
The color?
Uh... it's redwood.

270
00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:37,757
39, 40, there you go.
Way to work that diaper, big guy.

271
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:40,520
Hey. No kiss
bye-bye for daddy?

272
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,902
You kiss me tomorrow,
I'll bite your face off!

273
00:22:45,926 --> 00:22:47,124
Ciao.

274
00:22:49,685 --> 00:22:53,324
Well, I stood up for you,
and you lied to me.

275
00:22:53,348 --> 00:22:54,496
You liar!

276
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,020
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart.
And I'm not the liar. He is.

277
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:03,145
Hey!

278
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:05,440
All right, Slick-Nick.
You're under arrest.

279
00:23:05,464 --> 00:23:07,087
Really?
For what?

280
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:09,504
Gee, I don't know. How about
selling food without a permit?

281
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:11,574
Transporting undeclared commerce
across borough lines?

282
00:23:11,575 --> 00:23:15,292
- False advertizing.
- Permit. Receipt of declared commerce.

283
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,797
And I didn't falsely
advertize anything. Take care.

284
00:23:17,821 --> 00:23:20,004
You told that mouse the
Pawpsicle sticks were redwood!

285
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:22,728
That's right. Red wood.
With a space in the middle.

286
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:24,581
Wood that is red.

287
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,049
You can't touch me, Carrots.
I've been doing this since I was born.

288
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:30,091
You're gonna wanna refrain
from calling me Carrots.

289
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:32,054
My bad. I just naturally
assumed you came...

290
00:23:32,055 --> 00:23:34,237
from some little carrot-choked Podunk.
No?

291
00:23:34,261 --> 00:23:37,727
Uh, no. Podunk is in Deerbrooke county
and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.

292
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:41,089
Okay.
Tell me if this story sounds familiar.

293
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,032
Naive little hick with good
grades and big ideas decides

294
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,361
"Hey, look at me, I'm
gonna move to Zootopia...

295
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:49,714
Where predators and prey live
in harmony and sing Kumbaya!"

296
00:23:49,715 --> 00:23:52,697
Only to find, whoopsie,
we don't all get along.

297
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:56,646
And that dream of becoming a big city cop,
double whoopsie, she's a meter maid.

298
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,362
And whoopsie number three-sie,
no one cares about her or her dreams.

299
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:04,429
And soon enough those dreams die, and our
bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor

300
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:08,147
living in a box under a bridge. Till finally she has no choice but to go
back home

301
00:24:08,171 --> 00:24:11,518
with that cute fuzzy wuzzy little tail
between her legs to become...

302
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:15,478
You're from Bunnyburrow, is that what you said?
So how about a carrot farmer?

303
00:24:15,502 --> 00:24:17,762
That sound about right?

304
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,564
Oh!

305
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,879
Be careful now, or it won't just
be your dreams getting crushed.

306
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:28,942
Hey, hey. No one tells me what I can
or can't be. Especially not some...

307
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:33,889
jerk who never had the guts to try to be
anything more than a Pawpsicle hustler.

308
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:35,539
All right, look.

309
00:24:35,563 --> 00:24:39,410
Everyone comes to Zootopia thinking
they can be anything they want.

310
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:42,848
Well, you can't.
You can only be what you are.

311
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:45,299
Sly fox.
Dumb bunny.

312
00:24:45,323 --> 00:24:47,844
I'm not a dumb bunny.

313
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:51,373
Right.
And that's not wet cement.

314
00:24:52,336 --> 00:24:54,574
You'll never be a real cop.

315
00:24:54,587 --> 00:24:56,329
You're a cute meter maid, though.

316
00:24:56,353 --> 00:25:00,056
Maybe a supervisor one day.
Hang in there.

317
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,709
CARROTS for ONE

318
00:25:45,622 --> 00:25:48,366
Mom & Dad

319
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:54,488
- Oh, hey, it's my parents!
- Oh, there she is! Hi, Sweetheart!

320
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:57,437
Hey there, Jude the Dude.
How was your first day on the force?

321
00:25:57,438 --> 00:26:01,523
- It was real great!
- Yeah? Everything you ever hoped?

322
00:26:01,547 --> 00:26:06,860
Absolutely. And more.
Everyone's so nice, and I feel like...

323
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:09,456
- I'm really making a difference.
- Wait a second. Holy cranks, Bonnie.

324
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:11,218
- Look at that!
- Oh, my sweet heaven!

325
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:13,047
Judy, are you a meter maid?

326
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,577
Oh, this.. No! Oh, no.
This is just a temporary thing..

327
00:26:15,578 --> 00:26:18,527
- It's the safest job on the force!
- She's not a real cop!

328
00:26:18,551 --> 00:26:20,737
- Our prayers have been answered!
- Glorious day!

329
00:26:20,738 --> 00:26:22,942
Ho-ho, meter maid,
meter maid, meter maid!

330
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:24,872
- Dad! Dad!
- Meter maid!

331
00:26:24,873 --> 00:26:26,731
You know what,
it's been a really long day, I should...

332
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:29,423
- You get some rest.
- Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves.

333
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:33,076
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

334
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:40,192
Hey, bunny!
Turn down that depressing music!

335
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,334
Leave the meter maid alone,
didn't you hear her conversation?

336
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,545
- She feels like a failure!
- Oh, shut up!

337
00:26:45,546 --> 00:26:46,891
- You shut up!
- You shut up!

338
00:26:46,892 --> 00:26:50,576
- You shut up!
- Tomorrow is another day.

339
00:26:50,577 --> 00:26:53,008
Yeah, but it might be worse!

340
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:57,319
I was 30 seconds over!

341
00:26:58,046 --> 00:27:00,602
Yeah, you're a real hero, lady.

342
00:27:01,347 --> 00:27:04,382
My mommy says
she wishes you were dead.

343
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:08,701
Uncool rabbit, my tax dollars
pay your salary.

344
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,518
I am a real cop.
I am a real cop.

345
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,784
Hey, you!
Bunny!

346
00:27:15,808 --> 00:27:19,727
Sir, if you have a grievance you may
contest recitation in traffic court.

347
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:21,701
What are you talking about?!
My shop!

348
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:24,935
It was just robbed!
Look, he's getting away!

349
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:26,478
Well, are you a cop or not?

350
00:27:26,502 --> 00:27:30,068
Oh! Yes! Yes!
Don't worry, sir, I got this!

351
00:27:34,744 --> 00:27:38,711
- Stop in the name of the law!
- Catch me if ya' can, cottontail!

352
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:46,758
Coming through!

353
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:48,767
This is officer McHorn.
We got a 10-31.

354
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:51,991
I got dibs!
Officer Hopps, I am in pursuit!

355
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:53,861
Woo-hoo!

356
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,628
LITTLE
RODENTIA

357
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:01,777
- Ah!
- Ahh!

358
00:28:03,108 --> 00:28:04,505
Ha ha ha.

359
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:09,367
You!
Hey!

360
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:12,594
Hey, meter maid!
Wait for the real cops!

361
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:14,932
Stop!

362
00:28:18,274 --> 00:28:20,085
Ahhhh!

363
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,790
Oh.

364
00:28:41,025 --> 00:28:44,516
Sorry! Coming through.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon.

365
00:28:46,536 --> 00:28:47,704
Yahhh!

366
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:51,071
Bon voyage, flatfoot!

367
00:28:53,013 --> 00:28:54,195
Huh!

368
00:29:06,776 --> 00:29:10,673
- Hey! Stop right there!
- Have a donut, coppa!

369
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,537
Oh my god, did you see those
leopard print jeggings?

370
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:15,968
- Ah!
- Ah!

371
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:17,826
Oh!

372
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:23,518
- I love your hair.
- Thank you.

373
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:26,304
Heheheheh.
Come to papa!

374
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:30,790
Okay. You're gonna have
to be patient and wait in line

375
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:33,801
just like everyone else,
Mrs. Otterton. Okay?

376
00:29:40,217 --> 00:29:43,970
- I popped the weasel!
- Hopps!

377
00:29:45,895 --> 00:29:51,086
Abandoning your post. Inciting a scurry.
Reckless endangerment of rodents...

378
00:29:51,087 --> 00:29:56,342
But, to be fair, you did stop a master criminal
from stealing two dozen moldy onions.

379
00:29:56,343 --> 00:29:59,675
Mmm. Hate to disagree with you, sir,
but those aren't onions.

380
00:29:59,676 --> 00:30:02,103
Those are a crocus variety called
midnicampum holicithias.

381
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:03,682
They're a class C botanical, sir.

382
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:06,191
Well, I grew up in a family where plant
husbandry was kind of a thing...

383
00:30:06,215 --> 00:30:10,375
- Shut your tiny mouth now!
- Sir, I got the bad guy.

384
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,648
That's my job.

385
00:30:11,672 --> 00:30:15,003
Your job is putting tickets
on parked cars!

386
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:17,895
Chief, Mrs. Otterton's
here to see you again.

387
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,867
- Not now.
- Okay, I just need to know if you want to...

388
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:22,111
- take it this time she seems really upset...
- Not now!

389
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,209
Sir. I don't wanna
be a meter maid,

390
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:26,669
I wanna be a real cop.

391
00:30:26,693 --> 00:30:29,414
Do you think the mayor
asked what I wanted...

392
00:30:29,438 --> 00:30:31,718
- when he assigned you to me?
- But, sir...

393
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:36,733
Life isn't some cartoon musical where you
sing a little song, and your insipid dreams...

394
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:42,207
magically come true!
So let it go.

395
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:45,500
Chief Bogo, please!
Five minutes of your time, please.

396
00:30:45,524 --> 00:30:49,363
I'm sorry sir. I tried to stop her,
she's super slippery.

397
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:50,828
I gotta go sit down.

398
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:53,842
Ma'am, as I've told you,
we're doing everything we can.

399
00:30:53,843 --> 00:30:56,221
My husband has been
missing for ten days.

400
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:58,650
- His name is Emmitt Otterton.
- Yes. I know.

401
00:30:58,674 --> 00:31:02,594
He's a florist.
We have 2 beautiful children.

402
00:31:02,618 --> 00:31:04,514
He would never just disappear.

403
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:07,293
Ma'am, our detectives
are very busy.

404
00:31:07,317 --> 00:31:10,924
Please. There's gotta be somebody
to find my Emmitt.

405
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:13,781
- Mrs. Otterton.
- I will find him.

406
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:19,899
Oh. Thank you!
Bless you, bless you, little bunny!

407
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:24,782
Take this.
Find my Emmitt.

408
00:31:24,806 --> 00:31:28,107
Bring him home to me and my babies.
Please.

409
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:30,195
Mrs. Otterton.
Please wait out here.

410
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:32,260
Of course.
Oh, thank you both so much!

411
00:31:32,284 --> 00:31:33,635
One second.

412
00:31:34,524 --> 00:31:37,552
- You're fired.
- What? Why?

413
00:31:37,553 --> 00:31:42,185
Insubordination! Now. I'm going to open
this door, and you're goind to tell that Otter

414
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:48,071
you're a former meter maid with delusion
of grandeur, who will not be taking the case.

415
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,635
I just heard Officer Hopps
is taking the case!

416
00:31:50,636 --> 00:31:52,125
Assistant Mayor Bellwether!

417
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:55,400
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative
is really starting to pay off.

418
00:31:55,424 --> 00:31:57,718
Mayor Lionheart is
just gonna be so jazzed!

419
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:59,804
No, let's not tell
the mayor just yet.

420
00:31:59,828 --> 00:32:02,041
And I sent it, and it is done,
so I did do that.

421
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:04,248
All right, well, I'd say
the case is in good hands.

422
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:06,869
Us little guys really need to
stick together, right?

423
00:32:06,893 --> 00:32:09,222
- Like glue.
- Good one.

424
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,450
Just call me if you ever
need anything. Okay?

425
00:32:11,474 --> 00:32:14,884
You've always got a friend at
City Hall, Judy. All right! Bye-bye!

426
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:16,426
Thank you, ma'am!

427
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:23,564
I will give you 48 hours.

428
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:24,483
Yes!

429
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:32,044
That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton.
But.. You strike out, you resign.

430
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,401
Okay. Deal.

431
00:32:37,425 --> 00:32:41,329
Splendid. Clawhauser will give you
the complete case file.

432
00:32:41,353 --> 00:32:45,025
Here you go.
One missing otter.

433
00:32:45,732 --> 00:32:47,605
- That's it?
- Yikes!

434
00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:50,630
That is the smallest case file
I've ever seen. Leads, none.

435
00:32:50,654 --> 00:32:53,643
Witnesses, none. And you're not in the
computer system yet, so...

436
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,942
Resources, none!
Ha ha!

437
00:32:55,967 --> 00:33:00,351
Hoo, I hope you didn't stake your
career on cracking this one.

438
00:33:00,352 --> 00:33:02,328
Okay.
Last known sighting.

439
00:33:06,315 --> 00:33:08,908
Can I just borrow?
Thank you.

440
00:33:11,481 --> 00:33:14,539
- Pawpsicle?
- The murder weapon!

441
00:33:14,562 --> 00:33:18,270
- "Get your Pawpsicle"...
- Yeah! Cause that...

442
00:33:18,294 --> 00:33:20,200
What does that mean?

443
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:24,819
It means I have a lead.

444
00:33:29,093 --> 00:33:33,613
- Hi! Hello! It's me again!
- Hey! It's officer toot-toot.

445
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:36,201
Hoo... No.
Actually it's Officer Hopps,

446
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:38,657
and I'm here to ask you some
questions about a case.

447
00:33:38,681 --> 00:33:41,411
What happened, meter maid?
Did someone steal a traffic cone?

448
00:33:41,435 --> 00:33:43,305
It wasn't me.

449
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,244
Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the baby.
I gotta get to work.

450
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:52,699
This is important, sir. I think your
ten dollars worth of Pawpsicles can wait.

451
00:33:52,723 --> 00:33:56,100
Ha! I make 200 bucks
a day, fluff.

452
00:33:56,124 --> 00:33:59,432
365 days a year,
since I was 12.

453
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:02,387
- And time is money. Hop along.
- Please just look at the picture.

454
00:34:02,411 --> 00:34:04,881
You sold Mr. Otterton that Pawpsicle, right?

455
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:06,901
- Do you know him?
- I know everybody.

456
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:08,670
And I also know that somewhere

457
00:34:08,694 --> 00:34:12,368
there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal,
so why don't you get back to your box?

458
00:34:13,172 --> 00:34:15,766
Fine.
Then we'll have to do this the hard way.

459
00:34:16,152 --> 00:34:20,161
- Did you just boot my stroller?
- Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.

460
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:22,666
Ha. For what? Hurting
your feelings?

461
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,539
Felony tax evasion.

462
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:29,083
Yeah.. 200 dollars a day, 365 days a year,
since you were 12...

463
00:34:29,107 --> 00:34:34,458
that's two decades, so times twenty, which is
1,460,000, I think.

464
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:37,837
I mean, I am just a dumb bunny,
but we are good at multiplying.

465
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:42,696
Anyway, according to your tax forms,
you reported, let me see here, zero!

466
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,978
Unfortunately, lying on a federal form
is a punishable offense.

467
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:50,926
- 5 years jail time.
- Well, it's my word against yours.

468
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,046
200 bucks a day, fluff,
365 days a year, since I was twelve.

469
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,884
Actually it's your
word against yours.

470
00:34:57,908 --> 00:34:59,545
And if you want this pen
you're going to help me

471
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:01,895
find this poor missing otter,
or the only place

472
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:05,301
you'll be selling Pawpsicles
is the prison cafeteria.

473
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,191
It's called a hustle, sweet heart.

474
00:35:08,215 --> 00:35:13,321
She hustled you.
Ehahaha...

475
00:35:13,751 --> 00:35:17,640
She hustled you good!
You're a cop now, Nick.

476
00:35:17,664 --> 00:35:20,281
You're gonna need one of these.

477
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:23,543
Have fun working with the fuzz!

478
00:35:24,965 --> 00:35:26,725
Start talking.

479
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:30,394
I don't know where he is,
I only saw where he went.

480
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:32,730
Great, let's go!

481
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:36,255
It's not exactly a place
for a cute little bunny.

482
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:40,862
- Don't call me cute, get in the car.
- Okay. You're the boss.

483
00:35:58,266 --> 00:36:01,085
Hi.
I'm...

484
00:36:02,464 --> 00:36:06,793
Hello? Hello?
Hello?

485
00:36:08,554 --> 00:36:10,422
Hello!
My name is...

486
00:36:10,446 --> 00:36:13,291
You know, I'm gonna hit the
pause button right there.

487
00:36:13,315 --> 00:36:15,802
Cause we're all good on
bunny scout cookies.

488
00:36:15,826 --> 00:36:18,040
Uh, no.

489
00:36:18,064 --> 00:36:22,203
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.
I'm looking for a missing mammal...

490
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:26,821
Emmitt Otterton. Right here.
He may have frequented this establishment?

491
00:36:31,082 --> 00:36:33,574
Yeah, old Emmitt!

492
00:36:33,803 --> 00:36:36,082
Haven't seen him in
a couple of weeks.

493
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:40,765
But hey, you should talk to his yoga instructor.
I'd be happy to take you back.

494
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:43,687
Oh, thank you so much, I'd appericiate
that more than you can imagine, it'd be such...

495
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:48,719
- Oh! You are naked..
- Oh, for sure. We're a naturalist club!

496
00:36:48,743 --> 00:36:54,033
Yeah. In Zootopia anyone can be anything.
These guys, they be naked.

497
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:58,279
Nangi's just on the other side
of the pleasure pool.

498
00:37:04,045 --> 00:37:10,637
Oh boy. Does this make you uncomfortable?
Because if so, there's no shame in calling it quits.

499
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:12,809
Yes, there is.

500
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:15,029
Boy, that's the spirit.

501
00:37:15,605 --> 00:37:21,221
Yeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird.
But you know what I say is weird?

502
00:37:21,245 --> 00:37:25,456
Clothes on animals!
Here we go!

503
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,944
As you can see, Nangi is an elephant,
so she'll totally remember everything.

504
00:37:29,968 --> 00:37:34,533
Hey, Nangi. These dudes have some questions
about Emmitt the otter.

505
00:37:34,557 --> 00:37:35,859
- Who?
- Eh.

506
00:37:35,883 --> 00:37:39,955
Emmitt Otterton. Been coming
to your yoga class for like six years.

507
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:41,563
I have no memory
of this beaver.

508
00:37:41,587 --> 00:37:43,181
He's an otter, actually.

509
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:45,443
He was here a couple of
Wednesdays ago. Remember?

510
00:37:45,443 --> 00:37:46,351
No.

511
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:49,299
Yeah, he was wearing a green
cable knit sweater vest,

512
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:55,185
and a new pair of Quarterway slacks.
Oh, and a Paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot.

513
00:37:55,209 --> 00:37:57,823
- Real tight. Remember that, Nangi?
- No.

514
00:37:57,824 --> 00:38:03,126
Yeah, and we both walked him out, and he got into this
big old white car with a silver trim.

515
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,182
Needed a tune up. The third cylinder
wasn't firing. Remember that, Nangi?

516
00:38:07,206 --> 00:38:08,238
No.

517
00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:12,073
Eh. You didn't happen to catch
the license plate number?

518
00:38:12,074 --> 00:38:18,626
- Did you?
- Oh, for sure. It was 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.

519
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:21,178
0-3. Wow, this is a lot of great info.
Thank you.

520
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:28,261
Told you Nangi has a mind like a steel trap.
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.

521
00:38:29,356 --> 00:38:34,937
Well, I had a ball. You are welcome for the clue.
And seeing as any moron can run a plate,

522
00:38:34,961 --> 00:38:37,991
I will take that pen
and bid you adieu.

523
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:39,935
The plate.
I can't run a plate.

524
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,237
Oomf.
I'm not in the system yet.

525
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:46,114
- Give me the pen, please.
- What was it you said?

526
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,024
Any moron can run a plate?

527
00:38:48,048 --> 00:38:52,295
Gosh, if only there were a moron around
who were up to the task.

528
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:53,911
Rabbit, I did what you asked.

529
00:38:53,935 --> 00:38:55,885
You can't keep me
on the hook forever.

530
00:38:55,909 --> 00:39:00,259
Not forever. Well, I only have 36
hours left to solve this case.

531
00:39:00,283 --> 00:39:03,109
So can you run the plate or not?

532
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:08,741
Actually, I just remembered,
I have a pal at the DMV.

533
00:39:08,766 --> 00:39:11,690
Flash is the fastest guy in there.
You need something done, he's on it.

534
00:39:11,691 --> 00:39:15,463
I hope so. We are really fighting the clock
and every minute counts.

535
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:19,532
Wait.
They're all sloths?

536
00:39:46,275 --> 00:39:47,940
You said this was
going to be quick!

537
00:39:47,964 --> 00:39:49,677
What, are you saying just
because he's a sloth

538
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:53,645
he can't be fast? I thought in
Zootopia anyone could be anything.

539
00:39:53,646 --> 00:39:57,876
Flash, Flash, Hundred Yard Dash!
Buddy, it's nice to see you.

540
00:39:57,877 --> 00:40:03,884
Nice to... see you... too.

541
00:40:03,908 --> 00:40:06,063
Hey, Flash, I'd love
you to meet my friend.

542
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:07,835
Ah... Darlin, I've forgotten your name.

543
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:11,515
Hmm. Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD.
How are you?

544
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:13,290
I am...

545
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:16,703
doing... just..

546
00:40:16,735 --> 00:40:22,523
- Fine?
- as well.. as.. I can.. be...

547
00:40:22,524 --> 00:40:23,901
- What...
- Hang in there.

548
00:40:23,902 --> 00:40:27,235
- Can I... do...
- Well, I was hoping you could run a plate...

549
00:40:27,236 --> 00:40:29,542
- for you...
- Well, I was hoping you could...

550
00:40:29,543 --> 00:40:31,383
...today?

551
00:40:33,229 --> 00:40:38,704
Well, I was hoping you could run a plate for us.
We are in a really big hurry.

552
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:43,740
- Sure... What's the... plate...
- 2-9-T...

553
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:48,979
- Number?
- 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.

554
00:40:56,485 --> 00:41:03,066
- 2... 9...
- T-H-D-0-3.

555
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:07,553
- T...
- H-D-0-3.

556
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:11,335
- H...
- D-0-3.

557
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:16,940
- D...
- Mm-hm. 0-3.

558
00:41:18,036 --> 00:41:20,258
- 0...
- 3!

559
00:41:21,831 --> 00:41:24,894
- Hey, Flash. Wanna hear a joke?
- No!

560
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:27,055
- Sure.
- Mmm!

561
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:30,612
What do you call a
three-humped camel?

562
00:41:31,145 --> 00:41:37,971
I don't know.
What do you call...

563
00:41:37,972 --> 00:41:43,194
- Three-humped camel.
- a three-humped... camel?

564
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:46,274
Pregnant.
Ha ha ha ha...

565
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:02,009
Ha ha. Yes, very funny, very funny!
Can we please just focus on the task?

566
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,419
- Hey...
- Wait, wait!

567
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,847
- Priscilla!
- Oh, no!

568
00:42:06,881 --> 00:42:12,144
- Yes... Flash?
- What... do..

569
00:42:12,168 --> 00:42:13,483
- No...
- you call...

570
00:42:13,484 --> 00:42:14,797
A three-humped camel?

571
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:19,282
- Pregnant! Okay! We got it! Please just...
- - three... humped...

572
00:42:30,887 --> 00:42:33,296
- Here... you...
- Yes! Yeah, yeah! Hurry, thank you!

573
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,013
- 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
- ...go.

574
00:42:35,037 --> 00:42:37,829
It's registered to
Tundratown Limo Service.

575
00:42:37,853 --> 00:42:40,199
A limo took Otterton! And
the limo's in Tundratown!

576
00:42:40,223 --> 00:42:41,430
It's in Tundratown!

577
00:42:41,454 --> 00:42:43,194
Way to hustle, bud. I love you.
I owe you.

578
00:42:43,195 --> 00:42:46,695
Hurry! We gotta beat the rush hour and...
It's night?!

579
00:42:47,938 --> 00:42:49,459
Closed.
Great.

580
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:53,397
Mm. And I will betcha
you don't have a warrant to get in, hmm?

581
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:57,177
- Darn it. It's a bummer.
- You wasted the day on purpose.

582
00:42:57,201 --> 00:43:01,430
Ma'am, I have a fake badge. I would never
impede your pretend investigation.

583
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:07,084
It's not a pretend investigation!
Look, see? See him? This otter is missing.

584
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,578
Well, then they should have
gotten a real cop to find him.

585
00:43:09,602 --> 00:43:12,211
What is your problem? Does
seeing me fail somehow make

586
00:43:12,235 --> 00:43:14,875
you feel better about your
own sad, miserable life?

587
00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:16,969
It does, 100%.

588
00:43:16,993 --> 00:43:23,064
Now, since you're sans warrant.
I guess we're done?

589
00:43:24,508 --> 00:43:28,058
Fine. We are done.
Here's your pen.

590
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:36,558
First off, you throw like a bunny.
Second, you're a very sore loser.

591
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:39,346
See you later, Officer Fluff.
So sad this is over.

592
00:43:39,347 --> 00:43:42,872
- I wish I could have helped more.
- The thing is, you don't need...

593
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:45,381
a warrant if you have probable cause,
and I'm pretty sure I saw a...

594
00:43:45,405 --> 00:43:51,140
shifty lowlife climbing the fence.
So you're helping plenty! Come on!

595
00:43:52,717 --> 00:43:56,108
2-9-T-H-D-0-3!
This is it!

596
00:44:04,026 --> 00:44:06,037
Polar bear fur.

597
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:09,730
- Oh my God!
- What? What?

598
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:12,222
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole!

599
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,752
But on CD.
Who still uses CDs?

600
00:44:21,622 --> 00:44:26,143
Carrots, if your otter was here,
he had a very bad day.

601
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:32,326
Those are claw marks.
You ever seen anything like this?

602
00:44:32,327 --> 00:44:34,877
- No.
- Oh, wait. Look!

603
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:41,199
This is him. Emmitt Otterton.
He was definitely here.

604
00:44:41,642 --> 00:44:43,957
What do you think happened?

605
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:49,675
Oh no, wait a minute.
Polar bear fur...

606
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:53,576
Rat-pack music. Fancy cup.
I know whose car this is, we gotta go!

607
00:44:53,577 --> 00:44:56,474
- What? Whose car is it?
- The most feared crime boss in Tundratown.

608
00:44:56,498 --> 00:45:00,082
They call him Mr. Big, and he does not
like me. So we gotta go!

609
00:45:00,082 --> 00:45:01,919
I'm not leaving,
this is a crime scene.

610
00:45:01,943 --> 00:45:03,372
Well, it's gonna be an
even bigger crime scene...

611
00:45:03,396 --> 00:45:06,606
if Mr. Big finds me here,
so we're leaving right now.

612
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:11,204
Raymond! And is that Kevin?
Long time, no see.

613
00:45:11,205 --> 00:45:15,139
And speaking of no see,
how about you forget you saw me?

614
00:45:15,163 --> 00:45:17,038
Huh?
For old times sake?

615
00:45:17,062 --> 00:45:18,830
That's a no..

616
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:33,895
What did you do that made
Mr. Big so mad at you?

617
00:45:33,896 --> 00:45:37,327
I, uh... I may have sold him
a very expensive wall rug

618
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:43,674
that was made from the fur
of a skunk's butt.

619
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:47,152
Oh, sweet cheese 'n crackers.

620
00:46:00,851 --> 00:46:02,719
- Is that Mr. Big?
- No.

621
00:46:02,743 --> 00:46:06,554
- What about him? Is that him?
- No.

622
00:46:08,607 --> 00:46:12,100
- That's gotta be him.
- Stop talking. Stop talking. Stop talking!

623
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,121
Huh.

624
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:22,488
Mr. Big, sir,
this is a simple misunder...

625
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:23,719
Hmmph.

626
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,932
Yeah.

627
00:46:27,036 --> 00:46:29,568
This is a simple misunderstanding.

628
00:46:30,075 --> 00:46:33,311
You come here unannounced on the
day my daughter is to be married.

629
00:46:33,335 --> 00:46:36,351
Well, actually, we were brought here
against our will, so...

630
00:46:37,364 --> 00:46:39,463
Point is, I did not know
that it was your car,

631
00:46:39,487 --> 00:46:42,762
and I certainly did not know about
your daughter's wedding!

632
00:46:43,286 --> 00:46:45,176
I trusted you, Nicky.

633
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,131
I welcomed you into my home.

634
00:46:47,132 --> 00:46:48,990
We broke bread together.

635
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:51,458
Grandmama made you a cannoli.

636
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:54,063
And how did you repay my generosity?

637
00:46:54,087 --> 00:46:58,061
With a rug
made from the butt of a skunk.

638
00:46:58,062 --> 00:46:59,951
A skunk-butt rug.

639
00:46:59,952 --> 00:47:01,586
You disrespected me.

640
00:47:01,587 --> 00:47:03,509
You disrespected my grandmama,

641
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,648
who I buried in that skunk-butt rug.

642
00:47:07,709 --> 00:47:11,489
I told you never to show your face
here again, but here you are.

643
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,925
Snooping around with this...

644
00:47:13,926 --> 00:47:16,457
What are you? A performer?
What's with the costume?

645
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,476
- Sir, I am a co...
- Mime!

646
00:47:18,477 --> 00:47:21,530
She's a mime.
This mime can not speak.

647
00:47:21,554 --> 00:47:23,989
- You can't speak if you're a mime.
- No, I am a cop.

648
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:28,188
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.
And my evidence puts him in your car!

649
00:47:28,189 --> 00:47:31,954
So intimidate me all you want,
I'm going to find out what you did to that otter

650
00:47:31,978 --> 00:47:35,129
if it's the last thing I do.

651
00:47:35,248 --> 00:47:39,233
Hmm.
Then I have only one request.

652
00:47:39,374 --> 00:47:41,851
Say hello to Grandmama.

653
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:43,188
Ice 'em!

654
00:47:43,189 --> 00:47:45,752
No, no, no. I didn't see nothing!
I'm not saying nothing!

655
00:47:45,753 --> 00:47:46,809
And you never will.

656
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,897
Please!
No, no, no, no!

657
00:47:48,921 --> 00:47:51,072
If you're mad at me about
the rug, I've got more rugs!

658
00:47:51,073 --> 00:47:55,416
Daddy! It's time for our dance!

659
00:47:56,069 --> 00:48:00,111
Ah! What did we say?
No icing anyone at my wedding!

660
00:48:00,112 --> 00:48:02,771
I have to, baby,
daddy has to.

661
00:48:02,772 --> 00:48:04,467
- Ice 'em.
- No, no, no!

662
00:48:04,491 --> 00:48:06,104
Wait, wait!

663
00:48:06,105 --> 00:48:10,631
She's the bunny that saved my life yesterday!
From that giant donut!

664
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:13,335
- This bunny?
- Yeah. Hi!

665
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,804
- Hi. I love your dress.
- Oh. Thank you.

666
00:48:17,964 --> 00:48:19,837
Put them down.

667
00:48:21,931 --> 00:48:26,187
You've done me a great service.
I will help you find the otter.

668
00:48:26,233 --> 00:48:30,582
I will take your kindness,
and pay it forward.

669
00:48:48,586 --> 00:48:50,170
Hmm.

670
00:48:57,642 --> 00:49:02,308
Otterton is my florist.
He's like a part of the family.

671
00:49:02,451 --> 00:49:05,221
He had something important
he wanted to discuss.

672
00:49:05,245 --> 00:49:08,655
That's why I sent that
car to pick him up.

673
00:49:08,925 --> 00:49:11,071
But he never arrived.

674
00:49:11,072 --> 00:49:12,481
Because he was attacked.

675
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,237
No, he attacked.

676
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:16,744
Otterton?

677
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,026
Otterton.

678
00:49:18,027 --> 00:49:21,153
He went crazy.
Ripped up the car.

679
00:49:21,177 --> 00:49:26,274
Scared my driver half to death.
And disappeared into the night.

680
00:49:26,298 --> 00:49:29,085
But he's a sweet little otter.

681
00:49:30,302 --> 00:49:37,560
My child, we may be evolved,
but deep down we are still animals.

682
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,039
You wanna find Otterton, talk to
the driver of the car.

683
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:46,423
His name is Manchas.
Lives in the Rainforest District.

684
00:49:46,447 --> 00:49:49,061
Only he can tell you more.

685
00:49:52,417 --> 00:49:54,147
Mr. Manchas?

686
00:49:54,148 --> 00:49:56,037
Judy Hopps, ZPD.

687
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:59,723
We just wanna know what happened
to Emmitt Otterton.

688
00:50:03,955 --> 00:50:08,850
You should be asking
what happened to me.

689
00:50:08,874 --> 00:50:14,348
- Whoa. A teensy otter did that?
- What happened?

690
00:50:14,372 --> 00:50:16,968
He was an animal.

691
00:50:17,769 --> 00:50:20,954
Down on all fours.

692
00:50:23,877 --> 00:50:26,279
He was a savage!

693
00:50:35,621 --> 00:50:39,883
There was no warning.
He just kept yelling about the Night Howlers.

694
00:50:39,884 --> 00:50:42,768
Over and over, the Night Howlers!

695
00:50:42,769 --> 00:50:46,430
So you know about
the Night Howlers too?

696
00:50:46,455 --> 00:50:49,925
Good, good.
Because the Night Howlers are exactly

697
00:50:49,949 --> 00:50:52,775
what we are here
to talk about. Right?

698
00:50:52,776 --> 00:50:57,633
Yes, so you just open the
door and tell us what you know,

699
00:50:57,657 --> 00:50:59,700
and we will tell you what we know.

700
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,161
Okay?

701
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:03,548
Okay.

702
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,735
Clever fox.

703
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:12,980
Mr. Manchas?

704
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:20,062
Are you okay?

705
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:24,425
Run. Run!

706
00:51:28,428 --> 00:51:31,420
- What is wrong with him?!
- I don't know!

707
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:37,159
Jump!

708
00:51:39,274 --> 00:51:40,719
Come on!

709
00:51:45,056 --> 00:51:46,546
Head down!

710
00:51:48,024 --> 00:51:49,626
Officer Hopps to dispatch!

711
00:51:49,627 --> 00:51:52,934
Are you familiar with Gazelle? Greatest
singer of our lifetime. Angel with horns.

712
00:51:52,935 --> 00:51:54,333
Okay, hold on.
Keep watching.

713
00:51:54,357 --> 00:51:56,004
Who's that beside her?
Who is it?

714
00:51:56,005 --> 00:52:00,134
Wow, you are one hot dancer,
Benjamin Clawhauser.

715
00:52:00,406 --> 00:52:04,115
It's me! Did you think it was real?
It looks so real!

716
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:05,769
It's not, it's just a new app.

717
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:07,917
- Hold on a second.
- Clawhauser!

718
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:09,034
Clawhauser, listen to me.

719
00:52:09,058 --> 00:52:11,687
We have a 10-91!
Jaguar gone savage!

720
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,465
- Vine and Tujunga!
- It's Tu-hunga!

721
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:17,284
Okay, we're sending backup!

722
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:22,556
Look, over there!
Head for the sky-trans!

723
00:52:31,108 --> 00:52:34,176
Get in.
Carrots? Carrots!

724
00:52:34,177 --> 00:52:35,359
Go!

725
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:42,027
Buddy, one predator to another.

726
00:52:45,593 --> 00:52:49,510
Now I can tell you're a little tense,
so I'm just gonna give you a little personal space!

727
00:52:55,426 --> 00:52:58,383
Rabbit, whatever you do,
do not let go!

728
00:52:58,407 --> 00:53:00,209
- I'm gonna let go!
- You're gonna to what?

729
00:53:00,233 --> 00:53:02,753
One, two...

730
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:11,525
Carrots, you saved my life.

731
00:53:11,549 --> 00:53:16,028
Well, that's what we do at the ZPD...
Awww...

732
00:53:31,163 --> 00:53:33,565
Well, this should be good.

733
00:53:34,496 --> 00:53:37,636
I thought this was just a missing mammal case,
but it's way bigger.

734
00:53:37,637 --> 00:53:39,912
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.

735
00:53:39,913 --> 00:53:42,732
I believe he and this jaguar,
they...

736
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:44,008
They went savage, sir.

737
00:53:44,032 --> 00:53:48,246
Savage? This isn't the stone age, Hopps.
Animals don't go savage.

738
00:53:48,247 --> 00:53:50,200
I thought so too.

739
00:53:50,201 --> 00:53:52,603
Till I saw this.

740
00:53:53,727 --> 00:53:54,976
What?

741
00:53:54,977 --> 00:53:56,352
He was right here!

742
00:53:56,376 --> 00:53:58,566
The savage jaguar?

743
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:00,905
Sir, I know what I saw.
He almost killed us!

744
00:54:00,906 --> 00:54:06,371
Or maybe any agressive predator
looks savage to rabbits?

745
00:54:06,395 --> 00:54:07,377
Let's go!

746
00:54:07,401 --> 00:54:08,373
Wait! Sir!

747
00:54:08,374 --> 00:54:10,776
I'm not the only one who saw him.

748
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,231
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?

749
00:54:14,255 --> 00:54:15,627
Well, he was a key witness, and I...

750
00:54:15,651 --> 00:54:19,578
Two days to find the otter,
or you quit.

751
00:54:19,602 --> 00:54:22,260
That was the deal.

752
00:54:22,284 --> 00:54:24,488
Badge.

753
00:54:29,207 --> 00:54:31,070
- But, sir, we had...
- Badge!

754
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:37,802
Uh, no.

755
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:43,500
- What did you say, fox?
- Sorry, what I said was "no...".

756
00:54:43,524 --> 00:54:45,926
She will not be giving you that badge.

757
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:49,938
Look, you gave her a clown vest,
and a three-wheeled joke-mobile,

758
00:54:49,962 --> 00:54:53,917
and two days to solve a case
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?

759
00:54:53,918 --> 00:54:56,289
Yeah, it's no wonder she needed
to get help from a fox.

760
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:58,653
None of you guys were gonna help her,
were you?

761
00:54:58,677 --> 00:55:00,059
Here's the thing, chief.

762
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:03,651
You gave her the 48 hours,
so technically we still have...

763
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:07,283
ten left to find our Mr. Otterton.
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.

764
00:55:07,284 --> 00:55:12,699
So if you'll excuse us, we have a very
big lead to follow and a case to crack.

765
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,464
Good day.

766
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:21,839
Officer Hopps.

767
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:44,041
Thank you.

768
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,622
Never let them see that they get to you.

769
00:55:48,404 --> 00:55:50,006
So...

770
00:55:50,007 --> 00:55:52,506
Things do get to you?

771
00:55:52,507 --> 00:55:53,977
I mean not, not anymore.

772
00:55:54,399 --> 00:55:59,269
But I was small and emotionally
unbalanced like you once.

773
00:55:59,298 --> 00:56:02,372
- Har har.
- No, it's true.

774
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:06,076
I think I was 8, or maybe 9...

775
00:56:05,148 --> 00:56:10,390
And all I wanted to do was join
the Junior Ranger Scouts.

776
00:56:10,414 --> 00:56:14,835
So my mom scaped together enough money
to buy me a brand new uniform.

777
00:56:14,865 --> 00:56:17,690
Because, by god, I
was gonna fit in.

778
00:56:17,714 --> 00:56:22,467
Even if I was the only predator
in the troop, the only fox.

779
00:56:22,491 --> 00:56:24,825
I was gonna be part of a pack.

780
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:28,093
- Ready for initiation?
- Yeah. Pretty much born ready.

781
00:56:28,117 --> 00:56:30,104
I was so proud.

782
00:56:32,026 --> 00:56:32,787
Okay. Now raise your right
paw, and deliver the oath.

783
00:56:34,732 --> 00:56:41,387
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave,
loyal, helpful and trustworthy.

784
00:56:43,332 --> 00:56:46,760
Even though you're a fox?

785
00:56:46,784 --> 00:56:48,678
What?

786
00:56:49,726 --> 00:56:52,419
No, no! What did I
do wrong, you guys?

787
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:56,703
No, please! What did I do wrong?
What did I do?

788
00:56:57,396 --> 00:57:00,523
If you thought we would ever
trust a fox without a muzzle?

789
00:57:00,547 --> 00:57:03,201
You're even dumber than you look.

790
00:57:04,694 --> 00:57:07,307
Is he gonna cry?

791
00:57:22,213 --> 00:57:24,614
I learned two things that day.

792
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,379
One:

793
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,939
I was never gonna let anyone
see that they got to me.

794
00:57:30,867 --> 00:57:33,238
And two?

795
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:38,334
If the world's only gonna see
a fox as shifty and untrustworthy...

796
00:57:38,335 --> 00:57:41,379
There's no point in trying
to be anything else.

797
00:57:41,476 --> 00:57:45,361
Nick, you are so much more than that.

798
00:57:48,815 --> 00:57:50,664
Boy, look at that
traffic down there.

799
00:57:50,688 --> 00:57:52,263
How about we go up to
Chuck in traffic central?

800
00:57:52,287 --> 00:57:55,074
Chuck, how are things looking
on the jam cams?

801
00:57:55,098 --> 00:57:57,499
Nick, I'm glad you told me.

802
00:57:58,014 --> 00:57:59,680
The jam cams...

803
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:01,891
- Seriously, it's okay.
- No, no no!

804
00:58:01,892 --> 00:58:06,827
There are traffic cameras everywhere.
All over the canopy!

805
00:58:06,828 --> 00:58:09,873
- Whatever happened to that jaguar...
- The traffic cameras would have caught it!

806
00:58:09,897 --> 00:58:12,724
- Bingo!
- Ho-ho! Pretty sneaky, slick!

807
00:58:12,748 --> 00:58:16,286
However, if you didn't have
access to the system before,

808
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:19,680
I doubt chief Buffalo Butt is
gonna let you into it now.

809
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:24,163
No. But I have a friend
at City Hall who might.

810
00:58:24,872 --> 00:58:27,960
Eh. Sir, if we could just review
these very important billings.

811
00:58:27,961 --> 00:58:30,233
Sir! Oh, I'm sorry.
Sir.

812
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:33,813
Okay! I heard you, Bellwether,
just take care of it!

813
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:36,309
Please.
And clear my afternoon, I'm going out.

814
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,105
Oh, no, no. But, sir, you do
have a meeting with

815
00:58:38,129 --> 00:58:40,865
Herds and Gradings.
Sir, that's just, oh...

816
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:44,260
Oh, mutton chops.

817
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:48,460
Assistant Mayor Bellwether,
we need your help.

818
00:58:48,395 --> 00:58:49,805
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT MAYOR

819
00:58:49,423 --> 00:58:52,428
We just need to get into
the traffic cam database.

820
00:59:00,005 --> 00:59:01,873
- So fluffy!
- Hey!

821
00:59:01,897 --> 00:59:05,649
- Sheep never let me get this close!
- You can't just touch a sheep's wool!

822
00:59:05,673 --> 00:59:07,548
- It's like cotton candy.
- Stop it!

823
00:59:07,572 --> 00:59:09,037
Where to?

824
00:59:09,061 --> 00:59:11,880
Ah... Rainforest Dsitrict.
Vine and Tujunga.

825
00:59:11,891 --> 00:59:14,165
There.
Traffic cams for the whole city.

826
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:16,189
This is so exiting actually.
I mean, well, you know.

827
00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:18,204
I never get to do
anything this important.

828
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:20,287
But you're the assistant mayor of Zootopia.

829
00:59:20,288 --> 00:59:22,947
Oh.
I'm more of a glorified secretary.

830
00:59:22,971 --> 00:59:25,360
I think Mayor Lionheart just
wanted the sheep vote.

831
00:59:25,384 --> 00:59:27,067
But he did give me that nice mug.

832
00:59:27,068 --> 00:59:28,665
WORLD'S GREATEST ASSISTANT MAYOR DAD

833
00:59:28,689 --> 00:59:30,639
Feels good to be appreciated.

834
00:59:30,663 --> 00:59:31,740
Smellwether!

835
00:59:31,764 --> 00:59:34,751
Ah.
That's a fun little name he likes to use.

836
00:59:34,775 --> 00:59:37,937
I called him Lionfart once,
he did not care for that.

837
00:59:37,961 --> 00:59:39,365
Let me tell you, it was
not a good day for me.

838
00:59:39,389 --> 00:59:41,677
- Yes, sir.
- I thought you were gonna cancel my afternoon.

839
00:59:41,701 --> 00:59:45,035
Oh, dear. I better go.
Let me know what you find.

840
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:47,410
It was really nice for me to be...

841
00:59:47,435 --> 00:59:49,836
While we're young, Smellwether.

842
00:59:51,313 --> 00:59:53,265
You think when she goes
to sleep she counts herself?

843
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:55,292
Shush.
Okay, traffic cams..

844
00:59:55,293 --> 00:59:56,860
Tujunga... Tujunga...

845
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,484
We're in.

846
01:00:03,557 --> 01:00:08,147
- Who are these guys?
- Eh. Timberwolves.

847
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,573
Look at these dum-dums.

848
01:00:12,272 --> 01:00:13,328
Huh!

849
01:00:13,556 --> 01:00:16,120
Bet you a nickel one of them's gonna howl.

850
01:00:16,121 --> 01:00:17,081
And there it is.

851
01:00:17,105 --> 01:00:20,468
I mean, what is it with wolves
and the howling, it's...?

852
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,482
Howlings!
Night Howlers!

853
01:00:22,506 --> 01:00:26,206
That's what Manchas was afraid of, wolves!
The wolves are the Night Howlers!

854
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:29,088
- If they took Manchas..
- I bet they took Otterton too.

855
01:00:29,112 --> 01:00:31,860
All we gotta do is find out
where they went.

856
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:39,459
Wait, where'd they go?

857
01:00:39,483 --> 01:00:43,415
You know, if I wanted to avoid surveillance
because I was doing something illegal,

858
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:46,408
which I never have, I would use the
maintenance tunnel 6B.

859
01:00:46,432 --> 01:00:49,868
Which would put them out...
right there.

860
01:00:50,223 --> 01:00:53,339
Well, look at you, junior detective.

861
01:00:53,363 --> 01:00:57,529
You know, I think you'd actually
make a pretty good cop.

862
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:59,580
Eh. How dare you.

863
01:00:59,581 --> 01:01:02,075
Acacia Alley. Ficus Underpass.

864
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:03,202
South canyon.

865
01:01:03,203 --> 01:01:05,093
Mm-hm.
They're heading out of town.

866
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:07,522
Where does that road go?

867
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:51,662
Gary, quit it!
You're gonna start a howl!

868
01:01:51,663 --> 01:01:53,482
I didn't start it.

869
01:01:59,933 --> 01:02:01,462
Come on.

870
01:02:08,714 --> 01:02:11,440
You are a clever bunny.

871
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:30,145
It looks like this was a hospital.

872
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:44,320
You know, after you,
you're the cop.

873
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,899
Okay, all clear.

874
01:02:57,495 --> 01:03:01,340
Ha.
All this equipment is brand new.

875
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:04,188
Carrots.

876
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:07,179
Claw marks.

877
01:03:07,203 --> 01:03:10,665
Yeah, huge, huge claw marks.
What kind of...

878
01:03:28,328 --> 01:03:30,569
Mr. Manchas.

879
01:03:39,802 --> 01:03:42,941
It's him!
We found our otter.

880
01:03:43,424 --> 01:03:46,565
Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer Judy Hopps.

881
01:03:46,566 --> 01:03:48,423
Your wife sent me to find you.

882
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:50,482
We're gonna get you out of here now.

883
01:03:51,052 --> 01:03:52,590
Or not.

884
01:03:52,591 --> 01:03:55,122
Guess he's in no rush
to get home to the missus.

885
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,396
11, 12, 13, 14.

886
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:00,464
Not including Manchas,
it's... it's fourteen.

887
01:04:00,488 --> 01:04:03,349
Chief Bogo handed out 14 missing mammal files.

888
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:04,705
They're all here...

889
01:04:04,706 --> 01:04:08,570
All the missing mammals are right here.
Huh!

890
01:04:13,155 --> 01:04:14,412
Enough!

891
01:04:14,436 --> 01:04:16,986
I don't want excuses, doctor,
I want answers.

892
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:20,190
Mayor Lionheart, please.
We're doing everything we can.

893
01:04:20,214 --> 01:04:21,248
Really?

894
01:04:21,272 --> 01:04:24,670
Cause I got a dozen and a half animals here
who've gone off the rails crazy,

895
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,563
And you can't tell me why.

896
01:04:26,587 --> 01:04:29,233
Now I'd call that awfully far
from doing everything!

897
01:04:29,257 --> 01:04:32,342
Sir, it may be time to consider their biology.

898
01:04:32,366 --> 01:04:34,287
What?
What do you mean "biology"?

899
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:36,940
The only animals going savage are predators.

900
01:04:36,964 --> 01:04:40,403
We cannot keep it a secret.
We need to come forward.

901
01:04:40,427 --> 01:04:42,809
Hm, great idea.
Tell the public.

902
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:47,662
And how do you think they're gonna feel
about their mayor who is a lion?!

903
01:04:47,686 --> 01:04:50,299
- I'll be ruined!
- Well, what does Chief Bogo say?

904
01:04:50,323 --> 01:04:56,213
Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we
are going to keep it that way.

905
01:04:56,237 --> 01:04:57,391
Oh, no!

906
01:04:57,415 --> 01:04:59,929
- Someone's here.
- Sir, you need to go. Now.

907
01:04:59,953 --> 01:05:02,253
Security, sweep the area.

908
01:05:09,486 --> 01:05:10,762
Great, we're dead.

909
01:05:10,763 --> 01:05:13,870
We're dead. That's it. I'm dead.
You're dead. Everybody's dead.

910
01:05:13,871 --> 01:05:15,095
- Can you swim?
- What?

911
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,328
Can I swim?
Yes, I can swim. Why?

912
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:27,669
Aaahhhh!

913
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:40,864
Carrots!
Hopps! Judy!

914
01:05:41,222 --> 01:05:43,426
We gotta tell Bogo!

915
01:05:43,903 --> 01:05:48,485
Wow, you are one hot dancer, Chief Bogo.

916
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:52,083
- Chief Bogo!
- Not now.

917
01:05:52,107 --> 01:05:54,221
- Wait, is that Gazelle?
- No!

918
01:05:54,222 --> 01:05:57,217
I'm Gazelle, and you
are one hot dancer.

919
01:05:57,241 --> 01:06:01,454
You have the app too?
Ooohhh... Chief!

920
01:06:01,478 --> 01:06:04,419
Clawhauser! Can't you see I'm working
on the missing mammal cases?

921
01:06:04,443 --> 01:06:06,429
Oh! Yes, of course.
About that, sir.

922
01:06:06,453 --> 01:06:09,647
Officer Hopps just called,
she found all of them.

923
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:12,072
Wow, I'm impressed.

924
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:16,834
Mayor Lionheart, you have the right
to remain silent. Anything you...

925
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:19,833
You don't understand,
I was trying to protect the city!

926
01:06:19,857 --> 01:06:21,918
You were just trying
to protect your job.

927
01:06:21,942 --> 01:06:25,046
No, listen. We still don't
know why this is happening.

928
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:26,960
It could destroy Zootopia.

929
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:28,687
You have the right
to remain silent.

930
01:06:28,711 --> 01:06:31,848
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

931
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:38,499
Ladies and gentlemammals,

932
01:06:38,523 --> 01:06:42,093
14 mammals went missing and
all 14 have been found...

933
01:06:42,117 --> 01:06:46,137
by our newest recruit,
who will speak to you in a moment.

934
01:06:46,818 --> 01:06:50,118
- I'm so nervous.
- Okay, press conference 101.

935
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:52,734
You wanna look smart, answer their question
with your own question

936
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:54,892
and then answer that question.

937
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:59,069
Like this: "Excuse me, Officer Hopps.
What can you tell us about the case?"

938
01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:02,746
"Well, was this a tough case?
Yes, yes it was. You see?"

939
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:04,756
You should be
up there with me.

940
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,115
We did this together.

941
01:07:06,139 --> 01:07:09,638
Well, am I a cop?
No. No, I am not.

942
01:07:09,662 --> 01:07:11,664
Funny you should say that.

943
01:07:11,688 --> 01:07:18,848
Because, well, I've been thinking.
It would be nice to have a partner.

944
01:07:22,548 --> 01:07:25,900
Here. In case you need
something to write with.

945
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:33,473
Officer Hopps.
It's time.

946
01:07:37,026 --> 01:07:42,209
So now, I'll turn things over to the officer
who cracked the case.

947
01:07:42,233 --> 01:07:44,624
Officer Judy Hopps.

948
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:49,356
Yes?

949
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:51,079
What can you tell us about
the animals that went savage?

950
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:56,021
Well, the animals in question...
Emm.

951
01:07:58,351 --> 01:08:03,672
Are they all different species?
Yes. Yes, they are.

952
01:08:03,971 --> 01:08:05,819
Okay, so what is the connection?

953
01:08:05,843 --> 01:08:09,966
Oh. All we know is that they are all
members of the predator family.

954
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:12,809
So predators are the
only ones going savage?

955
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:14,931
That is accu..
Yes, that is accurate, yes.

956
01:08:14,955 --> 01:08:18,814
- Why? Why is this happening?
- We still don't know.

957
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:24,303
But, emm.
It may have something to do with biology.

958
01:08:24,327 --> 01:08:25,958
What do you mean, biology?

959
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:31,616
A biological component.
You know, something in their DNA.

960
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:34,205
In their DNA,
can you elaborate on that, please?

961
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:38,862
Yes. What I mean is
thousands of years ago

962
01:08:38,886 --> 01:08:46,043
Eh, predators survived through their...
agressive hunting instincts.

963
01:08:46,067 --> 01:08:51,808
For whatever reason, they seem to be
reverting back to their primitive, savage ways.

964
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:57,521
Officer Hopps, could
it happen again?

965
01:08:57,545 --> 01:09:00,661
It is possible.
So, we must be vigilant.

966
01:09:00,662 --> 01:09:04,923
And we at the ZPD are prepered
and are here to protect you.

967
01:09:04,288 --> 01:09:07,109
- Will more mammals go savage?
- What is being done to protect us?

968
01:09:07,169 --> 01:09:08,934
Have you considered a mandatory
quarantine on predators?

969
01:09:08,802 --> 01:09:10,954
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.

970
01:09:10,978 --> 01:09:14,103
That's all the time that we have.
No more questions.

971
01:09:16,271 --> 01:09:19,287
- Was I okay?
- Oh, you did fine.

972
01:09:20,213 --> 01:09:21,887
That went so fast, I
didn't get a chance to

973
01:09:21,911 --> 01:09:23,681
mention you or say anything
about how we...

974
01:09:23,705 --> 01:09:26,557
Oh, I think you said plenty.

975
01:09:26,558 --> 01:09:27,745
What do you mean?

976
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:30,450
"Clearly there's a
biological component?"

977
01:09:30,474 --> 01:09:35,244
"These predators may be reverting back
to their primitive, savage ways?"

978
01:09:35,268 --> 01:09:36,993
Are you serious?

979
01:09:37,016 --> 01:09:39,390
I just stated the
facts of the case.

980
01:09:39,414 --> 01:09:41,877
I mean, it's not like a
bunny could go savage.

981
01:09:41,901 --> 01:09:43,994
Right, but a fox could? Huh?

982
01:09:43,995 --> 01:09:48,077
- Nick, stop it, you're not like them.
- Oh, there's a 'them' now?

983
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:51,012
You know what I mean,
you're not that kind of predator.

984
01:09:51,013 --> 01:09:52,547
The kind that needs
to be muzzled?

985
01:09:52,571 --> 01:09:56,782
The kind that makes you think you need
to carry around fox repellant?

986
01:09:56,783 --> 01:10:00,019
Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that
little item the first time we met.

987
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:03,768
Look. Let me ask you a question.
Are you afraid of me?

988
01:10:04,956 --> 01:10:07,124
Do you think I might go nuts?

989
01:10:07,551 --> 01:10:12,944
You think I might go savage?
You think I might try to eat you?

990
01:10:12,968 --> 01:10:14,083
Huh!

991
01:10:16,422 --> 01:10:18,113
I knew it, huh.

992
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:22,358
Just when I thought somebody
actually believed in me, huh?

993
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:26,324
Probably best if you don't have
a predator as a partner.

994
01:10:31,207 --> 01:10:33,590
No, Nick.
Nick!

995
01:10:33,614 --> 01:10:35,924
Officer Hopps, were you just
threatened by that predator?

996
01:10:35,948 --> 01:10:37,527
No, he's my friend.

997
01:10:37,551 --> 01:10:39,504
We can't even trust our own friends?

998
01:10:39,528 --> 01:10:41,269
That is not what I said.
Please.

999
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:44,153
- Are we safe?
- Have any other foxes gone savage?

1000
01:10:44,154 --> 01:10:48,575
More bad news in this city gripped by fear.
A caribou is in critical condition.

1001
01:10:48,576 --> 01:10:51,076
The victim of a mauling by
a savage polar bear.

1002
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:55,574
This, the 27th such attack,
comes just one week after ZPD Officer,

1003
01:10:55,598 --> 01:11:00,294
Judy Hopps connected the violence
to traditionally predatory animals.

1004
01:11:00,318 --> 01:11:05,132
Meanwhile, a peace rally organized by
popstar Gazelle was marred by protest.

1005
01:11:05,156 --> 01:11:08,910
- Go back to the forest, predator!
- I am from the savannah.

1006
01:11:08,934 --> 01:11:11,011
Zootopia is a unique place.

1007
01:11:11,012 --> 01:11:17,013
It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city.
Where we celebrate our differences.

1008
01:11:17,038 --> 01:11:19,568
This is not the Zootopia I know.

1009
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:23,103
The Zootopia I know
is better than this.

1010
01:11:23,127 --> 01:11:25,851
We don't just blindly assign blame.

1011
01:11:30,115 --> 01:11:32,911
We don't know why these
attacks keep happening.

1012
01:11:32,935 --> 01:11:37,381
But it's irresponsible to label all
predators as savages.

1013
01:11:42,934 --> 01:11:45,336
It's not my Emmitt.

1014
01:11:47,632 --> 01:11:50,197
We cannot let fear divide us.

1015
01:11:50,221 --> 01:11:55,062
Please give me back the Zootopia I love.

1016
01:11:57,357 --> 01:12:00,264
Come on, Hopps.
The new mayor wants to see us.

1017
01:12:00,288 --> 01:12:03,071
The mayor?
Why?

1018
01:12:03,095 --> 01:12:05,638
It would seem you've arrived.

1019
01:12:08,831 --> 01:12:12,124
Clawhauser?
What are you doing?

1020
01:12:12,148 --> 01:12:16,792
Uh. They thought it would be
better if a predator

1021
01:12:16,816 --> 01:12:20,181
such as myself wasn't the first face
that you see

1022
01:12:20,205 --> 01:12:22,369
when you walk into the ZPD.

1023
01:12:22,393 --> 01:12:23,788
What?

1024
01:12:23,831 --> 01:12:27,940
They're gonna move me to records.
It's downstairs.

1025
01:12:27,998 --> 01:12:30,039
It's by the boiler.

1026
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:33,171
Hopps1

1027
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,474
Integrity Honesty Bravery

1028
01:12:38,498 --> 01:12:41,275
Emm.
I don't understand.

1029
01:12:41,299 --> 01:12:43,870
Our city is 90% prey, Judy,

1030
01:12:43,894 --> 01:12:47,397
and right now
they're just really scared.

1031
01:12:47,421 --> 01:12:50,381
You're a hero to them.
They trust you.

1032
01:12:50,405 --> 01:12:57,249
And so that's why Chief Bogo and I
want you to be the public face of the ZPD.

1033
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:06,379
I'm... not...
I'm not a hero.

1034
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:10,049
I came here to make the world
a better place. But...

1035
01:13:10,241 --> 01:13:11,861
...I think I broke it.

1036
01:13:11,885 --> 01:13:15,729
Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps.

1037
01:13:15,753 --> 01:13:19,966
The world has always been broken,
that's why we need good cops.

1038
01:13:20,874 --> 01:13:22,884
Like you.

1039
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:31,979
With all due respect, sir,
a good cop is supposed to serve and protect.

1040
01:13:32,003 --> 01:13:36,481
Help the city.
Not tear it apart.

1041
01:13:39,952 --> 01:13:43,572
- I don't deserve this badge.
- Hopps.

1042
01:13:43,573 --> 01:13:46,586
Judy, you've worked so hard
to get here.

1043
01:13:46,586 --> 01:13:48,861
It's what you've wanted since
you were a kid.

1044
01:13:48,862 --> 01:13:50,950
You can't quit.

1045
01:13:50,974 --> 01:13:53,376
Thank you for the opportunity.

1046
01:14:11,618 --> 01:14:14,339
A dozen carrots.
Have a nice day.

1047
01:14:14,363 --> 01:14:15,624
Come on.

1048
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,674
Hey there, Jude.
Jude the Dude.

1049
01:14:23,698 --> 01:14:26,781
Remember that one?
How we doing?

1050
01:14:26,805 --> 01:14:30,495
- I'm fine.
- You are not fine, your ears are droopy.

1051
01:14:31,265 --> 01:14:33,400
Why did I think I could
make a difference?

1052
01:14:33,424 --> 01:14:37,138
- Because you're a trier, that's why.
- You've always been a trier.

1053
01:14:37,162 --> 01:14:38,892
Oh, I tried.

1054
01:14:38,893 --> 01:14:43,025
And it made life so much worse
for so many innocent predators.

1055
01:14:43,049 --> 01:14:46,696
Oh, not all of them, though.
Speak of the devil. Right on time.

1056
01:14:47,931 --> 01:14:50,718
Is that Gideon Grey?

1057
01:14:50,742 --> 01:14:52,853
Yeah, it sure is.
We work with him now.

1058
01:14:52,877 --> 01:14:55,174
He's our partner. And we never
would have considered it,

1059
01:14:55,174 --> 01:14:57,153
- had you not opened our minds.
- That's right.

1060
01:14:57,177 --> 01:15:00,867
I mean, kid's turned into one of the
top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.

1061
01:15:02,241 --> 01:15:06,500
That's...
That's really cool, you guys.

1062
01:15:07,138 --> 01:15:09,893
Gideon Grey. I'll be darned.

1063
01:15:09,917 --> 01:15:14,367
Hey, Judy. I'd just like to say I'm sorry
for the way I behaved in my youth.

1064
01:15:14,391 --> 01:15:17,423
I had a lot of self-doubt,
and it manifested itself

1065
01:15:17,447 --> 01:15:20,079
in the form of unchecked
rage and agression.

1066
01:15:20,103 --> 01:15:22,537
I was a major jerk.

1067
01:15:22,931 --> 01:15:26,185
Well, I know a thing or two
about being a jerk.

1068
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:30,924
Anyhow, I brought you all these pies.

1069
01:15:31,072 --> 01:15:34,255
Hey, kids! Don't you run through that
midnicampum holicithias.

1070
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,316
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1071
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:37,334
Well, now. There's a
four-dollar word, Mr. H.

1072
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:40,403
My family always just
call them Night Howlers.

1073
01:15:41,231 --> 01:15:42,801
I'm sorry.
What did you say?

1074
01:15:42,802 --> 01:15:44,692
Oh.
Kid's talking about those flowers, Judy.

1075
01:15:44,693 --> 01:15:48,064
I use them to keep the bugs off the produce,
but I don't like the little ones going near them

1076
01:15:48,088 --> 01:15:49,595
on acoount of what happened
to your uncle Terry.

1077
01:15:49,619 --> 01:15:52,746
Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids
and went completely nuts.

1078
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:55,236
He bit the dickens out of your mother.

1079
01:15:55,237 --> 01:15:57,704
A bunny can go savage.

1080
01:15:57,705 --> 01:16:01,037
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.
But it did hurt like the devil.

1081
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:04,957
Well, sure it did. There's a sizable
divot in your arm. I'd call that savage.

1082
01:16:04,981 --> 01:16:08,281
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're flowers.

1083
01:16:08,282 --> 01:16:11,238
The flowers are making the predators go savage.

1084
01:16:11,262 --> 01:16:13,642
That's it! That's what
I've been missing!

1085
01:16:13,666 --> 01:16:16,495
Oh, keys! Keys! Keys! Keys!
Hurry, come on!

1086
01:16:16,519 --> 01:16:19,822
Oh. Thank you!
I love you, bye!

1087
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:26,322
- You catch any of that, Bon?
- Not one bit.

1088
01:16:26,346 --> 01:16:27,833
That makes me feel a little bit better,

1089
01:16:27,857 --> 01:16:30,675
I thought she was talking in
tongues or something.

1090
01:16:46,555 --> 01:16:48,152
Who is it?

1091
01:16:48,176 --> 01:16:51,117
I need to find Nick.
Please.

1092
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:53,767
Nick?

1093
01:16:53,986 --> 01:16:55,744
Nick?

1094
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,338
Oh, Nick.

1095
01:16:59,339 --> 01:17:03,409
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're toxic flowers.

1096
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:07,554
I think someone is targetting predators
on purpose and making them go savage.

1097
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:12,050
Wow.
Isn't that interesting?

1098
01:17:13,954 --> 01:17:17,222
Wait, please don't..
I know you'll never forgive me.

1099
01:17:17,223 --> 01:17:19,113
And I don't blame you.

1100
01:17:19,114 --> 01:17:21,515
I wouldn't forgive me either.

1101
01:17:21,743 --> 01:17:27,028
It was ignorant, and irresponsible,
and small-minded.

1102
01:17:27,864 --> 01:17:30,943
But predators shouldn't suffer
because of my mistakes.

1103
01:17:31,294 --> 01:17:33,664
I have to fix this.

1104
01:17:33,665 --> 01:17:36,218
But I can't do it without you.

1105
01:17:36,716 --> 01:17:40,305
And...
And after we're done...

1106
01:17:40,909 --> 01:17:43,641
you can hate me.
And...

1107
01:17:43,665 --> 01:17:45,291
And that'll be fine.

1108
01:17:45,315 --> 01:17:50,558
Because I was a horrible
friend and I hurt you.

1109
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:56,217
And you can walk away knowing
that you were right. All along.

1110
01:17:56,550 --> 01:18:00,299
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1111
01:18:04,056 --> 01:18:07,522
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1112
01:18:09,209 --> 01:18:12,606
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1113
01:18:12,606 --> 01:18:17,362
Don't worry, Carrots,
I'll let you erase it. In 48 hours.

1114
01:18:19,068 --> 01:18:21,565
All right, get in here.

1115
01:18:23,568 --> 01:18:27,414
Okay. Oh, you bunnies.
You're so emotional.

1116
01:18:27,438 --> 01:18:29,839
There we go, deep breath.

1117
01:18:29,863 --> 01:18:32,103
Are you-Are you just
trying to steal the pen?

1118
01:18:32,127 --> 01:18:33,971
Is that what this is?

1119
01:18:34,498 --> 01:18:37,602
- You are standing on my tail, though. Off, off!
- I'm sorry.

1120
01:18:37,626 --> 01:18:39,764
HOPPS
FAMILY FARM

1121
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:45,536
I thought you guys only grew carrots.
Mmph.

1122
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,480
- What's your plan?
- We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.

1123
01:18:48,504 --> 01:18:49,828
Okay, how?

1124
01:18:49,852 --> 01:18:53,246
- Know this guy?
- Uh-huh. I told you, I know everybody.

1125
01:18:53,247 --> 01:18:55,775
Ha-ha. Well, hello!
Step right up.

1126
01:18:55,799 --> 01:18:57,669
Anything you need, I got it.

1127
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:59,240
All your favorite movies.

1128
01:18:59,241 --> 01:19:01,739
I've got movies that
haven't even been released yet.

1129
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:03,553
Hey, 15% off.
20!

1130
01:19:03,577 --> 01:19:05,438
Make me an offer.
Come on!

1131
01:19:05,462 --> 01:19:08,833
Well, well, look who it is,
the Duke of Bootleg.

1132
01:19:08,857 --> 01:19:09,975
What's it to you, Wilde?

1133
01:19:09,999 --> 01:19:11,877
Shouldn't you be melting down
a Pawpsicle or something?

1134
01:19:11,901 --> 01:19:14,337
Hey, if it isn't
flopsy the copsie.

1135
01:19:14,361 --> 01:19:17,421
We both know those weren't only
onions I caught you stealing.

1136
01:19:17,445 --> 01:19:19,688
What were you gonna do with
those Night Howlers, Weselton?

1137
01:19:19,689 --> 01:19:23,835
It's Weaselton, Duke Weaselton.
And I ain't talking, rabbit.

1138
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:26,582
And there ain't nothing
you can do to make me.

1139
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:28,802
Ice him.

1140
01:19:28,826 --> 01:19:31,690
Ahhh!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ah!

1141
01:19:31,714 --> 01:19:34,271
You dirty rat, why are you helping her?
She's a cop!

1142
01:19:34,272 --> 01:19:37,165
And the godmother to
my future granddaughter.

1143
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,848
- I'm gonna name her Judy.
- Ohhhh...

1144
01:19:39,872 --> 01:19:41,827
Heh heh heh.
Ice this weasel.

1145
01:19:41,851 --> 01:19:44,440
Aww! All right, all right!
Please! I'll talk. I'll talk.

1146
01:19:44,464 --> 01:19:46,117
I stole the Night Howlers
so I could sell them.

1147
01:19:46,141 --> 01:19:49,110
They offered me what I
couldn't refuse: Money.

1148
01:19:49,111 --> 01:19:51,129
And to whom did you sell them?

1149
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:54,095
A ram named Doug. We got
a drop spot underground.

1150
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:57,483
Just watch it.
Doug is the opposite of friendly.

1151
01:19:57,509 --> 01:19:59,750
He's unfriendly.

1152
01:20:09,136 --> 01:20:10,506
Come on.

1153
01:20:22,925 --> 01:20:24,680
The weasel wasn't lying.

1154
01:20:24,704 --> 01:20:28,037
Yeah, it looks like old Doug's cornered
the market on Night Howlers.

1155
01:21:10,007 --> 01:21:12,898
You got Doug here.
What's the mark?

1156
01:21:13,308 --> 01:21:17,706
Cheetah in Sahara Square.
Got it.

1157
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:20,528
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast,
I can hit him.

1158
01:21:20,552 --> 01:21:25,397
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter
through the open window of a moving car.

1159
01:21:37,834 --> 01:21:41,150
Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done.
Or you'll see it on the news.

1160
01:21:41,174 --> 01:21:43,151
You know, whichever comes first.

1161
01:21:43,175 --> 01:21:46,329
Hey, Doug, open up!
We've got your latte.

1162
01:21:46,353 --> 01:21:49,709
All right, Woolter and Jesse are back,
so I'm leaving now. Out.

1163
01:21:49,733 --> 01:21:51,709
Hey. Wait, where you going?
Where are you going? Get back here!

1164
01:21:51,733 --> 01:21:53,876
What are you doing?
He's gonna see you!

1165
01:21:54,237 --> 01:21:55,782
What are you looking at?
Hey!

1166
01:21:55,806 --> 01:21:57,469
Whatever you're thinking,
stop thinking it.

1167
01:21:57,493 --> 01:22:00,653
Carrots.
Carrots.

1168
01:22:00,677 --> 01:22:02,501
You better have the
extra foam this time.

1169
01:22:02,525 --> 01:22:03,513
HA!

1170
01:22:05,651 --> 01:22:06,665
Hey!
Open up!

1171
01:22:06,689 --> 01:22:09,124
What are you doing? You
just trapped us in here!

1172
01:22:09,148 --> 01:22:11,040
We need to get this
evidence to the ZPD.

1173
01:22:11,064 --> 01:22:14,139
- Okay, great. Here it is. Got it.
- No, all of it.

1174
01:22:14,163 --> 01:22:15,648
Wait, what?

1175
01:22:18,237 --> 01:22:20,195
Oh, great, you're a
conductor now, huh?

1176
01:22:20,219 --> 01:22:24,522
Hey. Listen. It would take a miracle
to get this rustbucket going.

1177
01:22:25,551 --> 01:22:27,199
Well.
Hallelujah.

1178
01:22:27,223 --> 01:22:32,221
We kinda got a situation at the lab.
It just got worse!

1179
01:22:33,018 --> 01:22:34,315
Mission accomplished.

1180
01:22:34,339 --> 01:22:36,742
Would it be premature for me to
do a little victory toot-toot?

1181
01:22:36,766 --> 01:22:39,456
All right.
One toot-toot.

1182
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,619
Well, I can cross that off
the bucket list.

1183
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:56,869
I may have to rescind
that victory toot-toot.

1184
01:22:58,339 --> 01:23:00,368
Maybe that's just hail.

1185
01:23:03,403 --> 01:23:04,827
Back off!

1186
01:23:09,396 --> 01:23:10,959
Incoming!

1187
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:15,765
- Carrots!
- Don't stop! Keep going.

1188
01:23:15,789 --> 01:23:17,141
No, stop.
Please stop!

1189
01:23:17,165 --> 01:23:19,279
Do not stop this car!

1190
01:23:19,303 --> 01:23:20,873
Ahhh!

1191
01:23:21,706 --> 01:23:23,397
Owww!

1192
01:23:27,515 --> 01:23:28,679
Whoa!

1193
01:23:40,354 --> 01:23:43,173
- Speed up, Nick. Speed up!
- There's another train coming!

1194
01:23:43,197 --> 01:23:45,507
Trust me, speed up.

1195
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:50,669
Stop the train!

1196
01:23:51,917 --> 01:23:54,130
Hey.
Need some help?

1197
01:23:57,237 --> 01:24:00,757
Oh, no. Oh, no no no.
Too fast! Too fast! Hold on!

1198
01:24:11,923 --> 01:24:14,166
I think this is our stop.

1199
01:24:22,027 --> 01:24:25,792
Okay, maybe...
Maybe some of the evidence survived.

1200
01:24:33,974 --> 01:24:37,465
Everything is gone.
We've lost it all.

1201
01:24:38,014 --> 01:24:41,626
Yeah. All, except for this.
Ah, ha ha ha ha!

1202
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:43,484
- Ooh, Nick! Yes!
- Ow.

1203
01:24:43,508 --> 01:24:46,187
Come on!
We gotta get to the ZPD.

1204
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:48,561
Cut through the Natural History Museum.

1205
01:24:59,422 --> 01:25:03,301
- There it is.
- Judy. Judy!

1206
01:25:03,749 --> 01:25:05,578
Mayor Bellwether.

1207
01:25:05,602 --> 01:25:08,893
We found out what's happening.
Someone's darting predators with a serum.

1208
01:25:08,917 --> 01:25:10,604
That's what's making them go savage.

1209
01:25:10,628 --> 01:25:13,896
I'm so proud of you, Judy.
You did just a super job.

1210
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,537
Thank you, ma'am.

1211
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:21,392
How did you know
where to find us?

1212
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:23,027
I'll go ahead and
I'll take that case now.

1213
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:28,499
You know what? I think Nick and I
will just take this to the ZPD.

1214
01:25:32,434 --> 01:25:33,786
- Run.
- Run.

1215
01:25:34,646 --> 01:25:36,070
Get them!

1216
01:25:39,435 --> 01:25:40,882
Ah...

1217
01:25:41,685 --> 01:25:43,053
Carrots!

1218
01:25:43,077 --> 01:25:44,124
Aww.

1219
01:25:44,148 --> 01:25:46,408
Here, I got you.
Get in here.

1220
01:25:48,377 --> 01:25:50,606
Okay.
Now, just relax.

1221
01:25:50,607 --> 01:25:51,678
Whoops.

1222
01:25:51,702 --> 01:25:54,104
- Blueberry?
- Pass.

1223
01:25:55,466 --> 01:25:57,808
Come on out, Judy.

1224
01:25:57,832 --> 01:25:59,991
Take the case.
Get it to Bogo.

1225
01:26:00,015 --> 01:26:01,807
I'm not gonna leave you behind,
that's not happening.

1226
01:26:01,831 --> 01:26:04,333
- I can't walk.
- Just.. We'll think of something.

1227
01:26:04,357 --> 01:26:07,080
We're on the same team, Judy.

1228
01:26:07,081 --> 01:26:10,888
Underestimated.
Underappreciated.

1229
01:26:10,912 --> 01:26:13,442
Aren't you sick of it?

1230
01:26:15,831 --> 01:26:19,451
Predators.
They may be strong and loud.

1231
01:26:19,475 --> 01:26:23,248
But prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.

1232
01:26:26,568 --> 01:26:32,400
Think about it. 90% of the population
united against a common enemy.

1233
01:26:32,401 --> 01:26:34,803
We'll be unstoppable.

1234
01:26:37,646 --> 01:26:38,845
Huh?

1235
01:26:39,965 --> 01:26:41,544
Over there!

1236
01:26:45,247 --> 01:26:46,311
Oh!

1237
01:26:48,198 --> 01:26:49,261
Ah!

1238
01:26:57,292 --> 01:27:00,000
Well, you should have just
stayed on the carrot farm, huh?

1239
01:27:00,030 --> 01:27:02,986
It really is too bad,
I did like you.

1240
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:05,223
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?

1241
01:27:05,247 --> 01:27:08,457
Oohhh.
No, of course not.

1242
01:27:08,481 --> 01:27:09,914
He is.

1243
01:27:10,033 --> 01:27:12,691
No!
Oh, Nick?

1244
01:27:12,869 --> 01:27:17,313
Yes, police! There's a savage fox in the
Natural History Museum!

1245
01:27:17,337 --> 01:27:20,042
Officer Hopps is down.
Please hurry!

1246
01:27:20,066 --> 01:27:22,008
No, Nick.
Don't do this. Fight it.

1247
01:27:22,032 --> 01:27:25,171
Oh, but he can't help it.
Can he?

1248
01:27:25,195 --> 01:27:30,436
Since predators are just biologically
predisposed to be savages.

1249
01:27:37,407 --> 01:27:38,646
Get back!

1250
01:27:40,317 --> 01:27:43,097
Gosh!
Think of the headline!

1251
01:27:43,121 --> 01:27:47,032
Hero Cop Killed by Savage Fox.

1252
01:27:47,688 --> 01:27:51,704
So that's it? Prey fears predator,
and you stay in power?

1253
01:27:51,728 --> 01:27:53,050
Yeah.
Pretty much.

1254
01:27:53,074 --> 01:27:54,547
It won't work.

1255
01:27:54,571 --> 01:27:56,830
Fear always works.

1256
01:27:56,854 --> 01:28:00,402
And I'll dart every predator in
Zootopia to keep it that way.

1257
01:28:00,426 --> 01:28:01,404
Ah!

1258
01:28:03,169 --> 01:28:05,863
Oh, Nick.
No.

1259
01:28:08,329 --> 01:28:10,184
Bye-bye, bunny.

1260
01:28:14,658 --> 01:28:15,869
Blahhh...

1261
01:28:15,893 --> 01:28:19,944
Blood, blood, blood!
And death.

1262
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:21,175
All right, you know you're milking it.

1263
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,805
Besides, I think we got it.
I think we got it.

1264
01:28:22,829 --> 01:28:25,093
We got it up there,
thank you, yakety-yak.

1265
01:28:25,117 --> 01:28:26,875
You laid it all out beautifully.

1266
01:28:26,899 --> 01:28:27,751
What?

1267
01:28:27,752 --> 01:28:30,687
Yeah. Oh, are-are you looking for the serum?
Well, it's right here.

1268
01:28:30,711 --> 01:28:32,245
What you've got
in the weapon there,

1269
01:28:32,269 --> 01:28:35,026
those are blueberries,
from my family's farm.

1270
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:38,296
Mmmuch. They are delicious.
You should try some.

1271
01:28:38,297 --> 01:28:41,341
I framed Lionheart,
I can frame you too.

1272
01:28:41,342 --> 01:28:43,581
It's my word against yours.

1273
01:28:43,605 --> 01:28:45,641
Ooo.
Actually...

1274
01:28:45,665 --> 01:28:48,799
And I'll dart every predator
in Zootopia to keep it that way.

1275
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:51,381
- It's your word against yours.
- Huh?

1276
01:28:51,405 --> 01:28:54,787
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart.
Boom!

1277
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:03,730
Former mayor, Dawn Bellwether
is behind bars today,

1278
01:29:03,754 --> 01:29:07,749
guilty of masterminding the savage attacks
that have plagued Zootopia of late.

1279
01:29:07,773 --> 01:29:11,690
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,
denies any knowledge of her plot,

1280
01:29:11,714 --> 01:29:14,201
claiming he was just trying
to protect the city.

1281
01:29:14,225 --> 01:29:16,642
Did I falsely imprison those animals?

1282
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:18,078
Well, yes.
Yes, I did.

1283
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:21,725
It was a classic doing the wrong thing
for the right reason kind of a deal.

1284
01:29:21,726 --> 01:29:25,955
In related news, doctors say the Night Howlers'
antidote is proving effective

1285
01:29:25,956 --> 01:29:28,999
in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.

1286
01:29:33,528 --> 01:29:36,153
Oh, Emmitt!

1287
01:29:38,846 --> 01:29:40,783
Thank you.

1288
01:29:42,696 --> 01:29:44,548
When I was a kid,

1289
01:29:44,572 --> 01:29:48,097
I thought Zootopia was this perfect place.

1290
01:29:48,121 --> 01:29:49,900
Where everyone got along,

1291
01:29:49,924 --> 01:29:53,295
and anyone could be anything.

1292
01:29:53,493 --> 01:29:59,383
Turns out, real life is a little bit more
complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker.

1293
01:29:59,407 --> 01:30:02,187
Real life is messy.

1294
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:04,940
We all have limitations.

1295
01:30:04,964 --> 01:30:06,470
We all make mistakes.

1296
01:30:06,494 --> 01:30:10,623
Which means, hey, glass half full,
we all have a lot in common.

1297
01:30:10,647 --> 01:30:13,623
And the more we try to
understand one another.

1298
01:30:13,647 --> 01:30:16,431
The more exceptional each of us will be.

1299
01:30:17,449 --> 01:30:19,778
But we have to try.

1300
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:22,905
So no matter what type
of animal you are.

1301
01:30:22,929 --> 01:30:28,412
From the biggest elephant,
to our first fox.

1302
01:30:29,387 --> 01:30:31,563
I implore you.

1303
01:30:31,564 --> 01:30:36,451
Try...
Try to make the world a better place.

1304
01:30:36,843 --> 01:30:38,014
OFFICER
Nicholas P. Wilde

1305
01:30:38,038 --> 01:30:43,876
Look inside yourself and recognize
that change starts with you.

1306
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:50,696
It starts with me.
It starts with all of us.

1307
01:30:53,109 --> 01:30:55,225
- Yeh!
- Yeh!

1308
01:30:56,954 --> 01:31:00,738
All right, all right, enough.
Shut it!

1309
01:31:01,261 --> 01:31:04,204
We have some new recruits
with us this morning.

1310
01:31:04,228 --> 01:31:07,892
Including our first fox.
Who cares.

1311
01:31:07,916 --> 01:31:10,720
Hah. You should have your own line
of inspirational greeting cards, sir.

1312
01:31:10,744 --> 01:31:12,605
Shut your mouth, Wilde.

1313
01:31:12,629 --> 01:31:14,094
Assignments.

1314
01:31:14,095 --> 01:31:18,806
Officers Grizzoli, Fragmire, Delgato.
Tundratown SWAT.

1315
01:31:18,807 --> 01:31:22,680
Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard.
Undercover.

1316
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:26,865
Hopps, Wilde.
Parking duty.

1317
01:31:26,895 --> 01:31:28,594
Dismissed.

1318
01:31:28,923 --> 01:31:30,671
Just kidding!

1319
01:31:30,695 --> 01:31:34,220
We have reports of a street racer
tearing up Savannah Central.

1320
01:31:34,261 --> 01:31:36,558
Find him.
Shut him down.

1321
01:31:36,582 --> 01:31:40,642
So are all the rabbits bad drivers,
or is it just you?

1322
01:31:41,672 --> 01:31:44,067
Oops.
Sorry.

1323
01:31:44,187 --> 01:31:46,311
Heh heh.
Sly bunny.

1324
01:31:46,335 --> 01:31:47,716
Dumb fox.

1325
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:49,274
You know you love me.

1326
01:31:49,298 --> 01:31:50,920
Do I know that?

1327
01:31:50,921 --> 01:31:53,900
Yes.
Yes, I do.

1328
01:32:07,102 --> 01:32:11,624
Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour,
I hope you have a good explanation.

1329
01:32:12,478 --> 01:32:16,287
Flash, Flash.
Hundred Yard Dash!

1330
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:21,598
Nick...

1331
01:32:23,483 --> 01:32:25,693
Good evening, Zootopia!

1332
01:32:25,717 --> 01:32:28,091
Come on, everybody.
Put your paws up.
