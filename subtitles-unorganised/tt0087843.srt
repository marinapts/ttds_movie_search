1
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:49,358
Land that I love

2
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:54,279
Stand beside her
And guide her through the night

3
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,201
With a light from above

4
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,869
From the mountains

5
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:08,377
To the prairies
To the oceans white with foam

6
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,966
God bless America

7
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:19,012
My home sweet home

8
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,183
God bless America

9
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,605
Land that I love

10
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:33,569
Stand beside her
And guide her

11
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:37,781
Through the night
With a light from above

12
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,327
From the mountains

13
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,330
To the prairies

14
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:54,882
To the oceans white with foam

15
00:02:56,217 --> 00:03:03,307
God bless America

16
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:14,401
My home sweet home

17
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,613
From the mountains

18
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,617
To the prairies

19
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:27,748
To the oceans white with foam

20
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:36,506
God bless America

21
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,636
My home

22
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,514
Where is he? Where is he hiding?

23
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:52,314
I don't know. I've been looking
for him since yesterday.

24
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,484
Aah! Oh.

25
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:00,697
I'm gonna ask you for the last time.
Where is he?

26
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,700
I don't know.

27
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,622
What are you gonna do to him?

28
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,892
You stay here in case
that rat shows up.

29
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,144
Okay.

30
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,373
Who you protecting,
you dumb asshole?

31
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,085
A stoolie who rats on his own friends?

32
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,258
They were your friends too.

33
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,393
I got it. You wanna end up
like that bitch, huh?

34
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,745
At Chun Lao's. Chinese theater.

35
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,088
You stay here with this barrel of shit.

36
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:07,968
Noodles. Noodles. Noodles.

37
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,321
Uh--

38
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,063
Easy, easy....

39
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,399
This way. Hurry!

40
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,986
There down. Mott Street.
Go. Go. Go.

41
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,671
Noodles.

42
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,554
Noodles.

43
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,684
Noodles.

44
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,894
Untie me.

45
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:06,441
Stay that way. No, stay.
I want them to know I did it.

46
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,739
Where you going?
I'm gonna go get Eve.

47
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,615
Don't.

48
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,126
Why?

49
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:33,301
They-- They already been there.

50
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,496
Do you need anything?

51
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,040
Money?

52
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:13,257
I got more than I need.
-Yeah, it's all yours now.

53
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,090
Where to?

54
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,892
Sir, where do you want to go?

55
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,482
Anywhere. First bus.

56
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,655
Buffalo?

57
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,326
One way.

58
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,331
That'll be $1.20.

59
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,965
I wanna rent a car.

60
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,635
Would you fill this out, please?

61
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:13,325
Go, go.
Go ahead, shoot the dice, man.

62
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:17,037
Shoot the dice. Shoot the dice.
Shoot the dice.

63
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,834
That's right. That's right, man.
That's right.

64
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,439
Noodles.

65
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:16,068
I brought back
the key to your clock.

66
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,121
Lock the door.

67
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,095
When did you get back?

68
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:48,142
-Today.
-Why?

69
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:53,981
-They got in touch with me.
-Who?

70
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,275
I thought you might know.

71
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,026
Me?

72
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,780
I don't know nothing
about nobody no more.

73
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,971
You gonna offer me a drink?

74
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,475
Yeah, forgive me. Sure. Of course.

75
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,685
Please sit down.

76
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,297
Who's Robert Williams?

77
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,884
I am.

78
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:15,395
"We wish to inform you that following
the sale of the Beth Israel Cemetery...."

79
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:20,067
Yeah, the synagogue sent these out
if you wanted to relocate your loved ones.

80
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,278
I got the same letter
on account of my father.

81
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:28,575
Only the synagogue didn't send that.
I got that last week.

82
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,537
The rabbi told me he sent those out
about eight months ago.

83
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:35,082
Yeah, that's right.
That's just about when I got mine.

84
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,629
So, what else did he say, the rabbi?

85
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,424
He said that I was lucky.
The bodies of Philip Stein...

86
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:49,388
...Maximilian Bercovicz, Patrick
Goldberg were already spoken for.

87
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:53,892
And they were up in
a very fancy cemetery in Riverdale.

88
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,314
What's this all mean?

89
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,316
It means...

90
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:08,490
..."Noodles, though you've been hiding
in the asshole of the world, we found you.

91
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,576
We know where you are."

92
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,161
It means...

93
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,330
..."Get ready."

94
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,251
For what?

95
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,465
That's the one thing it didn't say.

96
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,538
What do you think?

97
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,834
I think the answer's here.
That's why I came back.

98
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,173
Hm.

99
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,814
I moved everything in here.

100
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,697
I had to sell the house,
the backroom.

101
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:36,870
You know, I always thought you might have
helped yourself to that million bucks.

102
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,206
But now I know.

103
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,125
No.

104
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,338
You're on your ass worse than ever.

105
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,217
But I thought it was you who--

106
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,761
No, you thought wrong.

107
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,391
The suitcase was empty.

108
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,145
Then who took it?

109
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:10,278
That's what I've been asking myself
for 35 years.

110
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,793
If it bothers you, I can sleep here.

111
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:29,089
-You can have my room.
-No. It's okay.

112
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:52,612
-How's your sister?
-I ain't seen her for years.

113
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,782
She's a big star now.

114
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,495
We should have known, huh?

115
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,833
You can always tell the winners
at the starting gate.

116
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:09,504
You can always tell the winners,
and you can tell the losers.

117
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,508
Who would've put a penny on you?

118
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,430
I'd have put everything
I ever had on you.

119
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,769
Yeah, and you would've lost.

120
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:40,118
Well, you're beat. Good night.

121
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,996
Good night, Moe. Thanks.

122
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,379
What have you been doing
all these years?

123
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,385
Been going to bed early.

124
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,677
Deborah, Papa says you should help.

125
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,471
No.

126
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,016
We've got customers all over.
We can't do everything.

127
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,853
Try. I've got my elocution lessons.

128
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:54,200
Fat, you better spray the toilet.
I saw a cockroach in there.

129
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,718
Sorry.

130
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,020
Sorry, I can't make it today.
See you tomorrow.

131
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,189
Okay. Bye.
Bye.

132
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,199
Sorry, Fats.

133
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,917
Noodles!
Bugsy's got a job for us.

134
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,085
Hurry up. He don't wait.

135
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,788
Who you calling a cockroach?

136
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,124
So, what are you?
You're filthy, you make me sick.

137
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:29,462
You crawl up toilet walls
just like a roach. So, what are you?

138
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,172
Let go!

139
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,301
I make you sick, huh? Then how
come you showed me your tush?

140
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,845
Hm. To a roach.

141
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,811
Go look at yourself, David Aaronson.

142
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,621
She don't leave me alone, I'm gonna
give her what she's asking for.

143
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,332
-What's Bugsy want?
-We gotta wake up a deadbeat.

144
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,627
That schmuck at the newsstand
didn't pay.

145
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,845
Here's your money, sir.

146
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,117
It's beautiful.

147
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,458
Ha-ha-ha.
-Look at it, it looks great! Wow!

148
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,510
Come on, guys.

149
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,895
Come on, come on.

150
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,856
Now make up your mind.

151
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,652
-Noodles, let's take the dollar.
-Yeah.

152
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,363
Skip, here you go.

153
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,991
That one.

154
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,244
Him.

155
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,996
Hey, Sam, I'll see you next Thursday.

156
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:13,084
That one.
Hey, and bring your wife along.

157
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,461
Are you nuts?

158
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:19,841
Bugsy said we could take the dollar
or we could roll the drunk.

159
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,301
Yeah, but he ain't even drunk yet.

160
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,512
We'll wait.

161
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:32,311
-Well, you roll that one over there.
-What's to roll? He drunk it all.

162
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,277
Bounce that little shikker.

163
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,744
Jacket.

164
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,964
It's Fartface.

165
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,886
Shit!

166
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,681
We should've took the dollar.

167
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:54,727
Could've had 10 hot corned-beef
sandwiches on poppy-seed rolls.

168
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:12,245
Look, the wagon will hide us
from Fartface. Get ready!

169
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,651
Now! Throw your jacket over him.

170
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:50,658
Hey, mister, you sick? Aw, poor guy,
you'll be okay. Come on, I'll help you.

171
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,661
Come on, up you go.

172
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,497
Now, you're worse
than my Uncle Nathan.

173
00:47:56,665 --> 00:48:00,126
Why do you want to get soused?
You can't even walk. I'll take you home.

174
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,128
Go, Mama.

175
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,348
Stop right there. Hey, you!
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

176
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,852
What the hell are you kids doing here?

177
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:21,856
-What are we kids doing here?
-We're getting it up the ass.

178
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:25,651
Yeah, getting screwed.
Is there a law against it?

179
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:29,780
Can you spare a dime for
pisherkehs that just got it up the ass?

180
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,700
Come on, get out of here.
Come on, get off the street.

181
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,286
Go on, get out of here.
Get off the street.

182
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,663
Go ahead. And don't come back.

183
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:41,667
I don't want to ever see you here again.
All right?

184
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,119
Hey, stop by for you later.

185
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,874
Yeah, but knock here on the john first.

186
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:28,756
My old man's praying, and my old lady's
crying. And the light's turned off.

187
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:33,552
What the hell should I go home for?
At least in here I can read.

188
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,493
Where are you going?
Mama, don't get worked up.

189
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,620
You got pots to clean.

190
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,085
Peggeleh?

191
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,255
I'll be right back, Ma.
I gotta go to the can.

192
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,181
Hi, Peggy.

193
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,975
At least you could lock the door.

194
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,855
Don't you like it?

195
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,739
I've seen better.

196
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,825
-You seen lots?
-How many you seen?

197
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,162
I'll tell you how many. None.

198
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,502
Let me see yours.

199
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,685
Looksies, no feelsies.

200
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:53,651
Peggy. Peggy, I-- I-- I--

201
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,529
I want--

202
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,865
-You like it, don't you?
-Not for free, I don't.

203
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:04,286
You bring me a charlotte russe with whipped
cream, then you can do anything you like.

204
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,248
Tomorrow. I'll bring it
to you tomorrow.

205
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:10,417
-I'll bring it tomorrow.
-Look, I don't give credit.

206
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,086
I promise. I promise.

207
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:16,423
You better stop squeezing me,
or I'm gonna poop in my pants.

208
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,265
Well, are you getting out?

209
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,232
Come on, come on.

210
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,637
Give me six copies.

211
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:49,308
Drop your pants
and I'll stick it to you again.

212
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,690
-What do you mean, "again"?
-That's a long story.

213
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,693
And look what time it is.

214
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:04,198
It's already 6:34. And I gotta go.

215
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,868
Boy, I got a lot of work to do.

216
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,995
Hold it a minute.

217
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:14,833
Now it's 6:35.
And I ain't got a damn thing to do.

218
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,046
Just you wait, asshole.
I'll do something with your time.

219
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,547
Wait! Hey!

220
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:23,008
Since we're talking about time...

221
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:26,929
...it looks like you're gonna break
that lamp at 6:36.

222
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,848
-Where'd you pinch this?
-It's mine.

223
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,643
-Prove it.
-I gave it to him.

224
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,145
Oh, yeah?

225
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,731
Who the hell are you?

226
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:41,151
-Where you from?
-The Bronx.

227
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,029
And you give away watches?

228
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,532
He's my uncle.

229
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,743
-And who gave it to you?
-My Uncle Nathan.

230
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,204
My little brother.

231
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,833
Tell your uncle
to stop by the precinct.

232
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,876
He's dead.
-Alcoholic.

233
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,045
In Kishnev, Poland.

234
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,341
Hm.

235
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,012
Then he don't need it no more.
It's been requisitioned.

236
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:14,059
-Requi-- What's that mean?
-Pinched, by him. At 6:37.

237
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:17,396
Just remember,
I got my eye on you two.

238
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,773
I got my eye on you too.

239
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:24,611
Take it! Take it!
Take the lamp off. I can't hold it.

240
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,656
Max.

241
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,245
Who's this?

242
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,041
My uncle.

243
00:55:56,936 --> 00:56:00,647
-That one. With the cream.
-The 5-cent one?

244
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,483
Yeah.

245
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:07,112
For the twopenny one she only gives
you a hand job. I can do that myself.

246
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,656
Not that one!

247
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,825
That one.

248
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,286
You sure?

249
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,331
Wrap it up pretty.

250
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,790
Good morning. Peggy home?

251
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,875
She's taking a bath.

252
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,670
That's great.
Would you tell her I'm here?

253
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:08,298
Hey, Ma. Another bucket of water.

254
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,468
Wait.

255
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,829
What do you want?
-Me?

256
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:49,376
-Mama said you were looking for me.
-Oh, ye-- No. The guys told me that--

257
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:53,755
-What?
-I'll come back some other time.

258
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,667
Noodles!

259
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,422
Noodles! Noodles! Noodles!

260
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,137
What?

261
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,722
Did you get it?

262
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:48,602
His asshole blinked, but we got him.
Nice going, Fartface. And on duty too.

263
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:53,440
Heh. Uh, ha, ha. You boys caught me
with my pants down that time. Heh, heh.

264
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,693
No, we caught you with your schmuck
up the tuchus of a minor.

265
01:00:56,861 --> 01:01:00,739
-Scram. Put this someplace safe.
That's all right. Ha, ha. Hey, hold it!

266
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,200
Where you going?
Stop! Hold it! Wait a minute!

267
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,118
Hey, you, stop! Hold it.

268
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:10,290
-What are you gonna do with that plate?
-Depends. What time is it, Max?

269
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,418
I think it's time
we got our watch back.

270
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,381
-Okay, boys, we're even.
-The hell we are.

271
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,966
You'll be collecting your
pension before we're even.

272
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,760
Hiya, fellas.

273
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,429
What do you boys want?

274
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,932
First off...

275
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,267
-...you're paying Peggy for us.
Ha, ha.

276
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,561
Okay. That's it?

277
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,397
Go ahead while I tell him.

278
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:37,609
Ha-ha-ha. I can't believe it.
My first time, and a lousy cop's paying for it.

279
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:44,282
Look, what else do you kids
want for that plate? Huh?

280
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:47,494
Noodles was telling me
about a guy called Bugsy.

281
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,497
Seems he's boss of this neighborhood,
thanks to you.

282
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,792
-Meaning what?
-Meaning he pays you off.

283
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,671
Will you slow down?
What is your hurry? Take it easy.

284
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,966
If you keep this up,
you're gonna come too fast.

285
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:06,680
Do you see what I mean?
You're so stupid. I can't believe it.

286
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:12,185
So why does Bugsy pay you?
What do you do for him?

287
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:17,649
-I close an eye once in a while.
-Well, now you close an eye for us.

288
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:21,027
Why? What are you kids up to?

289
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,366
He'll tell you.

290
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:30,120
Me, him, Cockeye and Patsy,
we're working together.

291
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,831
Bugsy'll flatten you.

292
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:36,334
Besides, I don't put up with
no trouble on my beat.

293
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:40,630
You'll put up, and you'll shut up.
You hear nothing, and you see nothing.

294
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:42,674
Just like you did for Bugsy.

295
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,217
Shit!

296
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:49,514
Aw, don't get upset. That makes it worse.
It can happen the first time.

297
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:54,144
-It's them two talking out there.
-Can't you see you're ruining the mood?

298
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,646
We made our deal.

299
01:02:57,231 --> 01:03:00,942
-So take a walk.
Come here, honey.

300
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:06,740
-Feel good, bubeleh?
-Ha! He'll never get it up.

301
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:12,496
Relax. Okay. Calm down, calm down.

302
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:22,714
Okay. Okay, come here.

303
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:44,296
I'm glad the baby's better.

304
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:48,925
Happy Pesach, Deborah.
Happy Pesach, Becky.

305
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:57,350
Hurry. We're gonna be late.

306
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,353
-Oh, there's Deborah.
-Sorry I'm late. Mama needed help.

307
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:05,442
Good girl. I just locked up,
and I'm giving you the keys.

308
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:22,459
I thought I'd just practice my dance
routines. That's all. All right?

309
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:25,837
Debbeleh, make sure you
don't let the goyim in.

310
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:30,508
-Okay, bye.
-See you later, Debbie. Bye.

311
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,458
Get down off of there, roach.

312
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,419
That record's just like Ex-Lax.

313
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:51,297
Every time I put it on,
you have to go to the bathroom.

314
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,442
What are you doing?

315
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:13,445
-Give me a drink.
-We're closed.

316
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:18,158
Nice people don't drink on Pesach.
They go to the synagogue.

317
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:20,326
So, what are you doing here?

318
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:23,288
Somebody's gotta keep an eye
on the place.

319
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:27,667
There are a lot of little thieves out there.
One of them could get into your house.

320
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:31,004
Especially if you leave the door open.

321
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,164
You can pray here too.

322
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:11,252
Here or in the synagogue,
to God it's the same difference.

323
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:15,048
Come over here and sit down.

324
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:51,042
"My beloved is white and ruddy.

325
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:54,838
His skin is as the most fine gold.

326
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:59,050
His cheeks are as a bed of spices."

327
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:05,598
Even though he hasn't washed
since last December.

328
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,856
"His eyes are as the eyes of doves.

329
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:15,733
His body is as bright ivory.

330
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:19,821
His legs are as pillars of marble."

331
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,576
In pants so dirty
they stand by themselves.

332
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:29,581
"He is altogether lovable."

333
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,710
But he'll always be a two-bit punk...

334
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:38,756
...so he'll never be my beloved.
What a shame.

335
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:11,956
Somebody's there.

336
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,179
There ain't nobody.

337
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:34,145
It's Max.

338
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:37,523
Ah. So that's who it was.

339
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:39,817
Noodles!

340
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:46,824
Go on, run.
Your mother's calling you.

341
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,332
Noodles!

342
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:58,002
Just gonna go see what he wants.

343
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,993
Hey.
-Yo.

344
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:36,082
-You been here long?
-No.

345
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:39,460
Were you in there?

346
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:44,048
You're one lousy kisser.

347
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:47,385
I seen you go in there
after that ball-buster.

348
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:52,557
Here's the stuff from last night. We got
4 for the silverware, 6 for the typewriter.

349
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:56,978
Shitsy Lipschitz wouldn't cough up
any more. We gotta get somebody else.

350
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:01,899
I came to divvy up.

351
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:07,030
-Tomorrow, with the others.
-I also came to pick you up.

352
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:12,535
-I can't come right now.
-The houses, the stores are all empty.

353
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:15,913
We got our pick. You pick that.

354
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:18,750
Yeah.

355
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:24,964
Some partner I got. Have fun.

356
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,265
How's it going, boys?

357
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,601
Who's that?

358
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,936
Bugsy.

359
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:59,665
I hear you guys are in business
for yourselves now, huh?

360
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:01,793
I hear youse are doing real good.

361
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:10,885
Ain't you gonna introduce me
to your friend here?

362
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:17,266
I'll introduce myself.

363
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:24,065
Excuse the glove.

364
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:33,658
Ow!

365
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:35,368
Son of a bitch!

366
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,750
That's my cut.

367
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:29,088
You don't work for me,
you don't work for no one.

368
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:31,048
-I don't like bosses.
Ha, ha.

369
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:35,052
You was better off
you stayed in the Bronx.

370
01:14:38,265 --> 01:14:41,267
It would have been better for you too.

371
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:27,480
-I'm gonna kill him one of these days.
-Yeah?

372
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:32,443
Meantime it looks like he's killed us.

373
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:54,507
Deborah, open up the door.

374
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,719
Deborah, open up the door.

375
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,806
Deborah.

376
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:47,685
That stuff, is it ready for the club?
-We're loading it.

377
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:27,058
Eh. Che cazzo succede down here?
-Al, we got the big boys with us today.

378
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:30,936
-They wanna work for us.
-Doing what Bugsy did. We want his job.

379
01:17:31,104 --> 01:17:32,271
Do you get that? Ha, ha.

380
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:37,818
We the best escorts you ever gonna get.

381
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:41,530
A fangulo a ma, escort your
mother's ass out of here.

382
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:48,120
Okay. Let's go, Noodles. We'll peddle
your invention somewhere else, huh?

383
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,957
Hey, wait a minute.

384
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:54,877
What invention?

385
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:57,963
-You ship your stuff by the river, right?
-Sometimes.

386
01:17:58,131 --> 01:18:01,717
And when you get caught by the Coast
Guard, you throw all the cases overboard.

387
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:04,595
-You lose the whole shipment.
So?

388
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:07,473
For 10 percent,
we'll save it all for you.

389
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,434
-What do you got, a submarine?
-We got salt.

390
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:13,437
You got what?

391
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:18,442
-Salt. Me and the boys are rolling salts.
-Yeah. We need 3 tons of salt per shipment.

392
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:22,154
Get the fuck out of here.
Go back to school where you belong.

393
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:25,116
What is it with all this salt?

394
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:29,787
Hey, hey, we got salt on our noodles.
Show them.

395
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:44,468
This is full of salt.

396
01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:51,100
All right, come here.

397
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:08,868
So?
-Keep your shirt on.

398
01:19:09,035 --> 01:19:11,662
We gotta wait for the salt
to dissolve.

399
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:46,822
-Well?
-Hey, what's wrong?

400
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,038
Hey, look.

401
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,373
Hey. Wow!

402
01:19:58,543 --> 01:19:59,877
Great!

403
01:20:01,379 --> 01:20:03,881
-Look at that!
-It's great.

404
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:05,466
-Noodles.
-Look at it.

405
01:20:07,093 --> 01:20:10,012
I see them! What did I tell you?
-Yeah.

406
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,392
Yeah!

407
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:28,739
Hey, Noodles.
Hooray. Hooray for us!

408
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:33,911
We did it.

409
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,539
Come here, Max.

410
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:41,293
We did it.
No, Max, no!

411
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,298
Max.

412
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:49,426
Max.

413
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:02,439
Max!

414
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:06,277
Max!

415
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:23,043
What would you do without me?

416
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:29,902
There.

417
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:36,533
From here on, we establish
the shared funds of the gang.

418
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:39,703
They belong to all of us together
and to none of us alone.

419
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:45,209
And we solemnly swear to put in 50
percent of everything we make. Agreed?

420
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:46,627
Agreed.

421
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,712
Agreed.
Agreed.

422
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:53,509
Agreed.

423
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,554
I wanna take another peek.

424
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:19,076
Announcing the immediate departure...

425
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:23,914
...of the Lackawanna Railroad,
Hudson Valley Express, Poughkeepsie...

426
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:29,044
...Albany, Utica and Buffalo.

427
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:32,548
All aboard.

428
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:39,763
This goes to Fat Moe.
We don't tell him what it's for.

429
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:43,267
And he gives it back
only when we're all together.

430
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:44,685
Agreed?

431
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:47,771
Agreed.

432
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:52,276
Agreed.

433
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:51,877
Bugsy's coming! Run!

434
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,639
Noodles.

435
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:48,600
I slipped.

436
01:27:26,699 --> 01:27:30,118
Bastard!
-Aah!

437
01:27:30,286 --> 01:27:32,454
Schmuck.

438
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:49,049
Wanna go in?

439
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:54,346
Yeah.

440
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:56,765
You a relative?

441
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:01,311
An uncle.

442
01:30:13,866 --> 01:30:15,492
It's open.

443
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:30,687
"Erected to their everlasting
memory by their friend and brother...

444
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:33,273
...David Aaronson, 1967."

445
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:15,351
Can I take that for you, sir?

446
01:36:17,813 --> 01:36:19,856
Your limousine is waiting.

447
01:36:30,242 --> 01:36:31,951
Maxie.

448
01:36:43,547 --> 01:36:46,549
How are you, uncle?
You're looking good.

449
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:49,761
You're looking a little better.

450
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:57,268
Come on. Better get
you off the streets.

451
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:03,775
-Some limousine.
-Ha, ha. What are you talking, huh?

452
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:08,696
We own the company now. It's a good
cover. You'd be surprised. It pays off too.

453
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:12,742
My mother wrote me you was
in the body-snatching business.

454
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:18,289
By the way, I appreciate
everything you did for my family.

455
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:20,750
Forget it. It's your dough.

456
01:37:21,418 --> 01:37:24,754
It's all down in black and white
in the company books.

457
01:37:25,589 --> 01:37:29,926
You're the company. You and Patsy and
Cockeye. Gravediggers and equal partners.

458
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:34,305
Heh. Hey, enough of this, huh?
Business before pleasure.

459
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:37,267
We got a rush job. Here.

460
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:43,147
Come here. Look at this. Come here.

461
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:48,528
Sudden death. Fucking tragedy, huh?

462
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:53,157
-Twenty-six years old.
-Twenty-six?

463
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:59,163
- What a shame.
-Great stiff. She died of an overdose.

464
01:37:59,331 --> 01:38:01,332
And I'm ready for another. Ha-ha-ha.

465
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:05,044
Come on, Noodles. Pump the life into her.
You didn't turn pansy in there, did you?

466
01:38:08,757 --> 01:38:09,841
There you go.

467
01:38:13,137 --> 01:38:17,181
Turning over in the grave.
They do it every time.

468
01:38:58,182 --> 01:39:01,017
Ha, ha. Don't worry. A pansy he ain't.

469
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:06,522
Thanks.
You're welcome, Noodles.

470
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:08,983
Whoops. Uh, sorry.

471
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:11,486
Thanks. Good night.

472
01:39:12,196 --> 01:39:17,200
Hey, you want a little pick-me-up?
Oh, no, thanks. I've had mine.

473
01:39:18,869 --> 01:39:21,245
Did you give her your all?
What do you think?

474
01:39:21,413 --> 01:39:22,997
Bet your life I did.

475
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:50,525
Wait till you see this place. Got the best....

476
01:39:50,693 --> 01:39:52,151
It's over here.

477
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:58,074
-Where we going?
-To a place that never closes.

478
01:39:58,951 --> 01:40:00,952
Whoops. Watch yourself.

479
01:40:11,922 --> 01:40:14,048
How's he doing?
He's doing great.

480
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:19,470
What's this?

481
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:22,098
Our place.
We got the hottest spot in town.

482
01:40:29,231 --> 01:40:32,775
Eh? This is the real Fat Moe's.

483
01:40:34,194 --> 01:40:36,112
Get rid of that rag, will you?

484
01:40:37,448 --> 01:40:39,657
-What do you think?
-It's beautiful.

485
01:40:39,825 --> 01:40:42,326
-Eh? You like it?
-Beautiful. Beautiful.

486
01:40:57,801 --> 01:40:59,594
Hey, give me that.

487
01:41:04,808 --> 01:41:08,019
-Noodles. Look who's here.
Patsy, look.

488
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:10,855
Come here, son of a bitch.
Come here! Come here!

489
01:41:11,023 --> 01:41:12,982
Patsy.
Oh.

490
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,485
-You look fantastic.
-Wait a minute.

491
01:41:15,652 --> 01:41:16,986
How you doing?

492
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:22,116
-Look how big you got.
-Me?

493
01:41:22,284 --> 01:41:24,327
Noodles. Oh. Oh, God.

494
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:27,330
-Noodles!
Freight train, coming through.

495
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:35,880
Hey. Hey, come on.
Hey, let's have a toast, for chrissakes.

496
01:41:36,048 --> 01:41:38,674
-You look like shit.
-What do you want? I just got out of prison.

497
01:41:38,842 --> 01:41:40,927
-Nice guy.
-Hey. Hey, Noodles, get a load of this.

498
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:42,136
Look.

499
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:47,183
Hey, Scotch heating.

500
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:49,352
-Yeah, a buck a cup.
Whoo!

501
01:41:50,479 --> 01:41:51,896
-A buck a cup?
-Yeah.

502
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:53,856
-How much it cost us?
-Costing us?

503
01:41:54,024 --> 01:41:56,859
-Yeah.
-A dime, including overhead.

504
01:41:57,027 --> 01:42:00,363
-Hey, Noodles. Fat Moe.
Oh. Heh.

505
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:07,912
You look terrific.

506
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:14,502
-Look like you lost an ounce or two.
You think I would lose hemorrhoids.

507
01:42:16,171 --> 01:42:18,506
Can't recognize him without an apron.

508
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:20,800
-L'chaim.
L'chaim.

509
01:42:21,885 --> 01:42:23,678
Welcome home.

510
01:42:27,057 --> 01:42:28,641
What the fuck kind of maître d' are you?

511
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:31,227
New guy rolls into the joint,
you don't even show him around.

512
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:33,104
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?

513
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:37,108
-I didn't know. Eh, Noodles, I'm sorry.
You're some bunch of shtunks.

514
01:42:37,317 --> 01:42:39,652
-You don't come up and get me?
He's the shtunk.

515
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:40,903
-Shtunk?
-Yeah, shtunk.

516
01:42:41,071 --> 01:42:44,407
-He said you weren't out till Monday.
-You can get him the next time he gets out.

517
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:48,619
-Ha-ha-ha.
-God forbid. God forbid.

518
01:42:53,208 --> 01:42:57,420
Whoa! Whoa! Ha-ha-ha.

519
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:09,891
Come on, let's see if you can
guess who it is.

520
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:14,770
Mmm.

521
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:18,399
Charlotte russe. With a little
too much whipped cream.

522
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:22,111
Peggy.

523
01:43:26,366 --> 01:43:30,620
Hey, you watch it, now.
And my prices, they've gone up.

524
01:43:30,787 --> 01:43:35,625
I work in a high-class joint now.
And I get paid by the pound.

525
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:36,792
Whoa!

526
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,796
My Peggy, she's worth every penny
of it too, my red-hot mama.

527
01:43:42,674 --> 01:43:44,634
Come on, come on. Eh, eh, eh.

528
01:43:45,344 --> 01:43:46,802
You fuck.

529
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:48,429
Timber!

530
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:53,517
You've seen your old pals, now I want you
to meet some new ones. Come on.

531
01:43:53,685 --> 01:43:57,647
Peggeleh, I'll see you later.
You gonna lay here all night or what?

532
01:44:07,991 --> 01:44:11,953
Cockeye wanted to play with the band.
I'm serious.

533
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:20,378
Come on.

534
01:44:47,197 --> 01:44:50,658
-Aren't you going to say hello?
-Hello.

535
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:14,515
-Your brother's a real friend.
-He's a romantic.

536
01:45:25,902 --> 01:45:29,739
-Max tell you I was getting out today?
-Max? No.

537
01:45:30,532 --> 01:45:35,077
-You remembered yourself?
-No, Moe. It's always Moe.

538
01:45:39,916 --> 01:45:41,709
Yeah.

539
01:45:50,302 --> 01:45:52,428
You mean you weren't
counting the days?

540
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:58,100
Of course I was. 4344, 4343.

541
01:45:58,268 --> 01:46:00,603
I lost track at 3000.

542
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:03,939
-That wasn't my choice.
-Yes, it was. It still is.

543
01:46:07,444 --> 01:46:10,571
Well, anyway, did you come here
to welcome me back at least?

544
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:14,950
I still live here. I was on my way out.
Moe said I should at least say hello.

545
01:46:16,453 --> 01:46:20,289
I hope Moe didn't have to
bend your arm or anything like that.

546
01:46:22,667 --> 01:46:23,959
No.

547
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:27,671
Welcome back, Noodles.

548
01:46:30,842 --> 01:46:32,176
Hey, Noodles.

549
01:46:39,309 --> 01:46:40,851
You dancing?

550
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:44,146
Every night at the Palace Theatre.

551
01:46:45,065 --> 01:46:50,319
I've made some progress since I danced
here among the brooms and the empties.

552
01:46:51,613 --> 01:46:55,825
You can come spy on me if you like.
If you have time.

553
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,661
Every night.

554
01:47:15,011 --> 01:47:16,512
Noodles.

555
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:23,686
Go on, Noodles,
your mother's calling you.

556
01:47:32,028 --> 01:47:34,655
It's good to see you again, Noodles.

557
01:47:47,544 --> 01:47:49,545
My pleasure.

558
01:47:57,929 --> 01:48:01,390
-Did you get the wine?
-Dago Red. The best.

559
01:48:09,065 --> 01:48:10,524
How you doing?

560
01:48:17,574 --> 01:48:21,243
There they are.
The four horsemen of the apocalypse.

561
01:48:23,914 --> 01:48:27,082
Did you see that movie, Joe?
It was a good movie.

562
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:28,876
-Hey, Max, how are you?
-Good to see you.

563
01:48:29,044 --> 01:48:30,669
Nice to see you.

564
01:48:31,463 --> 01:48:34,798
-This must be your friend Noodles.
-Noodles, say hello to Mr. Monaldi.

565
01:48:34,966 --> 01:48:37,092
-Hi, Noodles, how are you?
-I'm all right.

566
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:41,597
It's very nice to meet you. But you don't
have to call me Mr. Monaldi like he says.

567
01:48:41,765 --> 01:48:46,227
I like my friends and people I respect
to call me Frankie.

568
01:48:47,062 --> 01:48:50,773
Come on, sit down.
Get some chairs and some glasses.

569
01:48:54,611 --> 01:48:58,113
Sit down, relax. You're home now.

570
01:49:07,999 --> 01:49:10,793
This is my very dear friend Joe.

571
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:14,255
He came all the way from Detroit
to ask me to do him a favor.

572
01:49:14,923 --> 01:49:16,799
And I wanna do it for him.

573
01:49:18,134 --> 01:49:23,806
I don't have to tell you who Joe is,
how far he got, or how far he's gonna get.

574
01:49:24,349 --> 01:49:27,935
He's not only my dear friend,
he's my brother.

575
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:31,272
Frankie, I'll tell you the truth.
Even a Jew can't eat this shit.

576
01:49:32,941 --> 01:49:35,651
I mean, the mustard doesn't even help.

577
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:48,163
These guys with you?

578
01:49:48,748 --> 01:49:51,458
I told you these fellas are with me.

579
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:54,837
You could trust them.
You're in very good hands.

580
01:49:55,255 --> 01:49:58,132
Just tell them exactly
what you want them to do.

581
01:49:59,843 --> 01:50:03,512
Move some diamonds from Detroit.
Kid stuff.

582
01:50:09,519 --> 01:50:11,395
Why us then?

583
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:16,025
If it's kid stuff, why don't you have
the kids from Detroit do it?

584
01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:24,366
Excuse me, Noodles. What he means is
that it's something that's very simple...

585
01:50:24,534 --> 01:50:27,995
...but for now, he needs kids
from outside to handle it.

586
01:50:28,163 --> 01:50:32,750
He just found out they're gonna move
these diamonds to Holland in a few days.

587
01:50:32,917 --> 01:50:34,877
So it's something came up right away.

588
01:50:36,338 --> 01:50:38,047
You understand?

589
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:46,430
Hey, Joe.

590
01:50:47,349 --> 01:50:53,395
Tell these guys the story about, um,
the pussy being insured. What is it?

591
01:50:55,732 --> 01:50:58,942
Tell these guys how you stumbled
on this whole thing with the jewels....

592
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:01,403
Oh. Come on.
Tell them the story.

593
01:51:01,571 --> 01:51:05,366
The pussy insurance. The insurance
pussies. What is it? Tell them that story.

594
01:51:05,533 --> 01:51:11,413
Life is stranger than shit,
that's all. It's a pisser. No big story.

595
01:51:11,581 --> 01:51:15,084
I got this insurance agent,
this Jew kid named David.

596
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:19,922
This kid conned me into every policy
in the world. Every policy, name it.

597
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:23,884
Dogs, house, wife, life, anything.

598
01:51:24,052 --> 01:51:27,930
I'm drinking with the boys one night,
he comes in with his wife...

599
01:51:28,098 --> 01:51:31,433
...a pretty brunette with a nice ass
who works for a jeweler.

600
01:51:31,601 --> 01:51:34,436
And he's still on the hustle, this guy.

601
01:51:35,605 --> 01:51:38,357
So I wink at the guys,
I say, "Look...

602
01:51:40,068 --> 01:51:44,321
...the most serious policy that should be,
you don't have me covered for."

603
01:51:44,489 --> 01:51:47,324
He goes, "What's that, Joe?"
"Cock insurance."

604
01:51:48,743 --> 01:51:53,414
"You make me a policy that
when it don't work, I get a payment...

605
01:51:53,581 --> 01:51:55,749
...I'll write out a check now."

606
01:51:57,836 --> 01:52:03,674
He thinks, he says, "Oh, I don't know
if the actuality gauges govern this...

607
01:52:03,883 --> 01:52:06,009
...but we can make a policy.

608
01:52:06,177 --> 01:52:09,430
But you gotta guarantee
you're in good health now."

609
01:52:09,597 --> 01:52:14,309
"Oh, that's simple. Look, leave her with me.
Come back and see if it stands up.

610
01:52:14,477 --> 01:52:17,438
If it stands up, then you know
I'm in good health to begin with."

611
01:52:17,605 --> 01:52:19,857
The jerk leaves her. I screw her.

612
01:52:20,024 --> 01:52:24,987
Not only that, she likes it. And she tells me,
she blabs when her boss, the jeweler...

613
01:52:25,155 --> 01:52:27,197
...is shipping stones to Holland...

614
01:52:27,407 --> 01:52:31,660
...where he keeps his stash in a little drawer
in the safe. Everything in the world.

615
01:52:31,828 --> 01:52:35,164
Can't ask for more, right?
Except, one better.

616
01:52:35,331 --> 01:52:39,501
I never paid the first premium
on the new cock policy.

617
01:52:53,141 --> 01:52:54,641
Cock insurance.

618
01:53:00,356 --> 01:53:04,651
Life is funnier than shit.

619
01:53:05,028 --> 01:53:06,236
But...

620
01:53:10,033 --> 01:53:12,701
...be easy with the girl.

621
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:18,332
I mean that. Be easy with the girl.

622
01:53:26,549 --> 01:53:28,050
Oh, my God!

623
01:53:34,557 --> 01:53:35,724
Open it!

624
01:53:35,892 --> 01:53:38,185
Who's gotten in?

625
01:53:46,277 --> 01:53:48,237
Had to go and be a hero, huh?

626
01:53:54,577 --> 01:53:56,078
Open it.
-No.

627
01:53:56,246 --> 01:53:59,248
Open it!
Don't-- No, don't hurt him!

628
01:53:59,415 --> 01:54:02,417
-Don't hurt him!
Get this cunt out of here.

629
01:54:02,585 --> 01:54:05,546
You animal! You asshole!

630
01:54:06,506 --> 01:54:08,924
-Come on. Come on, hit me.
What do you mean?

631
01:54:09,092 --> 01:54:10,759
-Hit me.
What, are you crazy?

632
01:54:10,927 --> 01:54:14,263
-Straighten up and fly right.
-I'm all right.

633
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:17,307
Let me make it look real.
Make it look real.

634
01:54:17,517 --> 01:54:20,102
Come on, knock it off.
-I'm all right. Let go.

635
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:22,771
Come on, cut the act.
-Hit me!

636
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:26,733
She said hit her.
Go ahead, rap her in the mouth.

637
01:54:26,901 --> 01:54:29,778
Hit me!
I'll hit you! You bitch!

638
01:54:32,615 --> 01:54:35,033
You animal!
Put a cork in her.

639
01:54:37,203 --> 01:54:39,955
No. Oh.

640
01:54:40,123 --> 01:54:41,248
No.

641
01:54:41,416 --> 01:54:43,458
No. Don't.

642
01:54:43,626 --> 01:54:46,295
Don't. No!

643
01:54:46,462 --> 01:54:52,426
No! You dirty bastards! You're--

644
01:54:56,764 --> 01:54:58,640
Bastards!

645
01:55:05,315 --> 01:55:07,149
Try the secret compartment.

646
01:55:13,656 --> 01:55:15,490
Attaboy.

647
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:26,501
Thanks.

648
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:51,693
Wow. Nice matzo balls.
Huh?

649
01:55:56,532 --> 01:55:58,951
Whoa.

650
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:01,828
Those are beautiful. Look at that. Hm?

651
01:56:03,373 --> 01:56:05,707
Okay, better wrap them up.

652
01:56:14,842 --> 01:56:16,259
We're going. You coming?

653
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:21,556
Coming.

654
01:57:08,938 --> 01:57:12,274
-Morning.
-You get the stones?

655
01:57:31,210 --> 01:57:34,838
Aw.... Pay him.

656
01:57:59,655 --> 01:58:04,159
-Any problem?
-No trouble. Kid stuff.

657
02:00:19,378 --> 02:00:21,004
You okay?

658
02:00:59,001 --> 02:01:02,921
-How come you didn't tell me?
-Being inside can change you.

659
02:01:03,089 --> 02:01:05,966
I'd already made the deal with Frankie
to get rid of Joe.

660
02:01:06,133 --> 02:01:08,677
With Frankie Monaldi, you don't
say "yes," then "no." Couldn't...

661
02:01:08,844 --> 02:01:12,180
-...take the chance you'd change your mind.
-You're right. I would have said no.

662
02:01:12,723 --> 02:01:14,724
Frankie Monaldi is as big as they come.

663
02:01:14,892 --> 02:01:16,935
He's got the combination
in the palm of his hand.

664
02:01:17,103 --> 02:01:19,938
If we're not careful, he'll have us
in the palm of his hand.

665
02:01:20,106 --> 02:01:22,357
You don't get nowhere alone.

666
02:01:22,858 --> 02:01:25,235
I thought you were the guy
that said you didn't like bosses.

667
02:01:25,403 --> 02:01:28,530
It sounded like a good idea then.
It still is.

668
02:01:28,698 --> 02:01:29,906
Let's just think about it.

669
02:01:30,074 --> 02:01:34,619
They're gonna ask us to come in
with them. There's a lot in it for us.

670
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:41,543
Today they ask us to get rid of Joe.
Tomorrow they ask me to get rid of you.

671
02:01:41,711 --> 02:01:45,088
Is that okay with you?
Because it's not okay with me.

672
02:01:48,092 --> 02:01:49,926
All right.

673
02:01:51,095 --> 02:01:53,179
Let's just forget about it.

674
02:02:06,527 --> 02:02:08,069
Wanna go for a swim?

675
02:02:10,448 --> 02:02:12,866
Yeah, let's go for a swim.

676
02:02:24,003 --> 02:02:26,004
All right, what are you doing?

677
02:02:26,172 --> 02:02:29,591
Hey, Noodles.
Don't fuck around, Noodles.

678
02:02:32,678 --> 02:02:35,096
-What are you doing?
Hey!

679
02:02:35,264 --> 02:02:37,515
Are you crazy?

680
02:02:40,311 --> 02:02:42,228
Shit.

681
02:02:48,819 --> 02:02:52,489
That asshole!
I can't believe you did this!

682
02:03:10,007 --> 02:03:13,718
District Attorney James Lister
was killed in an explosion of a car...

683
02:03:13,886 --> 02:03:16,554
...belonging to Secretary of Commerce
Christopher Bailey...

684
02:03:16,722 --> 02:03:20,016
...as he was leaving
the secretary's Long Island estate.

685
02:03:20,184 --> 02:03:23,603
Mr. Lister, who was killed instantly
in the blast, was scheduled to testify...

686
02:03:23,771 --> 02:03:26,940
...in Washington on Thursday
before a Senate committee.

687
02:03:27,108 --> 02:03:31,111
A committee investigating what has
come to be called the Bailey scandal.

688
02:03:31,278 --> 02:03:34,656
A special team of detectives
has been assigned to the case.

689
02:03:34,824 --> 02:03:39,661
As for Secretary Bailey, he was not
available for any statement at this time.

690
02:03:40,538 --> 02:03:41,663
Did you know those guys?

691
02:03:41,831 --> 02:03:45,166
--offices of his longtime legal advisor,
Irving Gold...

692
02:03:45,334 --> 02:03:47,877
...in hopes of getting some comment.

693
02:03:48,045 --> 02:03:52,465
Mr. Gold, you're aware
that District Attorney Lister...

694
02:03:52,633 --> 02:03:56,553
...is the second witness in the Bailey
scandal to meet a sudden and violent end.

695
02:03:56,720 --> 02:04:00,223
The first was Thomas Finney,
undersecretary of commerce...

696
02:04:00,391 --> 02:04:04,602
...who fell to his death from
his 15th-floor office just a month ago.

697
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:06,396
Do you think there's a connection--?

698
02:04:06,564 --> 02:04:10,567
Take the money and run, Noodles.
What the hell's keeping you here?

699
02:04:11,527 --> 02:04:14,362
The only remaining witness
is the man who...

700
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:19,659
...rightly or wrongly has given his name
to this whole affair, Secretary Bailey.

701
02:04:19,827 --> 02:04:22,579
-I'm curious.
What does the secretary think?

702
02:04:22,746 --> 02:04:24,747
The secretary has no worries.

703
02:04:24,915 --> 02:04:29,752
Sir, if he has no worries, why then has
he retreated to his place on Long Island?

704
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:33,673
Far from retreating, he's busy preparing
his attack on the questions...

705
02:04:33,841 --> 02:04:35,675
...he will be asked by the committee.

706
02:04:35,843 --> 02:04:38,386
I'd call them accusations
more than questions, sir.

707
02:04:38,554 --> 02:04:41,222
-The secretary has no worries.
But the public does.

708
02:04:41,390 --> 02:04:45,935
Particularly in view of the rumors
about rigged contracts, bribery...

709
02:04:46,103 --> 02:04:50,565
...the international Mafia. Especially
those dealing with the illegal use...

710
02:04:50,733 --> 02:04:53,610
...of the Transport union
pension funds.

711
02:04:53,777 --> 02:04:56,112
Could you tell us anything about that?

712
02:04:56,280 --> 02:05:02,118
Gentlemen, I deny all of these rumors
and allegations against my organization.

713
02:05:02,286 --> 02:05:06,748
Our hands have always been
and will continue to remain clean.

714
02:05:06,916 --> 02:05:12,462
In my entire life, I've fought to keep
the American labor movement clear--

715
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:13,671
Him, I know.

716
02:05:13,839 --> 02:05:16,758
--forced speculation,
criminal elements...

717
02:05:16,926 --> 02:05:21,638
...or corrupt politicians.
If any mistakes have been made--

718
02:05:21,805 --> 02:05:24,933
He's still giving out
the same old bullshit.

719
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:31,439
If any guilt at all exists
in this situation, it lies elsewhere.

720
02:06:10,604 --> 02:06:15,191
What's this I've been reading
about you in the newspapers? Hm?

721
02:06:17,236 --> 02:06:21,781
Inflammatory words from a union boss?

722
02:06:26,161 --> 02:06:31,416
You still aren't gonna stop
the workers or the social movement.

723
02:06:31,959 --> 02:06:35,211
Listen to me, you socialist asshole!

724
02:06:35,379 --> 02:06:40,717
We don't give a good fart about the
socialist workers and their movements.

725
02:06:40,884 --> 02:06:45,888
We just want you out of the factory so
we can get the furnaces working again.

726
02:06:46,056 --> 02:06:49,058
This is the last offer
you're gonna get.

727
02:06:49,226 --> 02:06:52,270
You want to sign it or what?

728
02:06:58,152 --> 02:07:01,446
Tell your bosses they can
wipe their ass with it.

729
02:07:07,828 --> 02:07:09,162
Fill her up.

730
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:35,563
This is my last--

731
02:07:43,155 --> 02:07:46,282
Hold it, boys. Don't shoot.

732
02:07:47,493 --> 02:07:49,786
It's me, Crowning.

733
02:08:02,716 --> 02:08:05,468
-Crowning.
-Yeah.

734
02:08:05,636 --> 02:08:07,303
That'll do, boys.

735
02:08:07,471 --> 02:08:09,305
What'll do?

736
02:08:09,473 --> 02:08:12,767
We almost got the kid
where we want him.

737
02:08:16,605 --> 02:08:19,691
And we got the boss where we want him.

738
02:08:19,858 --> 02:08:21,442
Easy.

739
02:08:22,486 --> 02:08:24,487
Easy.

740
02:08:27,825 --> 02:08:30,159
Put them down.

741
02:08:30,911 --> 02:08:33,496
Put your guns away, boys.

742
02:08:43,298 --> 02:08:45,383
Just swapping prisoners.

743
02:08:46,009 --> 02:08:48,636
Fair trade, huh, chickenhead?

744
02:08:56,019 --> 02:08:59,188
Union boy over here for Mr. Boss Man.

745
02:08:59,356 --> 02:09:01,899
Well, look who's here. Ha, ha.

746
02:09:02,651 --> 02:09:05,403
Fat Moe's boneyard boys.

747
02:09:05,571 --> 02:09:07,655
Which reminds me.

748
02:09:08,073 --> 02:09:11,826
How's that cancer in your gut
coming along, Chicken Joe?

749
02:09:13,996 --> 02:09:17,790
-Untie him.
-I don't take orders from you.

750
02:09:17,958 --> 02:09:21,127
We're not asking you to take orders, Joe.
We're telling you.

751
02:09:21,295 --> 02:09:23,463
Now go ahead, untie him.

752
02:09:23,630 --> 02:09:25,631
Untie him.

753
02:09:30,512 --> 02:09:31,637
Untie him.

754
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,921
Who are you?

755
02:10:05,923 --> 02:10:06,964
Who's paying you?

756
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:11,052
I think this is really gonna
piss you off there, Mac.

757
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:14,764
I think it's those dirty, dirty
politician friends of yours.

758
02:10:14,932 --> 02:10:19,560
Yeah? Well, you crawl back and tell
him we don't want you in with us.

759
02:10:19,728 --> 02:10:23,481
Our fight's got nothing to do with
liquor and prostitution and dope.

760
02:10:23,649 --> 02:10:26,526
You'd better
get used to the idea, pal.

761
02:10:27,236 --> 02:10:29,111
This country is still growing up.

762
02:10:29,279 --> 02:10:33,199
Certain diseases it's better
to have when you're still young.

763
02:10:34,993 --> 02:10:39,789
You boys ain't a mild case
of the measles. You're the plague.

764
02:10:39,957 --> 02:10:41,999
And bastards like him are immune.

765
02:10:42,167 --> 02:10:45,461
That's the difference
between us and them!

766
02:10:47,297 --> 02:10:49,131
Take it easy.

767
02:10:49,299 --> 02:10:51,300
The difference is that
they're always gonna win...

768
02:10:51,468 --> 02:10:54,053
...and you're gonna
keep getting it up the ass.

769
02:10:54,221 --> 02:10:56,180
Sooner than you think.

770
02:11:13,490 --> 02:11:17,702
Chief Aiello, moving policemen into
the factory came as a surprise to everyone:

771
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:20,580
The press, the unions,
especially the strikers.

772
02:11:20,747 --> 02:11:23,332
Well, what did you want, sweetheart,
a declaration of war?

773
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:25,251
Ours was a peaceable operation.

774
02:11:25,419 --> 02:11:27,795
Wasn't that contrary
to new union laws?

775
02:11:27,963 --> 02:11:30,172
I'm chief of police,
not chief of the people.

776
02:11:30,340 --> 02:11:32,675
Was there any violence by the strikers
to justify--?

777
02:11:32,843 --> 02:11:36,512
My motto is:
"Prevention, not repression."

778
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:38,764
But you let scabs move in
and start working.

779
02:11:38,932 --> 02:11:42,310
Young lady, you wanna talk to me,
call them "unemployed workers."

780
02:11:43,645 --> 02:11:48,024
With your permission, I'll take these
flowers to my missis before they wilt.

781
02:11:48,692 --> 02:11:52,653
Or maybe you heard.
I'm the father of a baby boy!

782
02:11:54,865 --> 02:11:57,366
Chief, one more question.

783
02:11:57,534 --> 02:12:01,996
We heard he's the youngest stockholder
in that factory you occupied.

784
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:08,669
What'd you mean by that?

785
02:12:08,837 --> 02:12:12,006
They say management expressed their
thanks with a birthday present for the baby.

786
02:12:16,428 --> 02:12:19,055
You know,
slander is a serious offense.

787
02:12:19,222 --> 02:12:21,474
Especially when it comes
from a hack reporter.

788
02:12:21,975 --> 02:12:24,727
You wanna find out how serious?

789
02:12:26,855 --> 02:12:31,859
But since this is my first boy
after four girls...

790
02:12:32,027 --> 02:12:34,570
...I'll declare amnesty.

791
02:12:35,364 --> 02:12:38,574
Ha-ha-ha. Behave yourself.

792
02:12:39,952 --> 02:12:41,869
Go.

793
02:14:53,085 --> 02:14:56,087
Thank you. Oh.

794
02:14:56,254 --> 02:14:57,838
-He's eating?
-Mm-hm.

795
02:14:58,006 --> 02:15:01,425
-For five.
-For five? Well, why not?

796
02:15:01,593 --> 02:15:04,386
You could feed an army with
these two milk plants. Ha-ha-ha.

797
02:15:04,554 --> 02:15:05,846
We could open up a dairy.

798
02:15:09,267 --> 02:15:10,726
Oh, hey.

799
02:15:12,604 --> 02:15:18,400
Who loves you? Who loves you?
I love you.

800
02:15:18,568 --> 02:15:22,404
And I love you.
And I love you.

801
02:15:22,572 --> 02:15:24,198
Lucy!

802
02:15:24,366 --> 02:15:26,408
-Don't you have to feed him at 6:00?
Uh-huh.

803
02:15:27,786 --> 02:15:29,203
Come in.

804
02:15:30,914 --> 02:15:34,500
-Oh, here he is now.
-That's my son.

805
02:15:34,668 --> 02:15:38,629
That's my son. Oh, oh.

806
02:15:40,799 --> 02:15:46,428
That's my son. That's my son!
Ha-ha-ha.

807
02:15:46,596 --> 02:15:48,347
Jesus Christ, they change fast.

808
02:15:49,933 --> 02:15:52,560
Yeah, but he looks like my old man.

809
02:15:52,727 --> 02:15:54,603
Yeah, yeah, look, same eyes.

810
02:15:54,771 --> 02:15:57,148
And look at that,
the same devilish pride, huh?

811
02:15:57,315 --> 02:16:00,192
Hey. Hey, hey.

812
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:01,902
Did you see his dickey?

813
02:16:02,070 --> 02:16:03,946
-Vincent.
What?

814
02:16:04,114 --> 02:16:06,448
-The girls.
-The girls!

815
02:16:06,616 --> 02:16:12,538
Sooner or later you have to learn that
after me, the boss in the house is him.

816
02:16:12,706 --> 02:16:14,498
He's got balls just like his papa.

817
02:16:14,666 --> 02:16:15,916
-Whoa! Hey!
-Let me have him.

818
02:16:16,084 --> 02:16:19,712
No, no, no. I'll do this.

819
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:21,755
I'll do this, huh? Yeah.

820
02:16:25,093 --> 02:16:27,094
Look. Hey, hey.

821
02:16:28,847 --> 02:16:31,265
Ooh. Ha-ha-ha.

822
02:16:31,766 --> 02:16:33,100
Let Papa change you, huh?

823
02:16:33,268 --> 02:16:35,477
Come on, look.
Give me your little-bitty smile.

824
02:16:35,645 --> 02:16:40,524
Come on, come on, come on.

825
02:16:41,902 --> 02:16:42,943
What the fuck is this?

826
02:16:44,279 --> 02:16:49,450
-What is this? Huh? What's that?
No! No! Oh, no!

827
02:16:49,993 --> 02:16:52,244
-Look.
-It's the right number.

828
02:16:52,412 --> 02:16:55,748
The right number?
I'll break your goddamn neck!

829
02:16:55,916 --> 02:16:58,334
Find my son, or I'll burn down
this goddamn building!

830
02:16:59,669 --> 02:17:02,254
Hello! Hello.

831
02:17:02,422 --> 02:17:03,672
-Would you shut up?
-Oh!

832
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:08,177
No, hey, no. Wait, wait.
I'm not talking to you.

833
02:17:08,345 --> 02:17:10,554
Well, who's this?

834
02:17:10,722 --> 02:17:13,140
Never mind--
To who am I talking?

835
02:17:13,308 --> 02:17:16,101
Who the hell are you?
My son, where is he?

836
02:17:16,269 --> 02:17:20,314
Where the hell do you think he is?
He's in the maternity ward. He never left.

837
02:17:20,482 --> 02:17:23,817
He just got a little restless
so he wanted to change his bed.

838
02:17:23,985 --> 02:17:27,696
And the other kids got the same idea
so they also wanted to change their beds.

839
02:17:27,864 --> 02:17:31,659
So there you got 30, 40 screaming babies
jumping from one bed to another...

840
02:17:31,826 --> 02:17:35,246
...switching tags, so now
we do have a real problem.

841
02:17:35,413 --> 02:17:38,499
Piece of shit whoever you are!
What the fuck are you saying?

842
02:17:38,667 --> 02:17:40,000
-Huh?
-...can't find my son!

843
02:17:40,168 --> 02:17:41,210
Oh, no, no, no.

844
02:17:41,378 --> 02:17:44,296
Luckily we were there to see that
everything was under control.

845
02:17:44,464 --> 02:17:46,882
If you want, we can put everything
back where it was.

846
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:48,425
Except there's one problem.

847
02:17:48,593 --> 02:17:51,053
-You gotta meet us halfway.
-Halfway. Tell me!

848
02:17:51,221 --> 02:17:53,305
Why do you care who wins the strike?

849
02:17:53,473 --> 02:17:55,766
That's got nothing to do with me!
What did I do?

850
02:17:55,934 --> 02:17:58,519
What did you do?
First of all, you let the scabs in.

851
02:17:58,687 --> 02:18:01,313
Second of all, you got the cops in there
protecting them.

852
02:18:01,481 --> 02:18:04,858
-That's my right. I'm a cop!
-All right, shut the fuck up.

853
02:18:05,026 --> 02:18:07,027
Now, listen to me very carefully.

854
02:18:07,195 --> 02:18:11,198
You're gonna call off your dogs and let
the strikers work it out with the bosses.

855
02:18:11,366 --> 02:18:12,408
I want my son back now.

856
02:18:12,575 --> 02:18:15,119
Do that,
we'll give you your kid's new number.

857
02:18:15,287 --> 02:18:18,122
You don't do that, look for your kid
yourself, and good luck.

858
02:18:19,457 --> 02:18:21,000
-So, what is it gonna be?
-Okay.

859
02:18:21,167 --> 02:18:24,169
-I'll call my men off today.
-Attaboy.

860
02:18:24,337 --> 02:18:27,506
You know, Aiello, for a rotten,
rat-bastard son of a bitch...

861
02:18:27,674 --> 02:18:29,466
...you're not as stupid as I thought.

862
02:18:31,261 --> 02:18:33,429
-We'll be in touch.
-When will you call?

863
02:18:33,596 --> 02:18:36,807
Don't worry, don't worry.
We'll be in touch with you.

864
02:18:36,975 --> 02:18:38,267
-Bye.
-I gotta know--

865
02:18:42,314 --> 02:18:43,897
-So?
-We got a deal.

866
02:18:49,029 --> 02:18:51,280
-To a very smooth talker.
-Yeah.

867
02:18:51,448 --> 02:18:54,074
-Mazel.
At least.

868
02:18:54,242 --> 02:18:56,869
-Peggeleh.
-Noodles.

869
02:19:01,916 --> 02:19:03,959
Where's that switch list?

870
02:19:04,127 --> 02:19:06,545
The switch list?
-Yeah.

871
02:19:07,881 --> 02:19:09,590
-I can't find it.
What?

872
02:19:09,758 --> 02:19:11,842
I can't find it.

873
02:19:12,802 --> 02:19:15,846
-What'd you do with it?
-I think I dumped it with that jacket.

874
02:19:16,014 --> 02:19:17,598
What a yutz.

875
02:19:17,766 --> 02:19:19,933
Oh, Pat.
Wait a minute, listen.

876
02:19:20,101 --> 02:19:22,936
Listen, Noodles,
Noodles, wait. I remember.

877
02:19:23,104 --> 02:19:27,024
The boys' numbers was odd-- Was even,
and the girls' numbers was odd.

878
02:19:27,192 --> 02:19:29,318
-That's very simple.
-You took good stock.

879
02:19:29,486 --> 02:19:31,737
Hey, know what?
Let's give him an even number.

880
02:19:31,905 --> 02:19:34,239
Uh, eight. Let's pick an eight.

881
02:19:34,491 --> 02:19:35,616
Eight.

882
02:19:38,495 --> 02:19:40,037
Yeah, it's a good number.

883
02:19:40,205 --> 02:19:43,082
Wait a minute. What about
the other little pischers?

884
02:19:44,042 --> 02:19:46,126
We're better than fate.

885
02:19:46,294 --> 02:19:49,171
We give some the good life,
give it to others up the ass.

886
02:19:52,342 --> 02:19:55,803
All right, boys, let's settle up.
It's Saturday.

887
02:19:55,970 --> 02:19:59,264
Settle-shmettle, Peggy,
I'm gonna take mine out in trade.

888
02:19:59,432 --> 02:20:00,808
Oh, you're such a nudge.

889
02:20:02,477 --> 02:20:06,647
Hey, you know what?
I wish I was switched when I was a kid.

890
02:20:06,815 --> 02:20:08,565
What makes you think you weren't?

891
02:20:24,582 --> 02:20:26,708
I don't believe it.

892
02:20:27,377 --> 02:20:31,255
Hey, you guys, come here.
Take a look at who's over here.

893
02:20:31,423 --> 02:20:33,715
-That suit you, Peg?
Okay, fine, Max.

894
02:20:33,883 --> 02:20:36,427
-What have you got?
-Over there.

895
02:20:38,888 --> 02:20:40,806
Well, what--?

896
02:20:46,062 --> 02:20:50,232
Holy shit! Noodles, Noodles!
Come here, come here.

897
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:52,067
Look.

898
02:20:54,070 --> 02:20:56,488
The blond by the piano.

899
02:20:59,993 --> 02:21:02,119
-Yeah, who's that? Yeah.
-Who's that?

900
02:21:02,287 --> 02:21:04,329
You and this broad were
practically engaged.

901
02:21:04,497 --> 02:21:05,664
Ooh.

902
02:21:05,832 --> 02:21:10,878
Beat me. Ooh, beat me. Ooh, I love it.
Ha, ha.

903
02:21:11,045 --> 02:21:13,547
-Who was it? The Detroit cock-squasher?
Yeah.

904
02:21:13,715 --> 02:21:16,091
Peggy.
Not her, she looks different.

905
02:21:16,259 --> 02:21:19,595
You know that platinum blond
in the flower dress? She's by the table.

906
02:21:19,762 --> 02:21:22,181
See her? Call her in, will you?

907
02:21:28,813 --> 02:21:30,272
-Carol.
-Carol, whatever.

908
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:34,443
Just tell her there's a bunch of her
old friends here, you know what I mean?

909
02:21:36,154 --> 02:21:37,738
Carol.

910
02:21:37,906 --> 02:21:39,781
Carol!

911
02:21:44,787 --> 02:21:47,164
Noodles, pfft, come here.

912
02:21:50,376 --> 02:21:53,795
-Somebody here wants to see you.
-Who?

913
02:21:54,547 --> 02:21:56,256
You know these guys?

914
02:21:58,676 --> 02:22:00,552
No.

915
02:22:01,971 --> 02:22:04,431
I don't think so.

916
02:22:08,269 --> 02:22:09,770
No. Ha, ha.

917
02:22:09,938 --> 02:22:13,732
No. I'd remember a bunch
of good-lookers like these.

918
02:22:31,251 --> 02:22:34,920
Oh, well, how could I forget?

919
02:22:41,177 --> 02:22:43,554
There was, uh....

920
02:22:43,721 --> 02:22:49,351
There was only one of you
I got to know personally, though.

921
02:22:51,104 --> 02:22:52,813
Which one?

922
02:22:52,981 --> 02:22:56,233
Let's see how good
a memory you've got for faces.

923
02:23:16,546 --> 02:23:18,964
You.

924
02:23:19,132 --> 02:23:21,049
No.

925
02:23:21,301 --> 02:23:22,551
Him.

926
02:23:22,719 --> 02:23:26,305
We've been hanging out so long
together, we're starting to look alike.

927
02:23:26,472 --> 02:23:28,473
"Hanging out"?

928
02:23:38,693 --> 02:23:41,320
Charmed.

929
02:23:58,546 --> 02:24:00,547
You can call me Carol.

930
02:24:12,060 --> 02:24:14,311
We've already met.

931
02:24:32,538 --> 02:24:34,623
Pleasure.

932
02:24:35,667 --> 02:24:37,793
The pleasure...

933
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:40,212
...is all mine.

934
02:24:50,348 --> 02:24:53,058
Mmm.

935
02:25:07,198 --> 02:25:10,075
So you left Detroit, huh?

936
02:25:10,243 --> 02:25:12,744
No, her and her husband
just come in on the weekends.

937
02:25:12,912 --> 02:25:15,163
Yeah, it beats the seashore.

938
02:25:16,124 --> 02:25:20,210
Well, she takes on maybe 10 guys and
her hubby watches through the peephole.

939
02:25:20,378 --> 02:25:22,504
Beats the hell out of the movies.

940
02:25:22,672 --> 02:25:25,298
I wonder what that jerk is up to
in his cubbyhole now.

941
02:25:25,466 --> 02:25:27,759
He must be wondering,
where is his fucking wife?

942
02:25:35,810 --> 02:25:39,604
Why don't we make it a threesome, huh?

943
02:25:39,772 --> 02:25:42,899
Can't you see he's got
other plans for tonight?

944
02:25:43,067 --> 02:25:47,154
Well, bring her along.
We'll make it a foursome.

945
02:25:51,451 --> 02:25:54,619
I'm not that kind of guy.

946
02:25:54,787 --> 02:25:59,624
Besides, I'm afraid if I give you a good
crack in the mouth, you'd probably like it.

947
02:26:13,014 --> 02:26:15,474
Have a good night, fellas.

948
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:18,059
See you later.

949
02:26:31,157 --> 02:26:34,242
-Been waiting long?
-All my life.

950
02:26:54,514 --> 02:26:59,017
You wanted a place by the ocean so I had
it opened. It was closed for the season.

951
02:26:59,185 --> 02:27:01,978
All these tables are for two people.

952
02:27:02,313 --> 02:27:04,773
Pick whatever one you want.

953
02:27:36,305 --> 02:27:37,931
I like this one.

954
02:27:38,099 --> 02:27:40,225
Here, sit down.

955
02:27:49,694 --> 02:27:53,321
Oh, I'll have the asperges sauce
vinaigrette and then a Châteaubriand.

956
02:27:56,784 --> 02:27:58,660
I'll decide later.

957
02:27:58,828 --> 02:28:01,413
-Monsieur?
-I'll have the same.

958
02:28:02,498 --> 02:28:04,332
For the wine?

959
02:28:04,500 --> 02:28:06,751
You decide.
I'll just have water.

960
02:28:06,919 --> 02:28:10,881
-You decide.
-Thank you.

961
02:28:18,180 --> 02:28:19,639
You've been around.

962
02:28:20,808 --> 02:28:24,144
Where'd you learn all them
"parlez-vous français" dishes?

963
02:28:24,312 --> 02:28:25,812
Who's teaching you that stuff?

964
02:28:27,189 --> 02:28:30,442
You mean a sugar daddy
who tries to teach me how to act?

965
02:28:32,862 --> 02:28:34,404
I read books. I learn everything.

966
02:28:34,572 --> 02:28:38,241
I want to know everything.
Doesn't it make sense to have plans?

967
02:28:39,577 --> 02:28:41,828
Yeah, it does.

968
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:45,540
What about me? Am I in these plans?

969
02:28:47,668 --> 02:28:49,377
Noodles....

970
02:28:50,796 --> 02:28:54,341
You're the only person that I have ever--

971
02:28:54,508 --> 02:28:57,677
Ever what? Go ahead.

972
02:28:59,096 --> 02:29:01,097
Ever what?

973
02:29:01,682 --> 02:29:04,225
That I ever cared about.

974
02:29:04,602 --> 02:29:08,271
But you'd lock me up and you'd
throw away the key, wouldn't you?

975
02:29:12,777 --> 02:29:14,611
Yeah.

976
02:29:15,279 --> 02:29:17,364
Yeah, I guess so.

977
02:29:17,531 --> 02:29:19,658
Yeah.

978
02:29:19,825 --> 02:29:23,119
And the thing is,
I probably wouldn't even mind.

979
02:29:25,456 --> 02:29:30,293
-So?
-So I got to get to where I'm going.

980
02:29:30,461 --> 02:29:33,254
-And where's that?
-To the top.

981
02:29:36,968 --> 02:29:39,719
Now you sound just like Maxie.

982
02:29:40,262 --> 02:29:43,640
Youse are both alike,
that's why you hate each other so much.

983
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:46,017
Do you want me to leave?

984
02:29:51,065 --> 02:29:53,608
No, I don't want you to leave.

985
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:18,591
You dancing?

986
02:30:19,093 --> 02:30:20,719
-You asking?
-I'm asking.

987
02:30:20,886 --> 02:30:22,971
I'm dancing.

988
02:31:35,753 --> 02:31:40,465
To keep from going crazy,
you have to cut yourself off from the world.

989
02:31:40,633 --> 02:31:43,259
Just not think about it.
You have to, uh....

990
02:31:43,427 --> 02:31:46,721
You know, years that went by,
it seemed like...

991
02:31:46,889 --> 02:31:50,183
...no time at all,
because you're not doing anything.

992
02:31:50,351 --> 02:31:53,895
But there were two things I couldn't
get out of my mind. One was Dominic.

993
02:31:54,063 --> 02:31:57,607
The way he said "I slipped"
just before he died.

994
02:31:58,901 --> 02:32:01,152
The other was you.

995
02:32:07,368 --> 02:32:11,579
How you used to read me
your Song of Songs, remember?

996
02:32:13,374 --> 02:32:17,836
How beautiful are your feet
in sandals, O prince's daughter.

997
02:32:21,465 --> 02:32:26,636
I used to read the Bible every night.
Every night I used to think about you.

998
02:32:28,889 --> 02:32:33,601
Your navel is a bowl,
well-rounded with no lack of wine.

999
02:32:33,769 --> 02:32:37,647
Your belly, a heap of wheat
surrounded with lilies.

1000
02:32:37,815 --> 02:32:40,233
Your breasts...

1001
02:32:41,777 --> 02:32:44,237
...clusters of grapes.

1002
02:32:44,947 --> 02:32:49,284
Your breath, sweet-scented as apples.

1003
02:32:56,876 --> 02:32:59,961
Nobody's gonna love you
the way I loved you.

1004
02:33:04,466 --> 02:33:07,969
There were times I couldn't stand it
anymore. I used to think about you.

1005
02:33:08,137 --> 02:33:12,223
I'd think, "Deborah lives.
She's out there. She exists."

1006
02:33:12,391 --> 02:33:14,893
And that would get me through it all.

1007
02:33:17,438 --> 02:33:19,981
You know how important
that was to me?

1008
02:33:26,238 --> 02:33:28,865
Noodles, I'm leaving tomorrow
to go to Hollywood.

1009
02:33:29,033 --> 02:33:31,826
I wanted to see you tonight
to tell you.

1010
02:35:25,941 --> 02:35:27,608
No.

1011
02:35:28,068 --> 02:35:29,652
No! I--

1012
02:35:30,279 --> 02:35:33,072
No! No. Ah!

1013
02:35:36,702 --> 02:35:41,789
No. Please, no. No, please. No!

1014
02:35:41,957 --> 02:35:47,253
No! Oh, no! No, please!

1015
02:35:47,421 --> 02:35:52,592
No, no! Please, no, no. No.

1016
02:35:55,888 --> 02:35:57,638
No!

1017
02:37:32,526 --> 02:37:34,193
Deborah. Deborah.

1018
02:37:34,361 --> 02:37:36,737
Get away! Get away!

1019
02:37:53,672 --> 02:37:55,631
I'll be right back.

1020
02:38:27,372 --> 02:38:29,165
Take her home.

1021
02:38:30,083 --> 02:38:31,918
Take her home.

1022
02:40:05,178 --> 02:40:07,805
All aboard!

1023
02:42:28,488 --> 02:42:30,030
Well...

1024
02:42:30,699 --> 02:42:32,908
...look who's back.

1025
02:42:34,202 --> 02:42:35,953
What's this?

1026
02:42:39,458 --> 02:42:41,208
It's a throne.

1027
02:42:43,378 --> 02:42:45,755
It was a gift to a pope.

1028
02:42:46,631 --> 02:42:51,010
-Cost me 800 bucks.
-It's from the 17th century.

1029
02:43:00,270 --> 02:43:02,730
So, what are you doing with it?

1030
02:43:05,567 --> 02:43:07,443
I'm sitting on it.

1031
02:43:15,744 --> 02:43:18,913
-You got any coffee around?
Yeah, sure.

1032
02:43:30,759 --> 02:43:32,426
Thanks.

1033
02:44:47,335 --> 02:44:48,836
Hm.

1034
02:44:50,338 --> 02:44:55,092
While you were on vacation,
we were working overtime.

1035
02:45:02,267 --> 02:45:04,393
The union paid off.

1036
02:45:07,272 --> 02:45:09,315
That's your share.

1037
02:45:10,442 --> 02:45:14,737
Yeah. Even that geek.
You know, Jimmy "Clean Hands"...

1038
02:45:14,905 --> 02:45:20,701
...respects us.
Eh, I shed a little blood for the cause.

1039
02:45:20,869 --> 02:45:23,287
Yeah, it's all in the papers.

1040
02:45:23,455 --> 02:45:27,583
Morning Telegraph, they didn't like it.

1041
02:45:27,751 --> 02:45:32,588
It says, "Underworld joins strikers
in brutal battle."

1042
02:45:32,756 --> 02:45:36,550
But The Post, they liked it.

1043
02:45:36,718 --> 02:45:40,429
"Ends justify means
in decisive gangland encounter."

1044
02:45:40,847 --> 02:45:43,766
And they're the ones that kvetched
about the Atlantic City job.

1045
02:45:43,934 --> 02:45:47,937
Heh. Newspaper guys never know
what the fuck they want.

1046
02:45:54,861 --> 02:45:58,238
-Well, you could have looked for me.
We did.

1047
02:45:59,574 --> 02:46:02,034
Cockeye found you at the Chink's.

1048
02:46:02,202 --> 02:46:04,954
So fucking doped up
you didn't even recognize him.

1049
02:46:05,163 --> 02:46:10,334
Yeah, you were. Heh.
You called me "Deborah." Ha-ha-ha.

1050
02:46:12,087 --> 02:46:14,421
Hey, go fuck yourself.
Mind your own business.

1051
02:46:14,589 --> 02:46:18,884
We do our business together
and fucking broads do not get in the way...

1052
02:46:19,052 --> 02:46:20,344
-...and you know it!
Yeah?

1053
02:46:20,512 --> 02:46:22,763
-Yeah.
-Then what's she doing here?

1054
02:46:24,057 --> 02:46:27,977
Today ain't Saturday. She should be in
Detroit, screwing on the assembly line.

1055
02:46:28,144 --> 02:46:30,771
Well, she's screwing here now.

1056
02:46:30,939 --> 02:46:34,650
And only with Max.

1057
02:46:35,276 --> 02:46:37,236
Oh, yeah?

1058
02:46:37,404 --> 02:46:41,991
-With her husband peeping through?
-No, I left him.

1059
02:46:46,037 --> 02:46:49,790
You live with her, bring her here,
and you tell me not to mess with broads.

1060
02:46:49,958 --> 02:46:51,709
-You forget one thing.
What?

1061
02:46:51,876 --> 02:46:54,044
-I don't give a fuck about her.
-Max--

1062
02:46:54,212 --> 02:46:57,464
Shut up! Shut up! Shh!
Maxie, tell me something.

1063
02:46:57,632 --> 02:46:59,466
What'll you spend your honeymoon on?

1064
02:46:59,634 --> 02:47:03,679
-Maxie--
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

1065
02:47:04,973 --> 02:47:07,057
Just shut up!

1066
02:47:11,521 --> 02:47:13,522
You want me to dump her?

1067
02:47:13,982 --> 02:47:15,899
You want me to kick her
out of here?

1068
02:47:17,986 --> 02:47:20,320
Want me to kick her ass out or what?

1069
02:47:20,488 --> 02:47:25,242
You want me to kick--? Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out! Get out!

1070
02:47:32,292 --> 02:47:35,127
You gonna tell me I don't have
a way with women? Ha-ha-ha.

1071
02:47:47,974 --> 02:47:50,476
-Hello.
This is Jimmy. Who's this, Max?

1072
02:47:50,643 --> 02:47:52,686
No, it's Noodles.

1073
02:47:55,023 --> 02:47:59,026
Okay, listen.
We're gonna need you guys today.

1074
02:47:59,194 --> 02:48:02,446
I'm gonna be making
a tough speech, and I think you--

1075
02:48:13,083 --> 02:48:15,125
Go, go!

1076
02:48:36,397 --> 02:48:39,650
Start the engine.
I'll be right with you.

1077
02:48:39,818 --> 02:48:44,071
Mr. Gallagher wants you to know
how much he appreciates what you did.

1078
02:48:44,239 --> 02:48:46,657
To show his appreciation....

1079
02:48:57,085 --> 02:49:00,212
Here's an envelope
for the both of youse.

1080
02:49:00,380 --> 02:49:05,092
If we gotta complete the job,
I'll let you know.

1081
02:49:41,212 --> 02:49:42,379
Whoa! Whoa!

1082
02:49:42,797 --> 02:49:44,923
Wiped out by a blast of Cordon Rouge.

1083
02:49:45,091 --> 02:49:47,718
What would Crowning
and his bosses say after that, eh?

1084
02:49:47,886 --> 02:49:50,804
Never be afraid of you, then,
would they?

1085
02:49:50,972 --> 02:49:55,726
They're still not afraid of me.
It was you boys that scared them off.

1086
02:49:55,977 --> 02:50:00,355
And you didn't want these guys.
Aren't you lucky you got party leaders...

1087
02:50:00,523 --> 02:50:02,816
...like myself who care about the union?

1088
02:50:02,984 --> 02:50:07,321
Hey, the strike is settled. We won.
That's what counts. Am I right, Jim?

1089
02:50:07,488 --> 02:50:11,283
It was tough for Jimmy not to be there
to sign the contract though, huh, Jim?

1090
02:50:11,451 --> 02:50:12,993
No.

1091
02:50:14,662 --> 02:50:19,499
What's tough is, you boys did more in
a night than I could in two years of talking.

1092
02:50:19,667 --> 02:50:21,877
Forget it.
To the hottest newcomer...

1093
02:50:22,045 --> 02:50:24,046
-...in American unions.
There you go.

1094
02:50:24,214 --> 02:50:26,298
Jimmy Conway.
Now you're talking.

1095
02:50:26,466 --> 02:50:27,883
Roll out the barrel.

1096
02:50:28,051 --> 02:50:32,346
May God bless.
Drink up. Suck it right down.

1097
02:50:32,513 --> 02:50:36,308
You must be crazy giving
him drinks. We're going to operate.

1098
02:50:36,476 --> 02:50:41,438
Oh, what's the rush? They already told me
I'd be a gimp for the rest of my life.

1099
02:50:41,606 --> 02:50:46,777
Don't worry, Jimmy, with one leg
a little shy, you're gonna take giant steps.

1100
02:50:46,945 --> 02:50:51,073
Yeah. And always one step
right behind you, Sharkey?

1101
02:50:51,241 --> 02:50:53,951
Make sure they work on
the right leg, Jim.

1102
02:50:54,118 --> 02:50:56,411
-It's only blood, huh?
-Mazel.

1103
02:51:04,295 --> 02:51:09,299
You boys got yourself a real martyr
for a friend. Make it work for you.

1104
02:51:09,467 --> 02:51:12,678
Yeah, but what the hell are we
gonna do with a martyr?

1105
02:51:12,845 --> 02:51:17,057
Times change. Prohibition ain't gonna
last much longer. Take it from me...

1106
02:51:17,225 --> 02:51:23,563
-...a lot of you guys will be out of work.
-Go on, Mr. Sharkey. We're interested.

1107
02:51:24,983 --> 02:51:28,527
You ever think of setting
yourselves up in business?

1108
02:51:28,903 --> 02:51:33,657
All those trucks they're using to haul
liquor, soon be selling them for nothing.

1109
02:51:33,825 --> 02:51:39,079
I'm talking about hundreds of vehicles
controlled by a national organization...

1110
02:51:39,247 --> 02:51:42,833
...and supported by a powerful union
headed by Jimmy Conway.

1111
02:51:43,001 --> 02:51:47,087
Whatever you ask,
there's no way he can turn you down.

1112
02:51:47,755 --> 02:51:49,798
You gotta be kidding, Sharkey.

1113
02:51:52,010 --> 02:51:55,345
Jimmy "Clean Hands"
in business with us?

1114
02:51:55,972 --> 02:51:59,474
They won't be clean for long,
with the hands he's gonna shake.

1115
02:51:59,642 --> 02:52:02,269
Everything in good time.

1116
02:52:17,118 --> 02:52:21,121
-We're not interested.
-What's the matter, you got a problem?

1117
02:52:21,289 --> 02:52:24,958
We got plenty of money tucked away.
Why not invest it? What is the problem?

1118
02:52:25,126 --> 02:52:29,421
I'll put the party behind you.
And I got friends in high places.

1119
02:52:30,965 --> 02:52:34,217
I'm not interested in your friends,
and I don't trust politicians.

1120
02:52:34,385 --> 02:52:36,970
You still think like
some schmuck from the streets.

1121
02:52:37,138 --> 02:52:40,098
If we'd listened to you,
we'd still be rolling drunks.

1122
02:52:40,266 --> 02:52:42,601
-Are you broke?
-Don't bust my balls.

1123
02:52:42,769 --> 02:52:45,812
I am talking about real money.

1124
02:52:46,314 --> 02:52:51,985
This is real money to me. It's a lot
of money. You want any of it?

1125
02:52:52,445 --> 02:52:56,865
-You carry that stink of the streets.
-I like the stink. It makes me feel good.

1126
02:52:57,033 --> 02:53:00,535
I like the smell of it.
It opens up my lungs.

1127
02:53:01,245 --> 02:53:03,330
And it gives me a hard-on.

1128
02:53:03,498 --> 02:53:05,832
You're carrying dead weight, Maxie.

1129
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:09,252
One of these days,
you're gonna have to dump it.

1130
02:53:12,882 --> 02:53:15,675
Maxie. Let me know
when you're gonna dump me.

1131
02:53:15,843 --> 02:53:19,429
Meanwhile, I'll take a vacation in Florida.
I got a yen for the seashore.

1132
02:53:42,412 --> 02:53:44,121
Hey.

1133
02:53:45,998 --> 02:53:48,875
Listen, I was thinking it over and, um....

1134
02:53:50,211 --> 02:53:54,256
I guess I kind of got a yen
for the seashore myself.

1135
02:53:59,887 --> 02:54:01,471
You wanna go swimming?

1136
02:54:02,348 --> 02:54:06,518
Yeah. Yeah, let's go for a swim.

1137
02:54:23,327 --> 02:54:26,955
Read all about it! Read all about it!

1138
02:54:28,916 --> 02:54:31,418
Read all about it!

1139
02:55:45,993 --> 02:55:47,953
Hey, Maxie.

1140
02:55:48,538 --> 02:55:50,914
-Max.
-Huh?

1141
02:55:51,082 --> 02:55:53,833
How much money we got put away?

1142
02:55:54,085 --> 02:55:55,502
Why?

1143
02:55:58,339 --> 02:56:00,757
Because we're unemployed.

1144
02:56:15,815 --> 02:56:18,316
About a million bucks.

1145
02:56:18,818 --> 02:56:23,530
-Oh, yeah? Where'd you put it?
-In my underwear.

1146
02:56:25,658 --> 02:56:29,369
-I'd have found it there.
-Hey.

1147
02:56:29,704 --> 02:56:31,288
Huh?

1148
02:56:56,564 --> 02:57:01,109
We gotta reorganize, Max.
And I got a couple of good ideas.

1149
02:57:02,486 --> 02:57:04,195
Me too.

1150
02:57:04,488 --> 02:57:07,532
If I had a million bucks,
I'd take it easy.

1151
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:10,076
We'll take it easy when we got 20.

1152
02:57:11,454 --> 02:57:14,789
-Fifty.
Where you gonna get that?

1153
02:57:18,127 --> 02:57:19,794
Right here.

1154
02:57:29,138 --> 02:57:30,889
What's that?

1155
02:57:34,310 --> 02:57:36,227
It's a dream.

1156
02:57:38,648 --> 02:57:41,399
A dream I've been dreaming
all my life.

1157
02:57:41,567 --> 02:57:45,695
I swear to God, Noodles, you and me
together, we can make it come true.

1158
02:57:49,617 --> 02:57:50,825
What is it?

1159
02:57:56,123 --> 02:57:57,957
The Federal Reserve Bank.

1160
02:58:01,671 --> 02:58:05,131
It's the biggest step
we can take, Noodles.

1161
02:58:28,197 --> 02:58:30,031
You're really crazy.

1162
02:58:31,242 --> 02:58:35,912
Don't you ever say that to me.
Don't you ever say that to me again!

1163
03:00:01,665 --> 03:00:06,544
What chance is there that
a crazy thing like this might succeed, hm?

1164
03:00:07,755 --> 03:00:09,672
Don't ask me, ask Max.

1165
03:00:10,090 --> 03:00:15,929
You know as well as I do that this is
suicide, pure and simple, for everyone.

1166
03:00:16,680 --> 03:00:22,101
Yeah, well, don't tell me, tell him.
You got your own methods.

1167
03:00:22,728 --> 03:00:24,896
Yeah, I tried.

1168
03:00:25,356 --> 03:00:28,441
He doesn't want to screw anymore.

1169
03:00:31,403 --> 03:00:34,739
All he thinks about is this job.

1170
03:00:37,243 --> 03:00:40,328
Tear gas, hostages,
now he's gonna do this.

1171
03:00:40,496 --> 03:00:43,915
He's gonna do it with or without you.

1172
03:00:49,171 --> 03:00:52,590
Noodles, we've never liked each other.

1173
03:00:56,887 --> 03:01:02,517
We put up with each other for Max's sake.
So why don't we just get together once...

1174
03:01:02,685 --> 03:01:05,436
...and do something for him?

1175
03:01:15,155 --> 03:01:17,115
And after that...

1176
03:01:18,158 --> 03:01:21,327
...we can go back to being enemies.

1177
03:01:29,837 --> 03:01:34,883
You know,
if you were all in jail first...

1178
03:01:35,050 --> 03:01:38,136
...there wouldn't be any bank job.

1179
03:01:49,690 --> 03:01:52,358
I got the idea from your friend Max.

1180
03:01:54,194 --> 03:01:55,403
What do you mean?

1181
03:01:58,490 --> 03:02:01,826
He laughs at you. He makes fun of you.

1182
03:02:03,662 --> 03:02:06,956
He says Eve has got you by the balls.

1183
03:02:07,124 --> 03:02:11,044
Every time you walk past this place,
you shit in your pants.

1184
03:02:11,211 --> 03:02:15,006
You'd do anything for the cops to pick
you up so you wouldn't have to do this job.

1185
03:02:15,174 --> 03:02:17,258
Is that true, huh?

1186
03:02:29,980 --> 03:02:31,564
Well, then do it.

1187
03:02:31,732 --> 03:02:35,026
Do it. Put him in jail.
Put him in jail. Not long.

1188
03:02:35,194 --> 03:02:39,072
Just long enough so he can
get the idea out of his mind.

1189
03:02:40,866 --> 03:02:45,995
If you can't stand being away
from him, put yourself there too.

1190
03:02:47,581 --> 03:02:50,500
Better off than being dead.

1191
03:02:54,922 --> 03:02:57,215
You know what to do.

1192
03:03:00,844 --> 03:03:03,680
And if you don't, I will.

1193
03:03:07,518 --> 03:03:09,727
Get out. Take a cab.

1194
03:03:09,895 --> 03:03:12,772
I'm busy. I got things to do. Get out.

1195
03:03:18,320 --> 03:03:19,445
Noodles?

1196
03:03:20,489 --> 03:03:23,408
Make up your mind fast, huh?

1197
03:04:48,118 --> 03:04:50,203
What's the matter?

1198
03:04:50,704 --> 03:04:53,206
Aren't you having a good time?

1199
03:05:00,005 --> 03:05:02,590
Why are you going out tonight?

1200
03:05:03,133 --> 03:05:06,385
Why bother now that prohibition
is almost over?

1201
03:05:08,430 --> 03:05:12,350
Everybody's selling. We got friends who
have a lot of booze they wanna get rid of...

1202
03:05:12,518 --> 03:05:16,979
...for practically nothing.
So we figure, why not?

1203
03:05:23,153 --> 03:05:25,947
I'm gonna be gone for a while.

1204
03:05:26,240 --> 03:05:29,158
I'll be waiting at the hotel.

1205
03:05:29,993 --> 03:05:34,122
I like it when you come home
late and wake me up.

1206
03:05:39,711 --> 03:05:41,921
I'm not gonna be home tonight.

1207
03:05:48,929 --> 03:05:51,514
I'm not gonna be home tomorrow either.

1208
03:05:51,932 --> 03:05:55,893
I thought these things
only take a couple of hours.

1209
03:06:02,276 --> 03:06:08,197
Ladies and gents, I drink to the demise
of Fat Moe's speakeasy.

1210
03:06:08,490 --> 03:06:10,950
Who the hell wants to drink
here legally anyway?

1211
03:06:13,287 --> 03:06:16,789
Okay. Come on, Moe, set them up.
Go on, get in there.

1212
03:06:30,179 --> 03:06:31,637
Here's another one.
Ha-ha-ha.

1213
03:06:31,805 --> 03:06:34,056
Here's mud in your eye.

1214
03:06:40,731 --> 03:06:42,231
Boys.

1215
03:06:45,611 --> 03:06:47,737
Let's drink to our last shipment.

1216
03:06:47,905 --> 03:06:50,740
Because there's more onboard
tonight than just booze.

1217
03:06:50,908 --> 03:06:56,329
It's 10 years of our lives. Ten years
that were really worth living.

1218
03:06:56,496 --> 03:06:57,872
Yeah.

1219
03:07:06,048 --> 03:07:07,423
Aah.

1220
03:07:16,350 --> 03:07:18,184
Noodles.

1221
03:07:19,561 --> 03:07:21,145
Noodles.

1222
03:07:22,856 --> 03:07:25,441
-L'chaim.
-L'chaim.

1223
03:07:28,445 --> 03:07:31,030
How long will I have to wait?

1224
03:07:34,701 --> 03:07:38,204
A year and a half, more or less.

1225
03:07:39,581 --> 03:07:41,749
Six months off for good behavior.

1226
03:07:42,209 --> 03:07:45,044
-What are you gonna do?
-Don't ask.

1227
03:09:19,806 --> 03:09:21,640
Operator.

1228
03:09:22,976 --> 03:09:24,143
Police, please.

1229
03:09:30,150 --> 03:09:32,401
Fifth Precinct. Sergeant Halloran.

1230
03:09:35,155 --> 03:09:36,697
Hello.

1231
03:09:37,657 --> 03:09:40,743
Who's speaking? Can I help you?

1232
03:09:40,911 --> 03:09:42,912
-Hello?
-Yeah.

1233
03:09:45,499 --> 03:09:47,249
I got a good tip for you.

1234
03:10:13,735 --> 03:10:17,530
Yeah, who is it?
Yeah, it's Max. Open the door.

1235
03:10:23,412 --> 03:10:27,456
-What's the matter with you? You sick?
-No, I'm fine.

1236
03:10:27,624 --> 03:10:29,291
You don't look it.

1237
03:10:31,420 --> 03:10:34,255
Maybe you'd better
stay home tonight, huh?

1238
03:10:34,756 --> 03:10:37,675
-Why?
-Heh.

1239
03:10:40,137 --> 03:10:43,055
You know, I've been
watching you all night.

1240
03:10:44,558 --> 03:10:47,393
And you've been drinking like a fish.

1241
03:10:48,270 --> 03:10:50,688
Trying to get your courage up?

1242
03:10:54,192 --> 03:10:57,486
We're only bringing in
a shipment of booze.

1243
03:10:59,030 --> 03:11:02,241
It's got so you're even
scared to do that.

1244
03:11:03,994 --> 03:11:06,745
Maybe you just better
stay home tonight.

1245
03:11:07,789 --> 03:11:09,331
With Eve. Heh-heh-heh.

1246
03:11:19,676 --> 03:11:24,096
Hey, Maxie, everywhere you go,
I go too. Remember that.

1247
03:11:33,940 --> 03:11:36,400
Maybe Sharkey was right.

1248
03:11:36,568 --> 03:11:39,361
Maybe I ought to just dump you.

1249
03:11:48,497 --> 03:11:50,080
You're really crazy.

1250
03:11:50,248 --> 03:11:52,166
Never say that!

1251
03:11:52,626 --> 03:11:55,794
Don't say it!

1252
03:12:02,594 --> 03:12:06,764
Max made fools of us, Noodles.
He wanted to die.

1253
03:12:06,932 --> 03:12:09,975
Did you know his old man
died in the nut house?

1254
03:12:10,143 --> 03:12:12,978
Max didn't want to
end up the same way.

1255
03:12:13,188 --> 03:12:17,316
So he put the idea
in our heads to tip off the cops.

1256
03:12:17,484 --> 03:12:22,363
And when they stopped the truck,
Max started shooting first...

1257
03:12:22,531 --> 03:12:25,824
...just to get himself killed.

1258
03:12:43,009 --> 03:12:45,344
Uh, what is this?

1259
03:12:48,390 --> 03:12:49,557
Opening night.

1260
03:12:51,226 --> 03:12:53,936
Fifteen years ago.

1261
03:12:54,104 --> 03:12:56,355
Uh, who's this?

1262
03:12:58,066 --> 03:13:01,068
Patron saint of the place.

1263
03:13:02,445 --> 03:13:04,697
And some actress.

1264
03:13:05,490 --> 03:13:06,865
Do you know her?

1265
03:13:08,868 --> 03:13:10,411
No.

1266
03:14:03,548 --> 03:14:05,841
Hello, Deborah.

1267
03:14:13,433 --> 03:14:16,101
Aren't you gonna say anything?

1268
03:14:22,859 --> 03:14:26,195
What is someone
supposed to say after...

1269
03:14:26,821 --> 03:14:29,865
...more than 30 years.

1270
03:14:34,996 --> 03:14:40,959
Well, how about, "How you doing?
You're looking good."

1271
03:14:42,962 --> 03:14:46,131
Or, "I was hoping I'd never
see you again."

1272
03:14:48,551 --> 03:14:51,553
I never thought I would.

1273
03:14:52,639 --> 03:14:54,973
There's a difference.

1274
03:14:55,141 --> 03:14:58,811
Yeah. At least you recognize me,
that's something.

1275
03:14:58,978 --> 03:15:01,980
Actresses have good memories.

1276
03:15:11,741 --> 03:15:14,076
You want a drink?

1277
03:15:18,289 --> 03:15:20,708
I'm having one.

1278
03:15:31,136 --> 03:15:32,177
Margo?

1279
03:15:33,930 --> 03:15:36,640
-Yes, miss?
That's all for now. You can go.

1280
03:15:36,808 --> 03:15:39,017
All right, miss.

1281
03:15:43,898 --> 03:15:46,775
She called you "miss."

1282
03:15:47,110 --> 03:15:49,528
You never got married?

1283
03:15:50,363 --> 03:15:51,989
No.

1284
03:15:55,577 --> 03:15:57,119
You live alone?

1285
03:16:05,253 --> 03:16:06,754
No.

1286
03:16:13,595 --> 03:16:15,929
Where were you?

1287
03:16:18,850 --> 03:16:21,268
I was out of town.

1288
03:16:24,105 --> 03:16:26,899
Have you been back long?

1289
03:16:27,859 --> 03:16:30,277
A couple of days.

1290
03:16:30,445 --> 03:16:32,696
Are you staying?

1291
03:16:44,334 --> 03:16:45,751
That depends.

1292
03:16:48,671 --> 03:16:50,756
Why do you want to see me?

1293
03:16:52,592 --> 03:16:54,927
Two reasons.

1294
03:16:55,094 --> 03:16:58,347
First, I wanted to see
if you did the right thing...

1295
03:16:58,515 --> 03:17:00,599
...turning me down
to become an actress.

1296
03:17:04,771 --> 03:17:06,355
Well?

1297
03:17:09,150 --> 03:17:11,401
You did. You're terrific.

1298
03:17:27,168 --> 03:17:30,254
"Age cannot wither her."

1299
03:17:30,463 --> 03:17:33,465
It's like the play
was written for you.

1300
03:17:36,928 --> 03:17:39,388
What was the other reason?

1301
03:17:39,597 --> 03:17:41,890
The other reason...

1302
03:17:45,103 --> 03:17:49,439
...is to decide whether I should go
to a party tomorrow night.

1303
03:17:56,155 --> 03:17:57,698
A party?

1304
03:18:00,994 --> 03:18:03,495
Yeah, on Long Island.

1305
03:18:04,998 --> 03:18:08,166
A Secretary Bailey.

1306
03:18:12,005 --> 03:18:14,172
Do you know Secretary Bailey?

1307
03:18:16,009 --> 03:18:17,217
No.

1308
03:18:19,512 --> 03:18:21,972
But I was invited anyway.

1309
03:18:30,315 --> 03:18:33,358
But if you don't know each other,
why were you invited?

1310
03:18:33,526 --> 03:18:35,068
I don't know.

1311
03:18:36,696 --> 03:18:38,739
I thought you might know why.

1312
03:18:39,657 --> 03:18:41,158
Me?

1313
03:18:41,367 --> 03:18:42,993
Why me?

1314
03:18:48,416 --> 03:18:50,334
Because you know him.

1315
03:18:51,794 --> 03:18:53,253
-Who is it?
David.

1316
03:18:53,421 --> 03:18:56,089
-No, David.
Can I come in?

1317
03:18:56,299 --> 03:18:59,134
No, no, no. Just wait outside,
David, I'll call you.

1318
03:18:59,344 --> 03:19:01,720
Okay, I'll be right here.

1319
03:19:04,515 --> 03:19:08,310
-What does Secretary Bailey want from me?
-You came here to ask me that?

1320
03:19:08,519 --> 03:19:11,480
-Why did he send me an invitation?
-I don't know. I don't know.

1321
03:19:11,689 --> 03:19:16,026
Why should--? Why should I know about
your invitations? I don't know anything. I--

1322
03:19:16,235 --> 03:19:20,238
What do you want from me? Why did
you come here? I know nothing, nothing.

1323
03:19:20,406 --> 03:19:23,075
Now you're a lousy actress.

1324
03:19:25,912 --> 03:19:28,747
Who is Secretary Bailey?

1325
03:19:37,507 --> 03:19:41,134
Secretary Bailey is a rich businessman.

1326
03:19:46,849 --> 03:19:51,436
He came to the United States as a starving
immigrant and made a lot of money...

1327
03:19:51,646 --> 03:19:55,607
...in San Francisco and Los Angeles,
where he's lived for 30 years.

1328
03:19:55,775 --> 03:19:59,778
I know all that. It's all in the papers.
What else is there?

1329
03:20:06,285 --> 03:20:09,287
He married a very wealthy woman.

1330
03:20:10,581 --> 03:20:12,916
They had a child.

1331
03:20:13,292 --> 03:20:16,336
She died when the child was born.

1332
03:20:16,921 --> 03:20:21,466
A few years ago, he went into politics.
Moved here.

1333
03:20:21,634 --> 03:20:26,263
That's all past history. I'm not talking
about that. I'm talking about now.

1334
03:20:26,848 --> 03:20:29,474
Right now he's in trouble.

1335
03:20:31,144 --> 03:20:34,521
Why can't you just tell me you've
been living with him all these years...

1336
03:20:34,689 --> 03:20:36,648
...and that you're his lover?

1337
03:20:45,491 --> 03:20:48,493
Age can wither me, Noodles.

1338
03:20:52,206 --> 03:20:54,833
We're both getting old.

1339
03:21:00,173 --> 03:21:03,467
All that we have left now
are our memories.

1340
03:21:06,387 --> 03:21:12,350
If you go to that party on Saturday
night, you won't have those anymore.

1341
03:21:13,644 --> 03:21:16,188
Tear up that invitation.

1342
03:21:18,483 --> 03:21:21,193
There's an exit back this way.

1343
03:21:22,111 --> 03:21:25,030
Noodles, go through it.

1344
03:21:27,700 --> 03:21:29,576
Keep walking.

1345
03:21:29,786 --> 03:21:32,037
Don't turn around.

1346
03:21:33,164 --> 03:21:35,415
Please, Noodles.

1347
03:21:35,583 --> 03:21:38,710
I'm begging you. Please.

1348
03:21:45,176 --> 03:21:48,720
Are you afraid that I'll turn
into a pillar of salt?

1349
03:21:52,183 --> 03:21:55,977
If you go out that door, yes.

1350
03:22:54,203 --> 03:22:57,164
This is Secretary Bailey's son.

1351
03:22:57,373 --> 03:23:00,876
His name's David, just like yours.

1352
03:25:52,423 --> 03:25:54,257
Please go in.

1353
03:26:08,647 --> 03:26:10,815
What are you waiting for?

1354
03:26:14,653 --> 03:26:17,113
I don't understand, Mr. Bailey.

1355
03:26:43,808 --> 03:26:45,892
Sit down, Noodles.

1356
03:26:50,147 --> 03:26:51,940
Make yourself comfortable.

1357
03:27:10,334 --> 03:27:13,044
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.

1358
03:27:13,212 --> 03:27:15,213
Well, I was curious.

1359
03:27:18,175 --> 03:27:21,302
So many important people in one place.

1360
03:27:21,512 --> 03:27:25,390
Yes. Well, the rats usually
desert a sinking ship.

1361
03:27:25,850 --> 03:27:29,769
But in my case, they appear to be
flocking onboard.

1362
03:27:41,407 --> 03:27:45,243
Yeah, well, I read about
your troubles in the newspapers.

1363
03:27:46,620 --> 03:27:51,291
But a man in your position, with all
your power and all your privileges...

1364
03:27:51,500 --> 03:27:55,753
...has to assume a certain amount
of responsibility...

1365
03:27:56,422 --> 03:27:58,882
...a certain amount of risk.

1366
03:28:06,348 --> 03:28:09,100
Why'd you ask me
to come here, Mr. Bailey?

1367
03:28:12,438 --> 03:28:16,941
That invitation doesn't mean
a goddamn thing, and you know it.

1368
03:28:17,318 --> 03:28:20,862
All that counts is what
was in that suitcase.

1369
03:28:22,531 --> 03:28:25,241
The money and the contract.

1370
03:28:28,078 --> 03:28:31,289
It didn't say who the contract
was on, though.

1371
03:28:32,625 --> 03:28:35,043
Haven't you figured that out yet?

1372
03:28:36,754 --> 03:28:38,296
You, Mr. Bailey?

1373
03:28:52,102 --> 03:28:55,813
I haven't had a gun in my hand
for many, many years.

1374
03:28:57,441 --> 03:29:02,987
My eyes aren't too good,
even with my glasses. My hands shake.

1375
03:29:05,866 --> 03:29:09,869
-And I wouldn't wanna miss, Mr. Bailey.
-Cut the bullshit, Noodles.

1376
03:29:11,413 --> 03:29:14,165
I'm already a dead man.

1377
03:29:15,084 --> 03:29:19,504
At least give me the chance
to settle the debt that I owe to you.

1378
03:29:20,172 --> 03:29:23,675
I'll never make it before
the investigating committee.

1379
03:29:23,842 --> 03:29:27,804
They're scared to death
I'll implicate the whole bunch of them.

1380
03:29:28,180 --> 03:29:30,390
They gotta get rid of me.

1381
03:29:33,060 --> 03:29:36,020
Today is as good a day as any.

1382
03:29:38,190 --> 03:29:40,567
You do it, Noodles.

1383
03:29:41,527 --> 03:29:44,904
You're the only person
I can accept it from.

1384
03:29:51,787 --> 03:29:54,372
You see, I found out where you were.

1385
03:29:54,540 --> 03:29:57,625
I brought you back here for this.

1386
03:29:58,961 --> 03:30:02,171
To even the score between you and me.

1387
03:30:04,550 --> 03:30:07,010
You can get out through there.

1388
03:30:14,268 --> 03:30:18,813
It leads right down to the street.
Nobody will see you.

1389
03:30:25,571 --> 03:30:29,949
I don't know what you're talking about,
Mr. Bailey. You don't owe me a thing.

1390
03:30:37,916 --> 03:30:44,047
Your eyes were too full of tears to see
it wasn't me burned up on that street.

1391
03:30:44,882 --> 03:30:46,758
It was somebody else.

1392
03:30:48,344 --> 03:30:53,264
You were too shocked to realize
that the cops were in on it too.

1393
03:30:53,891 --> 03:30:57,101
That was a syndicate
operation, Noodles.

1394
03:31:07,404 --> 03:31:09,405
You're crazy.

1395
03:31:11,867 --> 03:31:16,120
You said that to me once before,
a long time ago.

1396
03:31:16,413 --> 03:31:19,874
But my mind was never as clear
as it was at that moment.

1397
03:31:20,626 --> 03:31:24,128
I took away your whole life from you.

1398
03:31:24,338 --> 03:31:27,173
I've been living in your place.

1399
03:31:28,384 --> 03:31:31,010
I took everything.

1400
03:31:32,429 --> 03:31:34,597
I took your money.

1401
03:31:35,224 --> 03:31:37,433
I took your girl.

1402
03:31:38,143 --> 03:31:42,939
All I left for you was 35 years of grief
over having killed me.

1403
03:31:44,525 --> 03:31:45,566
Now, why don't you shoot?

1404
03:33:21,205 --> 03:33:24,123
It's true,
I have killed people, Mr. Bailey.

1405
03:33:24,333 --> 03:33:29,086
Sometimes to defend myself,
sometimes for money.

1406
03:33:29,379 --> 03:33:31,923
And many people used to come to us.

1407
03:33:32,132 --> 03:33:35,051
Business partners, rivals...

1408
03:33:35,427 --> 03:33:37,595
...lovers.

1409
03:33:37,971 --> 03:33:42,099
Some of the jobs we took
and some we didn't.

1410
03:33:55,489 --> 03:33:58,449
Yours is one we would never touch,
Mr. Bailey.

1411
03:33:59,326 --> 03:34:02,286
Is this your way of getting revenge?

1412
03:34:06,250 --> 03:34:07,834
No.

1413
03:34:11,171 --> 03:34:14,298
It's just the way I see things.

1414
03:35:16,987 --> 03:35:19,780
It's 10:25...

1415
03:35:21,074 --> 03:35:24,243
...and I've got nothing left to lose.

1416
03:35:26,371 --> 03:35:30,333
When you've been betrayed by a friend,
you hit back.

1417
03:35:35,380 --> 03:35:37,214
Do it.

1418
03:35:59,363 --> 03:36:01,989
You see, Mr. Secretary...

1419
03:36:03,992 --> 03:36:06,077
...I have a story also.

1420
03:36:07,037 --> 03:36:09,580
A little simpler than yours.

1421
03:36:10,707 --> 03:36:15,419
Many years ago I had a friend,
a dear friend.

1422
03:36:17,047 --> 03:36:20,299
I turned him in to save his life...

1423
03:36:20,509 --> 03:36:22,802
...but he was killed.

1424
03:36:24,096 --> 03:36:26,931
But he wanted it that way.

1425
03:36:27,975 --> 03:36:30,184
It was a great friendship.

1426
03:36:33,271 --> 03:36:37,316
It went bad for him
and it went bad for me too.

1427
03:36:42,280 --> 03:36:44,448
Good night, Mr. Bailey.

1428
03:36:53,625 --> 03:36:57,336
I hope the investigation
turns out to be nothing.

1429
03:36:59,256 --> 03:37:03,300
It'd be a shame to see
a lifetime of work go to waste.

1430
03:40:28,882 --> 03:40:33,552
God bless America

1431
03:40:33,720 --> 03:40:37,973
Land that I love

1432
03:40:38,141 --> 03:40:42,811
Stand beside her
And guide her

1433
03:40:43,104 --> 03:40:46,315
Through the night
With a light from above

1434
03:40:48,068 --> 03:40:52,821
From the mountains
To the prairies

1435
03:40:52,989 --> 03:40:57,368
To the oceans white with foam

1436
03:40:58,411 --> 03:41:02,581
God bless America

1437
03:41:02,749 --> 03:41:06,919
My home sweet home

1438
03:41:08,338 --> 03:41:13,092
God bless America

1439
03:41:13,260 --> 03:41:17,304
Land that I love

1440
03:41:17,472 --> 03:41:22,351
Stand beside her
And guide her
