1
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:52,472
All I ever wanted
was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.

2
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:56,442
It all began in the summer of 1957,
before the start of second grade.

3
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:58,310
- Here we are.
- Ha, ha.

4
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:00,575
- What do you guys think?
- I like this place.

5
00:01:00,752 --> 00:01:03,084
- It's cool.
- Uh, what color is my room?

6
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:04,916
Just you wait.

7
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,650
- Let's see what's inside.
- Hey, come on, buddy Bryce.

8
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:10,454
Why don't, uh, you and I
go help unload the van...

9
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:14,224
...and the womenfolk here
can get in the kitchen and start setting up.

10
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:15,866
Okay, Dad.

11
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,264
For me, it was the beginning
of what would be...

12
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:22,806
...more than half a decade of
strategic avoidance and social discomfort.

13
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,772
- Hi, I'm Juli Baker.
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?

14
00:01:26,945 --> 00:01:28,139
Don't you want some help?

15
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:30,440
No. There's some
valuable things in there.

16
00:01:30,616 --> 00:01:33,414
- How about this one?
- No, no, no.

17
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:36,382
Run home. Your mother's
probably wondering where you are.

18
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,251
Oh, no, my mom knows where I am.
She said it's fine.

19
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:42,154
It didn't take long to realize
this girl could not take a hint.

20
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:44,818
- It's crowded in here with three people.
- I don't mind.

21
00:01:44,997 --> 00:01:47,795
- Of any kind.
- You wanna push this one together?

22
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,131
Bryce, isn't it time for you
to go help your mother?

23
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:54,136
Huh?

24
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:56,572
Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:59,975
I mean, nothing would stop her.

26
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:03,979
I was about to tell her to get lost
when the weirdest thing happened.

27
00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:10,121
I couldn't believe it.

28
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,190
There I was holding hands
with this strange girl.

29
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:16,793
- How did I get into this mess?
- Well, hello.

30
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,530
- I see you've met my son.
- Uh-huh.

31
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:26,069
Finally, I did the only manly
thing available when you're 7 years old.

32
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:35,342
However, my troubles were far from over.

33
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:38,148
The minute I walked
into Miss Yelson's classroom...

34
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:40,807
Bryce? You're here.

35
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:42,681
...it was clear:

36
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:44,947
School would not be a sanctuary.

37
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:49,291
Hey, Bryce, where's your girlfriend?

38
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,452
I was branded for life.

39
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,894
Hey, Bryce,
why don't you ask her to marry you?

40
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:59,466
Bryce and Juli sitting in a tree

41
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,869
K-l-S-S-l-N-G

42
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,032
My first year in town was a disaster.

43
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,234
Look at them.

44
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:08,402
And the next three weren't much better.

45
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,674
But finally, in the sixth grade,
I took action.

46
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,818
I hatched the plan.

47
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:15,519
Sherry.

48
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:17,852
Sherry, wait up.

49
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:19,848
Hi, Bryce. Heh.

50
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:21,623
I asked out Sherry Stalls.

51
00:03:21,793 --> 00:03:23,658
I was wondering if you wanted to go...

52
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,263
To full appreciate
the brilliance of this plan...

53
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:29,366
...you have to understand
that Juli hated Sherry Stalls...

54
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,392
...though I never understood why.

55
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,835
Sherry was nice, friendly
and she had a lot of hair.

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,407
At first, my mother wouldn't let me
get my ears pierced, but I begged...

57
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:40,704
The idea was that Sherry
would eat with me...

58
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,838
...maybe we'd walk around together,
and hopefully Juli would lose interest.

59
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,075
But I still can't get the hoops till I'm 16.

60
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:48,412
Oh, that's a shame.

61
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:52,717
So Melanie wanted to get her ears pierced,
but of course her mother said no.

62
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:57,021
So she threw a fit and smashed
her Johnny Mathis Greatest Hits album...

63
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,559
...and she got grounded, so now she can't
come to my pajama sleepover party.

64
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:05,396
Things were unfolding quite nicely.

65
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,661
What are you doing
for your science project?

66
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:11,639
That is, until my supposed
best friend, Garrett Einbinder...

67
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,675
...took an interest in Sherry himself.

68
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:17,679
I was thinking of showing how split ends
react with different hair conditioners.

69
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:19,009
That's fascinating.

70
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:22,017
Loyalty gave way to desire
and Garrett, the turncoat...

71
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:23,711
...told Sherry what I was up to.

72
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,249
Jerk.

73
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:27,220
She didn't take it well.

74
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:32,188
Word got back to Juli, and pretty soon
she started up with the goo-goo eyes again.

75
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:34,161
Only this time it was worse.

76
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:36,960
She started sniffing me.

77
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:39,501
That's right, sniffing me.

78
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:41,229
What was that all about?

79
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,136
My only consolation
was that next year would be different.

80
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:46,402
Junior high, bigger school.

81
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:51,015
Maybe we'd be in different classes
and it would finally, finally be over.

82
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:56,011
The first day I met Bryce Loski, I flipped.

83
00:04:56,721 --> 00:05:00,487
It was those eyes,
something in those dazzling eyes.

84
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:02,422
You wanna push this one together?

85
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,459
His family had just moved
into the neighborhood...

86
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,257
...and I'd gone over to help them.

87
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,630
I'd been in the van all of two minutes
when his dad sent him off to help his mom.

88
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:13,737
I could see he didn't wanna go.

89
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:18,467
So I chased after him to see if we could
play a little before he got trapped inside.

90
00:05:20,245 --> 00:05:22,440
The next thing I know,
he's holding my hand...

91
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,946
...and looking right into my eyes.

92
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,982
My heart stopped.

93
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:28,642
Was this it?

94
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,380
Would this be my first kiss?

95
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:34,389
- But then his mother came out.
- Well, hello.

96
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:38,086
And he was so embarrassed,
his cheeks turned completely red.

97
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:42,731
I went to bed that night thinking
of the kiss that might have been.

98
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:47,736
I mean, it was clear he had feelings for me,
but he was just too shy to show them.

99
00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:50,170
My mother said boys were like that.

100
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:54,108
- So I decided to help him out.
- Bryce? You're here.

101
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:59,175
I would give him plenty
of opportunity to get over his shyness.

102
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:02,716
By the sixth grade,
I'd learned to control myself.

103
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:05,118
Then Sherry Stalls entered the picture.

104
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:09,991
Sherry Stalls was nothing but a whiny,
gossipy, backstabbing flirt.

105
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:12,092
All hair and no substance.

106
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:13,356
And there she was...

107
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:16,523
...holding hands with Bryce. My Bryce.

108
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,226
The one who was walking around
with my first kiss.

109
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:22,532
My solution was to ignore her.
I knew a boy of Bryce's caliber...

110
00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:26,199
...would eventually see through
a shallow conniver like Sherry Stalls.

111
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:29,472
It took all of a week.
They broke up at recess.

112
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:33,009
She didn't take it well.

113
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,682
Now that Bryce was out of Sherry's
evil clutches, he started being nicer to me.

114
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,484
- Hi, Juli.
- Hi, Bryce.

115
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:43,353
He was so shy and so cute...

116
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,053
...and his hair,
it smelled like watermelon.

117
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:48,028
I couldn't get enough of it.

118
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,895
I spent the whole year
secretly sniffing watermelon...

119
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:54,368
...and wondering
if I was ever going to get my kiss.

120
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,635
Seventh grade brought changes, all right.

121
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:01,904
But the biggest one
didn't happen at school.

122
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,843
It happened at home.

123
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,711
My grandfather came to live with us.

124
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,151
Mom said he stared like that
because he missed Grandma.

125
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:20,127
That was not something Grandpa
would ever talk about with me.

126
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:25,360
As a matter of fact, he never talked
about much of anything with me.

127
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:28,637
That is, until Juli appeared
in the local newspaper.

128
00:07:28,807 --> 00:07:31,742
- Oh, Bryce. May I speak with you?
- What?

129
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:33,301
Have a seat, son.

130
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,213
Tell me about your friend Juli Baker.

131
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,418
Juli. She's not exactly my friend.

132
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,613
Oh. Why's that?

133
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,055
Why do you wanna know?

134
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:52,629
Now, Juli Baker did not
wind up in The Mayfield Times...

135
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:54,662
...for being an eighth-grade Einstein.

136
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:59,770
No, she got front-page coverage because
she refused to climb out of a sycamore tree.

137
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,464
Juli Baker and that stupid sycamore tree.

138
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:07,077
She always thought it was God's gift
to our little corner of the universe.

139
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:10,146
Hey, Bryce. Wanna come climb the tree
with me and my brothers?

140
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:12,307
No, thanks.

141
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:15,282
Bryce. Come up here. It's fun.

142
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,081
I can't.

143
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:23,319
My dad needs me to help him fix...

144
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,986
...a thing.

145
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:27,623
That's all I needed.

146
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,063
Climb up a tree with Juli Baker.

147
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:32,669
I'd be dragged right back
into the second grade.

148
00:08:32,837 --> 00:08:35,067
Bryce and Juli sitting in a tree.

149
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,334
Why don't you just make me eat lima beans
for the rest of my life.

150
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:41,108
It's three blocks away.

151
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,007
Two blocks.

152
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,309
One block away.

153
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,479
- Like that's valuable information.
- I hate it when she does that.

154
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,649
I like to think there's at least a chance
the bus won't show.

155
00:08:57,729 --> 00:09:01,130
I think the tree looks particularly beautiful
in this light. Don't you?

156
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:04,735
If by "beautiful" you mean "unbelievably
ugly," then, yes, I would agree.

157
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,571
You're just visually challenged.
I feel sorry for you.

158
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:15,144
"Visually challenged"?

159
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,643
"Visually challenged"?

160
00:09:16,815 --> 00:09:21,047
This from the girl who lived in a house
that was the joke of the neighborhood?

161
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:25,488
They had bushes growing over windows
and weeds all over the place.

162
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:28,150
It bugged my dad bigtime.

163
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:29,486
Oh, there he is.

164
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:33,992
The bricklayer who thinks he's a painter.
That truck's not ugly enough in real life?

165
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:35,689
He's gotta make a painting of it?

166
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,927
No, he does landscapes.
Sells them at the county fair.

167
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:40,696
People say they're beautiful.

168
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,602
Landscapes? Let me tell you something.

169
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:45,709
The world would have
more beauty in it...

170
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:49,779
...if he'd do a little landscaping
on that piece of crap he calls a yard.

171
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:52,940
I feel bad for his wife.
She married a dreamer.

172
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:56,485
Because of that, one of the two of them
will always be unhappy.

173
00:09:56,654 --> 00:10:00,021
Yeah, fine.
But why do we have to be unhappy?

174
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:02,592
As annoying as the yard was
to my dad...

175
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,252
...it was nothing compared to how annoying
Juli Baker was in that tree.

176
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:08,160
Three blocks away.

177
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,494
Every morning
we had to listen to the sound...

178
00:10:10,668 --> 00:10:12,727
...of her blow-by-blow traffic report.

179
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,201
Two blocks.

180
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:15,634
There you go.

181
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,603
Why do they call it The Three Stooges?

182
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:19,834
- I mean, there's five of them.
- What?

183
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:23,447
Well, yeah, there's Moe, Larry, Curly,
Shemp and Curly Joe.

184
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,516
- Yeah, but they only have three at a time.
- Yeah.

185
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:29,847
You know, I hate Curly Joe.
I mean, he shouldn't even be a Stooge.

186
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:33,013
Listen, girl,
I'm this close to calling the police.

187
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:35,989
You are trespassing and obstructing
progress on a contracted job.

188
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:38,391
- What's going on?
- Either you come down...

189
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:41,726
...or we're gonna cut you down.
- You guys, come up here with me.

190
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,091
They won't cut it down
if we're all up here.

191
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,294
- Bus, bus, bus.
- Juli was frantic.

192
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:48,098
They wanted to cut down her tree.

193
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,333
I couldn't understand why
that mutant tangle of gnarly branches...

194
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:54,103
...meant so much to her.
- Bryce, please.

195
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:56,409
- I felt bad for her.
- Leave her.

196
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,446
But I wasn't about to cut school over it.

197
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,640
Come on, bro.

198
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:02,944
Why isn't she your friend, Bryce?

199
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:05,921
You'd have to know Juli.

200
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,455
Well, I'd like to.

201
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:08,950
Why?

202
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,822
That girl has an iron backbone.

203
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:13,827
Why don't you invite her over sometime?

204
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,627
An iron backbone?

205
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,825
She's just stubborn...

206
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:19,629
...and she's pushy beyond belief.

207
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:21,633
Is that so?

208
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,070
And she's been stalking me
since the second grade.

209
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:27,707
Well, a girl like that
doesn't live next door to everyone.

210
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:29,510
Lucky them.

211
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:32,606
Read this.

212
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,942
Without prejudice.

213
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:42,982
Like I needed to know
anything more about Juli Baker.

214
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,389
Juli wasn't at the bus stop
the next morning.

215
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,198
Or the morning after that.

216
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:52,770
She was at school,
but you'd never know it.

217
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:55,735
- Little Joe? He's got so much makeup on...
- He doesn't age.

218
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:58,068
I told myself I should be glad about it.

219
00:11:58,243 --> 00:12:00,404
I mean, isn't that what
I'd always wanted?

220
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:04,014
But still, I felt bad for her.

221
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:07,809
I was gonna tell her I was sorry,
but then I thought, hey, no...

222
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:09,878
...that's the last thing I needed:

223
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:12,545
Juli Baker thinking I missed her.

224
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,654
I see why you like to come out here.

225
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:21,561
Would you mind explaining it
to your mother?

226
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:23,934
I loved to watch my father paint.

227
00:12:24,102 --> 00:12:27,003
Or really, I loved to hear him talk
while he painted.

228
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:29,503
I learned a lot about my dad that way.

229
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:31,266
He told me all sorts of things...

230
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:35,640
...like how he got his first job delivering hay
and how he'd wished he'd finished college.

231
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:37,781
Then one day he surprised me.

232
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:42,283
What's going on with you
and, uh, Bryce Loski?

233
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,378
What do you mean? Nothing.

234
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:47,352
Oh, okay.

235
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:49,251
My mistake.

236
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,490
Why would you even think that?

237
00:12:51,663 --> 00:12:52,721
No reason.

238
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:55,123
Just that you...

239
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,592
...talk about him all the time.

240
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,101
I do?

241
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,603
Mm-hm.

242
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,533
I don't know.

243
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:10,606
I guess it's something about his eyes.

244
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:13,082
Or maybe his smile.

245
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:15,585
But what about him?

246
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,581
- What?
- You have to look at the whole landscape.

247
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,785
What does that mean?

248
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,858
A painting is more
than the sum of its parts.

249
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:30,262
A cow by itself is just a cow.

250
00:13:30,702 --> 00:13:35,730
A meadow by itself is just grass,
flowers.

251
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:41,005
And the sun peeking through the trees
is just a beam of light.

252
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,012
But you put them all together...

253
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:46,579
...and it can be magic.

254
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:51,180
I didn't really understand
what he was saying until one afternoon...

255
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:53,551
...when I was up in the sycamore tree.

256
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,192
I was rescuing a kite.

257
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:59,262
It was a long way up,
higher than I'd ever been.

258
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:03,997
And the higher I got,
the more amazed I was by the view.

259
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:07,099
I began to notice
how wonderful the breeze smelled.

260
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:09,501
Like sunshine and wild grass.

261
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,007
I couldn't stop breathing it in...

262
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:16,112
...filling my lungs
with the sweetest smell I'd ever known.

263
00:14:17,215 --> 00:14:18,614
Hey, you found my kite.

264
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:21,445
Bryce, you should come up here.

265
00:14:22,186 --> 00:14:23,653
It's so beautiful.

266
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,480
I can't. I sprained my, um...

267
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,122
I have a rash.

268
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:33,253
From that moment on,
that became my spot.

269
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,562
I could sit there for hours,
just looking out at the world.

270
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:41,034
Some days the sunsets
would be purple and pink.

271
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:45,005
And some days
they were a blazing orange...

272
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,974
...setting fire to the clouds
on the horizon.

273
00:14:48,146 --> 00:14:50,842
It was during one of those sunsets
that my father's idea...

274
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,745
...of the whole being greater
than the sum of its parts...

275
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:56,478
...moved from my head to my heart.

276
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,154
Some days I would get there extra early
to watch the sunrise.

277
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:03,190
One morning
I was making mental notes...

278
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:06,387
...of how the streaks of light
were cutting through the clouds...

279
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:08,122
...so I could tell my dad...

280
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:10,699
...when I heard a noise below.

281
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,093
Excuse me.

282
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,364
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but you can't
park there. That's a bus stop.

283
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,064
Hey, what are you doing up there?

284
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:20,176
You can't be up there,
we're gonna take this thing down.

285
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:23,245
- The tree?
- Yeah. Now come on down.

286
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:26,943
- But who told you, you could cut it down?
- The owner.

287
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:28,851
Why?

288
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,454
He's gonna build a house,
and this tree's in the way.

289
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:36,457
- So come on, girl, we got work to do.
- You can't cut it down. You just can't.

290
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:39,494
Listen, girl.
I'm this close to calling the police.

291
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:42,895
You are trespassing and obstructing
progress on a contracted job.

292
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,127
Now either you come down,
or we're gonna cut you down.

293
00:15:46,304 --> 00:15:48,465
Go ahead. Cut me down.

294
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,301
I'm not coming down.
I'm never coming down.

295
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,075
Bryce. You guys, come up here with me.

296
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,543
They won't cut it down
if we're all up here.

297
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:59,315
Bryce, please don't let them do this.

298
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,817
Come on, you guys.

299
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,481
Bryce, please. You don't have to
come up this high. Just a little ways.

300
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,451
Bryce, please. Please.

301
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:13,862
What happened after that was a blur.

302
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:19,333
It seemed like the whole town was there.

303
00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:21,631
But still I wouldn't move.

304
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:23,740
Then my father showed up.

305
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:27,071
He talked a fireman into letting him come up
to where I was.

306
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:32,347
Sweetie, it's time to come down.

307
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,346
Daddy, please don't let them do this.

308
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,750
- Sweetie...
- Daddy, look.

309
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:40,322
You can see everything.
You can see the whole world from here.

310
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:43,591
No view is worth my daughter's safety.
Now, come on.

311
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,995
I can't.

312
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:51,190
Julianna, it's time to come down now.

313
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:53,693
Please, Daddy.

314
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:56,401
It's time.

315
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,280
And that was it.

316
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,612
I must've cried for two weeks straight.

317
00:17:10,288 --> 00:17:13,018
Oh, sure, I went to school
and did the best I could...

318
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,817
...but nothing seemed to matter.

319
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,119
- Juli?
- Huh?

320
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,390
Do you know the answer?

321
00:17:20,765 --> 00:17:22,858
Uh, the Peloponnesian War?

322
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,636
I'm sure that's the answer
to something...

323
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:27,998
...but I was looking for the area
of a rhomboid.

324
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:34,477
Somehow, rhomboids
and isosceles right triangles...

325
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:36,909
...didn't seem so important.

326
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,177
I rode my bike so I wouldn't have to pass
by the stump...

327
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,878
...that used to be the earth's
most magnificent sycamore tree.

328
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:48,055
But no matter what I did,
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

329
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,225
Are you okay?

330
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:57,059
It was just a tree.

331
00:17:57,234 --> 00:18:00,260
No, it wasn't just a tree.

332
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:10,746
I never want you to forget how you felt
when you were up there.

333
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:14,441
Thanks, Dad.

334
00:18:19,256 --> 00:18:21,622
It was the first thing I saw every morning...

335
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:24,317
...and the last thing I saw
before I went to sleep.

336
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,129
And once I could look at it
without crying...

337
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:31,462
...I saw more than the tree
and what being up there meant to me.

338
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:35,761
I saw the day that my view of things
around me started changing.

339
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,070
And I wondered,
did I still feel the same things about Bryce?

340
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:48,182
I've never been a huge fan of eggs.

341
00:18:48,352 --> 00:18:50,912
I mean, I could always just take them
or leave them.

342
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,080
That is, until one day
in Skyler Brown's garage...

343
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,488
...when my feelings about eggs
were solidified.

344
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:02,058
Hey, hey, hey. Guys.
Edna's found her breakfast.

345
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,728
I mean, if a slimy reptile
found them appetizing...

346
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:08,633
...there was certainly no place for them
in my diet.

347
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:11,541
Oh, man, that's so cool.

348
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:15,110
She doesn't even have to chew.
I mean, think of all the time you'd save.

349
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,476
I could've gone my whole life
not knowing that snakes eat eggs raw...

350
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:20,173
...if it hadn't been for Lynetta.

351
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:22,444
She had a major-league thing
for Skyler Brown.

352
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,644
I think it's gross.

353
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:26,483
He and Juli's brothers,
Matt and Mark, had formed a band.

354
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:28,784
And Lynetta would watch them practice.

355
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,256
That is so neat.

356
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:32,089
How about that, huh, Bryce?

357
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:34,094
Yeah. Neat.

358
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:37,063
So, Brycie, how do you think
he's gonna digest that?

359
00:19:37,868 --> 00:19:40,393
- Stomach acid?
- You'd like to think that.

360
00:19:40,571 --> 00:19:42,835
Wait, everybody quiet. Here he goes.

361
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,407
Eggs over easy.

362
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:50,342
Gross. Gross, gross, gross.

363
00:19:50,514 --> 00:19:52,778
Wait, wait.
You haven't seen the best part.

364
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:55,613
Ugh!

365
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:57,276
Gross.

366
00:19:57,621 --> 00:20:00,715
I tried to be casual about it,
but it didn't take.

367
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:02,654
I started having bad dreams.

368
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,988
I'd be trapped inside a huge egg...

369
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,598
...and this monster would open his jaws
and start to devour me.

370
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:10,700
I'd wake up just in time.

371
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:15,264
Then the real nightmare began.

372
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:18,272
Hi, Bryce. I brought these over
for you and your family.

373
00:20:18,442 --> 00:20:20,239
- My chickens are laying eggs.
- What?

374
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:23,847
You remember Abby and Bonnie and Clyde
and Dexter and Eunice and Florence?

375
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:27,350
- The ones I hatched for the science fair.
- How could I forget?

376
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:30,580
It was classic Juli Baker.

377
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:33,549
She totally dominated the fair.

378
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:38,155
And get this, her project
was all about watching boring eggs hatch.

379
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:41,960
I mean, here I had a live-action
erupting volcano...

380
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:44,397
...and all anyone cared about
was Juli's boring chicks...

381
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:46,297
...breaking out of their boring shells.

382
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,062
Oh, I think the last one's hatching.

383
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:50,264
- It's hatching.
- Oh, it's hatching.

384
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:51,931
Kids, come over here.

385
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:54,907
But hey, she won. I lost.

386
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,706
I've never been one to dwell.

387
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:57,905
Here it comes.

388
00:20:58,082 --> 00:21:00,414
But that didn't mean
I had to eat her lousy eggs.

389
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:03,075
I think it was very sweet of Juli
to bring us those eggs.

390
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:05,688
I don't care.
I'm still having cereal tomorrow.

391
00:21:05,856 --> 00:21:08,791
Yeah, how do we know there's no chicks
in one of those eggs?

392
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:12,360
I used to eat farm-fresh eggs
when I was a kid. They were delicious.

393
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,361
Yeah, well, that's all well and good...

394
00:21:14,532 --> 00:21:17,592
...but what if we crack one open
and a dead chick falls out?

395
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:21,636
Do they have a rooster? If they don't
have a rooster the eggs can't be fertile.

396
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:25,367
And if they had a rooster, we'd know.
The whole neighborhood would know.

397
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:27,135
Maybe they got it de-yodeled.

398
00:21:27,444 --> 00:21:28,468
"De-yodeled"?

399
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:30,713
You know. De-cock-a-doodle-doo'd.

400
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:32,542
What the hell are you talking about?

401
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:34,612
Like they de-bark dogs.

402
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:38,321
Bryce, why don't you just ask Juli?

403
00:21:38,489 --> 00:21:40,116
What?

404
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,657
- You afraid to talk to her?
- I'm not afraid to talk to her.

405
00:21:44,862 --> 00:21:46,329
I know you are, but what am I?

406
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:49,398
- Okay. Just talk to her and find out.
- Bryce.

407
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,902
How do you tell if one's a rooster?

408
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:55,197
- Well, a rooster's bigger. Longer feathers.
- Mm-hm.

409
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:57,806
They've got that red stuff
growing out of their head.

410
00:21:57,975 --> 00:22:00,967
- And around their neck too.
- That shouldn't be too hard to spot.

411
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:05,604
Although, come to think of it,
chickens have the rubbery red stuff too.

412
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,114
Just not as much.

413
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,876
Garrett's expertise in roosters...

414
00:22:09,053 --> 00:22:12,545
...was the cornerstone of our plan
to avoid contact with Juli Baker.

415
00:22:12,723 --> 00:22:15,954
The balance of which involved
spying over her back fence.

416
00:22:16,861 --> 00:22:19,295
- Come on, come on.
- Shh. Shh.

417
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:24,166
Over here.

418
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:32,538
I can't see the stupid chickens.

419
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,701
We gotta get them out of the coop.

420
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,379
Is that a rooster?

421
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:43,986
No, it looks like a chicken.

422
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:45,979
How can you tell?

423
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,584
It just does.

424
00:22:47,758 --> 00:22:49,851
See what I mean? Expertise.

425
00:22:51,896 --> 00:22:52,920
- Shh, shh!
- What?

426
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:54,121
Juli.

427
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:55,890
Here, guys.

428
00:22:56,734 --> 00:22:58,634
Go on, there you go.

429
00:22:59,036 --> 00:23:01,561
- Here, guys. Go on.
- Yeah, they're all chickens.

430
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:04,535
- There's no rooster?
- What did I just say?

431
00:23:04,742 --> 00:23:05,868
How can you tell?

432
00:23:06,143 --> 00:23:08,407
- Well, none of them are strutting.
- Here, come on.

433
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:10,513
- Roosters strut?
- Come on, guys.

434
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:12,715
- What did I just say?
- Here.

435
00:23:13,484 --> 00:23:16,544
Plus, hardly any of them
have any rubbery red stuff.

436
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,655
- What are you doing?
- Yeah. They're definitely all chickens.

437
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:21,856
They're all chickens.

438
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:23,453
I'm proud of you, Bryce.

439
00:23:23,627 --> 00:23:25,857
- You overcame your fear.
- Huh?

440
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,931
- You talked to her.
- Oh, heh. Yeah.

441
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,524
It's no big deal.

442
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,101
That's what she told you?
They're all chickens?

443
00:23:33,904 --> 00:23:34,996
Yeah.

444
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,605
She's a genius. You're both genius...
Of course they're all chickens.

445
00:23:40,177 --> 00:23:42,372
A rooster's a chicken. The question is:

446
00:23:42,613 --> 00:23:46,049
Is one of them a rooster
or are they all hens?

447
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:49,950
Hens? Who said anything about hens?

448
00:23:50,287 --> 00:23:51,652
Then it hit me.

449
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:54,950
Garrett didn't know jack shit
about chickens.

450
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,855
- Do roosters strut?
- Yes, they do.

451
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,893
What does that have to do
with anything?

452
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,024
They're all hens.

453
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:07,060
Well, the main thing is the eggs are okay.

454
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,602
It's all settled.

455
00:24:08,772 --> 00:24:10,069
Not for me.

456
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,538
There was no way
I was ever gonna eat anything...

457
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,940
...that had anything to do
with Juli Baker.

458
00:24:15,112 --> 00:24:16,636
I'm not eating them.

459
00:24:17,047 --> 00:24:18,412
Well, why not?

460
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,709
Have you seen their yard? It's...

461
00:24:20,884 --> 00:24:25,150
There's not even any grass.
It's all mud and chicken turds.

462
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:28,758
Ew. Gross. Salmonella.

463
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,860
Do you suppose
they could have salmonella?

464
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:34,623
- It's not very likely.
- Why take the risk?

465
00:24:35,065 --> 00:24:36,498
What do we do with the eggs?

466
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,958
Give them back.

467
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:41,101
- Give them back? To Juli?
- Sure.

468
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:44,598
You talked to her before, right?
It didn't kill you.

469
00:24:44,975 --> 00:24:46,499
Well, what do I say?

470
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,767
Tell her we don't eat eggs.

471
00:24:50,214 --> 00:24:53,183
Uh, we're allergic to them or something.

472
00:24:53,517 --> 00:24:54,916
Come on, use your brains.

473
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,485
It didn't feel right to lie.

474
00:24:58,655 --> 00:25:02,955
Besides, even a seventh grader would know
that entire families aren't allergic to eggs.

475
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:05,318
But I didn't wanna
hurt her feelings either.

476
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:08,160
So that left me with only one option.

477
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:10,232
And thus another near-death
experience...

478
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:13,700
...in my ongoing saga with Juli Baker
had been successfully avoided.

479
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:15,398
Until one week later.

480
00:25:15,572 --> 00:25:17,767
Hi, Bryce. Brought you some more eggs.

481
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:19,340
Wow.

482
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,445
- Thanks.
- Did your family like the first batch?

483
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,308
Do you even have to ask?

484
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,447
Great. See you at school.

485
00:25:28,385 --> 00:25:30,717
What I hoped would be
a one-time event...

486
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:35,120
...was just the beginning of a life consumed
with lies, intrigue and deception.

487
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,687
Every morning
I'd be on the lookout for Juli...

488
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:41,729
...so if she happened to come, I could whip
the door open before she knocked.

489
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:43,264
Thanks.

490
00:25:45,235 --> 00:25:47,430
Then I'd dump the eggs
before anyone noticed.

491
00:25:47,604 --> 00:25:50,732
And why? Why couldn't I just face her?

492
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:52,301
Why couldn't I just say:

493
00:25:52,476 --> 00:25:56,037
"No, thanks. Don't want them.
Don't need them. Give them to the snake"?

494
00:25:56,647 --> 00:25:59,582
Was I really afraid
of hurting her feelings...

495
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,243
...or was I just afraid of her?

496
00:26:05,923 --> 00:26:07,754
Now, you wanna make sure you get it...

497
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:11,361
When Mrs. Brubeck first suggested
hatching eggs as my science project...

498
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,655
...I was less than excited.

499
00:26:14,131 --> 00:26:16,861
That is, until I saw my first sign of life.

500
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,426
Is that it?

501
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:22,504
Wow.

502
00:26:23,273 --> 00:26:26,174
- It looks like a bean.
- It does.

503
00:26:26,343 --> 00:26:27,776
Let's try the other ones.

504
00:26:27,945 --> 00:26:29,537
Suddenly it felt real.

505
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,305
All the eggs were alive.

506
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:34,417
There were, like, little bean babies
inside every one.

507
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:37,879
On the day of the fair,
all six chicks hatched.

508
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,920
What are the odds?

509
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,786
This year's top prize goes to Juli Baker...

510
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,928
...for her wonderful project:

511
00:26:45,095 --> 00:26:47,620
"A Chicken is Born."

512
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:51,164
I won first place.

513
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:55,101
And that was cool,
but all I really cared about were my chicks.

514
00:26:56,006 --> 00:26:57,769
There you go. There you go, guys.

515
00:26:57,941 --> 00:27:00,409
My mom wasn't crazy
about us raising chickens.

516
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,044
But I begged and pleaded.

517
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:05,340
I told her I would take care of everything.
And I did.

518
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:07,276
Where's Clyde?

519
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,977
Clyde?

520
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:14,714
Hey, Clyde. What's the matter?

521
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:17,085
Are you okay? Aren't you hungry?

522
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:20,162
Come on. Come here.
What's wrong, baby?

523
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,490
Come here.

524
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:27,059
Hey, you're not Clyde. You're Clydette.

525
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:29,097
Mom!

526
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:34,136
As it turned out, my hens
laid more eggs than we could eat.

527
00:27:35,045 --> 00:27:36,512
At first we tried to keep up...

528
00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:39,874
...but after a month of boiling,
frying and deviling...

529
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:44,009
...like that movie The Blob,
we were being overtaken by eggs.

530
00:27:44,188 --> 00:27:47,817
Then opportunity in the form
of our neighbor, Mrs. Steuby, knocked.

531
00:27:47,991 --> 00:27:49,891
Hello, dear.

532
00:27:51,695 --> 00:27:55,529
If you ever have any extra,
I'd be happy to buy them from you.

533
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:58,027
- Really?
- Certainly.

534
00:27:58,702 --> 00:28:02,138
And I happen to know that Mrs. Helms
would be interested as well.

535
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,132
- Great.
- Nothing like fresh eggs.

536
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,711
- Thanks, Mrs. Steuby.
- You bet, dear. Bye.

537
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:14,575
Between Mrs. Steuby and Mrs. Helms,
my egg overflow problem was solved.

538
00:28:14,751 --> 00:28:17,481
Then I realized that Mrs. Loski
deserved eggs too.

539
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,986
But I didn't think it would be right
to charge her.

540
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:23,524
She had been such a good neighbor,
lending us supplies when we ran out...

541
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:26,322
...giving my mother a ride
when our car wouldn't start...

542
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,963
...it was the least I could do.

543
00:28:28,865 --> 00:28:32,733
Besides, if I happened to run into Bryce,
that wouldn't be the end of the world.

544
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:34,161
Hi, Bryce.

545
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,829
By the third time I brought eggs over
to the Loskis...

546
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,565
...I realized Bryce was waiting for me.

547
00:28:38,742 --> 00:28:42,678
Waiting to pull open the door and say,
"Thanks, Juli. See you at school."

548
00:28:42,913 --> 00:28:45,143
And in return,
I got a few moments alone...

549
00:28:45,315 --> 00:28:47,146
...with the world's most dazzling eyes.

550
00:28:47,317 --> 00:28:50,343
Thanks, Juli. See you at school.

551
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,351
It was a bargain.

552
00:28:52,589 --> 00:28:54,420
Until the day it wasn't.

553
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:57,253
It was two weeks after the sycamore tree
was cut down...

554
00:28:57,427 --> 00:28:59,952
...and I was just starting
to feel normal again.

555
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:06,100
Hey, Juli. Right on schedule.

556
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,397
Yeah, well, neither rain nor sleet.

557
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:11,063
- Huh?
- You know, the mailman thing?

558
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:13,939
Oh. Right.

559
00:29:17,814 --> 00:29:20,374
So, um, will you start
riding the bus again?

560
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:24,280
I don't know.
I haven't been up there since...

561
00:29:24,454 --> 00:29:27,446
It doesn't look so bad anymore.
It's all cleared away.

562
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:35,798
Well, um, I better get ready for school.

563
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:37,797
Guess I'll see you there.

564
00:29:37,968 --> 00:29:39,367
See you.

565
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,862
Maybe Bryce was right.

566
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,735
Maybe it was time
I started riding the bus again.

567
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,275
After all, didn't he just tell me
he wanted me to?

568
00:29:48,445 --> 00:29:52,108
Could it be that Bryce Loski
actually misses me?

569
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,112
Juli? What are you still doing here?

570
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,757
I was just thinking.

571
00:30:03,026 --> 00:30:05,460
It's pickup day. The cans are in front.

572
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:07,153
I know. You need some help?

573
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,623
No. Maybe I'll do it later.

574
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,298
Are those my eggs?

575
00:30:14,071 --> 00:30:16,335
Yeah. Yeah, I dropped them.

576
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,832
They're not broken.

577
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:20,840
Why are you throwing them away?

578
00:30:24,848 --> 00:30:25,906
Don't you want them?

579
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:29,746
It wasn't me.
My dad didn't think it was worth the risk.

580
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,619
Risk? What risk?

581
00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:33,347
Salmonella.

582
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,120
What? He's afraid of being poisoned?

583
00:30:36,493 --> 00:30:40,088
Well, Juli, I mean, look at your back yard.
It's a complete mess.

584
00:30:40,263 --> 00:30:41,787
It's, like, covered in turds.

585
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:44,693
That's not true.
I clean up after my girls every day.

586
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,462
We just didn't wanna hurt your feelings.

587
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:54,374
Have you always thrown them away?

588
00:30:58,915 --> 00:31:01,884
You know, Mrs. Steuby and Mrs. Helms
pay me for my eggs.

589
00:31:02,052 --> 00:31:04,680
- They do?
- They pay me 60 cents a dozen.

590
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,213
I didn't know.

591
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,223
How could you?

592
00:31:10,627 --> 00:31:12,060
I'm sorry.

593
00:31:13,897 --> 00:31:15,626
No, you're not.

594
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:32,909
It didn't take me long to realize...

595
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:35,278
...that I'd traded in my old problems
with Juli Baker...

596
00:31:35,452 --> 00:31:37,352
...for a whole set of new ones.

597
00:31:38,488 --> 00:31:42,891
It was actually worse having her mad at me
than having her annoy me.

598
00:31:43,226 --> 00:31:45,490
The way she ignored me
was a constant reminder...

599
00:31:45,662 --> 00:31:47,254
...that I'd been a jerk.

600
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:54,695
Then one day I was coming home
from playing basketball with Garrett...

601
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,065
...and things got weird.

602
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:58,833
Don't be so timid.
Come on, you won't hurt them.

603
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:01,534
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's it.

604
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,269
My grandfather.

605
00:32:03,647 --> 00:32:08,243
All I ever saw him wear was slippers.
Now, where did he get those work boots?

606
00:32:09,286 --> 00:32:11,254
I couldn't stop looking over there.

607
00:32:11,421 --> 00:32:14,822
And the more I looked, the madder I got.

608
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:17,821
My grandfather had already said
more to Juli in one hour...

609
00:32:17,994 --> 00:32:21,054
...than he'd said to me in the whole time
he'd been living with us.

610
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,563
I was pretty sure
I'd never seen him laugh.

611
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:27,435
And what was his deal with Juli Baker?

612
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:34,704
Hi, Grandpa.

613
00:32:37,113 --> 00:32:38,808
Juli told me about the eggs.

614
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,244
You know, Bryce...

615
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,980
...one's character is set at an early age.

616
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:49,392
I'd hate to see you swim out so far
you can't swim back.

617
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,583
Sir?

618
00:32:51,528 --> 00:32:53,519
It's about honesty, son.

619
00:32:54,197 --> 00:32:56,825
Sometimes a little discomfort
in the beginning...

620
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,798
...can save a whole lot of pain
down the road.

621
00:33:13,383 --> 00:33:18,150
When it came to holding a grudge,
Juli Baker was truly impressive.

622
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,651
All week I tried to approach her
at school.

623
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:24,123
She'd always find some way to duck me.

624
00:33:24,694 --> 00:33:29,290
And whenever she was in her yard,
Grandpa was always there with her.

625
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,459
Finally, one Saturday I saw my opening.

626
00:33:35,071 --> 00:33:38,234
My grandfather had gone into town
to buy some Bengay.

627
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,509
I guess the yard work
was starting to get to him.

628
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,180
It's looking real good.

629
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:51,014
Thanks. Chet did most of it.

630
00:33:53,256 --> 00:33:55,451
I'm sorry for what I did.

631
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:02,059
I just don't get it, Bryce.
Why didn't you just tell me?

632
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:04,927
I don't know. It was dumb.

633
00:34:05,101 --> 00:34:07,797
And I shouldn't have said anything
about your yard, either.

634
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:09,598
It wasn't right.

635
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:13,099
Maybe it's all for the best.

636
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:18,012
I mean, look, I learned so much from Chet,
it's amazing.

637
00:34:19,082 --> 00:34:20,572
You're lucky.

638
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:23,378
I don't even have grandparents anymore.

639
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:26,521
Oh.

640
00:34:28,658 --> 00:34:30,421
I feel sorry for him.

641
00:34:31,061 --> 00:34:32,528
He misses your grandma.

642
00:34:34,631 --> 00:34:37,498
Can you believe it?
He says I remind him of her.

643
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:40,099
- What?
- I know. That's what I said.

644
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:44,366
But he meant it in a nice way.
Something about her spirit.

645
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,573
Yeah.

646
00:34:47,243 --> 00:34:48,540
Well...

647
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,972
Good luck with the grass.
I'm sure it'll come up great.

648
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,383
Thanks.

649
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,980
I guess I'll see you around.

650
00:35:00,156 --> 00:35:01,851
I guess so.

651
00:35:17,107 --> 00:35:20,474
While Juli's acceptance of
my apology was not all that I'd hoped for...

652
00:35:20,644 --> 00:35:23,078
...at least the eggs thing
was finally behind me.

653
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:27,071
The first time in months
I could truly enjoy Bonanza.

654
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,113
Where you going
and why you dressed like that?

655
00:35:33,189 --> 00:35:34,247
Skyler's.

656
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:38,019
Matt and Mark are bringing over recording
stuff and they're gonna make a demo.

657
00:35:38,194 --> 00:35:41,095
Demo? Like they know how
to make a demo.

658
00:35:41,665 --> 00:35:45,123
- You don't even know them.
- I don't have to. I know the type.

659
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,403
- You don't know anything.
- Don't talk to me like that.

660
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:50,664
- I'm late.
- Be back by 11.

661
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:53,966
Yep. Everything was back to normal.

662
00:36:01,217 --> 00:36:02,980
Is that girl working you too hard?

663
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:09,118
That girl's name is Juli.
And, no, she isn't working me too hard.

664
00:36:10,026 --> 00:36:12,358
You've developed
quite a soft spot for her, huh?

665
00:36:12,529 --> 00:36:13,553
Steven.

666
00:36:14,197 --> 00:36:18,156
No, Patsy. Just wanna find out
why your father has the energy...

667
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:20,359
...to befriend a complete stranger...

668
00:36:20,537 --> 00:36:23,506
...when he won't throw a baseball around
with his own grandson.

669
00:36:23,673 --> 00:36:26,665
- It's okay, Dad.
- No, it's not okay.

670
00:36:27,177 --> 00:36:28,701
Juli reminds him of Grandma.

671
00:36:28,878 --> 00:36:30,607
Of Renee? Heh.

672
00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:32,476
That's ridiculous.

673
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,315
You know why the Bakers
haven't fixed their yard?

674
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:40,479
Yeah, because he's too busy
with his paint-by-numbers kit.

675
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,225
If you had a brother with a severe handicap,
what would you do?

676
00:36:44,894 --> 00:36:47,328
What the hell
does that have to do with anything?

677
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,897
Juli's father has a retarded brother.

678
00:36:50,266 --> 00:36:52,962
So what? He's not the gardener,
is he? Heh.

679
00:36:53,136 --> 00:36:54,831
Ha-ha-ha.

680
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,029
It was a joke.

681
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:00,171
You know,
other people have family troubles...

682
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,574
...and they manage
to mow their own lawns.

683
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:06,074
I don't know where their pride
in ownership is.

684
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:07,546
They don't own that house.

685
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,679
The landlord's supposed to maintain it.

686
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:15,018
Mr. Baker puts every extra penny he has
into caring for his brother.

687
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,888
Don't they have government facilities
for that sort of thing?

688
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:21,758
Maybe they thought that a private facility
would be better for him.

689
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:26,197
Either way, it's not our fault that their
family has some chromosomal abnormality.

690
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,837
It has nothing to do with chromosomes.

691
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:33,067
When Juli's uncle was born, he had
the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck.

692
00:37:33,243 --> 00:37:38,078
If he'd had enough oxygen, he would've
been a perfect little baby, just like your son.

693
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,348
Goddamn it, Chet.

694
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,816
- Patsy? Patsy?
- Leave me alone!

695
00:37:48,925 --> 00:37:50,722
Sorry about that.

696
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:53,152
Why is Mom so upset?

697
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:58,066
Because...

698
00:37:58,968 --> 00:38:01,129
...but for the grace of God...

699
00:38:01,704 --> 00:38:04,366
...your mother could be standing
in Mr. Baker's shoes.

700
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:07,442
Did her brother have the cord
wrapped around his neck too?

701
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:10,770
You did.

702
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:16,477
Luckily, the doctor who delivered you
was on the ball and got it untangled...

703
00:38:16,653 --> 00:38:20,885
...but it easily could've gone
the other way.

704
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:29,664
- Wanna go for a walk?
- Huh?

705
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:33,067
I find it helps clear the mind.

706
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,172
What would they have done with me?

707
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:42,105
You can't dwell on something
that might've been, Bryce.

708
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:46,775
The way my dad was talking, sounds like
he would've thrown me in a nuthouse.

709
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,941
No, no. Now, that's not fair.

710
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,315
You can't condemn him
for something he hasn't done.

711
00:38:57,093 --> 00:38:58,958
This is where that tree was, wasn't it?

712
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,561
Yeah.

713
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:05,729
Must've been a spectacular view.

714
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,608
She's quite a girl.

715
00:39:17,046 --> 00:39:19,344
Some of us get dipped in flat...

716
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,249
...some in satin...

717
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,884
...some in gloss.

718
00:39:23,453 --> 00:39:25,353
But every once in a while...

719
00:39:25,521 --> 00:39:28,684
...you find someone who's iridescent.

720
00:39:30,426 --> 00:39:32,451
And when you do...

721
00:39:32,962 --> 00:39:34,987
...nothing will ever compare.

722
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,034
Flat, glossy, iridescent?

723
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,100
What the hell did that mean?

724
00:39:47,277 --> 00:39:50,542
Juli Baker had always
just seemed plain to me.

725
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:54,510
Until now.

726
00:40:03,326 --> 00:40:06,591
And the way she talked about
what it felt like to be up in that tree...

727
00:40:06,763 --> 00:40:09,823
...to be held above the earth,
brushed by the wind.

728
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:12,467
Who in junior high talks like that?

729
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:16,001
This weird feeling started taking over
in the pit of my stomach...

730
00:40:16,172 --> 00:40:17,901
...and I didn't like it.

731
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,304
I was slipping, man.

732
00:40:20,476 --> 00:40:22,341
And it was time to get a grip.

733
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,374
I'd never been embarrassed
by where we lived before.

734
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,779
I also never really thought about money.

735
00:40:28,952 --> 00:40:32,649
I knew we weren't rich, but I didn't feel
like we were missing anything.

736
00:40:32,822 --> 00:40:35,586
That is, until Bryce Loski
called our home a complete mess.

737
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:38,784
- What's your name?
- What's your name?

738
00:40:38,962 --> 00:40:41,897
Is it Mary or Sue?

739
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,329
What's your name?

740
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,367
Do I stand a chance with you?

741
00:40:47,537 --> 00:40:51,803
It's so hard to find a personality

742
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:54,409
With charms like yours for me

743
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:58,707
Ooh-ee, ooh-ee, ooh-ee

744
00:40:59,482 --> 00:41:01,848
I had to do something
and I knew what it was.

745
00:41:02,018 --> 00:41:04,987
What's your name?

746
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,987
- Oh, you're sounding really good.
- Yeah.

747
00:41:14,163 --> 00:41:16,097
We'll record it in Skyler's garage.

748
00:41:16,366 --> 00:41:18,061
That's a wonderful project.

749
00:41:18,534 --> 00:41:21,901
Speaking of projects, I was thinking
it might be cool to fix up the yard.

750
00:41:22,071 --> 00:41:24,301
- What?
- I mean, how much can grass seed cost?

751
00:41:24,474 --> 00:41:27,466
I could plant a lawn,
maybe some flowers.

752
00:41:27,643 --> 00:41:29,133
I could even put up a fence.

753
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,776
Honey, that's a major undertaking.

754
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,016
- I could pay for it with my egg money.
- No. That's your money.

755
00:41:38,187 --> 00:41:41,179
The landlord should be the one
taking care of all this.

756
00:41:41,824 --> 00:41:44,952
But he doesn't. And we live here.

757
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,926
And it looks so bad.

758
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,932
Jules.

759
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:52,962
What's going on?

760
00:41:53,936 --> 00:41:55,494
Nothing, Dad.

761
00:41:57,507 --> 00:41:59,236
It's okay, sweetheart.

762
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,637
You can tell us.

763
00:42:04,547 --> 00:42:08,313
The Loskis have been throwing away my
eggs because they're afraid of salmonella.

764
00:42:08,785 --> 00:42:10,912
Because our yard is such a mess.

765
00:42:12,255 --> 00:42:13,552
Did Patsy say that?

766
00:42:14,223 --> 00:42:17,056
No. Bryce did.

767
00:42:19,695 --> 00:42:22,289
But it must have been
a family discussion.

768
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:25,233
A boy doesn't come up with that
on his own.

769
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:27,729
- Who cares what they think?
- Yeah, who cares?

770
00:42:27,904 --> 00:42:30,134
Trina.

771
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,833
Let's not get into this.

772
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,408
No, I'm tired of living like this, Richard.

773
00:42:35,211 --> 00:42:38,374
I'm tired of having to take temp jobs
just to make ends meet.

774
00:42:38,548 --> 00:42:41,745
I'm tired of having to push a chair up
against the washing machine...

775
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:43,351
...just to keep the door shut.

776
00:42:43,953 --> 00:42:46,751
I'm tired of having to borrow
Mrs. Steuby's vacuum cleaner...

777
00:42:46,923 --> 00:42:48,823
...every time ours breaks down.

778
00:42:48,991 --> 00:42:51,357
Do you think this is the life
I pictured for us?

779
00:42:52,628 --> 00:42:55,426
Sometimes you have to sacrifice
to do the right thing.

780
00:42:55,598 --> 00:43:00,228
We always end up agreeing that Devonhurst
is the right thing for Daniel.

781
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:04,063
Well, maybe we should start thinking
about what's right for us.

782
00:43:04,407 --> 00:43:07,774
Our daughter is suffering
because we won't fix up our own yard.

783
00:43:08,111 --> 00:43:10,341
It's not our yard.

784
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,879
How can you say that, Richard? How?

785
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,208
We've lived here for 12 years...

786
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:20,344
...and for 12 years we've been saying
it's temporary, but it's not.

787
00:43:20,656 --> 00:43:22,351
This is our home.

788
00:43:22,692 --> 00:43:25,923
Is it wrong to wanna live somewhere
you can be proud of?

789
00:43:26,095 --> 00:43:29,258
To have enough to send your kids
to college?

790
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,859
Maybe it's time
we considered government care.

791
00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:35,231
We are not moving my brother.

792
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,002
He's more important
than your own children?

793
00:43:38,174 --> 00:43:39,402
- Dad!
- How dare you!

794
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:43,204
Stop it, Dad! Please, just stop.

795
00:43:45,348 --> 00:43:49,045
I'm sorry. Julianna, this is not your fault.

796
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:52,617
We'll work this out, I promise.

797
00:43:54,223 --> 00:43:58,057
That was the first time I ever heard
my parents really yell at each other.

798
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:00,354
I'm sorry about tonight.

799
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:02,896
That night they each came into my room.

800
00:44:03,065 --> 00:44:05,966
My father talked about his brother
and how much he loved him...

801
00:44:06,135 --> 00:44:09,070
...and how he promised his parents
he'd always take care of him.

802
00:44:10,173 --> 00:44:12,641
My mother talked about how much
she loved my father...

803
00:44:12,808 --> 00:44:14,867
...for his strength and kind heart.

804
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,510
When she kissed me good night...

805
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:20,615
...she whispered that of all her
many blessings, I was her best.

806
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,049
I felt sorry for my father.

807
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:26,950
I felt sorry for my mother.

808
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:31,219
But most of all,
I felt lucky for me that they were mine.

809
00:44:32,995 --> 00:44:35,759
I wanted to think the reason
I started working on my yard...

810
00:44:35,932 --> 00:44:39,163
...had nothing to do with Bryce.
It was about making our house better.

811
00:44:39,335 --> 00:44:43,135
After what he did with the eggs,
why should I care what he thought?

812
00:44:43,406 --> 00:44:44,430
But I did.

813
00:44:44,607 --> 00:44:47,167
Are you pruning that
or trying to hack it to death?

814
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:53,007
Hi. I'm Chet Duncan,
Bryce's grandfather.

815
00:44:53,182 --> 00:44:56,049
Sorry it's taken me so long
to come over and introduce myself.

816
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:57,846
Nice to meet you.

817
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:01,119
So are you trimming all these
to the same height?

818
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,884
Well, yeah, that's what I was thinking,
but I don't know.

819
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,051
Do you think it would look better
to take them out?

820
00:45:06,229 --> 00:45:10,723
Oh, these are Hicksii shrubs.
These will prune up nicely.

821
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,298
Listen, Mr. Duncan.

822
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:17,166
Call me Chet.

823
00:45:17,573 --> 00:45:18,870
Chet.

824
00:45:19,308 --> 00:45:21,742
If you're here
because of what Bryce said...

825
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:23,475
...I don't need your help.

826
00:45:25,548 --> 00:45:27,709
Read about you in the paper.

827
00:45:28,784 --> 00:45:31,150
Renee would've sat up in that tree
with you.

828
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,789
She would've sat up there all night.

829
00:45:35,591 --> 00:45:36,683
Renee?

830
00:45:37,326 --> 00:45:38,884
My wife.

831
00:45:39,729 --> 00:45:41,253
You remind me a lot of her.

832
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,363
We worked on the yard for weeks.

833
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,335
And the whole time we worked,
we talked.

834
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,573
- Right there?
- Perfect, yeah.

835
00:45:53,743 --> 00:45:56,576
He wanted to know more
about the sycamore tree.

836
00:45:56,846 --> 00:45:58,313
He knew exactly what it meant...

837
00:45:58,481 --> 00:46:01,177
...about the whole being greater
than the sum of its parts.

838
00:46:01,484 --> 00:46:03,349
He said it was the same with people...

839
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,386
...but sometimes with people,
the whole could be less.

840
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,914
I thought that was pretty interesting.

841
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:12,026
I started looking at people
I'd known since elementary school...

842
00:46:12,194 --> 00:46:15,721
...trying to figure out if they were more
or less than the sum of their parts.

843
00:46:18,634 --> 00:46:21,933
Chet was right. A lot of them were less.

844
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,576
Of all my classmates, the one person
I couldn't seem to place was Bryce.

845
00:46:33,482 --> 00:46:36,144
Until recently, I would've said
with absolute certainty...

846
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,119
...that he was greater, far greater,
than the sum of his parts.

847
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:41,813
But now I wasn't so sure.

848
00:46:41,991 --> 00:46:44,824
It's looking good, Juli. Nice job.

849
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,620
Thanks. Chet did most of it.

850
00:46:51,467 --> 00:46:53,662
I'm sorry for what I did.

851
00:46:57,039 --> 00:46:58,939
I just don't get it, Bryce.

852
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,042
Why didn't you just tell me?

853
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,734
Was he really sorry?

854
00:47:02,912 --> 00:47:05,881
Or was he just saying these things
to make himself feel better?

855
00:47:06,182 --> 00:47:09,674
Then I thought maybe I just wanted him
to be more than the sum of his parts.

856
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:12,749
But as I looked into his eyes...

857
00:47:12,922 --> 00:47:15,049
...those dazzling eyes...

858
00:47:15,858 --> 00:47:17,485
...for the first time...

859
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,629
...I was pretty sure
that Bryce Loski was less.

860
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,333
We're going to invite the Bakers
over for dinner.

861
00:47:33,509 --> 00:47:35,670
- What?
- I don't know, Mom.

862
00:47:35,845 --> 00:47:37,574
I think that's a marvelous idea.

863
00:47:37,747 --> 00:47:39,874
Patsy, what purpose does this serve?

864
00:47:40,049 --> 00:47:42,415
Trina Baker is a very nice person.

865
00:47:42,585 --> 00:47:45,918
- And Matt and Mark are really cool.
- I hate cool.

866
00:47:46,088 --> 00:47:48,147
Something we should've done years ago.

867
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:50,815
Yeah, but we didn't. And now we can't.

868
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,291
The statute of limitations has run out.

869
00:47:54,029 --> 00:47:56,224
We're having the Bakers over for dinner.

870
00:47:58,634 --> 00:48:03,264
If this is about what I said last night,
I'm sorry, okay?

871
00:48:03,439 --> 00:48:06,840
But, you know, having them over for dinner
is not gonna fix his brother.

872
00:48:07,276 --> 00:48:09,073
It's going to be a sit-down dinner.

873
00:48:09,245 --> 00:48:11,941
And I expect everyone
to dress accordingly.

874
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,206
Oh, God. Can't we just have a barbecue?

875
00:48:14,383 --> 00:48:17,409
It's going to be a sit-down dinner.

876
00:48:19,054 --> 00:48:20,749
Just shoot me now.

877
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:22,990
Careful what you wish for.

878
00:48:23,759 --> 00:48:24,919
So that was it.

879
00:48:25,094 --> 00:48:29,724
A dress-up, sit-down dinner with Juli Baker
was in my immediate future.

880
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:34,397
And that made seeing Juli at school
more uncomfortable.

881
00:48:34,904 --> 00:48:37,031
I found myself staring at her in class.

882
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,674
And the way her hair fell back
over her shoulders...

883
00:48:39,842 --> 00:48:42,276
...she looked just like the picture
in the newspaper.

884
00:48:43,979 --> 00:48:45,970
Dana Tressler caught me watching.

885
00:48:46,148 --> 00:48:49,083
If I didn't do something fast,
this could spread like wildfire.

886
00:48:49,251 --> 00:48:50,946
There was a bee in her hair.

887
00:48:52,021 --> 00:48:53,113
See, there it goes.

888
00:48:55,991 --> 00:48:57,891
There's no bee.

889
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,891
It flew out the window.

890
00:49:00,696 --> 00:49:03,460
I convinced myself I'd dodged a bullet.

891
00:49:04,366 --> 00:49:06,630
I had to put Juli out of my mind.

892
00:49:06,802 --> 00:49:10,238
Keep the focus on the important stuff
like schoolwork.

893
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:15,073
My weakness was unnerving.

894
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,603
I need your sharpener.

895
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,715
- You ever heard of knocking?
- Hey, what you got there? Dad's Playboy?

896
00:49:20,983 --> 00:49:22,245
None of your business.

897
00:49:22,485 --> 00:49:25,181
- Give my best to Miss October.
- Get out.

898
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,886
- Or should I say your best? Ha, ha.
- You're disgusting.

899
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:31,787
Another disaster avoided.

900
00:49:31,961 --> 00:49:34,293
My life had become a minefield.

901
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:34,930
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

902
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,955
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

903
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,458
What's this?

904
00:49:40,636 --> 00:49:41,898
Whoa.

905
00:49:42,538 --> 00:49:44,438
It's not what you think.

906
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:48,336
Okay, it is what you think,
but I can explain.

907
00:49:49,345 --> 00:49:52,143
Okay, I can't explain.
Can we just talk about it later?

908
00:49:52,314 --> 00:49:53,941
Whatever you say.

909
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,743
I had to talk to someone.

910
00:49:55,985 --> 00:49:58,954
Why not Garrett?
Maybe he could help me get back on track.

911
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,817
Garrett was surprisingly sensitive
in matters of the heart.

912
00:50:01,991 --> 00:50:04,255
Are you freaking mental? Juli Baker.
You hate her.

913
00:50:04,426 --> 00:50:07,589
That's what's weird. I don't think I do.
I can't stop thinking about her.

914
00:50:07,763 --> 00:50:10,459
- You got it bad, man.
- Well, what do I do?

915
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:13,659
Well, you gotta nip this in the bud.
These aren't real emotions.

916
00:50:13,836 --> 00:50:16,464
- They're not?
- You feel guilty because of the egg thing.

917
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,106
Yeah, and I insulted her yard.

918
00:50:18,274 --> 00:50:20,504
Exactly. Of course,
the place is a dump anyways.

919
00:50:20,676 --> 00:50:24,203
Her dad's got a retarded brother
and all their money goes to helping him.

920
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,042
A retard? Well, shoot,
that ought to tell you something.

921
00:50:27,383 --> 00:50:29,817
- About what?
- About Juli.

922
00:50:30,686 --> 00:50:31,778
What are you saying?

923
00:50:32,354 --> 00:50:34,288
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

924
00:50:34,456 --> 00:50:37,152
I couldn't believe it.
I wanted to yell at him.

925
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:40,124
Tell him that he didn't know Juli
like I did.

926
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:42,259
But all that came out was:

927
00:50:43,098 --> 00:50:44,759
Heh, oh.

928
00:50:44,934 --> 00:50:47,402
- Right.
- Yeah.

929
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:50,835
Right. Um, I'll talk to you later.

930
00:50:53,442 --> 00:50:55,876
I was supposed to go
to Garrett's after school...

931
00:50:56,045 --> 00:50:57,637
...but I couldn't be around him.

932
00:50:57,813 --> 00:50:59,508
He'd crossed the line.

933
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:03,311
And standing right next to him
across that line was my father.

934
00:51:03,786 --> 00:51:05,720
I didn't care what they thought.

935
00:51:05,921 --> 00:51:08,219
I liked Juli Baker.

936
00:51:11,393 --> 00:51:13,554
Sunday mornings
are peaceful in our house.

937
00:51:13,729 --> 00:51:15,560
My dad lets himself sleep in.

938
00:51:15,731 --> 00:51:17,858
My mother lets herself not fix breakfast.

939
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,797
If my brothers have been out late
playing with their band...

940
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:23,302
...you won't even know they're around
till noon.

941
00:51:23,472 --> 00:51:26,407
But this Sunday, I woke up feeling weird.

942
00:51:26,575 --> 00:51:29,874
I had to do something to shake off
the confused feelings about Bryce...

943
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,070
...that were starting to creep back in.

944
00:51:39,788 --> 00:51:43,280
You really did it, didn't you? Heh.

945
00:51:44,326 --> 00:51:47,352
- Proud of you.
- Thanks, Dad.

946
00:51:47,696 --> 00:51:51,530
- Where you going?
- To see Daniel. It's his birthday.

947
00:51:53,335 --> 00:51:54,461
I wanna come with you.

948
00:51:55,104 --> 00:51:58,437
Oh, honey, just enjoy the morning,
stay with your mom.

949
00:51:59,975 --> 00:52:02,466
No, Dad. I wanna come.

950
00:52:03,512 --> 00:52:05,343
Sweetheart, listen.

951
00:52:05,514 --> 00:52:07,539
Sometimes, with Daniel...

952
00:52:07,716 --> 00:52:09,411
I'm coming, Dad.

953
00:52:12,354 --> 00:52:13,787
Okay.

954
00:52:14,857 --> 00:52:17,018
We'd better leave a note for your mother.

955
00:52:19,628 --> 00:52:22,529
In all the years,
I'd never visited my Uncle Daniel.

956
00:52:22,698 --> 00:52:25,997
I don't know why.
It was always something my dad did alone.

957
00:52:27,169 --> 00:52:30,969
We didn't say much to each other on
the drive to Devonhurst, but I didn't care.

958
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,867
I just liked being with my dad.

959
00:52:34,376 --> 00:52:38,244
Somehow the silence seemed to connect us
in a way that words never could.

960
00:52:56,832 --> 00:53:00,700
The residents tend to the grounds
as part of their therapy.

961
00:53:03,772 --> 00:53:07,708
It takes some getting used to.
They're good people, though.

962
00:53:09,111 --> 00:53:10,635
Daniel?

963
00:53:11,413 --> 00:53:12,471
Daniel.

964
00:53:13,449 --> 00:53:16,646
Richard! You're here!

965
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,946
Richard for my birthday.

966
00:53:19,121 --> 00:53:21,146
Who? Richard, who? Who?

967
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,984
Who? Who? Richard, who? Who?

968
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,888
Daniel, Daniel, it's Julianna.
It's my daughter.

969
00:53:26,562 --> 00:53:28,120
Your niece.

970
00:53:29,932 --> 00:53:31,627
Julianna.

971
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,394
- Ha, Julianna.
- Happy birthday, Uncle Daniel.

972
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:37,539
Ha-ha-ha. Richard. It's my birthday.

973
00:53:37,973 --> 00:53:41,067
I have your pictures, Julianna.
I have your pictures.

974
00:53:41,243 --> 00:53:44,041
We have a present for you.

975
00:53:44,213 --> 00:53:45,646
A puzzle? A puzzle, Richard?

976
00:53:45,814 --> 00:53:47,406
Not just a puzzle.

977
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:50,177
A puzzle and a...

978
00:53:50,786 --> 00:53:51,810
...pinwheel.

979
00:53:51,987 --> 00:53:55,252
A pinwheel! Thank you, Richard.

980
00:53:55,424 --> 00:53:56,914
Yes.

981
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,424
Orange. Outside? Outside, Richard?

982
00:54:01,997 --> 00:54:04,989
You wanna go outside?
All right, we'll go to, uh, McEIliot's.

983
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:07,567
- We'll walk out there for an ice cream.
- Ice cream!

984
00:54:07,736 --> 00:54:10,364
Oh, no. No, no, we can't.

985
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,507
Daniel doesn't like ice cream.

986
00:54:12,941 --> 00:54:14,533
Aw.

987
00:54:16,078 --> 00:54:19,605
- I do like ice cream, Richard.
- I'm only kidding.

988
00:54:19,782 --> 00:54:21,477
- I know you like ice cream.
- Ahh!

989
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:24,050
You love ice cream. All right, come on.

990
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:32,190
- Here you go. Got it?
- Ah!

991
00:54:32,361 --> 00:54:33,521
Here you go.

992
00:54:33,695 --> 00:54:35,458
It's my birthday.

993
00:54:40,302 --> 00:54:42,293
Lollipop. It's my birthday.

994
00:54:47,276 --> 00:54:49,039
You like it? Oh!

995
00:54:50,946 --> 00:54:53,779
- All right, Daniel. Okay, wait, wait.
- Ice cream. Ice cream.

996
00:54:53,949 --> 00:54:56,713
- My ice cream. My ice cream. Ugh!
- It's okay. Daniel.

997
00:54:57,719 --> 00:54:59,084
Daniel!

998
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:01,389
Daniel! Leave it, I'll get y...

999
00:55:01,557 --> 00:55:03,582
Ice cream on the floor.
Ice cream on the floor.

1000
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,784
Would you go get him another cone?

1001
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,559
- Yeah.
- I need ice cream, Richard!

1002
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:11,597
It's my birthday, Richard.
It's my birthday!

1003
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,133
Ice cream, Richard! Ice cream, Richard!

1004
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,161
Stop! Stop it!

1005
00:55:16,338 --> 00:55:17,828
- I need it!
- Stop it! Stop it!

1006
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,243
- Here we go.
- Ice cream!

1007
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:23,901
Aah!

1008
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,412
- Richard!
- Okay, okay. I've got some ice cream.

1009
00:55:29,017 --> 00:55:32,043
Birthday ice cream. That's good, Richard.

1010
00:55:32,221 --> 00:55:34,621
I'm so sorry.
He hasn't done anything like that...

1011
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:38,487
I'd often heard my father talk about
how difficult life was for Daniel.

1012
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:41,725
But I never really understood it until now.

1013
00:55:42,865 --> 00:55:45,265
- Yeah, there you go.
- Heh. Orange.

1014
00:55:45,434 --> 00:55:48,096
On the walk back,
Daniel acted like nothing had happened.

1015
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:49,862
Other way. Other way.

1016
00:55:50,706 --> 00:55:53,174
On the ride home,
my dad told me that Uncle Daniel...

1017
00:55:53,342 --> 00:55:56,175
...used to live with him and Mom
before we were born.

1018
00:55:56,345 --> 00:55:59,280
But after a while, it became too difficult.

1019
00:56:00,782 --> 00:56:03,615
When we got home,
everything looked the same.

1020
00:56:03,785 --> 00:56:05,412
But it wasn't.

1021
00:56:05,587 --> 00:56:08,954
Before today, Daniel had always been
just a name to me.

1022
00:56:09,124 --> 00:56:11,319
Now he was part of the family.

1023
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,231
- Hey.
- Hey.

1024
00:56:23,772 --> 00:56:24,898
How'd it go?

1025
00:56:25,741 --> 00:56:26,833
I'm glad I went.

1026
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,772
I'm glad you went too.

1027
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:33,772
Trina, it's Sunday.
What are you doing mopping the floor?

1028
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:37,676
Patty Loski invited us over for dinner
Friday night.

1029
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,681
Shouldn't she be mopping her floor?

1030
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,756
Or did she ask to borrow ours?

1031
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,221
Nervous energy.

1032
00:56:46,828 --> 00:56:49,160
- Did she invite all of us?
- Yes, she did.

1033
00:56:49,331 --> 00:56:52,357
Even our friend Sal Monella?

1034
00:56:52,834 --> 00:56:53,892
Richard.

1035
00:56:54,069 --> 00:56:56,697
Why, after all these years?

1036
00:56:56,872 --> 00:57:01,502
Well, she said she felt really bad
that they hadn't invited us before...

1037
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:04,842
...and apparently they want
to get to know us better.

1038
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,011
And you wanna go?

1039
00:57:07,616 --> 00:57:09,481
Well, she insisted.

1040
00:57:10,485 --> 00:57:12,783
And I think it would be really nice.

1041
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,187
All right.

1042
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:18,183
We'll go.

1043
00:57:18,627 --> 00:57:21,061
I wasn't too thrilled about dinner
with the Loskis...

1044
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:24,289
...but I could see it meant a lot
to my mother.

1045
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:28,135
At school the next day,
I couldn't seem to concentrate.

1046
00:57:28,804 --> 00:57:31,272
My thoughts kept running back to Daniel.

1047
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,807
I wondered what my grandparents
had gone through having a son like him...

1048
00:57:34,977 --> 00:57:36,376
...when reality interrupted.

1049
00:57:36,545 --> 00:57:39,070
- Bryce Loski likes you.
- What?

1050
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,215
He's got a big crush on you.

1051
00:57:41,383 --> 00:57:44,511
What are you talking about?
Bryce Loski does not have a crush on me.

1052
00:57:44,686 --> 00:57:47,211
Oh, yeah?
In science, I caught him staring at you.

1053
00:57:47,389 --> 00:57:49,880
He said it was because there was a bee
in your hair.

1054
00:57:50,058 --> 00:57:51,958
Is that the lamest cover-up or what?

1055
00:57:53,061 --> 00:57:54,221
Maybe there was a bee.

1056
00:57:54,396 --> 00:57:57,832
The only bee you're attracting
is B-R-Y-C-E.

1057
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,231
I'm telling you,
that boy is lost in love land.

1058
00:58:01,403 --> 00:58:02,768
- Come on.
- Where?

1059
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,600
I saw him sneaking off with Garrett.
Come on.

1060
00:58:07,376 --> 00:58:10,368
Are you freaking mental?
Juli Baker. You hate her.

1061
00:58:10,545 --> 00:58:12,479
That's what's so weird. I don't think I do.

1062
00:58:12,647 --> 00:58:13,909
I can't stop thinking about her.

1063
00:58:14,082 --> 00:58:16,642
- You got it bad, man.
- What do I do?

1064
00:58:16,985 --> 00:58:18,475
You gotta nip this in the bud.

1065
00:58:18,653 --> 00:58:20,951
They're not?

1066
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:23,182
You feel guilty because of the egg thing.

1067
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:24,848
Yeah, and I insulted her yard.

1068
00:58:25,027 --> 00:58:27,188
Exactly. The place is a dump anyways.

1069
00:58:27,362 --> 00:58:31,093
Her dad's got a retarded brother
and all their money goes to helping him.

1070
00:58:31,266 --> 00:58:33,530
A retard?
Well, that ought to tell you something.

1071
00:58:33,702 --> 00:58:36,102
- About what?
- About Juli.

1072
00:58:36,605 --> 00:58:37,799
What are you saying?

1073
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:40,373
The apple doesn't fall far
from the tree, my friend.

1074
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:43,875
- Oh, heh. Yeah. Right.
- Yeah.

1075
00:58:44,046 --> 00:58:45,877
I'll talk to you later.

1076
00:58:46,048 --> 00:58:47,379
Okay.

1077
00:58:50,252 --> 00:58:52,277
I'm sorry. I thought...

1078
00:58:52,454 --> 00:58:55,218
It's okay. It's fine.

1079
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,789
And it was.

1080
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:59,017
Because now my confusion was gone.

1081
00:58:59,194 --> 00:59:03,528
I was sure I no longer liked
Bryce Loski.

1082
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:09,394
Mom, are you trying to make the Bakers
feel totally worthless?

1083
00:59:09,571 --> 00:59:11,539
I want it to be nice.

1084
00:59:12,707 --> 00:59:15,198
- And why aren't you dressed?
- I'm going.

1085
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:19,677
I wanted to look good for Juli.

1086
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:23,215
But I didn't want her to think
that I wanted to look good for her.

1087
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,710
It was a fine line.

1088
00:59:30,492 --> 00:59:32,824
A very fine line.

1089
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:38,060
Bryce, they're here. Come on down.

1090
00:59:38,233 --> 00:59:39,700
Coming!

1091
00:59:41,336 --> 00:59:42,997
Hey, come on in.

1092
00:59:43,171 --> 00:59:45,605
- Come in, come in.
- There goes the waistline.

1093
00:59:45,774 --> 00:59:48,538
I'm glad you could make it.
Lynetta, Steven, company's here.

1094
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,042
- Coming!
- What is this? Homemade pie?

1095
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:54,046
Yes, it's pecan
and blueberry cheesecake.

1096
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,683
Let's take them to the kitchen.

1097
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:57,250
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, looking good.

1098
00:59:57,419 --> 00:59:59,284
- This is my dad.
- Hi, I'm Lynetta.

1099
00:59:59,454 --> 01:00:01,922
- Hi, nice to finally meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

1100
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:04,217
Hey, big guy.

1101
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,791
Hey, Steven. How are you?

1102
01:00:05,961 --> 01:00:08,725
We should've done this a long time ago.
Come on in.

1103
01:00:09,297 --> 01:00:10,321
This is a cool place.

1104
01:00:10,499 --> 01:00:13,434
Yeah, it's all right.
Come on, I'll show you my room.

1105
01:00:14,636 --> 01:00:16,604
You gotta hear this new song we wrote.

1106
01:00:16,771 --> 01:00:17,999
It's so good.

1107
01:00:18,173 --> 01:00:19,572
Hi.

1108
01:00:25,113 --> 01:00:26,546
You look nice.

1109
01:00:27,282 --> 01:00:30,251
I heard you and Garrett
making fun of my uncle in the library.

1110
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,147
And I don't wanna speak to you.

1111
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,288
Not now, not ever.

1112
01:00:36,825 --> 01:00:39,225
- And I say you can.
- But what you're proposing...

1113
01:00:39,394 --> 01:00:43,888
...would require a perpetual-motion
machine, so it's not possible.

1114
01:00:44,065 --> 01:00:47,125
If you had two opposite charged poles
with a neutral conductor...

1115
01:00:47,669 --> 01:00:48,897
Perpetual motion?

1116
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:52,767
Here I was, dying inside, and they
were talking about perpetual motion.

1117
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,966
And how did Juli know
about all that stuff?

1118
01:00:55,143 --> 01:00:57,873
Come on, everybody, dinner's ready.
Lynetta!

1119
01:00:58,046 --> 01:00:59,445
Dinner!

1120
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,774
Juli, can I talk to you?

1121
01:01:04,352 --> 01:01:07,651
It was wrong, what Garrett said.
I know it.

1122
01:01:07,822 --> 01:01:09,915
Did you know it was wrong
when he said it?

1123
01:01:10,225 --> 01:01:13,160
Yeah. I wanted to punch him.

1124
01:01:13,328 --> 01:01:15,296
But we were in the library.

1125
01:01:15,597 --> 01:01:17,861
So instead you just agreed with him
and laughed.

1126
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:20,191
Yeah.

1127
01:01:21,836 --> 01:01:23,827
Then that makes you a coward.

1128
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:30,308
I had to sit across from Juli
for an entire dinner.

1129
01:01:31,012 --> 01:01:32,309
My dad was right.

1130
01:01:32,948 --> 01:01:34,711
We should have barbecued.

1131
01:01:35,116 --> 01:01:38,711
I just want to say how wonderful it is
to have you share a meal with us.

1132
01:01:38,887 --> 01:01:40,878
May it be the first of many.

1133
01:01:42,924 --> 01:01:43,948
Wrong pipe.

1134
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,887
Well, we couldn't be happier.

1135
01:01:48,063 --> 01:01:51,396
We are just all so thrilled to be here.

1136
01:02:01,076 --> 01:02:03,806
Juli, you did a really nice job
on your yard.

1137
01:02:04,312 --> 01:02:06,974
Thanks. Chet was a big help.

1138
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:08,907
Yeah, I know.

1139
01:02:09,084 --> 01:02:12,451
You gotta tell me your secret.
I can't get him to do a thing around here.

1140
01:02:12,621 --> 01:02:14,953
- Steven.
- I kid.

1141
01:02:17,392 --> 01:02:21,852
I'm telling you, the neighborhood
is really coming to life.

1142
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,924
I mean, that new house is taking shape.

1143
01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:27,261
Which one?

1144
01:02:27,636 --> 01:02:30,264
You know, the one where they cut down
that big ugly tree.

1145
01:02:31,806 --> 01:02:35,936
I wanted to say that a lot of people
liked that tree, but I didn't.

1146
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,705
I didn't want to go against my dad.

1147
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,675
Some people thought that tree
was the jewel of the neighborhood.

1148
01:02:42,851 --> 01:02:45,684
Yeah, well,
there's no accounting for taste.

1149
01:02:48,256 --> 01:02:51,453
So, Matt, Mark, Mark, Matt...

1150
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,160
You guys are, uh, gonna be
graduating soon, huh?

1151
01:02:54,329 --> 01:02:56,229
Yeah, thank God.

1152
01:02:57,198 --> 01:02:58,460
You don't like high school?

1153
01:02:59,434 --> 01:03:01,629
- You kidding?
- No.

1154
01:03:02,003 --> 01:03:04,437
High school was the best time of my life.

1155
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:08,805
- Not for us, no.
- Yeah, we've had enough of that scene.

1156
01:03:08,977 --> 01:03:10,205
Ah.

1157
01:03:10,378 --> 01:03:13,211
So college is probably
out of the question, huh?

1158
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,707
No, it's a possibility.

1159
01:03:14,883 --> 01:03:16,441
They've actually been accepted...

1160
01:03:16,618 --> 01:03:18,916
...at several places already.
- Yes, they have.

1161
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,520
Really?

1162
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,787
Well, that's good.

1163
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,986
But, um,
we're gonna give music a shot first.

1164
01:03:27,395 --> 01:03:30,796
- Really?
- Oh, they are very talented.

1165
01:03:30,965 --> 01:03:32,990
Oh, their band is really boss.

1166
01:03:33,168 --> 01:03:35,728
They did a bunch of demos
and they're really cool.

1167
01:03:36,304 --> 01:03:37,396
Thanks, Lyn.

1168
01:03:37,572 --> 01:03:40,735
When Steven and I first met,
he was playing in a band.

1169
01:03:40,909 --> 01:03:43,002
You played in a band?

1170
01:03:43,178 --> 01:03:46,773
He was a wonderful saxophone player.

1171
01:03:47,248 --> 01:03:49,876
- Cool. You still play?
- Well, l...

1172
01:03:50,051 --> 01:03:52,815
Well, if you want,
you can come jam out with us sometime.

1173
01:03:54,389 --> 01:03:55,720
Uh, you...

1174
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:57,448
No, I mean... Heh.

1175
01:03:57,926 --> 01:03:59,416
That's not me anymore.

1176
01:03:59,594 --> 01:04:02,154
Have you boys ever performed
in front of an audience?

1177
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:03,354
A lot of times.

1178
01:04:03,531 --> 01:04:06,193
The more Matt and Mark
talked about their musical exploits...

1179
01:04:06,368 --> 01:04:07,767
...the quieter my dad got.

1180
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:11,431
He tried to plaster on a smile
now and then...

1181
01:04:11,606 --> 01:04:14,234
...but underneath he seemed really sad.

1182
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,476
But my parents didn't like him at first.

1183
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:21,240
Republicans fought like crazy
against the New Deal.

1184
01:04:21,416 --> 01:04:24,044
The rest of the evening
was painless enough.

1185
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:28,516
But through it all,
Juli didn't say a word to me.

1186
01:04:28,957 --> 01:04:31,357
Never even looked at me.

1187
01:04:32,594 --> 01:04:34,789
Until she was about to leave.

1188
01:04:35,764 --> 01:04:38,255
I'm sorry I was so angry
when we first came in.

1189
01:04:38,433 --> 01:04:40,230
I think everyone had a good time.

1190
01:04:41,202 --> 01:04:43,670
Your mom was really nice to invite us.

1191
01:04:45,707 --> 01:04:46,969
See you.

1192
01:04:47,142 --> 01:04:48,803
Her apology made things worse.

1193
01:04:49,043 --> 01:04:52,342
- Hey, wait for me.
- I knew I wasn't forgiven.

1194
01:04:53,281 --> 01:04:56,478
It was like I wasn't even important enough
to hold a grudge against.

1195
01:04:56,651 --> 01:04:58,949
Well, I think they're a delightful family.

1196
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,588
Those boys were nothing like I expected.

1197
01:05:01,756 --> 01:05:03,849
I thought they were very nice young men.

1198
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,788
- Hoodlums.
- What?

1199
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,428
How you think they can afford
all that recording gear?

1200
01:05:08,596 --> 01:05:12,498
Steven, please.
You can't just make an accusation like that.

1201
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:14,828
Don't be so naive, Patsy.

1202
01:05:15,003 --> 01:05:17,938
Do you know how expensive it is
to record a demo?

1203
01:05:18,106 --> 01:05:20,506
They're probably stealing hubcaps,
for chrissake.

1204
01:05:20,675 --> 01:05:23,235
You are such an asshole.

1205
01:05:23,678 --> 01:05:25,441
What is the matter with you?

1206
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:28,440
Go to hell.

1207
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:31,277
Don't you talk to me like that.

1208
01:05:31,453 --> 01:05:32,613
Steven, stop!

1209
01:05:32,787 --> 01:05:34,550
Nobody talks to me like that...

1210
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,587
...in my own house!
- Stop!

1211
01:05:36,858 --> 01:05:40,919
I'd seen my father angry before,
but this was different.

1212
01:05:41,362 --> 01:05:42,727
As I lay in bed that night...

1213
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:46,264
...I thought about how my dad
always looked down on the Bakers.

1214
01:05:46,434 --> 01:05:50,427
And how he'd called them trash
and made fun of Mr. Baker's paintings.

1215
01:05:50,605 --> 01:05:53,165
And now I realized
he was just mad at himself.

1216
01:05:53,341 --> 01:05:55,036
But why?

1217
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:57,371
Juli called me a coward.

1218
01:05:57,545 --> 01:06:00,241
Was it possible my dad
was a coward too?

1219
01:06:00,682 --> 01:06:02,240
I didn't know.

1220
01:06:02,717 --> 01:06:04,275
What difference did it make?

1221
01:06:04,452 --> 01:06:06,477
Juli Baker was out of my life.

1222
01:06:06,654 --> 01:06:08,485
Or, more accurately...

1223
01:06:08,656 --> 01:06:10,180
...I was out of hers.

1224
01:06:11,459 --> 01:06:14,019
As I was getting dressed
for the Loskis' dinner party...

1225
01:06:14,195 --> 01:06:17,255
...I found myself staring at the painting
my father had given me...

1226
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,593
...and became furious all over again.

1227
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,531
Bryce had never been
a friend to me, ever.

1228
01:06:22,704 --> 01:06:24,695
He hadn't taken my side about the tree...

1229
01:06:24,873 --> 01:06:26,397
...he'd thrown away my eggs...

1230
01:06:26,574 --> 01:06:29,441
...and he made fun of me
at my uncle's expense.

1231
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:31,642
When my mother called
that it was time to go...

1232
01:06:31,813 --> 01:06:33,508
Juli, let's go, we're late!

1233
01:06:33,681 --> 01:06:37,742
I went out with every intention of
telling her that I wasn't going to the Loskis.

1234
01:06:37,919 --> 01:06:41,355
Please hold these. I need to check my hair
really quickly one more time.

1235
01:06:41,523 --> 01:06:43,115
- Your hair is perfect.
- Really?

1236
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,690
But she looked so happy...

1237
01:06:44,859 --> 01:06:49,023
...and she'd gone to so much trouble
over the pies that I couldn't.

1238
01:06:49,197 --> 01:06:51,927
Ooh! Oh, my gosh.
Oh, God, what a disaster.

1239
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,897
Okay. Here, hold one, and you hold this.

1240
01:06:54,068 --> 01:06:56,628
- I don't wanna hold it.
- I won't have you hold it.

1241
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:57,862
Let's go, boys.

1242
01:06:58,039 --> 01:07:00,166
But that didn't mean
I had to be nice to Bryce.

1243
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,332
And I don't wanna speak to you.

1244
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:04,478
Not now, not ever.

1245
01:07:05,179 --> 01:07:06,737
It felt good to take charge.

1246
01:07:06,915 --> 01:07:10,373
I felt strong, in control.
I told Bryce what I thought...

1247
01:07:10,552 --> 01:07:13,817
...and I was determined not to talk to him
for the rest of the evening.

1248
01:07:14,756 --> 01:07:18,658
At dinner it struck me that we were sharing
a meal with a group of strangers.

1249
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,858
We'd lived across the street
from the Loskis for years...

1250
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:26,160
...but except for Chet,
I didn't know these people at all.

1251
01:07:26,968 --> 01:07:29,630
Mr. Loski was clean and smooth
on the outside...

1252
01:07:29,804 --> 01:07:33,706
...but it seemed like there was something
rotten buried just beneath the surface.

1253
01:07:36,411 --> 01:07:40,871
By the end of the evening,
all I felt was detached, neutral.

1254
01:07:41,049 --> 01:07:43,483
No fireworks, no leftover anger...

1255
01:07:43,651 --> 01:07:45,949
...no flutters, nothing.

1256
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,246
See you.

1257
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:50,649
I went to bed that night feeling peaceful.

1258
01:07:50,825 --> 01:07:51,849
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1259
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:54,494
I was grateful that I had the family I had.

1260
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:59,856
And it felt good to no longer care
about Bryce Loski.

1261
01:08:05,907 --> 01:08:08,705
The dinner with the Bakers
had taken its toll on me.

1262
01:08:09,177 --> 01:08:11,737
Then the annual
school fundraiser arrived...

1263
01:08:11,913 --> 01:08:15,246
...and I found myself
with a whole new set of problems.

1264
01:08:16,818 --> 01:08:18,979
I was a Basketboy.

1265
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:22,116
To fully appreciate the humiliation
of being a Basketboy...

1266
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:26,420
...you need to know that the chosen few are
auctioned off in front of the student body...

1267
01:08:26,594 --> 01:08:28,186
...to the highest-bidding females.

1268
01:08:28,363 --> 01:08:31,264
Yes, technically, each of us
comes with a lunch in a basket...

1269
01:08:31,432 --> 01:08:34,697
...but let's not kid ourselves.
This was a beefcake parade.

1270
01:08:34,869 --> 01:08:36,496
There he is, my idol.

1271
01:08:36,671 --> 01:08:38,138
One word, you're a dead man.

1272
01:08:38,306 --> 01:08:40,536
No, man, I'm serious.
Listen, you won't believe this.

1273
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:41,936
What?

1274
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:44,305
Two of the hottest chicks
are fighting over you.

1275
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,380
- What are you talking about?
- Sherry is breaking up with Mitch.

1276
01:08:47,548 --> 01:08:49,812
She and Melanie
are having a bidding war over you.

1277
01:08:49,984 --> 01:08:51,315
I don't care.

1278
01:08:51,486 --> 01:08:54,649
Are you nuts?
Sherry dumped Mitch because of you.

1279
01:08:54,822 --> 01:08:56,312
You're my idol.

1280
01:08:56,491 --> 01:08:58,618
As comforting as it was
to be Garrett's idol...

1281
01:08:58,793 --> 01:09:02,285
...it didn't diminish the horror
of being Basketboy number nine.

1282
01:09:02,463 --> 01:09:06,763
And my only hope was that a giant tornado
would destroy the school before the event.

1283
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:08,796
It was a long shot.

1284
01:09:10,038 --> 01:09:11,903
Welcome, everyone...

1285
01:09:12,073 --> 01:09:15,975
...to this year's
Mayfield Boosters Club Auction.

1286
01:09:16,878 --> 01:09:19,574
Once again we are pleased to present...

1287
01:09:19,747 --> 01:09:23,183
...20 of Mayfield's finest young men...
- Bryce, Bryce, Bryce.

1288
01:09:23,351 --> 01:09:25,581
- What are you doing here?
- Juli's in the third row.

1289
01:09:25,753 --> 01:09:28,017
- So?
- So she's got a wad of cash.

1290
01:09:28,723 --> 01:09:29,747
- Bullshit.
- Bull-true.

1291
01:09:29,924 --> 01:09:31,653
I saw her counting it by her locker.

1292
01:09:31,826 --> 01:09:32,850
And now...

1293
01:09:33,027 --> 01:09:36,360
...please give a big Mayfield School
welcome...

1294
01:09:36,531 --> 01:09:40,831
...to your 1963 Basketboys.

1295
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:48,298
Juli with cash? What did this mean?

1296
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:50,706
Was it possible
she was gonna bid on me?

1297
01:09:50,878 --> 01:09:53,039
First up, we have...

1298
01:09:53,214 --> 01:09:55,478
...Raymond Hughes.

1299
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:57,277
Raymond's on the chess team...

1300
01:09:57,452 --> 01:10:01,718
...and his hobbies include stamp collecting
and the yo-yo.

1301
01:10:01,889 --> 01:10:03,379
Remember, when you bid...

1302
01:10:03,558 --> 01:10:06,618
...you'll not only be getting
the handsome Mr. Hughes...

1303
01:10:07,195 --> 01:10:09,720
...you'll also be enjoying...

1304
01:10:10,098 --> 01:10:12,692
...a lovely chicken-salad sandwich...

1305
01:10:13,134 --> 01:10:17,161
...and what looks to be
a tasty bean dip, and...

1306
01:10:18,106 --> 01:10:20,404
Oh. Excuse me, onion dip.

1307
01:10:20,808 --> 01:10:23,470
And a big slice of cherry pie.

1308
01:10:23,644 --> 01:10:26,511
Okay, who will start the bidding at $5?

1309
01:10:27,949 --> 01:10:30,076
- Thus began the bidding.
- Anybody?

1310
01:10:30,251 --> 01:10:33,482
Or in Raymond Hughes' case,
the lack of bidding.

1311
01:10:34,655 --> 01:10:36,555
Very good, here we go.

1312
01:10:37,558 --> 01:10:39,082
Sold.

1313
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,693
Sold.

1314
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,955
Sold.

1315
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:45,893
Come on. Do I hear 10?

1316
01:10:46,067 --> 01:10:47,898
- Ten.
- Ten.

1317
01:10:48,069 --> 01:10:51,232
- Ten.
- Peanut-butter-and-banana sandwich.

1318
01:10:51,405 --> 01:10:52,667
Fifteen.

1319
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,070
Sold for $15.

1320
01:10:56,778 --> 01:10:59,576
Number eight is Eddie Trulock.

1321
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,345
Eddie is a member of the debate team.

1322
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:06,752
Now only Eddie Trulock
stood between me and the auction block.

1323
01:11:07,021 --> 01:11:09,819
I wasn't interested in his hobbies
or what was in his basket.

1324
01:11:09,991 --> 01:11:13,256
- Let's start the bidding at $5.
- All I could think of was Juli.

1325
01:11:13,427 --> 01:11:15,793
- Anybody?
- What if she did bid on me?

1326
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:19,294
What if she got in a bidding war
with Sherry and Melanie and lost out?

1327
01:11:19,467 --> 01:11:20,491
No bidders?

1328
01:11:20,668 --> 01:11:22,932
I was contemplating the horrors
of this when...

1329
01:11:23,104 --> 01:11:24,401
Eight dollars.

1330
01:11:24,839 --> 01:11:28,536
There you go. Eight dollars,
that's more like it. Do I hear 10?

1331
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:30,677
Juli Baker was bidding on Eddie Trulock?

1332
01:11:30,845 --> 01:11:33,313
- Okay, 8 going once.
- How could she bid on Eddie?

1333
01:11:33,481 --> 01:11:35,972
- Eight going twice.
- How could she bid on anyone?

1334
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:38,584
Sold to Juli Baker.

1335
01:11:42,623 --> 01:11:46,957
Next is Basketboy number nine,
Bryce Loski.

1336
01:11:47,128 --> 01:11:51,292
I knew I was supposed
to step forward, but I couldn't move.

1337
01:11:51,465 --> 01:11:54,195
Step up, Bryce, don't be shy.

1338
01:11:55,636 --> 01:11:58,230
Better late than never. Ha, ha.

1339
01:11:58,406 --> 01:12:00,431
Bryce likes to play baseball.

1340
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:02,735
Oh, well, wait until l...

1341
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:04,377
Oh.

1342
01:12:04,545 --> 01:12:06,445
Well, it appears the bidding is underway.

1343
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:07,774
- Fifteen.
- Twenty.

1344
01:12:08,216 --> 01:12:09,740
- Twenty-five.
- Thirty.

1345
01:12:09,917 --> 01:12:11,817
Forty.

1346
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,018
Oh, my.

1347
01:12:15,189 --> 01:12:17,214
Fifty dollars. Wh...

1348
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,020
Fifty going once.

1349
01:12:20,194 --> 01:12:22,424
Fifty going twice.

1350
01:12:22,763 --> 01:12:26,324
Sold to Miss Sherry Stalls for $50.

1351
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,025
An all-time record.

1352
01:12:29,337 --> 01:12:33,467
Oh, the boosters will be very grateful
for such a generous donation.

1353
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:35,131
It's strange.

1354
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:38,679
Here I was, having lunch
with the hottest girl in school...

1355
01:12:38,846 --> 01:12:40,177
...and I was miserable.

1356
01:12:40,348 --> 01:12:42,942
We're going up to the lake.
My dad has a cabin there...

1357
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:45,278
...and you get the most outrageous tan.

1358
01:12:45,453 --> 01:12:48,820
Because less than 20 feet
away from me was Juli.

1359
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:52,084
My Juli with Eddie Trulock.

1360
01:12:52,526 --> 01:12:54,187
She's laughing.

1361
01:12:54,528 --> 01:12:56,223
What was she laughing about?

1362
01:12:56,397 --> 01:13:00,197
How could she sit there and laugh
and look so beautiful?

1363
01:13:01,068 --> 01:13:02,831
Bryce, are you all right?

1364
01:13:04,071 --> 01:13:05,402
What?

1365
01:13:05,573 --> 01:13:06,904
What are you staring at?

1366
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:09,536
Nothing.

1367
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:13,509
Lunch is really delicious, Bryce.

1368
01:13:17,752 --> 01:13:18,946
Bryce, did you hear me?

1369
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,486
This is a really delicious lunch.

1370
01:13:22,123 --> 01:13:24,421
Can we not talk about tans or food?

1371
01:13:25,793 --> 01:13:27,886
Well, what do you wanna talk about?

1372
01:13:28,062 --> 01:13:31,930
I don't know, perpetual motion?
Do you know anything about that?

1373
01:13:32,233 --> 01:13:33,564
Perpetual what?

1374
01:13:37,238 --> 01:13:40,765
I don't know what came over me.
It was like I was possessed or something.

1375
01:13:40,942 --> 01:13:44,070
- Juli, I gotta talk to you.
- What?

1376
01:13:46,948 --> 01:13:48,176
What's going on, Bryce?

1377
01:13:51,285 --> 01:13:52,513
What are you doing?

1378
01:13:54,422 --> 01:13:56,014
Bryce, stop it.

1379
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:58,249
Bryce, you didn't even make it to first base.

1380
01:13:58,426 --> 01:13:59,859
I'll kiss you. Ha, ha.

1381
01:14:00,328 --> 01:14:02,956
Juli! Juli!

1382
01:14:04,999 --> 01:14:07,229
Juli, wait. Can we talk?

1383
01:14:07,868 --> 01:14:09,301
Juli!

1384
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,938
- What's the matter with you?
- Leave me alone, Garrett.

1385
01:14:12,106 --> 01:14:16,566
You get a date with the finest girl
on campus and you blow it for Juli.

1386
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:19,542
- You wouldn't understand!
- I completely don't understand!

1387
01:14:20,648 --> 01:14:22,309
We're talking about Juli Baker here.

1388
01:14:22,483 --> 01:14:25,316
Nightmare neighbor, know-it-all nuisance.
The coop-poop babe.

1389
01:14:25,486 --> 01:14:27,215
Shut up!

1390
01:14:27,388 --> 01:14:29,982
Hey, have you flipped?
What's the matter with you?

1391
01:14:30,157 --> 01:14:34,389
You know what, if you're gonna be like this,
I don't need the association.

1392
01:14:34,562 --> 01:14:37,929
- Well, good, because neither do I.
- Yeah, neither do I!

1393
01:14:40,634 --> 01:14:44,331
As I walked home with the dirty
dishes clanking inside my picnic basket...

1394
01:14:44,505 --> 01:14:46,769
...all I could think of was Juli.

1395
01:14:46,974 --> 01:14:49,670
And I realized Garrett was right
about one thing:

1396
01:14:49,844 --> 01:14:52,904
I had flipped. Completely.

1397
01:15:04,658 --> 01:15:05,682
Hello?

1398
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:08,988
Oh, heh. Hi, Mrs. Baker. Is Juli there?

1399
01:15:09,163 --> 01:15:13,259
Oh. I'm sorry, Bryce.
Juli doesn't wanna talk.

1400
01:15:18,572 --> 01:15:20,631
Please, Mrs. Baker. I gotta see her.

1401
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:22,332
I'm sorry, Bryce.

1402
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:25,804
But I'm afraid she's locked herself
in her room.

1403
01:15:31,852 --> 01:15:34,286
I tried to go to bed early that night...

1404
01:15:34,455 --> 01:15:36,252
...but I couldn't sleep.

1405
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:39,921
I watched her house from my window
for hours.

1406
01:15:40,094 --> 01:15:43,086
I had to find a way
to show her how I felt.

1407
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:47,763
Monday morning,
as I made my way into school...

1408
01:15:47,935 --> 01:15:51,029
...I was deciding which
of the Everly Brothers I'd rather marry...

1409
01:15:51,405 --> 01:15:54,135
...when Dana Tressler forced Bryce
back into my brain.

1410
01:15:54,308 --> 01:15:56,401
Juli. The list is out.

1411
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:59,612
There he is, number nine, your main dish.

1412
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:01,372
Bryce Loski's not my main dish.

1413
01:16:01,549 --> 01:16:05,349
- Oh, you're sticking to your diet.
- It's not a diet, Dana.

1414
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:08,215
- I'm over him, okay?
- I'm glad to hear it.

1415
01:16:08,389 --> 01:16:11,688
Because rumor has it Sherry's
already staking her claim on him.

1416
01:16:12,059 --> 01:16:14,357
Sherry? Sherry Stalls?

1417
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:16,826
Oh, Liz. Macy. The list is up.

1418
01:16:20,668 --> 01:16:24,798
That afternoon, I found myself
obsessing about the Basketboy auction.

1419
01:16:25,272 --> 01:16:27,934
I could feel myself backsliding
about Bryce.

1420
01:16:28,109 --> 01:16:30,407
But why should I care if Sherry liked him?

1421
01:16:30,578 --> 01:16:32,569
I shouldn't even be thinking about him.

1422
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,870
I had to rise above this.

1423
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:37,108
Bryce Loski was no longer in my life.

1424
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,721
On the morning of the auction,
I was on edge.

1425
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:47,388
I found myself, without even knowing
how it happened, staring at my egg money.

1426
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,085
I needed a strategy.

1427
01:16:49,263 --> 01:16:50,628
It was simple.

1428
01:16:50,798 --> 01:16:54,529
If I left my money at home,
I'd leave temptation with it.

1429
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:58,095
My strategy suffered a setback
when I ran into Mrs. Steuby.

1430
01:16:58,272 --> 01:16:59,671
Julianna.

1431
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,432
Julianna.

1432
01:17:01,609 --> 01:17:03,099
Hello, dear.

1433
01:17:04,445 --> 01:17:07,175
I'm so sorry it's taken me so long
to get this to you...

1434
01:17:07,348 --> 01:17:09,646
...but I keep missing you in the morning.

1435
01:17:10,151 --> 01:17:12,483
Mrs. Steuby, I don't want that.
You don't have to...

1436
01:17:12,653 --> 01:17:14,678
Don't be ridiculous. I'm gonna pay you.

1437
01:17:14,855 --> 01:17:17,722
- I'm going to pay you.
- I don't want that. I don't want it.

1438
01:17:17,892 --> 01:17:21,055
Yeah, I want you to go out
and buy yourself something festive.

1439
01:17:21,228 --> 01:17:22,286
Pedal pushers. Ha, ha.

1440
01:17:22,463 --> 01:17:23,794
- Mrs. Steuby.
- Bye, dear.

1441
01:17:23,964 --> 01:17:27,593
- Mrs. Steuby, I don't want pedal pushers.
- No, no. You'll look great.

1442
01:17:30,471 --> 01:17:32,268
It's okay.

1443
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:35,602
It's okay. No big deal.
Just pretend like I don't have it.

1444
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:38,337
I hear you're planning to bid on Bryce.

1445
01:17:38,512 --> 01:17:40,275
What? Who told you that? No, I'm not.

1446
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:42,677
Someone saw you with a wad of cash
this morning.

1447
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:45,444
- How much do you have?
- It's none of your business.

1448
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:48,520
And I'm not bidding, okay?
I don't even like him anymore.

1449
01:17:48,689 --> 01:17:50,350
Oh, that'll be the day.

1450
01:17:50,524 --> 01:17:54,119
It's true. Go ahead,
waste your money on him. I don't care.

1451
01:17:54,495 --> 01:17:59,330
And now, will you all give
a big Mayfield School welcome...

1452
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:03,630
...to your 1963 Basketboys.

1453
01:18:04,271 --> 01:18:06,239
I could say I didn't care all I wanted...

1454
01:18:06,407 --> 01:18:09,103
...but seeing Bryce walk out
in his jacket and tie...

1455
01:18:09,276 --> 01:18:11,107
...holding that picnic basket...

1456
01:18:11,278 --> 01:18:13,542
...set my head spinning again.

1457
01:18:14,081 --> 01:18:15,946
Fifteen going once.

1458
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:20,011
- The auction seemed to fly by.
- Fifteen going twice.

1459
01:18:20,187 --> 01:18:23,179
Sold to Macy Taylor for $15.

1460
01:18:24,358 --> 01:18:26,849
Before I knew it,
Eddie Trulock was called.

1461
01:18:27,361 --> 01:18:30,194
Number eight is Eddie Trulock.

1462
01:18:30,698 --> 01:18:32,029
Which meant Bryce was next.

1463
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:34,497
Eddie is a member of the debate team.

1464
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,865
And his hobbies include fishing...

1465
01:18:38,038 --> 01:18:41,201
...and model-airplane building.

1466
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:43,468
Who will give me $5?

1467
01:18:46,447 --> 01:18:49,939
- Why isn't anyone bidding? He's so nice.
- Exactly.

1468
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:52,341
Nobody?

1469
01:18:54,888 --> 01:18:56,219
Eight dollars.

1470
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:59,257
Sold to Juli Baker for $8.

1471
01:18:59,426 --> 01:19:01,326
How did this happen?

1472
01:19:01,495 --> 01:19:03,656
Was it because I felt bad for Eddie?

1473
01:19:03,831 --> 01:19:06,527
Or was it because I couldn't trust myself
with Bryce?

1474
01:19:07,334 --> 01:19:09,564
As I made my way
to the multi-purpose room...

1475
01:19:09,737 --> 01:19:12,501
...I contemplated
the startling turn of events.

1476
01:19:12,673 --> 01:19:15,369
Here I was, about to have lunch
with Eddie Trulock...

1477
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:17,806
...while the boy I mooned over
for half my life...

1478
01:19:17,978 --> 01:19:20,344
...was going to share a meal
with my mortal enemy.

1479
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,211
I wanna thank you for bidding on me.

1480
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:27,354
It was touch-and-go there for a while.

1481
01:19:27,688 --> 01:19:30,418
No, I wanted to. This will be fun.

1482
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:42,294
- I hear you like building model airplanes.
- Yeah.

1483
01:19:42,469 --> 01:19:46,337
My father and I just finished
a Russian MiG-19. It was made in 1955.

1484
01:19:46,507 --> 01:19:49,965
MiG's first supersonic fighter.
Tricky because the cockpit was recessed...

1485
01:19:50,144 --> 01:19:52,044
I tried to give Eddie my full attention.

1486
01:19:52,212 --> 01:19:55,340
But it was difficult,
because Bryce was right behind him.

1487
01:19:55,516 --> 01:19:57,780
Eddie was saying something
about intake valves...

1488
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:01,944
...when out of nowhere, Bryce stood up
and marched straight towards me.

1489
01:20:02,656 --> 01:20:04,851
Hey, Juli, I gotta talk to you.

1490
01:20:12,032 --> 01:20:13,659
What are you doing?

1491
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:19,505
He was going to kiss me. To kiss me.

1492
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:22,272
All my life I've been waiting for that kiss.

1493
01:20:22,576 --> 01:20:25,670
But not like this. Not this way.

1494
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:29,980
I pedaled home so hard,
I thought my lungs would burst.

1495
01:20:35,089 --> 01:20:36,784
Julianna?

1496
01:20:39,259 --> 01:20:40,851
Julianna.

1497
01:20:43,897 --> 01:20:45,455
Honey?

1498
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,192
What's wrong?

1499
01:20:48,836 --> 01:20:50,463
I can't.

1500
01:20:54,074 --> 01:20:55,905
Sweetheart...

1501
01:20:57,010 --> 01:20:58,534
...you can tell me.

1502
01:21:00,748 --> 01:21:02,841
Bryce tried to kiss me.

1503
01:21:04,084 --> 01:21:05,551
He did?

1504
01:21:05,886 --> 01:21:07,217
In school.

1505
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:10,051
In front of everybody.

1506
01:21:11,892 --> 01:21:13,189
Mom, please don't get it.

1507
01:21:13,894 --> 01:21:15,657
It's probably him.

1508
01:21:17,231 --> 01:21:19,028
Sweetheart...

1509
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:20,996
...maybe you should talk to him.

1510
01:21:22,803 --> 01:21:24,361
I can't.

1511
01:21:24,872 --> 01:21:26,499
I can't.

1512
01:21:28,308 --> 01:21:30,503
Bryce wouldn't leave me alone.

1513
01:21:31,712 --> 01:21:33,703
He kept calling on the phone.

1514
01:21:35,949 --> 01:21:37,883
And knocking on the door.

1515
01:21:38,752 --> 01:21:41,516
He even snuck around the house
and tapped on my window.

1516
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:44,013
Juli! Please, I gotta see you!

1517
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:45,658
Come on out, just for a minute!

1518
01:21:45,826 --> 01:21:49,023
Why didn't he understand
that I just wanted to be left alone?

1519
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:50,720
Please!

1520
01:21:53,267 --> 01:21:55,701
After two days, Bryce stopped.

1521
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:58,099
And I thought it was finally over.

1522
01:22:01,575 --> 01:22:05,136
Then, one afternoon,
I was coming into the front room to read...

1523
01:22:07,748 --> 01:22:09,682
...when I heard a noise in the yard.

1524
01:22:14,354 --> 01:22:15,651
Hey, what's he doing?

1525
01:22:15,823 --> 01:22:19,759
Juli, calm down. I gave him permission.

1526
01:22:19,927 --> 01:22:23,590
Permission? Permission for what?
He's digging a hole.

1527
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:25,387
I told him he could.

1528
01:22:25,966 --> 01:22:27,490
But why?

1529
01:22:27,668 --> 01:22:29,431
I told him he could.

1530
01:22:29,870 --> 01:22:32,737
It was torture seeing him
dig up my grass.

1531
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,306
How could my father let him do this?

1532
01:22:35,642 --> 01:22:37,974
Bryce knew I was there too.

1533
01:22:46,119 --> 01:22:47,677
He's gone.

1534
01:22:58,065 --> 01:22:59,464
A tree?

1535
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,065
He's planting a tree?

1536
01:23:07,875 --> 01:23:09,137
Is it a?

1537
01:23:09,309 --> 01:23:11,470
I didn't really need to ask.

1538
01:23:11,645 --> 01:23:13,977
I could tell
from the shape of the leaves...

1539
01:23:14,147 --> 01:23:16,172
...and the texture of the trunk.

1540
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:18,676
It was a sycamore tree.

1541
01:23:24,157 --> 01:23:29,060
When she walked out of the door,
I thought back to the first time I saw her.

1542
01:23:29,229 --> 01:23:33,757
How could anybody, ever,
have wanted to run away from Juli Baker?

1543
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:36,227
He looked at me with those eyes.

1544
01:23:36,403 --> 01:23:38,633
Those once again dazzling eyes.

1545
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:43,333
And I knew that Bryce Loski
was still walking around with my first kiss.

1546
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:45,937
But he wouldn't be for long.

1547
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,281
As we stood there,
I realized that all these years...

1548
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:52,475
...we never really talked.

1549
01:23:55,856 --> 01:23:57,118
Do you need some help?

1550
01:23:58,058 --> 01:23:59,218
Yeah.

1551
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:02,954
But that day, we started.

1552
01:24:04,364 --> 01:24:07,128
And I knew we'd be talking for a long time.

1553
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,497
Let's do it from the beginning again.

1554
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:57,224
You ready? And action.

1555
01:29:57,401 --> 01:29:58,698
Juli, can we talk?

1556
01:29:58,869 --> 01:30:00,393
- What's going on?
- And...

1557
01:30:01,805 --> 01:30:03,272
Oh, God.

1558
01:30:03,473 --> 01:30:05,464
Oh, God, here we go.

1559
01:30:06,376 --> 01:30:08,901
The scene where we're doing
the Basketboy thing...

1560
01:30:09,079 --> 01:30:12,515
...where we almost kiss,
that one was so hard.

1561
01:30:12,683 --> 01:30:14,116
Bryce, what are you doing?

1562
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:15,945
Mm...

1563
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:17,916
Stop it. Ha, ha!

1564
01:30:18,088 --> 01:30:19,612
And then I leave? Ha, ha.

1565
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:20,814
God.

1566
01:30:20,991 --> 01:30:24,085
You gotta be serious about this.
You can't be giggling during this.

1567
01:30:24,261 --> 01:30:26,456
- Okay. Okay.
- Sorry.

1568
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:27,824
Can't be Giggleville.

1569
01:30:27,998 --> 01:30:29,863
Let's do it again. No giggling.

1570
01:30:30,033 --> 01:30:31,591
It's supposed to be we're talking...

1571
01:30:31,802 --> 01:30:33,633
...and he comes up and tries to kiss me.

1572
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:36,671
It was really hard. I had to wait
until he got there and then I'm like:

1573
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,102
Oh, it was so embarrassing.

1574
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:39,569
And action.

1575
01:30:41,812 --> 01:30:43,211
Juli, I gotta talk to you.

1576
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,608
We don't actually kiss.

1577
01:30:44,781 --> 01:30:47,909
It's a near kiss.
I try to kiss her and then she runs out.

1578
01:30:48,085 --> 01:30:49,677
I was kind of confused when I read that.

1579
01:30:49,853 --> 01:30:53,949
Because she wanted the kiss
the entire time, then when I try she runs.

1580
01:30:54,124 --> 01:30:56,422
He gets up and, like, walks towards me...

1581
01:30:56,593 --> 01:31:00,654
...and says, "Can I talk to you?"
And he grabs me and he goes like:

1582
01:31:00,864 --> 01:31:02,388
And then I have to run away.

1583
01:31:02,566 --> 01:31:03,828
But we kept laughing.

1584
01:31:06,136 --> 01:31:07,660
I tripped on the cloth.

1585
01:31:07,838 --> 01:31:10,830
It was so funny. Oh, my gosh.
It was so hard to keep a straight face.

1586
01:31:11,274 --> 01:31:12,298
It was so embarrassing.

1587
01:31:12,576 --> 01:31:14,339
Just turn around.

1588
01:31:14,511 --> 01:31:15,535
That was so weird.

1589
01:31:15,712 --> 01:31:19,113
I thought the sniffing hair was weird,
when I had to sniff his hair in one scene...

1590
01:31:19,282 --> 01:31:20,510
...but that was really weird.

1591
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:23,448
That was really fun to film
but it was really awkward as well.

1592
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:25,918
Then Madeline was trying to not laugh.

1593
01:31:26,556 --> 01:31:29,024
- Why are you smiling?
- Cut.

1594
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:31,558
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry. Ha, ha.

1595
01:31:31,728 --> 01:31:33,355
It was so hard not to laugh.

1596
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:36,192
I had to have Callan... He was off camera.
I'm like, "Turn around!"

1597
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,161
What are you doing?

1598
01:31:39,336 --> 01:31:40,360
Stop.

1599
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:41,970
- Ha, ha.
- And cut.

1600
01:31:42,139 --> 01:31:44,232
One of the kids,
who played Eddie Trulock...

1601
01:31:44,408 --> 01:31:47,343
...who ended up being chosen by Juli
at the Basketboy thing...

1602
01:31:47,511 --> 01:31:51,880
...he told Madeline and I that my look
when I was trying to kiss her was like:

1603
01:31:52,349 --> 01:31:54,146
Show him your face.

1604
01:31:56,319 --> 01:31:59,379
You see... coming towards you
and you're supposed to be serious.

1605
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:01,319
Okay, picture's up.

1606
01:32:01,491 --> 01:32:04,722
I had to run out after and I'd
stay there for a bit after she'd run away.

1607
01:32:04,895 --> 01:32:07,523
And we had all the really nice
extra kids over there...

1608
01:32:07,697 --> 01:32:10,165
...and they were saying, like,
"Ooh. Bryce. Bryce."

1609
01:32:10,467 --> 01:32:11,729
Bryce, stop.

1610
01:32:11,902 --> 01:32:13,699
Bryce, you didn't even make it
to first base.

1611
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:15,064
Hey, Bryce, I'll kiss you.

1612
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:18,571
- Nice job, make-out artist.
- Hello, lover boy.

1613
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:19,834
And cut. Good.

1614
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:22,444
Okay. Good. Very good, Cal.

1615
01:32:22,612 --> 01:32:25,581
Sometimes Rob will yell a direction,
like, "Try it like that!"

1616
01:32:25,749 --> 01:32:26,943
Because he's in the other room.

1617
01:32:27,117 --> 01:32:29,642
I was like, "We're not gonna kiss, right?
We're not, right?"

1618
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:31,651
Then we did the scene and he's like:

1619
01:32:31,822 --> 01:32:35,223
"Okay, Callan, this time
I want you to actually kiss her."

1620
01:32:35,392 --> 01:32:36,916
- Cal?
- Yes?

1621
01:32:37,094 --> 01:32:39,062
On this time,
I want you to really kiss her.

1622
01:32:39,229 --> 01:32:40,594
- No, I'm kidding.
- He's kidding.

1623
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:41,753
- Ha, ha!
- What?

1624
01:32:41,932 --> 01:32:43,923
My face drained. I'm just like:

1625
01:32:44,801 --> 01:32:47,133
And I looked at Callan. I'm like, "What?"

1626
01:32:47,304 --> 01:32:49,238
It was so funny.
They got me really good.

1627
01:32:49,406 --> 01:32:52,569
- Oh, my gosh. That was scary.
- Ha, ha.

1628
01:32:52,742 --> 01:32:55,006
- Good one, Rob.
- Who put you up to that?

1629
01:32:55,178 --> 01:32:57,612
But the sad thing was,
my mom and dad put him up to it.

1630
01:32:58,048 --> 01:33:00,573
Oh, gosh. That was so embarrassing.
