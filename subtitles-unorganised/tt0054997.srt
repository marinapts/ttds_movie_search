1
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,538
Yes, sir.

2
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,538
I got grease
in this lining.

3
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:45,537
It'll take about
30 minutes to check it.

4
00:00:45,537 --> 00:00:49,586
Check the oil, too.

5
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:51,586
Boys just
passing through?

6
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:53,235
Yep.

7
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:54,635
Pittsburgh?

8
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:56,235
Uh-huh.

9
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:58,634
We got
a sales convention.

10
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:01,234
What do
you guys sell?

11
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:03,231
Druggist supplies.

12
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:06,231
Buster's going
to get an award.

13
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:10,230
He sold 17,000 bucks
worth of stuff last month.

14
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,379
Fastest
and the best.

15
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:16,479
Hey, give us
another round, will you?

16
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,528
It's a hot day
for driving.

17
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:21,528
Late afternoon
is better.

18
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:24,677
You guys have
plenty of time.

19
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:28,574
Make Pittsburgh in two,
maybe three hours.

20
00:01:28,574 --> 00:01:32,523
Hey, he's right.

21
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:35,323
What do you say?

22
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:37,273
Play a little pool?

23
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:39,272
Wait out the heat?

24
00:01:39,272 --> 00:01:42,272
It's going to
cost you money.

25
00:01:42,272 --> 00:01:44,271
Grab yourself a cue.

26
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,471
Good thing
he can afford it.

27
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:50,620
Keep them coming,
will you, friend?

28
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,617
J.T.S. Brown.

29
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:04,265
Hmm?

30
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:11,164
Ah.

31
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,163
You miss again,

32
00:02:13,163 --> 00:02:17,213
you lose again.

33
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,510
What's the kid
in hock for?

34
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,759
About 60, 70 bucks.

35
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,609
Next game, 10 bucks.

36
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:27,359
Nice-looking boy.

37
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:31,358
It's too bad he can't
hold his liquor.

38
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:56,651
I made it, boy!

39
00:02:56,651 --> 00:03:00,350
Pay up, sucker!

40
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,649
Talk about luck.

41
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,649
What do you mean?

42
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:07,646
You couldn't make
that shot again

43
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,646
in a million years.

44
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:11,646
I couldn't, huh?

45
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:14,345
Go ahead,
set them up

46
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:16,645
the way they were before.

47
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:18,344
Why?

48
00:03:18,344 --> 00:03:20,344
Go ahead.

49
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:22,344
Bet you 20 bucks

50
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:24,343
I'll make this shot.

51
00:03:24,343 --> 00:03:26,643
Nobody can
make that shot,

52
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:30,642
not even
a lucky lush.

53
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:38,338
How's that?

54
00:03:38,338 --> 00:03:41,388
That the way
they were before?

55
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,387
Yeah.
That's it.

56
00:03:43,387 --> 00:03:47,287
Come on.
Put it up.

57
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:02,681
Ha ha ha!

58
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:09,680
Set them up again.

59
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,679
Come on.
Set them up again!

60
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,679
You're drunk, boy.

61
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,729
No more bets.

62
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:20,378
We got to be
at that convention

63
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:22,477
in the morning.

64
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:25,725
Up the flagpole
with the convention!

65
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:29,374
I got my money
on the table.

66
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:31,374
I don't want it.

67
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:35,323
I'll try you.

68
00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:38,372
Well.

69
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:39,672
Well.

70
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:41,722
Don't be a chump.

71
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:44,321
Don't bet
any more money.

72
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:46,521
Well, well, well!

73
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:49,468
You figure
I'm a little drunk,

74
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:52,667
and you just want in
real friendly

75
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,667
while the money's
still floating, huh?

76
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:59,666
Okay.

77
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:05,315
Go ahead.
Set them up.

78
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:18,360
You want some
easy money, huh?

79
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Here's $105.

80
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,360
That's one week's
commissions.

81
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,709
You want to take
the whole thing?

82
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:28,258
I'll take a piece.

83
00:05:28,258 --> 00:05:30,658
<i>No. I want him.</i>

84
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:32,308
Okay.

85
00:05:32,308 --> 00:05:36,307
I'll meet you
in the car, chump.

86
00:07:59,116 --> 00:08:03,115
Morning, Henry.

87
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:40,104
Quiet.

88
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:44,053
Yeah.
Like a church.

89
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,602
Church of the good hustler.

90
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:52,102
Looks more like a morgue.

91
00:08:52,102 --> 00:08:56,101
Those tables are the slabs
they lay the stiffs on.

92
00:08:57,101 --> 00:09:01,098
I'll be alive
when I get out, Charlie.

93
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,095
Any table?

94
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:20,094
Any table.

95
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:25,141
No bar?

96
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:27,690
No bar.
No pinball machines.

97
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,690
No bowling alleys.

98
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,690
Just pool.
Nothing else.

99
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,639
This is Ames, mister.

100
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:45,687
This is Ames, mister.

101
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:18,776
Nice clean pocket drop.

102
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:40,170
How much am I going to win
tonight?

103
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:46,319
10 grand.

104
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:50,318
I'm going to win
10 grand in one night.

105
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:57,766
Who's going to beat me?

106
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,366
Come on, Charlie.

107
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:02,813
Who's going to
beat me?

108
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:06,813
Okay, okay.
Nobody can beat you.

109
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:10,062
10 grand.

110
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:12,911
Is there
any other pool room

111
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:16,861
where a guy can leave
with 10 grand in one night?

112
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,860
I can remember
hustling an old man

113
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,359
for a dime a game.

114
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,859
You looking
for action?

115
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:28,456
Maybe.

116
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:30,356
You Eddie Felson?

117
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,355
Who's he?

118
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:34,355
What's
your game?

119
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:37,554
You name it,
we shoot it.

120
00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:39,854
Look, friend.

121
00:11:39,854 --> 00:11:41,904
I'm not trying
to hustle.

122
00:11:41,904 --> 00:11:45,903
Don't try to
hustle me.

123
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:49,952
Okay. I'm Eddie Felson.

124
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:52,949
Got any straight pool
shooters here?

125
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:55,999
What kind of
straight pool game?

126
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:58,048
The expensive kind.

127
00:11:58,048 --> 00:12:01,948
Come here to play
with Minnesota Fats?

128
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:03,947
Yeah, that's right.

129
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:05,947
Want some free advice?

130
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:08,596
How much
will it cost?

131
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,946
Who are you,
his manager?

132
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:12,945
His friend?
His stooge?

133
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:14,945
He's my partner.

134
00:12:14,945 --> 00:12:16,745
You well-heeled,
partner?

135
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:18,992
We got enough.

136
00:12:18,992 --> 00:12:21,192
Go home.

137
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:23,491
Fats don't need
your money.

138
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:26,491
Nobody's beat him
in 15 years.

139
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:28,490
He's the best.

140
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,040
You got that
wrong, mister.

141
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,039
I am.

142
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,089
You just go ahead
and play him, friend.

143
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,638
Where can I find him?

144
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:43,635
Comes right in this poolroom
every night,

145
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:48,084
8:00 on the nose.

146
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:15,661
You shoot
a good stick.

147
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:17,011
Thanks.

148
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:20,010
Gee, you shoot
straight pool, mister?

149
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,010
Now and then.

150
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,707
You know how it is.

151
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:27,806
You're Minnesota Fats,
aren't you?

152
00:14:27,806 --> 00:14:27,956
You're Minnesota Fats,
aren't you?

153
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:31,306
They say Minnesota Fats
is the best

154
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:33,355
where I come from.

155
00:14:33,355 --> 00:14:35,355
Is that a fact?

156
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:39,304
They say old Fats
just shoots the eyes

157
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:41,304
right off them balls.

158
00:14:41,304 --> 00:14:44,353
Where do you
come from?

159
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:46,003
California. Oakland.

160
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:47,600
California?

161
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,650
Is your name Felson?

162
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,650
That's right.

163
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,899
I hear you've been
looking for me.

164
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,348
Yeah. That's right, too.

165
00:14:58,348 --> 00:15:00,048
Big John?

166
00:15:00,048 --> 00:15:04,047
You think this boy
is a hustler?

167
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:11,046
You like to gamble?

168
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:13,493
Gamble money
on pool games?

169
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:17,542
Let's shoot
a game of straight pool.

341
00:33:28,888 --> 00:33:32,885
15.

342
00:33:33,535 --> 00:33:37,534
125.

343
00:33:40,484 --> 00:33:43,833
Eddie?

344
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:47,782
Wake up, Eddie.

345
00:33:56,681 --> 00:34:00,728
We lose again.

346
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:13,675
[Bottle Falls]

347
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:37,718
This is all
we got left?

348
00:34:37,718 --> 00:34:41,718
That's all you got.
That's all we got left.

349
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:43,967
Willie,

350
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:47,964
give me
the stake money.

351
00:34:53,963 --> 00:34:57,012
Fats, I got
about $200 here.

352
00:34:57,012 --> 00:35:01,012
Game's over, Eddie.

353
00:35:03,111 --> 00:35:05,761
I got
about $200 here.

354
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:09,760
You can't run out on me.

355
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,007
You watch me.

356
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,050
Fats, come on.

357
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:45,049
Come on.

358
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:50,698
Hey, Fats?

359
00:35:58,946 --> 00:36:01,246
Eddie.

360
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:02,943
Eddie.

361
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:06,992
Eddie.

362
00:36:07,992 --> 00:36:11,991
Eddie.

363
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:27,120
I'm sorry, Charlie.

364
00:38:16,157 --> 00:38:20,156
Give me a towel,
will you?

365
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:06,293
<i>May I have
your attention, please?</i>

366
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:08,292
Ha ha ha!

367
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:12,291
Are you sure?

368
00:39:12,591 --> 00:39:15,291
Can I get you
something?

369
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:19,290
Later.

370
00:39:29,336 --> 00:39:32,285
Long wait for a bus?

371
00:39:32,285 --> 00:39:34,335
Yes.

372
00:39:34,335 --> 00:39:37,284
How long
you been waiting?

373
00:39:37,284 --> 00:39:38,634
What?

374
00:39:38,634 --> 00:39:41,684
How long have you
been waiting?

375
00:39:41,684 --> 00:39:45,683
Since 4:00.

376
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:49,680
Just a cup
of black coffee, please.

377
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,579
And ma'am,
wait a minute!

378
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:57,428
Would you like
another cup?

379
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:01,378
Fine. Thanks.

380
00:40:01,628 --> 00:40:05,627
What time's
the bus leave?

381
00:40:05,627 --> 00:40:07,276
What bus?

382
00:40:07,276 --> 00:40:08,976
Yours.

383
00:40:08,976 --> 00:40:13,023
8:00.

384
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:20,072
That wouldn't give us
much time, would it?

385
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:26,521
You're right.
I guess it wouldn't.

386
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:39,466
Hello and good-bye.

387
00:40:53,113 --> 00:40:57,112
Have a nice trip.

388
00:40:57,512 --> 00:40:58,862
Thanks.

389
00:40:58,862 --> 00:41:02,859
I will.

390
00:41:07,808 --> 00:41:11,758
Give it to me.

391
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,600
<i>6:00 bus toJersey City,
Alexandria,</i>

392
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,599
<i>Triangle,
and Williamsburg, Virginia,</i>

393
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,598
<i>loading on platform

394
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:55,595
How much
do I owe you?

395
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:59,594
It was paid for
by the lady.

396
00:42:03,543 --> 00:42:05,543
Give me some bourbon.

397
00:42:05,543 --> 00:42:07,542
J.T.S. Brown.

398
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:10,142
Check.

399
00:42:10,142 --> 00:42:11,742
Want a chaser?

400
00:42:11,742 --> 00:42:15,741
No.

401
00:42:28,886 --> 00:42:31,786
Have a nice trip?

402
00:42:31,786 --> 00:42:33,935
Fair.

403
00:42:33,935 --> 00:42:36,185
Can I sit down?

404
00:42:36,185 --> 00:42:37,684
Why not?

405
00:42:37,684 --> 00:42:41,734
We already know
each other's secrets.

406
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,430
Thanks for the...
for the breakfast.

407
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,429
Two ships passing
in the night

408
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:56,379
should always buy
each other breakfast.

409
00:42:56,379 --> 00:42:58,428
Can I buy you
another drink?

410
00:42:58,428 --> 00:43:01,028
Can I buy you
another drink?

411
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:04,777
Another one for me
and the lady.

412
00:43:04,777 --> 00:43:07,276
Check.

413
00:43:07,276 --> 00:43:08,974
You look different.

414
00:43:08,974 --> 00:43:10,824
More relaxed.

415
00:43:10,824 --> 00:43:12,373
The lights.

416
00:43:12,373 --> 00:43:14,073
And the scotch.

417
00:43:14,073 --> 00:43:16,073
You missed your bus.

418
00:43:16,073 --> 00:43:18,572
I wasn't
waiting for one.

419
00:43:18,572 --> 00:43:21,372
Why go
to the bus station?

420
00:43:21,372 --> 00:43:23,921
The same reason
you went.

421
00:43:23,921 --> 00:43:26,421
That hour
of the morning,

422
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:28,970
you haven't
got much choice.

423
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,917
I only live
three blocks from there.

424
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:37,116
Where do you live?

425
00:43:37,116 --> 00:43:38,466
Around.

426
00:43:38,466 --> 00:43:42,415
I know where you live.

427
00:43:42,515 --> 00:43:46,515
In a locker
in the bus station.

428
00:43:48,564 --> 00:43:52,163
What's it like
living in a locker?

429
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:53,763
Cramped.

430
00:43:53,763 --> 00:43:56,163
You always
drink like this

431
00:43:56,163 --> 00:43:58,560
so early in the morning?

432
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,609
You always ask
so many questions?

433
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:05,409
No, not always.

434
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:09,408
Sometimes I wake up,
and I can't sleep,

435
00:44:09,658 --> 00:44:11,658
not without a drink.

436
00:44:11,658 --> 00:44:14,607
The bars don't open
until 8:00.

437
00:44:14,607 --> 00:44:18,106
Mac over there
has faith in me.

438
00:44:18,106 --> 00:44:21,156
When I'm broke,
he trusts me.

439
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:23,653
Don't you
trust me, Mac?

440
00:44:23,653 --> 00:44:25,503
Check.

441
00:44:25,503 --> 00:44:27,452
When I'm not broke,

442
00:44:27,452 --> 00:44:31,152
I usually have
a bottle in my room.

443
00:44:31,152 --> 00:44:33,651
Then I sleep
very well.

444
00:44:33,651 --> 00:44:37,200
You talk funny,
but I like it.

445
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,450
I used to be
an actress.

446
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,999
What do you do now?

447
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:44,999
I'm a college girl.

448
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:48,246
Tuesdays and Thursdays
I go to college.

449
00:44:48,246 --> 00:44:51,696
You don't look like
a college girl.

450
00:44:51,696 --> 00:44:53,695
I'm the emancipated
type.

451
00:44:53,695 --> 00:44:55,495
Real emancipated.

452
00:44:55,495 --> 00:44:57,594
I didn't mean that.

453
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:00,694
You just don't
look young enough.

454
00:45:00,694 --> 00:45:02,243
I'm not.

455
00:45:02,243 --> 00:45:04,243
Why go to college?

456
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,592
Got nothing to do
on those days.

457
00:45:07,592 --> 00:45:11,092
What do you do
on other days?

458
00:45:11,092 --> 00:45:12,739
I drink.

459
00:45:12,739 --> 00:45:14,239
Hey!

460
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:17,788
No. No more.

461
00:45:17,788 --> 00:45:20,788
I'm getting sleepy.

462
00:45:20,788 --> 00:45:23,287
Thank you very much,
mister.

463
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,887
Eddie. The name's Eddie.

464
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,686
The name
should be Eddie.

465
00:45:28,686 --> 00:45:31,236
What should
my name be?

466
00:45:31,236 --> 00:45:34,185
Whatever you
like it to be.

467
00:45:34,185 --> 00:45:38,182
I like it to be
what it is... Sarah.

468
00:45:38,332 --> 00:45:40,332
That's a biblical name.

469
00:45:40,332 --> 00:45:43,781
You want to know
its meaning?

470
00:45:43,781 --> 00:45:47,730
I could always
get us a bottle.

471
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:56,279
No.

472
00:45:56,279 --> 00:45:58,278
Afifth of scotch?

473
00:45:58,278 --> 00:46:02,277
Do you want me to
step out in the alley?

474
00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:06,325
No.

475
00:46:06,325 --> 00:46:10,374
I'll take you home.

476
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:19,372
All right.

477
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:39,916
It's all right.

478
00:46:39,916 --> 00:46:41,915
I'm not drunk.

479
00:46:41,915 --> 00:46:45,915
I'm lame.

480
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:56,495
Why me?

481
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:15,039
Please.

482
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:17,038
Please!

483
00:48:17,038 --> 00:48:18,038
Please!

484
00:48:18,038 --> 00:48:22,037
You're too hungry.

485
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:37,582
Take it. It's yours.

486
00:48:42,531 --> 00:48:46,481
You can have this room
for $1.50 a night

487
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,630
or $7.00 by the week.

488
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,080
For the night.

489
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:55,079
In advance.

490
00:48:58,076 --> 00:49:02,075
<i>Clara Macy.</i>

491
00:50:28,602 --> 00:50:32,601
Bottle of beer.

492
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:37,200
Hey, mister.

493
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,498
Can I grab a cue?

494
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:42,247
You're Eddie Felson,
aren't you?

495
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,497
Who?

496
00:50:43,497 --> 00:50:47,446
I saw you play
at Ames the other night.

497
00:50:48,096 --> 00:50:50,096
I tell you what.

498
00:50:50,096 --> 00:50:53,395
I'll keep one hand
in my pocket.

499
00:50:53,395 --> 00:50:57,444
You're out
of our league.

500
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:04,391
What are you stuck for?

501
00:51:04,391 --> 00:51:08,390
Three. That's
enough for me.

502
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:12,089
Thank you.

503
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:15,389
Can I buy
you fellows a drink?

504
00:51:15,389 --> 00:51:17,388
Okay.

505
00:51:17,388 --> 00:51:20,388
Say, you know,
you shoot good,

506
00:51:20,388 --> 00:51:23,137
but you also
shoot lucky.

507
00:51:23,137 --> 00:51:27,086
Yeah, I shoot lucky.

508
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:04,009
Why did you do that?

to shave.

01:02:23,851 --> 01:02:27,850
Did you hold out
on me, Charlie?

676
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,550
How much?

677
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:34,499
How much?

678
01:02:36,299 --> 01:02:38,248
My 25%.

679
01:02:38,248 --> 01:02:40,298
Approximately
1,500 bucks.

680
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:42,296
Oh, you crumb!

681
01:02:42,296 --> 01:02:45,845
With that 1,500,
I could've beat him.

682
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:48,244
That's all I needed,
Charlie.

683
01:02:48,244 --> 01:02:50,294
Give me the money.

684
01:02:50,294 --> 01:02:51,893
To play Fats?

685
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,793
To play Fats!

686
01:02:53,793 --> 01:02:57,792
If you're coming back
on the road, okay.

687
01:02:57,842 --> 01:03:01,292
If you're giving it
to Minnesota Fats,

688
01:03:01,292 --> 01:03:02,841
nothing doing.

689
01:03:02,841 --> 01:03:05,891
You still don't see,
do you?

690
01:03:05,891 --> 01:03:09,388
You are nothing
but a small-time Charlie.

691
01:03:09,388 --> 01:03:12,387
You'd love to
keep me hustling.

692
01:03:12,387 --> 01:03:15,387
A couple more years
with me,

693
01:03:15,387 --> 01:03:19,386
you might make enough
to get a poolroom

694
01:03:19,386 --> 01:03:22,435
with a handbook
on the side.

695
01:03:22,435 --> 01:03:26,435
Is that when you
say good-bye to me?

696
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:28,334
That's what
you think?

697
01:03:28,334 --> 01:03:31,334
Yeah!

698
01:03:31,334 --> 01:03:34,381
All right.
That's what I want.

699
01:03:34,381 --> 01:03:37,380
A poolroom with
a little handbook

700
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,380
on the side.

701
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:42,929
I'm getting old.

702
01:03:42,929 --> 01:03:45,729
Lay down and die
by yourself.

703
01:03:45,729 --> 01:03:49,728
Don't take me with you.

704
01:03:53,927 --> 01:03:55,727
Just like that?

705
01:03:55,727 --> 01:03:59,774
Yeah,
just like that!

706
01:04:13,971 --> 01:04:18,020
Thanks for the drink,
Eddie's girl.

707
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:36,464
Here.

708
01:04:36,464 --> 01:04:37,864
Everybody,

709
01:04:37,864 --> 01:04:41,813
everybody wants
a piece of me!

710
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:51,859
Aren't you going to
have one?

711
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:59,508
What did he have to
come back here for?

712
01:05:04,907 --> 01:05:07,906
Come here.

713
01:05:07,906 --> 01:05:11,955
Come here!

714
01:05:50,644 --> 01:05:52,043
Going out?

715
01:05:52,043 --> 01:05:56,043
Yeah, for a little while.

716
01:05:57,642 --> 01:05:59,542
Ohh.

717
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:02,689
Hey.

718
01:06:02,689 --> 01:06:06,688
You okay?

719
01:06:30,732 --> 01:06:32,781
What are you writing?

720
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:35,031
Oh, it's a story,

721
01:06:35,031 --> 01:06:39,030
a story
I'm making up.

722
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:49,678
Give it to me.

723
01:06:49,828 --> 01:06:52,375
What's this
supposed to mean?

724
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:56,375
Give it back to me.

725
01:07:03,823 --> 01:07:06,123
What's this
supposed to mean?

726
01:07:06,123 --> 01:07:09,122
"We have a contract
of depravity.

727
01:07:09,122 --> 01:07:13,171
All we have to do
is pull a blind down."

728
01:07:20,218 --> 01:07:22,617
Write yourself
another story.

729
01:07:22,617 --> 01:07:26,616
Well, what else
have we got?

730
01:07:27,816 --> 01:07:30,166
We never talk
about anything.

731
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:32,865
We stay
in this room,

732
01:07:32,865 --> 01:07:36,265
and we drink,
and we make love.

733
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:37,864
We're strangers.

734
01:07:37,864 --> 01:07:40,214
What happens
when the liquor

735
01:07:40,214 --> 01:07:43,111
and the money run out,
Eddie?

736
01:07:43,111 --> 01:07:47,110
You told Charlie
to lay down and die.

737
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:51,659
Will you say that
to me, too?

738
01:07:52,909 --> 01:07:56,958
What happens, Eddie?

739
01:07:56,958 --> 01:08:00,258
Just find yourself
another rich old lover.

740
01:08:00,258 --> 01:08:04,257
And I'm sure
you'll help me.

741
01:08:07,006 --> 01:08:09,004
Are you waiting

742
01:08:09,004 --> 01:08:12,303
for me to cry?

743
01:08:12,303 --> 01:08:14,303
You bum.

744
01:08:14,303 --> 01:08:18,302
You poolroom bum!

745
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:30,000
Give me three cards.

746
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,047
Give me
a bottle of beer.

747
01:08:35,047 --> 01:08:37,046
How'd you make out?

748
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:39,996
I made
a couple of bucks.

749
01:08:39,996 --> 01:08:41,296
Poker game?

750
01:08:41,296 --> 01:08:42,995
Yeah.

751
01:08:42,995 --> 01:08:46,295
Is it open?

752
01:08:46,295 --> 01:08:47,994
Huh?

753
01:08:47,994 --> 01:08:49,294
It's open.

754
01:08:49,294 --> 01:08:51,294
What will you have?

755
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:55,343
Give me a beer.

756
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:02,039
Okay?

757
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:05,039
Sit down.

758
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:06,538
What's the limit?

759
01:09:06,538 --> 01:09:08,538
Half on a dollar.

760
01:09:08,538 --> 01:09:11,038
Give me 10 bucks worth.

761
01:09:11,038 --> 01:09:14,437
$10.

762
01:09:14,437 --> 01:09:16,436
Make it 20.

763
01:09:16,436 --> 01:09:20,486
$20.

764
01:09:21,086 --> 01:09:23,933
Cut.

765
01:09:23,933 --> 01:09:27,932
Deal.

766
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:38,080
Bourbon,J.T.S. Brown.

767
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,080
Two.

768
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,429
I'm buying.

769
01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:45,479
I thought
you only drank milk.

770
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:47,476
Only when I work.

771
01:09:47,476 --> 01:09:49,076
Yeah? Why?

772
01:09:49,076 --> 01:09:52,475
I like it.
It's good for you.

773
01:09:52,475 --> 01:09:55,475
Besides, you start
drinking whiskey gambling,

774
01:09:55,475 --> 01:09:59,124
it gives you an excuse
for losing.

775
01:09:59,124 --> 01:10:02,123
How'd you do
in the game?

776
01:10:02,123 --> 01:10:04,123
I lost 20 bucks.

777
01:10:04,123 --> 01:10:06,173
Poker's not
your game.

778
01:10:06,173 --> 01:10:07,522
What is?

779
01:10:07,522 --> 01:10:10,522
Pool.

780
01:10:10,522 --> 01:10:12,569
Are you being cute?

781
01:10:12,569 --> 01:10:16,219
I don't think anyone
shoots better pool

782
01:10:16,219 --> 01:10:19,568
than I saw you shoot
at Ames.

783
01:10:19,568 --> 01:10:21,517
You got talent.

784
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:23,517
So what beat me?

785
01:10:23,517 --> 01:10:25,167
Character.

786
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:27,066
Yeah, sure, sure.

787
01:10:27,066 --> 01:10:29,466
You're damn right
I'm sure.

788
01:10:29,466 --> 01:10:32,515
Everybody's got talent.
I got talent.

789
01:10:32,515 --> 01:10:36,514
You can't play poker
for 40 hours on talent.

790
01:10:37,163 --> 01:10:39,162
Minnesota Fats
isn't the best

791
01:10:39,162 --> 01:10:41,561
just because
he's got talent.

792
01:10:41,561 --> 01:10:45,161
Minnesota Fats has
more character than you.

793
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:47,210
I got drunk.

794
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:50,210
He drank as much
as you did.

795
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:53,209
Maybe he knows
how to drink.

796
01:10:53,209 --> 01:10:56,209
You think that's a talent,
too?

797
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:58,608
What do I do now?

798
01:10:58,608 --> 01:11:00,608
Lie down and bow?

799
01:11:00,608 --> 01:11:03,605
What do I do?
Go home?

800
01:11:03,605 --> 01:11:05,655
That's your problem.

801
01:11:05,655 --> 01:11:07,654
So I stay

802
01:11:07,654 --> 01:11:11,603
until I hustle up enough
to play Fats again.

803
01:11:12,253 --> 01:11:14,253
Maybe by that time,

804
01:11:14,253 --> 01:11:16,602
I'll develop myself
some character.

805
01:11:16,602 --> 01:11:18,602
Maybe by that time,

806
01:11:18,602 --> 01:11:21,252
you'll die
of old age.

807
01:11:21,252 --> 01:11:24,651
How much do you
think you'll need?

808
01:11:24,651 --> 01:11:26,301
1,000.

809
01:11:26,301 --> 01:11:28,248
No. 3,000 at least.

810
01:11:28,248 --> 01:11:31,248
He'll start
at 500 a game.

811
01:11:31,248 --> 01:11:34,597
He'll beat the pants
off you.

812
01:11:34,597 --> 01:11:37,296
That's the way he plays

813
01:11:37,296 --> 01:11:40,646
against a man
who knows the game.

814
01:11:40,646 --> 01:11:43,645
He might be
scared of you.

815
01:11:43,645 --> 01:11:45,645
That could
change things,

816
01:11:45,645 --> 01:11:48,644
but I wouldn't
count on it.

817
01:11:48,644 --> 01:11:50,644
How do you know?

818
01:11:50,644 --> 01:11:52,641
Nobody knows that much.

819
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:55,341
See that big car
outside?

820
01:11:55,341 --> 01:11:58,340
I get a new one
every year

821
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:01,339
because I make it my business

822
01:12:01,339 --> 01:12:04,339
to know
what guys will do.

823
01:12:04,339 --> 01:12:06,338
I made enough off you

824
01:12:06,338 --> 01:12:08,188
to pay for it twice.

825
01:12:08,188 --> 01:12:08,338
to pay for it twice.

826
01:12:08,338 --> 01:12:09,988
In that case,

827
01:12:09,988 --> 01:12:12,487
you owe me
another drink.

828
01:12:12,487 --> 01:12:13,987
Go ahead.

829
01:12:13,987 --> 01:12:18,034
Eddie? Is it okay
if I get personal?

830
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:21,034
What have you been
so far?

831
01:12:21,034 --> 01:12:23,583
Eddie,
you're a born loser.

832
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:26,033
What's that
supposed to mean?

833
01:12:26,033 --> 01:12:28,532
First time
in 10 years

834
01:12:28,532 --> 01:12:31,531
I ever saw Minnesota Fats
hooked,

835
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:34,081
but you
let him off.

836
01:12:34,081 --> 01:12:36,081
I got drunk.

837
01:12:36,081 --> 01:12:38,030
Sure you got drunk.

838
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:41,579
You had the best
excuse for losing.

839
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:44,077
Winning can be heavy, too.

840
01:12:44,077 --> 01:12:46,077
Drop that load,
too,

841
01:12:46,077 --> 01:12:48,626
when you got
an excuse.

842
01:12:48,626 --> 01:12:50,576
Feeling sorry
for yourself

843
01:12:50,576 --> 01:12:52,725
is a great
indoor sport

844
01:12:52,725 --> 01:12:54,475
enjoyed by all,

845
01:12:54,475 --> 01:12:56,524
especially
the born loser.

846
01:12:56,524 --> 01:12:58,624
Thanks for the drink.

847
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:01,623
Wait. Maybe I can help you.

848
01:13:01,623 --> 01:13:03,623
To do what?

849
01:13:03,623 --> 01:13:06,622
Get the 3,000.
Play Minnesota Fats.

850
01:13:06,622 --> 01:13:08,170
Why?

851
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:10,170
10 reasons,
maybe 15.

852
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:13,169
There's something
in it for me.

853
01:13:13,169 --> 01:13:14,669
How much?

854
01:13:14,669 --> 01:13:16,169
75%.

855
01:13:16,169 --> 01:13:17,668
For who?

856
01:13:17,668 --> 01:13:19,168
For me.

857
01:13:19,168 --> 01:13:22,167
Who do you
think you are?

858
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:23,667
General Motors?

859
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:27,066
How much do you
think you're worth?

860
01:13:27,066 --> 01:13:29,716
I'm putting up
the money.

861
01:13:29,716 --> 01:13:32,713
I get 75%
if you win.

862
01:13:32,713 --> 01:13:35,163
You think
I can lose?

863
01:13:35,163 --> 01:13:37,712
I never
saw you win.

864
01:13:37,712 --> 01:13:41,661
You saw me beat
Minnesota Fats for $18,000.

865
01:13:41,661 --> 01:13:43,661
When you hustle,

866
01:13:43,661 --> 01:13:46,660
at the end
of the game,

867
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:48,660
you count
your money.

868
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:51,709
That's how you
find out who's best.

869
01:13:51,709 --> 01:13:53,709
Why back me, then?

870
01:13:53,709 --> 01:13:56,708
Find yourself
a big poker game.

871
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:58,256
I like action.

872
01:13:58,256 --> 01:14:01,855
One thing I think
you're good for

873
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,505
is action.

874
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:05,555
Besides,
you got talent.

875
01:14:05,555 --> 01:14:08,754
Yeah, you already
told me that.

876
01:14:08,754 --> 01:14:12,753
Cut that slice down
to bite size,

877
01:14:12,753 --> 01:14:14,253
maybe we can talk.

878
01:14:14,253 --> 01:14:17,202
No. I don't make
bad bets.

879
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:19,252
75/25.
That's it.

880
01:14:19,252 --> 01:14:21,801
Kiss off.

881
01:14:21,801 --> 01:14:25,249
Hey, wait.

882
01:14:25,249 --> 01:14:28,848
What will you do
about the money?

883
01:14:28,848 --> 01:14:31,847
There are places.
I'll scuffle around.

884
01:14:31,847 --> 01:14:34,197
The word's out on you.

885
01:14:34,197 --> 01:14:37,246
You walk in
the wrong place,

886
01:14:37,246 --> 01:14:39,296
they'll eat you alive.

887
01:14:39,296 --> 01:14:41,645
When did you
adopt me?

888
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:45,645
I don't know when it was.

889
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:29,382
Hi.

890
01:15:29,382 --> 01:15:33,431
Hi.

891
01:15:38,328 --> 01:15:42,327
You lucky punk.
I quit you.

892
01:15:44,477 --> 01:15:46,476
You want in,
friend?

893
01:15:46,476 --> 01:15:49,026
How much
you playing for?

894
01:15:49,026 --> 01:15:53,025
$1.00 on the 5,
2 on the 9.

895
01:15:53,025 --> 01:15:55,575
I'll play you
a couple.

896
01:15:55,575 --> 01:15:57,074
Whew!

897
01:15:57,074 --> 01:16:01,074
That's it for me.

898
01:16:01,573 --> 01:16:03,571
You quitting, too?

899
01:16:03,571 --> 01:16:05,571
You're
a good player.

900
01:16:05,571 --> 01:16:08,070
How much
are you ahead?

901
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:09,570
A couple bucks.

902
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:12,919
I guess it's just
you and me.

903
01:16:12,919 --> 01:16:15,669
I guess it is, boy.

904
01:16:15,669 --> 01:16:17,718
Let's raise
the bet.

905
01:16:17,718 --> 01:16:21,018
2 on the 5,
5 on the 9.

906
01:16:21,018 --> 01:16:23,067
You know what, kid?

907
01:16:23,067 --> 01:16:25,617
I think
you're a hustler.

908
01:16:25,617 --> 01:16:27,116
Try me.

909
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:28,314
Shoot.

910
01:16:28,314 --> 01:16:32,263
Okay.

911
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:52,757
You sure you don't
want to quit?

912
01:16:52,757 --> 01:16:55,207
Let's cut
the small stuff.

913
01:16:55,207 --> 01:16:57,206
$100 freeze out.

914
01:16:57,206 --> 01:17:00,156
10 games.
10 bucks a game.

915
01:17:00,156 --> 01:17:02,205
Winner take all.

916
01:17:02,205 --> 01:17:04,655
Then we'll see
who quits.

917
01:17:04,655 --> 01:17:06,654
Okay, friend.
You're on.

918
01:17:06,654 --> 01:17:08,154
Call it.

919
01:17:08,154 --> 01:17:11,204
Heads.

920
01:17:11,204 --> 01:17:15,203
You win.

921
01:17:23,399 --> 01:17:26,598
You better not miss,
friend.

922
01:17:26,598 --> 01:17:28,698
I don't rattle, kid.

923
01:17:28,698 --> 01:17:30,698
But just for that,

924
01:17:30,698 --> 01:17:34,647
I'm going to
beat you flat.

925
01:17:39,746 --> 01:17:43,743
That's one.

926
01:17:47,342 --> 01:17:51,291
That's five.

927
01:17:51,341 --> 01:17:55,341
That's six.

928
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,340
That's 10.

929
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:02,339
You two-bit punk.

930
01:18:02,339 --> 01:18:06,338
Pay up.
100 bucks.

931
01:18:08,836 --> 01:18:10,836
You quitting, friend?

932
01:18:10,836 --> 01:18:14,885
Yeah,
I'm quitting.

933
01:18:30,382 --> 01:18:33,379
Why, you're a pool shark,
boy.

934
01:18:33,379 --> 01:18:35,379
A real pool shark.

935
01:18:35,379 --> 01:18:36,828
So's he.

936
01:18:36,828 --> 01:18:39,828
But you're better
than he was...

937
01:18:39,828 --> 01:18:40,878
much better.

938
01:18:40,878 --> 01:18:41,028
much better.

939
01:18:41,028 --> 01:18:45,027
There's your money, boy.

940
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:56,374
There's your money, boy.

941
01:18:58,872 --> 01:19:00,772
All right.

942
01:19:00,772 --> 01:19:02,271
Pool shark!

943
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:05,821
Wait a minute.

944
01:19:05,821 --> 01:19:09,820
Let's give this boy
his money.

945
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:14,419
We always pay
what we lose, boy.

946
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:32,513
Ooh!

947
01:19:33,013 --> 01:19:37,062

01:20:31,098 --> 01:20:33,097
I got beat up.

01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:42,143

I'm a loser?

A loser?

972
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:04,087
Yeah.

973
01:24:04,087 --> 01:24:07,086
I met this guy,
Bert Gordon.

974
01:24:07,086 --> 01:24:10,136
He said
I'm a born loser.

975
01:24:10,136 --> 01:24:11,735
Would he know?

976
01:24:11,735 --> 01:24:13,735
He knows a lot.

977
01:24:13,735 --> 01:24:16,134
Why did he tell you?

978
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:17,684
I'm not sure.

979
01:24:17,684 --> 01:24:19,634
He said some people

980
01:24:19,634 --> 01:24:22,531
look for an excuse to lose.

981
01:24:22,531 --> 01:24:25,881
What does he do,
this Bert Gordon?

982
01:24:25,881 --> 01:24:27,930
He's a gambler.

983
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:29,880
Is he a winner?

984
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:32,279
Well,
he owns things.

985
01:24:32,279 --> 01:24:35,329
Is that
what makes a winner?

986
01:24:35,329 --> 01:24:36,878
What else does?

987
01:24:36,878 --> 01:24:40,328
Does it bother you,
what he said?

988
01:24:40,328 --> 01:24:43,927
Yeah.

989
01:24:43,927 --> 01:24:46,976
Yeah,
it bothers me a lot,

991
01:24:48,974 --> 01:24:51,973
once at Ames

01:24:51,973 --> 01:24:53,973
and then at Arthur's...

993
01:24:53,973 --> 01:24:56,672
in that cheap,
crummy poolroom.

994
01:24:56,672 --> 01:24:59,672
Now,
why did I do it?

995
01:24:59,672 --> 01:25:02,671
I could've
beat that guy cold.

996
01:25:02,671 --> 01:25:05,021
He never
would have known.

997
01:25:05,021 --> 01:25:08,720
I just had to
show those punks

998
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:12,717
what the game is like
when it's great.

999

You know,

Anything can be great.

1001
01:25:18,016 --> 01:25:20,016
Bricklaying can be great

1002
01:25:20,016 --> 01:25:22,015
if a guy knows

1003
01:25:22,015 --> 01:25:24,715
what he's doing and why

1004
01:25:24,715 --> 01:25:27,614
and can make it
come off.

1005
01:25:27,614 --> 01:25:29,614
When I'm
really going,

1006
01:25:29,614 --> 01:25:32,763
I feel like
a jockey must feel

1007
01:25:32,763 --> 01:25:35,763
with all that speed
and power

1008
01:25:35,763 --> 01:25:37,460
underneath him.

1009
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:39,660
He's coming
into the stretch,

01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:41,659
the pressure's
on him,

1011
01:25:41,659 --> 01:25:45,709
and he just feels
when to let it go

1012
01:25:45,709 --> 01:25:47,708
and how much,

1013
01:25:47,708 --> 01:25:50,108
'cause he's got
everything working...

1014
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:51,757
timing, touch.

1015
01:25:51,757 --> 01:25:54,107
It's a real
great feeling

1016
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:56,156
when you're right

1017
01:25:56,156 --> 01:25:58,806
and you know
you're right.

1018
01:25:58,806 --> 01:26:02,753
It's like I got oil
in my arm.

1019
01:26:02,753 --> 01:26:05,753
The pool cue's
part of me.

1020
01:26:05,753 --> 01:26:08,102
It's got nerves
in it.

1021
01:26:08,102 --> 01:26:11,701
You feel the roll
of those balls.

1022
01:26:11,701 --> 01:26:14,151
You don't
have to look.

1023
01:26:14,151 --> 01:26:16,150
You just know.

1024
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:19,750
You make shots that
nobody's ever made,

1025
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:22,149
and you play that game

1026
01:26:22,149 --> 01:26:25,549
the way nobody's
ever played.

1027
01:26:25,549 --> 01:26:27,796
You're not a loser, Eddie.

1028
01:26:27,796 --> 01:26:31,795
You're a winner.

1029
01:26:33,145 --> 01:26:34,845
about anything.

1030
01:26:34,845 --> 01:26:38,844
I love you, Eddie.

1031
01:26:44,893 --> 01:26:46,892
You know,
someday, Sarah,

1032
01:26:46,892 --> 01:26:49,642
you're going to settle down,

1033
01:26:49,642 --> 01:26:51,941
and you're going to marry

1034
01:26:51,941 --> 01:26:53,939
a college professor.

1035
01:26:53,939 --> 01:26:57,738
You're going
to write a great book...

1036
01:26:57,738 --> 01:26:59,688
Maybe about me, huh?

1037
01:26:59,688 --> 01:27:03,687
<i>Fast Eddie Felson,
hustler.</i>

1038
01:27:06,936 --> 01:27:10,986
I love you.

1039
01:27:11,235 --> 01:27:13,585
You need the words?

1040
01:27:13,585 --> 01:27:15,985
I need them very much.

1041
01:27:15,985 --> 01:27:18,232
If you ever say them,

1042
01:27:18,232 --> 01:27:22,231
I'll never let you
take them back.

1043
01:27:44,675 --> 01:27:48,624
Are you glad?

1044
01:27:48,624 --> 01:27:52,623
Yes, I'm glad.

1045
01:28:13,717 --> 01:28:16,766
Hello, Eddie.

1046
01:28:16,766 --> 01:28:18,116
Hi.
How's business?

1047
01:28:18,116 --> 01:28:19,766
Slow.

1048
01:28:19,766 --> 01:28:21,765
Why the openhand bridge?

1049
01:28:21,765 --> 01:28:24,115
Something wrong
with your hand?

1050
01:28:24,115 --> 01:28:26,364
I had a little accident.

1051
01:28:26,364 --> 01:28:29,814
You seem to do okay
that way.

1052
01:28:29,814 --> 01:28:32,611
My game's 20% off,
maybe more.

1053
01:28:32,611 --> 01:28:35,111
Somebody step
on your hand?

1054
01:28:35,111 --> 01:28:38,110
A big creep
broke my thumbs.

1055
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:40,760
A man named
Turk Baker?

1056
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:43,059
You know everybody,
don't you?

1057
01:28:43,059 --> 01:28:45,859
Everybody who can hurt me.

1058
01:28:45,859 --> 01:28:49,108
Everybody who can help me,
I pay.

1059
01:28:49,108 --> 01:28:51,957
Where do I sign up?

1060
01:28:51,957 --> 01:28:55,157
First match
is Louisville, Kentucky.

1061
01:28:55,157 --> 01:28:57,954
I'll be there.

1062
01:28:57,954 --> 01:28:59,454
What happened to you?

1063
01:28:59,454 --> 01:29:01,603
My thumbs.

1064
01:29:01,603 --> 01:29:04,203
I don't mean
your thumbs.

1065
01:29:04,203 --> 01:29:06,202
Maybe I'm not

1066
01:29:06,202 --> 01:29:10,202
such a high-class piece
of property right now.

1067
01:29:10,652 --> 01:29:13,701
A 25% slice
of something big

1068
01:29:13,701 --> 01:29:17,500
is better than a 100%
slice of nothing.

1069
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:21,199
Hey, give us
a couple of drinks,

1070
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:22,697
will you?

1071
01:29:22,697 --> 01:29:26,696
J.T.S. Brown.

1072
01:29:33,195 --> 01:29:35,195
Good evening, sir.

1073
01:29:35,195 --> 01:29:38,194
Give us a nice
quiet table.

1074
01:29:38,194 --> 01:29:42,143
Yes, sir.
Right this way.

1075
01:30:03,737 --> 01:30:07,736
Would you like a drink
before dinner, sir?

1076
01:30:08,286 --> 01:30:10,786
Okay?

1077
01:30:10,786 --> 01:30:12,283
Sherry.

1078
01:30:12,283 --> 01:30:15,783
Very old.
Very dry.

1079
01:30:15,783 --> 01:30:18,732
Two.

1080
01:30:18,732 --> 01:30:22,781
Sherry?

1081
01:30:24,281 --> 01:30:26,280
It's a nice joint.

1082
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,280
You look very pretty.

1083
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:31,729
I feel pretty.

1084
01:30:31,729 --> 01:30:33,729
What's so funny?

1085
01:30:33,729 --> 01:30:35,829
Your tie.

1086
01:30:35,829 --> 01:30:38,776
I've never seen you
wear one.

1087
01:30:38,776 --> 01:30:42,775
Afirst time
for everything.

1088
01:30:50,874 --> 01:30:52,373
Oh, yeah.

1089
01:30:52,373 --> 01:30:56,372
That's great.

1090
01:30:58,572 --> 01:31:02,569
Excuse me, sir.

1091
01:31:18,866 --> 01:31:22,865
To you, Eddie.

1092
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:41,409
Thank you, sir.

1093
01:31:42,409 --> 01:31:46,458
What is it, Eddie?

1094
01:31:47,408 --> 01:31:49,458
Want another drink?

1095
01:31:49,458 --> 01:31:52,455
What do you
want to tell me?

1096
01:31:52,455 --> 01:31:56,454
I'll be leaving town
for a little while.

1097
01:32:00,454 --> 01:32:02,453
For how long?

1098
01:32:02,453 --> 01:32:04,453
Oh, I don't know.

1099
01:32:04,453 --> 01:32:06,552
A week? Ayear?

1100
01:32:06,552 --> 01:32:08,352
More like a week.

1101
01:32:08,352 --> 01:32:09,952
I'll be back.

1102
01:32:09,952 --> 01:32:13,001
Sure.

1103
01:32:13,001 --> 01:32:17,000
Let's go.

1104
01:32:38,044 --> 01:32:39,494
Taxi.

1105
01:32:39,494 --> 01:32:42,043
No, I want to walk.

1106
01:32:42,043 --> 01:32:46,090
Come here.
Come on.

1107
01:32:59,538 --> 01:33:03,537
You better get
some dry things on.

1108
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:19,582
Don't you want to know
where I'm going?

1109
01:33:19,582 --> 01:33:22,631
No.

1110
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:26,180
Yes. I want to know what for,

1111
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:30,130
but I don't want to ask.

1112
01:33:33,627 --> 01:33:37,126
I'm going to Louisville
with a friend

1113
01:33:37,126 --> 01:33:39,126
to make some money.

1114
01:33:39,126 --> 01:33:41,625
I need it, the money.

1115
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:44,675
I'll be leaving early
in the morning.

1116
01:33:44,675 --> 01:33:46,874
Leave now.

1117
01:33:46,874 --> 01:33:49,774
Oh, grow up.

1118
01:33:49,774 --> 01:33:51,673
Why should I?

1119
01:33:51,673 --> 01:33:55,273
I'm going to Kentucky
to play pool.

1120
01:33:55,273 --> 01:33:57,320
I need the money.

1121
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:59,970
I said I'd be back.

1122
01:33:59,970 --> 01:34:02,369
If you were coming back,

1123
01:34:02,369 --> 01:34:05,369
you wouldn't have
taken me out tonight

1124
01:34:05,369 --> 01:34:07,268
or bought this dress.

1125
01:34:07,268 --> 01:34:09,268
You're hustling me, Eddie.

1126
01:34:09,268 --> 01:34:11,267
I never hustled you,

1127
01:34:11,267 --> 01:34:14,217
even when I thought I was.

1128
01:34:14,217 --> 01:34:18,216
What do I do?
Sit here and wait?

1129
01:34:18,416 --> 01:34:21,865
You'll come back
and you'll love me,

1130
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:24,913
and then you'll
go away again.

1131
01:34:24,913 --> 01:34:28,812
Is that your
idea of love?

1132
01:34:28,812 --> 01:34:31,811
I got no idea of love.

1133
01:34:31,811 --> 01:34:35,861
Neither one of us
would know what it was

1134
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:40,360
if we saw it
coming down the street.

1135
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:43,909
I'd know it.

1136
01:34:43,909 --> 01:34:45,909
I'd know it.

1137
01:34:45,909 --> 01:34:49,906
What are you trying
to do to me?

1138
01:34:50,406 --> 01:34:52,405
I love you.

1139
01:34:52,405 --> 01:34:56,454
Well, what's your idea of love?
Chains?

1140
01:34:59,904 --> 01:35:03,903
No.

1141
01:35:08,952 --> 01:35:12,949
I made you up,
didn't I?

1142
01:35:14,449 --> 01:35:16,448
You weren't real.

1143
01:35:16,448 --> 01:35:20,398
I made you up like
everything else.

1144
01:35:20,398 --> 01:35:23,997
There was no
car crash, Eddie.

1145
01:35:23,997 --> 01:35:27,346
When I was 5,
I had polio.

1146
01:35:27,346 --> 01:35:29,946
The rich old man
is my father.

1147
01:35:29,946 --> 01:35:33,945
He walked out on us
when I was 7.

1148
01:35:34,445 --> 01:35:38,092
He sends me a check
every month.

1149
01:35:38,092 --> 01:35:40,941
That's how he buys his way

1150
01:35:40,941 --> 01:35:42,941
out of my life.

1151
01:35:42,941 --> 01:35:46,490
The men I've known...
after they left,

1152
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:48,990
I'd say they
weren't real.

1153
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:50,989
I made them up.

1154
01:35:50,989 --> 01:35:54,989
<i>I wanted you
to be real.</i>

1155
01:35:58,488 --> 01:36:01,487
I'm so scared, Eddie.

1156
01:36:01,487 --> 01:36:05,535
I'm scared.

1157
01:36:18,032 --> 01:36:20,082
Sarah Packard,
Bert Gordon.

1158
01:36:20,082 --> 01:36:24,081
Miss Packard,
how do you do?

1159
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:29,078
That brown one
is mine.

1160
01:36:29,078 --> 01:36:31,577
It goes in there.

1161
01:36:31,577 --> 01:36:35,577
I got it,
I got it.

1162
01:36:36,626 --> 01:36:39,126
You sure you're
comfortable, Miss...

1163
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:41,125
Packard.
Sarah Packard.

1164
01:36:41,125 --> 01:36:43,625
I have trouble
remembering names.

1165
01:36:43,625 --> 01:36:46,274
You want anything?

1166
01:36:46,274 --> 01:36:48,174
No, I'm fine.

1167
01:36:48,174 --> 01:36:50,624
You ever been
to Louisville

1168
01:36:50,624 --> 01:36:52,621
during derby week?

1169
01:36:52,621 --> 01:36:55,221
I've never been
to Louisville.

1170
01:36:55,221 --> 01:36:57,220
Lots of class.

1171
01:36:57,220 --> 01:37:00,170
See some of
the best-dressed,

1172
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:04,169
most beautiful women

James Findley's
very rich.

1174
01:37:10,218 --> 01:37:14,267
Grandfather left him 20%
of the tobacco company.

1175
01:37:14,267 --> 01:37:16,266
And he hustles pool?

1176
01:37:16,266 --> 01:37:18,264
He's a gentleman
gambler,

1177
01:37:18,264 --> 01:37:21,263
gets his kicks
playing with hustlers.

1178
01:37:21,263 --> 01:37:24,263
He's got an old
southern mansion.

1179
01:37:24,263 --> 01:37:26,712
Drinks 8-year-old
bourbon.

1180
01:37:26,712 --> 01:37:29,162
How good is he?

1181
01:37:29,162 --> 01:37:33,211
They say he's
one of the best.

1182
01:37:33,361 --> 01:37:36,860
You must have
confidence in me.

1183
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:39,260
I have confidence
in Findley.

1184

What's that mean?

1185
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:43,457
I'm confident
he's a loser.

1186
01:37:43,457 --> 01:37:45,807
You're only
half a loser.

1187
01:37:45,807 --> 01:37:48,206
The other half,
a winner.

1188
01:37:48,206 --> 01:37:50,206
Here, I got it.

1189

No, I pick up
all the tabs.

1190

Fats knew the game
was in the clutch.

1191
01:37:59,254 --> 01:38:00,953
He played it smart.

1192
01:38:00,953 --> 01:38:03,253
In my head,

1193
01:38:03,253 --> 01:38:06,302
I played that game
1,000 times.

1194
01:38:06,302 --> 01:38:07,350
Play it again.

Combed his hair.

Came back
all ready to go.

1200

You were through.

1201
01:38:20,298 --> 01:38:22,797
You saw
how he looked.

1202

All set to start
all over again.

1203

You know what
you were doing?

1204

You were waiting
to get beat.

I know.

I've been there

Doesn't your lighter
work, Mr. Gordon?

I forgot
all about it.

Fine.

Good. I don't like

Why did you
say that?

1220
01:39:17,832 --> 01:39:20,082
Mr. Gordon
meant no offense.

1221
01:39:20,082 --> 01:39:23,829
It was a figure
of speech.

You were right,

02:02:58,184 --> 02:02:59,534
Aah!

1501
02:02:59,534 --> 02:03:01,183
Eddie, stop!

1502
02:03:01,183 --> 02:03:02,583
Uhh!

1503
02:03:02,583 --> 02:03:04,683
Stop it!

1504
02:03:04,683 --> 02:03:08,630
[Bert Screaming]

1505
02:04:22,659 --> 02:04:26,608
Came to play pool, Fats.

1506
02:04:29,758 --> 02:04:32,757
That's good, Eddie.
For how much?

1507
02:04:32,757 --> 02:04:35,207
You name it.

1508
02:04:35,207 --> 02:04:37,106
$1,000 a game.

1509
02:04:37,106 --> 02:04:40,705
Let's make it
$3,000 a game, Fats.

1510
02:04:40,705 --> 02:04:42,505
Come on, $3,000.

1511
02:04:42,505 --> 02:04:46,504
That's my bankroll,
my life savings.

1512
02:04:46,704 --> 02:04:49,502
What's the matter, Fats?

1513
02:04:49,502 --> 02:04:53,151
If you beat me
the first game,

1514
02:04:53,151 --> 02:04:56,550
I'm on my way back
to Oakland.

1515
02:04:56,550 --> 02:05:00,549
Let's go.

1516
02:05:05,848 --> 02:05:07,848
Get on me, Bert.

1517
02:05:07,848 --> 02:05:11,847
I can't lose.

1518
02:05:12,545 --> 02:05:16,494
Willie.

1519
02:05:22,893 --> 02:05:24,543
Call it.

1520
02:05:24,543 --> 02:05:28,542
Heads.

1521
02:06:12,729 --> 02:06:16,178
How should I play that one,
Bert?

1522
02:06:16,178 --> 02:06:17,828
Play it safe?

1523
02:06:17,828 --> 02:06:21,677
You always told me
to play the percentage.

1524
02:06:21,677 --> 02:06:24,877
Well, here we go,
fast and loose.

1525
02:06:24,877 --> 02:06:28,324
1 ball, corner pocket.

1526
02:06:28,324 --> 02:06:32,323
Percentage players die broke,
too, don't they, Bert?

1527
02:06:40,771 --> 02:06:44,071
How can I lose?

1528
02:06:44,071 --> 02:06:48,070
12 ball.

1529
02:06:49,420 --> 02:06:52,317
I mean, how can I lose?

1530
02:06:52,317 --> 02:06:54,817
'Cause you were right, Bert.

1531
02:06:54,817 --> 02:06:57,816
It's not enough
to have talent.

1532
02:06:57,816 --> 02:07:00,815
You got to have character,
too.

1533
02:07:00,815 --> 02:07:04,815
4 ball.

1534
02:07:09,864 --> 02:07:12,913
Yeah, I sure got
character now.

1535
02:07:12,913 --> 02:07:16,911
I got it in a hotel room
in Louisville.

1536
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:21,609
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.

1537
02:07:21,609 --> 02:07:23,859
I'm shooting pool, Fats.

1538
02:07:23,859 --> 02:07:27,858
When I miss,
you can shoot.

1539
02:07:32,007 --> 02:07:36,006
5 ball.

1540
02:07:38,556 --> 02:07:42,553
14 ball.

1541
02:07:44,853 --> 02:07:48,902
4 ball.

1542
02:07:50,901 --> 02:07:54,901
That's the game.

1543
02:08:04,549 --> 02:08:08,546
Game.

1544
02:08:18,544 --> 02:08:22,593
8 ball.

1545
02:08:36,588 --> 02:08:40,587
13 ball.

1546
02:08:55,634 --> 02:08:58,082
I quit, Eddie.

1547
02:08:58,082 --> 02:09:02,081
I can't beat you.

1548
02:09:02,081 --> 02:09:06,130
Willie, give him the stake.

1549
02:09:07,130 --> 02:09:10,130
You got yourself
a pool player.

1550
02:09:10,130 --> 02:09:14,179
Preacher, give me my coat,
will you?

1551
02:09:15,678 --> 02:09:19,678
Where do you think
you're going?

1552
02:09:21,177 --> 02:09:25,125
Eddie?

1553
02:09:25,125 --> 02:09:29,124
You owe me money!

1554
02:09:30,673 --> 02:09:34,673
Just how do you figure that,
Bert?

1555
02:09:36,172 --> 02:09:39,572
What do you figure
I owe you?

1556
02:09:39,572 --> 02:09:40,671
Half.

1557
02:09:40,671 --> 02:09:43,171
In Louisville,
it was 75%.

1558
02:09:43,171 --> 02:09:47,169
Well, here it's half.

1559
02:09:51,417 --> 02:09:55,366
What if I don't pay you,
Bert?

1560
02:09:57,666 --> 02:10:01,615
You don't pay me?

1561
02:10:01,615 --> 02:10:03,665
You're going to get

1562
02:10:03,665 --> 02:10:07,364
your thumbs broken again.

1563
02:10:07,364 --> 02:10:11,413
And your fingers.

1564
02:10:11,713 --> 02:10:14,311
If I want them to,

1565
02:10:14,311 --> 02:10:16,610
they'll break your right arm.

1566
02:10:16,610 --> 02:10:20,659
Better pay him, Eddie.

1567
02:10:32,757 --> 02:10:36,006
So you figure
you're still my manager?

1568
02:10:36,006 --> 02:10:38,654
I'm a businessman, kid.

1569
02:10:38,654 --> 02:10:41,653
You got many games
lined up?

1570
02:10:41,653 --> 02:10:44,703
We'll make
a lot of money.

1571
02:10:44,703 --> 02:10:45,952
50%?

1572
02:10:45,952 --> 02:10:49,902
It don't have to be 50.
It'd be 30, 25.

1573
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:58,800
We really stuck
the knife in her.

1574
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:00,050
Aaah.

1575
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:03,447
We really
gave it to her good.

1576
02:11:03,447 --> 02:11:05,596
And if it didn't
happen in Louisville,

1577
02:11:05,596 --> 02:11:07,646
it'd happen
someplace else.

1578
02:11:07,646 --> 02:11:09,946
If it didn't happen now,
it'd happen in six months.

1579
02:11:09,946 --> 02:11:11,995
That's the kind of dame
she was!

1580
02:11:11,995 --> 02:11:13,995
But we twisted it,
didn't we, Bert?

1581
02:11:13,995 --> 02:11:16,794
Maybe that doesn't
stick in your throat

1582
02:11:16,794 --> 02:11:19,144
'cause you spit it out

1583
02:11:19,144 --> 02:11:21,693
just like everything else!

1584
02:11:21,693 --> 02:11:25,692
But it sticks in mine.

1585
02:11:26,192 --> 02:11:30,190
I loved her, Bert.

1586
02:11:30,739 --> 02:11:34,739
I traded her in
on a pool game.

1587
02:11:34,839 --> 02:11:37,888
That wouldn't mean
anything to you,

1588
02:11:37,888 --> 02:11:39,038
because who did you
ever care about?

1589
02:11:39,038 --> 02:11:40,787
because who did you
ever care about?

1590
02:11:40,787 --> 02:11:42,187
"Win", you said.

1591
02:11:42,187 --> 02:11:45,137
You don't know
what winning is.

1592
02:11:45,137 --> 02:11:46,786
You're a loser.

1593
02:11:46,786 --> 02:11:48,786
'Cause you're
dead inside.

1594
02:11:48,786 --> 02:11:51,835
You can't live
unless you make

1595
02:11:51,835 --> 02:11:54,783
everything else
dead around you!

1596
02:11:54,783 --> 02:11:57,032
Too high, Bert.

1597
02:11:57,032 --> 02:12:01,081
The price is too high.

1598
02:12:01,131 --> 02:12:04,781
If I take it,
she never lived.

1599
02:12:04,781 --> 02:12:08,830
She never died.

1600
02:12:08,830 --> 02:12:11,779
We both know
that's not true.

1601
02:12:11,779 --> 02:12:15,778
She lived.
She died.

1602
02:12:18,176 --> 02:12:20,176
Well, we'd better...

1603
02:12:20,176 --> 02:12:23,175
Tell your boys
they better kill me,

1604
02:12:23,175 --> 02:12:26,824
because if they
just bust me up,

1605
02:12:26,824 --> 02:12:29,824
put all those pieces
back together,

1606
02:12:29,824 --> 02:12:33,223
and then,
so help me God, Bert,

1607
02:12:33,223 --> 02:12:37,272
I'll come back here
and I'll kill you.

1608
02:12:38,272 --> 02:12:42,269
No.

1609
02:12:46,318 --> 02:12:50,367
All right.

1610
02:12:57,216 --> 02:13:01,215
All right.

1611
02:13:05,864 --> 02:13:09,912
Only, uh...

1612
02:13:09,912 --> 02:13:13,911
don't ever walk into
a big-time pool hall again.

1613
02:13:26,058 --> 02:13:27,958
Fat man.

1614
02:13:27,958 --> 02:13:29,508
You shoot a great
game of pool.

1615
02:13:29,508 --> 02:13:33,505
So do you, Fast Eddie.
