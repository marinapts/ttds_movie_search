1
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,760
"My name is Michelle McNally"

2
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:06,355
"The older child of an Anglo Indian
family based in Shimla"

3
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,434
"This story is about me and my teacher"

4
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,136
"A story about two people
left incomplete by god..."

5
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,967
"who have fought a battle with fate..."

6
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,371
"and made the impossible, possible"

7
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,744
"The world in my story is different..."

8
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,078
"where sound transcends into silence..."

9
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,788
"and light into darkness"

10
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,057
"This is my world"

11
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:42,566
"Where nothing can be seen nor heard"

12
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,629
"There is only one name for my world..."

13
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,486
"How long can you live in this darkness?"

14
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:06,956
"A few moments... hours... days?"

15
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:11,455
"For 40 years I've lived
in this darkness..."

16
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:15,428
"for 4 years I've given
my final B.A. Exam..."

17
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,301
"and for twelve years, I've gone
to this church, every Sunday"

18
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,703
"But that Sunday was special"

19
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,642
"I felt God would answer my prayers..."

20
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,110
"...my only prayer was..."

21
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:10,316
"...that my teacher
would come back to me"

22
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:18,063
"My prayers take long to reach God..."

23
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,157
"and He takes long in granting them"

24
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,804
"Even that Sunday I didn't
find my teacher"

25
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,031
"That evening Sara and I were
returning home..."

26
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,338
"...when suddenly..."

27
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,786
Wait...

28
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,495
Michelle, just wait for me, ok?

29
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:21,923
Oh my God!

30
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:28,289
MICHELLE!! MICHELLE!!

31
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,097
MICHELLE!!
Your prayers have been answered...

32
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,640
it's Debraj... he's there
near the fountain,

33
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:44,441
It's true, I promise, yes promise!
Come! Yes. Yes

34
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,007
"That day my teacher came back to me..."

35
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,505
"after 12 years I recognized him..."

36
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,874
"but he had forgotten everything..."

37
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:24,222
"even me"

38
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,926
"I am writing this story for him..."

39
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,561
"to my teacher - Debraj Sahai"

40
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,857
He doesn't remember anything?

41
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,455
Surely there must be something
we can do.

42
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:06,231
Sara, Mr. Sahai has Alzheimer's disease.

43
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,559
He has forgotten everything.
It's a very scary void.

44
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,301
Mr. Sahai has even forgotten his bed.

45
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:18,340
He has forgotten words,
even forgotten how to speak.

46
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,375
No doctor. I refuse to believe this...

47
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,677
he must remember something...

48
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:30,152
otherwise, after all these years,
to find him at our house...

49
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,959
and Mr. Sahai can
never forget Michelle.

50
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:39,187
Like a duster wipes the words
of a blackboard...

51
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:44,426
the disease has slowly
wiped out all his memories.

52
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:50,068
A few words or instances
might spark some memory...

53
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,370
but Alzheimer's has no cure.

54
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,071
What is Michelle doing?

55
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:00,350
She wants to read to him
her life story, in Braille.

56
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:07,353
Maybe by touching those words
he might remember something...

57
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:11,458
Michelle believes
that this miracle will happen.

58
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,063
Science doesn't believe in miracles.

59
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,606
It is impossible for him
to remember anything...

60
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,105
Impossible is one word that
Mr. Sahai never taught Michelle

61
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,848
And what you call impossible...

62
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,141
she will make possible.

63
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,578
"You were written in my destiny..."

64
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,583
"when I was 2 years old"

65
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:46,694
"That night suddenly
all happiness left us..."

66
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,334
"when my life entered a black vaccuum"

67
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:54,297
Michelle... my beautiful baby.

68
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,604
You're not sick anymore...
now you can play in water.

69
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:05,948
Look who has come! Papa!
What has the doctor told papa?

70
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:10,153
The doctor has said that
Michelle can't see or hear.

71
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,318
What did you say?

72
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,194
Our Michelle has gone
blind and deaf.

73
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,246
Look at me! Michelle!

74
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,184
"I was like an animal"

75
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,251
"Children loved playing pranks on me."

76
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,885
"So did God."

77
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,157
Mrs. Gomes! Who has tied
these cans on Michelle?

78
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,492
Shh... calm down Michelle,
calm down, baby calm down.

79
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,877
Fire! Fire! Mrs. McNally. Fire!

80
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,986
Help Mrs. McNally
Help. Mrs. McNally

81
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,425
For eight years... every day
a new accident

82
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,895
Hurting someone with a knife,
or breaking her own head!

83
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,827
She could have burnt
the whole house down.

84
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,969
With Michelle, we can never be happy.

85
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,433
What are you trying to say?

86
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,472
We will send her to an institution.

87
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,867
You mean a mental asylum?

88
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,245
How can you think that?

89
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,509
Cathy, I love her just as much.

90
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,116
But I still want to send her away.

91
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,086
She could cause irreparable damage.

92
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,884
No. I'm sorry. I don't agree.

93
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,561
There is no other solution.

94
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,322
I have no more patience left.

95
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,990
Sara! Oh my God!

96
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,671
Enough of this!
This child will be the death of us.

97
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,000
Paul, leave her!

98
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,168
She will not stay her another moment.
She almost... killed Sara.

99
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,384
Let her go!

100
00:10:53,552 --> 00:11:00,788
It's not her fault.
For God's sake!

101
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,124
Try and understand her.

102
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,694
She is suffering.

103
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,370
She is suffocating
in her own darkness.

104
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,033
My baby is suffering

105
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,346
There's this school in Dehradun...

106
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,048
where children like Michelle
are given special training.

107
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,390
If you let me,
I can write for a teacher...

108
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,495
We do not need a teacher...

109
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,425
We need a magician.

110
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:45,461
I don't want to hear anymore
that there is no cure for our Michelle.

111
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:46,933
One Last time Paul.

112
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,838
Maybe this is the teacher
who is the magician...

113
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,410
who will bring light
into our Michelle's life.

114
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:05,719
Debraj.

115
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:14,223
Ah, Ms. Nair. Come into the light.

116
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:19,229
What are you doing, Debraj?
You've just had your eyes operated.

117
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,601
And now what are you doing
holding a dying bulb?

118
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:27,207
This bulb is dying, Ms. Nair.
I need to stand by it

119
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:29,514
Am I right?

120
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,349
It's... it's dying.

121
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,616
You've been drinking again all day.
Haven't you, Debraj?

122
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,351
No, no...

123
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:49,566
Trying to find a sign for light.
For my deaf and blind children...

124
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,932
whose light has been
taken away from them.

125
00:12:54,006 --> 00:13:03,039
Light... LIGHT!

126
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:08,149
Just spell it, Debraj.
L.I.G.H.T. Light

127
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:12,051
Ah! The difference between
a teacher... and a magician.

128
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,886
You make me so angry sometimes Debraj.

129
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,129
Angry... Angry

130
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,154
Stop this bullshit

131
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:23,802
Bullshit Bullshit
Bull. Bull... Bull... shit Bull... shit

132
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:29,498
I do not have time for your talks.
I have some very important news for you.

133
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:35,374
Three guesses... if it's my termination
letter, put it in the third drawer.

134
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,549
If it's my last salary,
then it goes here in my pocket...

135
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,117
and if it's a notice to vacate this room
then throw it in the dustbin.

136
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,187
And. On your way to any of
these Ms Nair... could you please

137
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,450
fetch me my... eye-drops... from that
table over there. Thank you.

138
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,560
You may have three guesses Debraj...

139
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,423
but you have only one choice.
This letter.

140
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,596
An eight-year girl,
in Shimla, Michelle.

141
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:01,203
She can't see, she can't hear and
her parents don't understand her.

142
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,209
You are their last hope Debraj.

143
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,773
Otherwise they will put her
in the asylum.

144
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:11,845
You are the best teacher I know.
She needs a teacher, you need a job.

145
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:12,940
Look up

146
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,381
What do you see in this eye, Ms. Nair?

147
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,049
A great love for me.

148
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,488
You need to get your eyes checked.

149
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,893
And this one?
- Nothing

150
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,132
Her name is Michelle, isn't it?

151
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,469
I can see everything clearly.

152
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,340
A beautiful morning...

153
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,639
snow covered streets...

154
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,519
and that little girl...

155
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:53,548
a lost soul, directionless.

156
00:14:54,593 --> 00:15:00,395
I will give her wings
made of words, Ms. Nair.

157
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,933
I will teach her how to fly.

158
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:10,200
You couldn't do anything for yourself
and you're out to change others' lives

159
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,772
What happened, do your eyes hurt?

160
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:17,278
No, not my eyes...

161
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:23,145
my heart hurts...

162
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:37,028
listening to your cruel words...

163
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:46,308
it hurts... it hurts!

164
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:53,249
That after spending thirty years
in this school...

165
00:15:53,452 --> 00:16:01,325
I'm just an unseen unheard entity.

166
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:08,364
When I saw the school
for the last time...

167
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:14,765
my students were waving to me
in the wrong direction.

168
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:22,238
Waving to me in the
wrong direction Ms. Nair.

169
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:30,917
Oh! Lt... it... it... hurts...

170
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:34,853
it hurts.

171
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,131
"Destiny had put together
two strange soul- mates."

172
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,931
"I was left incomplete by god..."

173
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,870
"and you were
a battle - weary warrior."

174
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,645
"I was waiting in my darkness..."

175
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,275
"and you were bringing
the flickering light."

176
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,193
Right. Where's the girl?

177
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,794
This is all we needed.
An alcoholic teacher.

178
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:29,978
Mmmm... lnteresting.
Playful, bit of a brat.

179
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,712
And very pretty...

180
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:59,768
Yes. Yes... someone new...
a new buddy.

181
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:13,283
You like my glasses, don't you?
Well... you can have them...

182
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,426
here... there you go.

183
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:22,358
Happy?

184
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,973
Teacher... Tea... cher

185
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,777
Mr. Sahai, she understands?

186
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,006
No, she's just imitating me.

187
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,775
Good... good girl

188
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:49,886
What is she doing?

189
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,292
That's her sign for me.
Her mother

190
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:58,994
Oh, she's strong.
- I'm really sorry, Mr. Sahai

191
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,000
It's alright.

192
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,604
What's this!!
What is this bell for?

193
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,606
This is her identity

194
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,844
If she is lost.
We find her through its sound.

195
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,078
Take it off!!!!

196
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,749
When you think, that
your child is an animal...

197
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:26,763
what do you expect of others?
- It's your job to make her human.

198
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,161
How do you plan to do this?

199
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,697
These Fingers, Mr. McNally.

200
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,635
They're eyes of the blind...

201
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,634
...Voice of the mute...

202
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,299
poetry of the deaf.

203
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,246
Raise it to a sword...

204
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,643
...clench it for strength.

205
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,849
They can feed you and slap you,

206
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,350
They can point you towards God
and sometimes...

207
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,316
even the door.

208
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:59,397
It isn't as easy as you make it seem.
My daughter is like me...

209
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,866
stubborn...
- Insolent.

210
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,098
Not you. Your daughter

211
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,966
Lunch... will be served
shortly, Mr. Sahai.

212
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,570
Thank you. Mrs. McNally,
I'm so hungry.

213
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,676
Thank you Lord, for the bread
on our plate

214
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:26,449
for the air we breathe,
so fresh and pure.

215
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,825
For kindness and faith,
we are thankful to Thee.

216
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:35,457
Life's treasures and loved ones,
we hold and cherish.

217
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:46,910
No

218
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,212
Leave her, Mr. Sahai.

219
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,346
No. She has to learn how to behave.

220
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,344
Leave her hand Mr. Sahai!

221
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,819
This is the only reason
she hasn't learnt anything.

222
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,387
I will not tolerate this
in front of my guests.

223
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,463
Michelle eats like this.

224
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,899
Either she eats from her plate
or stays hungry. Am I understood?

225
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,538
Let her eat, you will
get another plate.

226
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,198
I... don't have a problem
with the plate, Mr. McNally.

227
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,037
The plate... is fine.

228
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,440
Let her go.
This is no way to teach.

229
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,276
Don't you feel pity
for this handicapped child?

230
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:30,385
Pity? And on this devil?
So she can do as she pleases?

231
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,784
No Mr. McNally,
I have pity on you...

232
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,959
and don't you dare
call her handicapped.

233
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:41,588
That's enough! Do not forget that you
are a paid servant in this house.

234
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,964
A Teacher! Mr. McNally... not a
paid servant... A paid teacher.

235
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,071
Leave her, right now.

236
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,638
No! You leave. All of you.

237
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,399
Mr. Sahai,
handling Michelle like this...

238
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,738
Mrs. McNally... you had said that
you'd cooperate.

239
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,810
All right. There's no point in
going on like this.

240
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,813
Let's give him a chance.
Let him do his job Paul.

241
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,647
Leave! Leave!

242
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,938
Martha, I'm really sorry,
for today's lunch

243
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,606
Don't worry Cathy.

244
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,935
He's a new teacher, that's why.
Isn't it, Paul?

245
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,106
Martha, I'll drop you home.

246
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,076
Paul, I will speak to Mr. Sahai...

247
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,349
I am very hungry;
I am going to eat...

248
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:45,627
and if you behave
then you can eat too.

249
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,837
Spoon!

250
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:09,248
No. You will not use
your hands to eat your food.

251
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,480
Open it, open it, open,
and open your hands.

252
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,988
Leave, leave it. Leave it.

253
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,822
Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit down.

254
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:26,001
You will not touch the food
with your hands.

255
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:27,671
Sit down... sit.

256
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:38,482
Stop it... stop it.
Just stop it, just stop it.

257
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:42,551
Stop it. Just stop it,
just just stop it. STOP IT.

258
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,017
Spoon. Spoon.

259
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,662
There is going to be no mother.
Your mother's not here.

260
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,765
Just your teacher.
Your teacher... just me

261
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:03,366
Where you going?
Where do you think you are going...

262
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,100
you are not going to go out...
don't...

263
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,880
wait... where do you think
you are running from?

264
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,442
You are not going out...

265
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:15,147
come along... with me... come on.

266
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:19,013
Come here... Sit.

267
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:26,625
You are going to eat your food
with a spoon. Come on.

268
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:31,197
You are going to eat your food
with a spoon, come on,

269
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,631
Open your mouth... Open it...

270
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:38,301
Open your mouth... Open, Open it...
open it. Open it, open it.

271
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:44,238
Yes. Yes. Yes... very good.

272
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:49,752
You little brat...

273
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,859
That should cool you down.

274
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,925
This is no way to teach...

275
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:11,534
We thank you Lord
for the food on this plate...

276
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:20,484
For the air we breathe.
So pure and clear.

277
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,521
For good health and peace.
For beauty and love.

278
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,555
Please don't make
a hasty decision

279
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,625
Paul I know that his way
of teaching is eccentric...

280
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,161
He's rude, he's arrogant,
and he's an alcoholic.

281
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,389
He's not fit to be a teacher.

282
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,726
But, you didn't see
what he did today...

283
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:40,564
Michelle actually ate today with...
- What do you want Cathy?

284
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,240
Get insulted in my own house?

285
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,376
No. - Then he's got to go.

286
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,378
I hope you understand.

287
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,021
The woods are lovely...
dark and deep

288
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,988
But I have promises to keep...
- Mr. Sahai...

289
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,255
And miles to go before I can
find the damn envelope. Ah, yes!

290
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,366
I need to talk to you, Mr. Sahai.
Are you busy?

291
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:14,232
No. Not at all. I was just writing
to my friend, about Michelle.

292
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:19,405
She has learnt her first lesson
today... etiquette, behavior.

293
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,112
That you do not possess.

294
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:28,947
Anyway I'll skip the pleasantries.
I want you to leave this house.

295
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:33,454
I will not leave without
completing my job.

296
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:36,352
I've only just started.
Still a long way to go. You know.

297
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,792
I don't like the way you teach.

298
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,796
And I don't like your interference.

299
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:49,268
This is your train ticket... Cheque.
And your termination letter.

300
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:58,212
We don't need you anymore.
You're taking the first train tomorrow.

301
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,043
And Michelle takes the next
to the mental asylum?

302
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,156
Now she's deaf blind and also
mentally retarded.

303
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,723
My daughter... is my responsibility.

304
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:12,260
And mine too, Mr. McNally.
You do understand that this will...

305
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,064
destroy her completely.

306
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:20,899
Train will leave exactly at seven.

307
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:27,069
And please... put this back
where it belongs.

308
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,041
Goodnight.

309
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,214
Goodnight!

310
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,481
Mr. Sahai must have left by now.

311
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:47,162
We'll talk about Michelle
after I return.

312
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:02,810
What is happening in this house?
Mrs. Gomes!

313
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,650
What is going on here?
This is ridiculous.

314
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,986
Mrs. Gomes, I don't understand what
is going on in this house today.

315
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,750
Good morning, Mrs. McNally.
And how are you today?

316
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,395
Mr Sahai?
We thought you would have left.

317
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,531
Just shifting rooms Mrs. McNally.
I never leave my work incomplete.

318
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:22,700
What do you want?

319
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:27,268
Same thing you want... that
Michelle becomes independent.

320
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,531
And for that, I need time.

321
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,005
You know that Paul...

322
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,270
Has gone out for twenty days. And those
twenty days belong to Michelle and me.

323
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,277
Now, don't say No, Mrs. McNally.

324
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:42,078
No!! It's not possible. You won't
take advantage of Paul's absence.

325
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,454
Oh my God!! Oh my God!!
I don't believe this!

326
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,520
This is ridiculous.
I don't believe this!

327
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,721
What have you done?
This is Paul's study...

328
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,365
Now this will be Michelle's study.

329
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,332
Mrs. Gomes!!! Put that back!
- No, Ma'am, he's right!

330
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:02,506
Oh ho! So the servants also
listen to you now!

331
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,401
Who are you to take over my house?

332
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,301
Michelle's teacher.

333
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,914
Were... were Mr. Sahai,
not anymore.

334
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:17,214
I am your last hope.

335
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:22,018
If I leave today
then after a few days...

336
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,191
Michelle will reach the asylum.

337
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:29,025
Mr Sahai... Mr Sahai!

338
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:29,993
Yes?

339
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,095
As long as I live, my daughter
will never enter the asylum.

340
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:36,702
Do you understand?

341
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,277
My mother always...

342
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,041
said the same thing.

343
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,112
That as long as I live...

344
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,654
my daughter will never leave me.

345
00:29:54,626 --> 00:30:00,792
But one day, she herself...

346
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,735
dragged her to the asylum.

347
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:23,646
And she got lost behind
the asylum's iron doors.

348
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:33,423
Michelle is deaf and
blind, Mrs McNally!

349
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,498
She is not mentally retarded!

350
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:46,708
She need to recognize words...

351
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:52,247
every thing that she touches,
that she eats...

352
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:59,780
has a name; which has a meaning.
I will teach her to speak...

353
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:03,456
through signs.

354
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:10,362
Till she is secure in her house,
this can't happen.

355
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:13,594
That's why!

356
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:15,463
Firstly...

357
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,640
I will have to change
this part of the house.

358
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:24,406
Everything should be new for her.

359
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:28,317
No papers, no books...
Only empty walls.

360
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,952
I'll even change
the smell of this room.

361
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,850
Secondly, only I will have
a right over Michelle.

362
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,456
She will rely only on me!

363
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,786
Third thing, no one including you
will be allowed here.

364
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,828
No, no no... don't shake your head!
Look at me... look!

365
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:44,631
It's difficult but it will
have to be done for Michelle.

366
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,899
Fourth thing, all I want is
time and trust.

367
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,434
No salary, no allowances,
nothing and...

368
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,105
no alcohol

369
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,078
And the fifth thing...

370
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:06,585
so, when do I get
charge of my student?

371
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,393
This evening.

372
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:26,703
You know. Mrs. McNally,
I wish I could sing...

373
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:31,644
but my singing is so... pathetic.

374
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:55,271
Dear Ms. Nair,
I have good news.

375
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:05,340
You will be unhappy to know that
the magician is at work

376
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:10,686
Today is Michelle's first day...

377
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:15,484
Mr. Sahai...
- In school. Ah!

378
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,259
Your student.

379
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,421
You kept your promise, Mrs. McNally

380
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:29,234
School has started,
and parents are not allowed.

381
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,429
So you should leave.

382
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,047
I have never left her alone.

383
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:43,876
Please take care of her.
Don't be harsh on her

384
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,011
No.

385
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,522
She is looking for me.
- Yes. I know.

386
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,395
She's going to come to you now.
Leave, Mrs. McNally.

387
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,464
Please leave. Get back.

388
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,907
No, I can't take this...
- 20 days!

389
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:08,970
You cannot touch her for 20 days.
- But its time for her to eat.

390
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,374
Yes I know Mrs. McNally.
You must leave now.

391
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,572
Please. Please. Can I?
- I said leave.

392
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:32,226
NO! No. No more mother.
No more father. Just me.

393
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,398
Me, your friend. Your Friend.

394
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:42,376
Look see see ya ya, your teacher.
Friend. Friend!

395
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:08,096
The magic has begun, Ms. Nair!
The magic!

396
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,370
I will change her life.

397
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:15,743
The magic has begun!
Magic!

398
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:39,134
Wake up, Miss... Michelle McNally.
We all pass through this darkness

399
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,735
Once in which you are living.

400
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:48,139
So don't remain in the dark.

401
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:53,516
Come into the light!
Light. Light.

402
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:58,521
Yes! Yes! Yes! Light!

403
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,492
The alphabets for the world start
with A, B, C, D, E but yours...

404
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:09,623
start with B, L, A, C, K...

405
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:15,197
black, black, black

406
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:21,177
Your alphabets, your world
are different Michelle.

407
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:25,713
You are different, you are, you are,
and you are different...

408
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:30,116
and are proud that you're different.

409
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:49,201
Here. This is cake.
Yes cake,

410
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,072
C. Cake, C.A.K.E.

411
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:59,305
Cake. C.A.K.E. Cake. Cake.

412
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:05,147
C.A.K.E. Spell it.
Spell it spell... cake

413
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,654
cake on my hands.
Spell it. Spell it.

414
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,159
Don't you dare touch the cake!

415
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,569
Mrs. McNally, could you...

416
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:32,115
Mrs, Mrs McNally,
could you get some light?

417
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,112
I'm coming! I'm coming.

418
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,210
Oh God! Is Michelle all right?

419
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,115
Can you get some light? Oh. Oh!

420
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,083
Mr. Sahai! Mr. Sahai

421
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,959
Good evening Mrs. McNally
- Do you need any help?

422
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,428
Do I look... as though
I need some help?

423
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,597
Well, that looked
like a knockout to me.

424
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,804
Knockout, Knockout yes.

425
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:07,114
Eyes are not important
as compared to light.

426
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,419
I have learnt this,
while teaching Michelle.

427
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:14,489
In darkness, even eyes are of no use.

428
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:25,396
The first round was a knock out.
But the next round will be mine.

429
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,165
Good luck to you, Mr. Sahai.
Good luck.

430
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,303
Come along, yes,
come along... Here!

431
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:41,184
This is water. No, no...
don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

432
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:44,445
Mr. Sahai... - Yes?

433
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,453
Michelle is scared of water.

434
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,593
And I want to take this
fear out of her mind.

435
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:56,193
In five days, she will be swimming.
Round Two has begun.

436
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,334
Hey! Where are you going?
Come here.

437
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,596
Where are you going?
Come back...

438
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:07,204
careful, careful.
Careful now. Watch it! Watch it!

439
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:11,204
Watch out!
I told you to be careful.

440
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:15,013
Calm down. Calm down, calm down.
This is a thorn.

441
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:32,634
Balm, balm.

442
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,963
To soothe the pain.

443
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,680
Your first handshake, Mr. Sahai.

444
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,988
Yes, we're friends now.

445
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:02,830
And... my first flying kiss.

446
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:11,398
She needs to learn that
she is destined to thorns.

447
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,980
Those very thorns that adorned
Jesus's crown.

448
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,015
Right Mrs. McNally?

449
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:30,917
Yes!

450
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,711
"I was slowly understanding
relationships..."

451
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,279
"between a thorn and pain..."

452
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,051
"between water and thirst..."

453
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,620
"but one relationship
was still strange to me..."

454
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:02,892
"of names and meanings."

455
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:03,787
Bird... bird... bird

456
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:16,766
Ball. B.A.L.L.
Ball. Ball... ball...

457
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:36,586
W.A.T.E.R.

458
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,260
Water. Water... water

459
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,931
SPOON

460
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:53,637
This is... Napkin...

461
00:41:57,047 --> 00:42:00,346
No. No. This is not spoon

462
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:07,954
This is... napkin, Napkin...
Say ' Napkin'.

463
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,390
Ah! I am fed up.

464
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:25,404
No, Mrs. McNally, I will not
allow you to take Michelle yet

465
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:30,576
She hasn't learnt anything yet.
She knows words, but not the meanings.

466
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,881
She still calls napkin, spoon.
It's still a long way to go, you know

467
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:37,247
How much longer Mr. Sahai?
Nineteen days have passed

468
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:40,423
The promise was for 20 days,
I still have a few hours

469
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,615
What can happen in a few hours?

470
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:46,887
Knowledge can come in a flash Mrs. McNally.
It's like lighting a candle...

471
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,932
Once this candle is lit, the whole
house will be filled with light.

472
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,998
Believe me, this miracle
can happen any time...

473
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:57,503
And Paul can come at any moment.
I'm really very sorry.

474
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:02,745
I will come to get Michelle tomorrow.
At sunrise

475
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:09,251
And I shall pray there is
no sunrise tomorrow, Mrs McNally

476
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,279
Good night

477
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:29,762
What?

478
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:35,143
You've made a fine young lady
out of my Michelle!

479
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,413
Thank you.

480
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:02,067
Thank you.

481
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:29,129
Spoon...

482
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:42,802
Try and understand Michelle,
every word has a meaning.

483
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,976
And without words, you will
never come out of darkness.

484
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,617
You will never be able
to see the light!

485
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,481
You will you will never be
able to see the light.

486
00:44:52,523 --> 00:45:01,898
They will put this bell around you
and call you a cow. C.O. W... cow.

487
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,426
You will become an animal Michelle.
Just an animal

488
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:06,193
Michelle...

489
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,671
They will put you in an asylum.

490
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,637
And this time
I won't let this happen.

491
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:16,609
You will have to learn Michelle.
Are you listening?

492
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,874
You are my last hope.
Michelle, Michelle...

493
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,951
Michelle, are you listening?
- You'll have to leave now Mr. Sahai.

494
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:25,713
No, I am not going to
leave Mrs. McNally

495
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,748
I will not give up so easily.

496
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,892
I have kept my promise.
Now it's your turn.

497
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:33,586
But it's not yet over Mrs. McNally.
There are still a few minutes left.

498
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:36,493
Paul can come at any moment.
Mr. Sahai. I'm helpless

499
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,167
Yes. Mrs. McNally.
But she has to learn.

500
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,359
Mr. Sahai...
- She has to learn...

501
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:45,508
that the hand she is holding has a name.
That you are mother, mother...

502
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,905
M.O.T.H.E. R... mother.

503
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,249
And that is FATHER.

504
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:03,086
Paul, I was just...
- Leave, Mr. Sahai.

505
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,852
Dear Ms. Nair, you will be
delighted to know...

506
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:37,118
that after having spent 20 days
with little Michelle, I have failed.

507
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:42,393
However, if you're smiling at the
thought of looking into my eyes again...

508
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,624
you are terribly mistaken.

509
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,239
Mrs. Gomes, will you stop her?

510
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:01,146
Let her be Mr. Sahai.
She's very happy today

511
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:07,751
No! Stop it Michelle.
You little brat.

512
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,258
I am not going to allow you
to do this to me.

513
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,497
I might have been asked to leave...

514
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:18,395
but I am not going to leave you
to behave like this.

515
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,840
Stop it Michelle.
Stop it!

516
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:28,603
You won't forget what I've
taught you in 20 days... sit down

517
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:29,278
Please leave her Mr. Sahai,
let her be.

518
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,639
Sit... sit down.

519
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:36,684
You will use this napkin on your
neck and use a spoon... to eat.

520
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:39,185
Mo you are not going to throw...

521
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:03,745
Come on, Come here...

522
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:08,247
You brat... you want to
throw water at me!

523
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,780
Let me teach you what water is!
Come here! What water is, come on!

524
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:19,490
This is water... water... water...

525
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:24,497
Give me your hand... This is woah...
Water... water... Understand?

526
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:25,326
Woah!!

527
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:30,329
Woah!

528
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:54,316
Water... it's water...

529
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:59,689
W.A.T.E.R.

530
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:23,511
Mrs. McNally!!!

531
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:36,933
Yes... this is 'Grass'.
G.R.A.S.S. Spell it...

532
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:42,060
Very good... Very good...
Mrs. McNally!!!

533
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:50,646
That's 'FLOWER' flower...
flower... F.L.O.W.E. R... flower.

534
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:56,884
Mrs. McNally!! Mr. McNally!!
Mr. McNally!! Mr. McNally!!

535
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,991
What's wrong Mr. Sahai?
Is Michelle all right?

536
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:05,889
Michelle. Michelle she...
Mrs. McNally. She knows, she knows.

537
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,120
She knows the meaning of words.

538
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:10,356
She actually. Actually
knows the meaning of words.

539
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,330
Look. Look!

540
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:20,333
Yes, Michelle...
Mother. Mother...

541
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:38,551
Maa...

542
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:53,506
Mother

543
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:55,269
Maa...

544
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,376
Once more

545
00:51:59,249 --> 00:51:59,977
Ma...

546
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:06,482
Pa... Pa...

547
00:52:47,303 --> 00:52:53,731
This is 'Teacher'. "Tea... cher"

548
00:52:57,714 --> 00:53:06,679
Tee... Tee

549
00:53:08,057 --> 00:53:10,423
Yes... Yes

550
00:53:10,727 --> 00:53:12,854
Yes, he's your Tee

551
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:32,544
Dear Ms. Nair...

552
00:53:38,555 --> 00:53:40,147
You'll be happy to know...

553
00:53:43,259 --> 00:53:50,495
that I have... I have...

554
00:54:18,194 --> 00:54:21,391
"That day you had won your
first battle over my darkness."

555
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:24,963
"But today you don't
remember anything."

556
00:54:26,469 --> 00:54:28,403
"Now I will fight
against your darkness."

557
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:33,903
"I'll teach you everything
you taught me"

558
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:37,562
"Water. The first word
that you taught me..."

559
00:55:38,141 --> 00:55:40,575
"and after that..."

560
00:55:41,577 --> 00:55:47,482
"you typed every little
detail on my hand..."

561
00:55:47,984 --> 00:55:51,647
"like a maestro playing a symphony"

562
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:55,519
Cathy!

563
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,187
Martha... Martha!
When did you return from London?

564
00:55:59,395 --> 00:56:03,354
Oh! It's so good to see you.
Merry Christmas.

565
00:56:05,668 --> 00:56:09,229
Mr. McNally...
- Coming, Mr Sahai. Just a moment

566
00:56:10,073 --> 00:56:15,033
I'd like you to meet Mr. Fernandez,
principal of the King Edward University.

567
00:56:15,244 --> 00:56:17,735
I want Michelle to study
in their college

568
00:56:17,947 --> 00:56:19,710
It's an honor to meet you,
Mr. Fernandez.

569
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:20,541
It's a pleasure sir.

570
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:22,711
I don't believe how time
has passed, Martha

571
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:26,480
Let me prove it to you...
Hello... Come

572
00:56:30,026 --> 00:56:35,020
Did you recognize her?
My younger daughter, Sara

573
00:56:35,732 --> 00:56:38,633
Sara, this is aunt Martha,
an old friend of mine

574
00:56:38,835 --> 00:56:39,301
Oh! Hello, aunt Martha.
I've heard so...

575
00:56:39,502 --> 00:56:41,902
But where is my dear Michelle?
I can't wait to see her

576
00:56:42,105 --> 00:56:43,868
Ah Michelle.
Have you seen Michelle?

577
00:56:44,507 --> 00:56:50,377
Err! Yes... I think
she's inside, excuse me.

578
00:56:53,049 --> 00:56:54,209
Come... we'll go look for her.

579
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,778
Ah! There she is

580
00:58:21,504 --> 00:58:25,406
Mr. Sahai. Look at that girl.
She can't hear or see,

581
00:58:25,608 --> 00:58:28,600
And still... just look at her,
it's wonderful.

582
00:58:30,646 --> 00:58:32,136
That's Michelle McNally...

583
00:58:34,784 --> 00:58:38,686
the girl I was talking about.
- That's impossible Mr. Sahai.

584
00:58:38,888 --> 00:58:42,824
Impossible is a word that I have
never taught her Mr. Fernandez.

585
00:58:43,392 --> 00:58:45,587
There are special schools
for such children...

586
00:58:46,095 --> 00:58:48,427
where they are taught many things.

587
00:58:50,132 --> 00:58:54,034
To make baskets, weave carpets...

588
00:58:55,338 --> 00:59:00,366
Have you heard of a girl like Michelle
getting admission in a normal college?

589
00:59:00,576 --> 00:59:03,602
No, but I would love to.

590
00:59:03,813 --> 00:59:06,145
How will she understand the lectures?

591
00:59:06,349 --> 00:59:11,446
I will sit with her in the classroom.
She will learn everything through signs

592
00:59:11,687 --> 00:59:13,882
Every word, every letter.

593
00:59:16,158 --> 00:59:21,994
Michelle... meet your Principal

594
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:33,602
Yes yes... I've told him... you
want admission in arts, not science

595
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:38,674
Mr. Sahai I will have to consult
the trustees on this.

596
00:59:38,881 --> 00:59:43,978
You get few chances for good deeds.

597
00:59:44,554 --> 00:59:47,546
And I hope that you will
not lose this opportunity.

598
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,219
Cheers?

599
00:59:53,896 --> 00:59:59,528
Mr. Sahai, you know this university
is for normal students.

600
01:00:00,069 --> 01:00:02,697
But because of your faith
in Michelle...

601
01:00:02,905 --> 01:00:04,839
and because we believe
you are a good teacher...

602
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:08,238
We will interview Michelle.
- Thank you.

603
01:00:08,511 --> 01:00:10,877
But today, you cannot
interpret for Michelle.

604
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,411
We have called a special teacher,
who doesn't know either of you.

605
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:17,845
She will interpret.

606
01:00:18,054 --> 01:00:20,750
They will interview you.
Another interpreter, not me, ok?

607
01:00:27,897 --> 01:00:29,364
Ah, there she is.

608
01:00:33,536 --> 01:00:34,093
Mrs Nair?

609
01:00:34,737 --> 01:00:37,205
Welcome Ms. Nair, meet Mr. Sahai.

610
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,202
Hello, Ms. Nair.
- Hello.

611
01:00:39,408 --> 01:00:40,534
Light

612
01:00:50,653 --> 01:00:53,713
Are you ready for the interview?

613
01:00:56,092 --> 01:00:57,116
We're ready, Sir.

614
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:02,655
Why does she want to study?

615
01:01:03,132 --> 01:01:05,464
Why do you want to study?

616
01:01:07,169 --> 01:01:10,400
I want to study... and learn...

617
01:01:10,973 --> 01:01:16,775
so that I may live with dignity,
with independence... and to be alive.

618
01:01:17,613 --> 01:01:19,240
How many oceans are
there in the world?

619
01:01:19,448 --> 01:01:22,508
How many oceans are
there in the world?

620
01:01:24,086 --> 01:01:30,924
For me every drop of water is an ocean

621
01:01:31,127 --> 01:01:35,587
She is not answering my question.
How many oceans are there in the world?

622
01:01:35,798 --> 01:01:39,256
They want a straight answer
to their question

623
01:01:46,108 --> 01:01:50,101
If we are in India,
on which side will America be?

624
01:01:50,312 --> 01:01:52,712
If you are in India,
which side is America?

625
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:19,470
The world is round.
So America can be on any side.

626
01:02:22,244 --> 01:02:26,146
What does knowledge mean to her?
- What does knowledge mean to you?

627
01:02:29,018 --> 01:02:31,578
Knowledge... is everything

628
01:02:32,521 --> 01:02:40,394
Knowledge is spirit, wisdom,
courage, light, sound.

629
01:02:42,064 --> 01:02:45,227
Knowledge is my Bible, God...

630
01:02:46,702 --> 01:02:47,828
Tee!

631
01:02:48,337 --> 01:02:53,934
...knowledge is my teacher
- Bravo! Excellent.

632
01:02:59,715 --> 01:03:01,182
Congratulations, Mr. Sahai.

633
01:03:01,851 --> 01:03:05,184
Your student is now a
part of our university.

634
01:03:10,392 --> 01:03:14,021
Thank you... Thank you

635
01:03:22,571 --> 01:03:23,868
I answered every question they asked.

636
01:03:24,974 --> 01:03:30,139
Michelle looks so happy today Paul.
Can't stop talking about the interview

637
01:03:31,413 --> 01:03:33,540
She hasn't stopped smiling all day.

638
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:38,152
Why not? A girl who couldn't
sit at the dining table...

639
01:03:38,988 --> 01:03:44,051
has a seat in the university today.
Unbelievable.

640
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:51,223
Can you imagine? Can you imagine the day
when we see Michelle as a graduate?

641
01:03:51,834 --> 01:03:55,565
Ah, it's going to be such a
special day, isn't it Sara?

642
01:03:57,106 --> 01:03:58,232
Yes, of course, mama.

643
01:03:59,008 --> 01:04:01,909
Whatever Michelle does is always special.
Isn't it?

644
01:04:03,245 --> 01:04:05,406
Excuse me;
I need to finish my sketch.

645
01:04:13,355 --> 01:04:15,084
Good evening Sara.
- Good evening.

646
01:04:15,624 --> 01:04:19,583
Mr. Sahai, congratulations.
You have performed yet...

647
01:04:19,795 --> 01:04:23,754
another miracle.
Still a long way to go, Mr. McNally

648
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,865
The journey has just begun.

649
01:04:30,806 --> 01:04:31,773
Teacher!

650
01:04:35,811 --> 01:04:39,269
She's been waiting for
her gift for so long.

651
01:04:51,327 --> 01:04:52,794
What is this?

652
01:04:54,563 --> 01:04:58,021
Your friend, for... life.

653
01:04:58,667 --> 01:05:03,536
I don't need

654
01:05:05,007 --> 01:05:06,474
I don't want to be dependent on this.

655
01:05:08,677 --> 01:05:12,909
This will not make you dependent.

656
01:05:14,483 --> 01:05:19,614
It will make you independent.
Do you understand?

657
01:05:55,624 --> 01:05:57,615
"It was the beginning of a new life..."

658
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:01,195
"a new feeling, a new horizon..."

659
01:06:01,897 --> 01:06:03,364
"You had faith in me..."

660
01:06:03,899 --> 01:06:05,867
"and I had faith in my wings."

661
01:06:06,268 --> 01:06:09,533
Remember how happy I was
that day?

662
01:06:19,581 --> 01:06:23,108
Is it wise to let Michelle live alone?

663
01:06:23,319 --> 01:06:26,220
She is not alone;
Mrs. Gomes will also live here.

664
01:06:26,422 --> 01:06:28,390
I will also live next door.

665
01:06:29,124 --> 01:06:34,391
University is close by,
she will meet new people.

666
01:06:34,663 --> 01:06:39,259
Besides, we can't protect
her all her life.

667
01:06:39,468 --> 01:06:40,730
Don't worry. She'll be fine!

668
01:06:40,936 --> 01:06:42,233
What's wrong with you, Sara? Huh?

669
01:06:42,438 --> 01:06:44,303
We were all just laughing
now suddenly you're fighting.

670
01:06:44,506 --> 01:06:47,236
It's very irritating, mama.
Anything that I put anywhere...

671
01:06:47,443 --> 01:06:48,842
she picks it up and puts it
somewhere else.

672
01:06:49,812 --> 01:06:51,404
Ma, I love her very much,
I really do.

673
01:06:51,613 --> 01:06:53,911
But... Please... leave me
out of this. Ok?

674
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:57,248
She's very excited, sweetie.
Please understand

675
01:06:57,453 --> 01:06:59,978
I understand everything.
It's always about her, right?

676
01:07:00,189 --> 01:07:03,352
Her excitement, her happiness, she's
the one who means everything to you

677
01:07:03,826 --> 01:07:07,557
But what about me?
Should I speak to you in sign language?

678
01:07:07,763 --> 01:07:09,697
Paul, I can't believe
what she's saying.

679
01:07:12,768 --> 01:07:15,202
Oh My God...
Michelle!

680
01:07:16,638 --> 01:07:20,005
Michelle!
- No, Mrs. McNally. Leave her alone.

681
01:07:21,844 --> 01:07:24,608
With every fall, she'll rise higher.

682
01:07:25,647 --> 01:07:28,616
I fell.

683
01:07:29,518 --> 01:07:30,576
That's the spirit.

684
01:07:32,988 --> 01:07:40,019
I want you to walk alone,
without any help.

685
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:46,297
then right. Understood?

686
01:08:01,483 --> 01:08:03,815
JoJo... go slow... l'm getting old.

687
01:08:05,187 --> 01:08:06,654
Oh! I'm so sorry.

688
01:08:20,702 --> 01:08:21,327
Where is she going?

689
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:26,940
Where... are you going?

690
01:08:28,043 --> 01:08:31,570
No no no... This is the
wrong way... it's this way.

691
01:08:32,081 --> 01:08:34,515
No... it's... tch!
We're getting late...

692
01:08:34,716 --> 01:08:41,349
Come on... yes, hurry up

693
01:08:44,059 --> 01:08:44,855
Yes, come on...

694
01:08:47,963 --> 01:08:50,022
Run, run, run!
Yes!

695
01:08:55,237 --> 01:08:56,704
Come on, come on... hurry up.

696
01:08:58,073 --> 01:08:59,097
- Present.

697
01:08:59,908 --> 01:09:01,705
- Present

698
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:03,705
- Present

699
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:05,869

700
01:09:09,885 --> 01:09:12,718
- Present.

701
01:09:14,089 --> 01:09:17,752
"There was so much to learn
and there was such little time."

702
01:09:18,594 --> 01:09:19,720
"24 hours without tiring..."

703
01:09:20,562 --> 01:09:25,226
"Your fingers would speak to me."

704
01:09:25,801 --> 01:09:29,134
Whether life starts from
the womb or from the earth...

705
01:09:30,105 --> 01:09:36,066
its journey starts from darkness
and ends in darkness.

706
01:09:37,513 --> 01:09:40,971
One day we will all have to pass
through this darkness...

707
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:48,014
and reach into the light.

708
01:09:48,423 --> 01:09:51,722
"One day, we all have to go through
the darkness, to... light..."

709
01:09:52,494 --> 01:09:54,758
"New doors opened up for me..."

710
01:09:55,497 --> 01:09:59,991
"new friends, new stories,
new poetry..."

711
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:02,933
"a new way of looking at the world"

712
01:10:03,705 --> 01:10:06,503
"what you see is what you dream'

713
01:10:08,377 --> 01:10:11,540
No. She, she... she disagrees
with the poet

714
01:10:12,714 --> 01:10:16,343
Eyes don't see dreams
but the mind does.

715
01:10:17,152 --> 01:10:22,886
I can't see with my eyes,
yet I dream.

716
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:28,122
Our dream is that one-day
I would graduate.

717
01:10:40,175 --> 01:10:43,872
Are you ready?

718
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:45,137
Ready...

719
01:10:46,682 --> 01:10:48,980
Tree...
- Tree...

720
01:10:49,918 --> 01:10:52,250
Burr...
- Butterfly...

721
01:10:52,854 --> 01:10:54,981
Bir...
- Bird...

722
01:10:55,524 --> 01:10:57,321
Fish...
- Fish...

723
01:10:58,527 --> 01:11:00,154
Bee...
- Bee...

724
01:11:08,337 --> 01:11:13,001
"The best years of my life..."

725
01:11:13,909 --> 01:11:16,036
"memories of which
bring joy even today"

726
01:11:30,592 --> 01:11:32,025
It's ok...

727
01:11:33,428 --> 01:11:34,360
It's all right!

728
01:11:41,703 --> 01:11:43,364
What? Tickly?

729
01:11:54,716 --> 01:11:58,709
It's not going to snow.
Please concentrate on your studies

730
01:12:00,088 --> 01:12:03,717
No, no... you wont need the
umbrella at all, concentrate.

731
01:12:17,806 --> 01:12:19,899
Give me the umbrella.
Hey stop it...

732
01:12:20,108 --> 01:12:21,075
Give me the umbrella...

733
01:12:21,276 --> 01:12:22,243
Give me the umbrella...
give... me... The umbrella

734
01:12:56,478 --> 01:12:57,604
"Can't you see"?

735
01:12:58,447 --> 01:12:59,106
I'm sorry sir

736
01:13:01,483 --> 01:13:06,284
Hey... no... no. No.
It's alright... it's alright.

737
01:13:06,621 --> 01:13:08,782
No, no...

738
01:13:09,391 --> 01:13:13,327
you are too slow!
How will you pass?

739
01:13:14,663 --> 01:13:15,459
You'll try?

740
01:13:16,531 --> 01:13:17,463
Let's watch it

741
01:13:20,035 --> 01:13:24,335
This is ten words in one minute

742
01:13:27,175 --> 01:13:29,803
You're going to try and do thirty.
Thirty words, my foot!

743
01:13:39,654 --> 01:13:43,146
Pass?
- No fail.

744
01:13:49,097 --> 01:13:53,500
No, not in one or two subjects,
you have failed in all of them.

745
01:14:19,528 --> 01:14:23,362
"People celebrate success
but we celebrated failure"

746
01:14:24,766 --> 01:14:27,701
"While eating ice cream
you told me the story of the spider"

747
01:14:28,603 --> 01:14:31,037
"Who after a lot of tries
made her home."

748
01:14:31,773 --> 01:14:34,867
"After all, failure is
the first step towards success..."

749
01:14:35,911 --> 01:14:38,903
"but for me these steps
were never-ending."

750
01:14:45,654 --> 01:14:48,919
Mr. Sahai, how are you?
How is Michelle?

751
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:52,726
She's all right,
her results have come out.

752
01:14:53,295 --> 01:14:54,159
And what happened?

753
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,564
She has failed again.

754
01:14:59,634 --> 01:15:03,229
But she said that
her papers were easy.

755
01:15:03,438 --> 01:15:08,569
She lied, so she could
enjoy her holidays

756
01:15:11,179 --> 01:15:16,310
But you said that only after falling
can a person rise higher.

757
01:15:18,253 --> 01:15:22,417
Before I fall, I want her
to learn how to fly.

758
01:15:23,525 --> 01:15:28,428
I'm getting old, you know?

759
01:15:28,663 --> 01:15:32,099
Oh no...
- What happened?

760
01:15:32,534 --> 01:15:37,164
Michelle has failed again?
- Yes Paul. I'm worried.

761
01:15:37,506 --> 01:15:38,473
I think Mr Sahai...

762
01:15:41,643 --> 01:15:46,444
Ma... I want to come home.

763
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:56,785
Ma, I failed.

764
01:15:59,728 --> 01:16:10,696
Teacher shouted at me.

765
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:12,973
I love you, my baby, I love you.

766
01:16:37,098 --> 01:16:39,498
I was told you were looking
for me Mr. Fernandez

767
01:16:40,335 --> 01:16:44,829
Ah Mr. Sahai, please come in.
I have been waiting for you all day...

768
01:16:46,007 --> 01:16:50,000
I want to share my biggest
achievement with you.

769
01:16:50,679 --> 01:16:52,112
Please have a seat.

770
01:16:56,585 --> 01:17:02,353
Mr. Sahai Michelle has been studying
in the same class for 2 years.

771
01:17:03,258 --> 01:17:06,091
So I thought I would do
something to... help her.

772
01:17:09,764 --> 01:17:13,029
First year Arts, entirely in Braille.

773
01:17:14,769 --> 01:17:20,105
You had once said very few chances
are given for doing good deeds.

774
01:17:20,809 --> 01:17:25,041
I'm happy that you haven't
wasted this chance.

775
01:17:25,981 --> 01:17:28,643
Now no one can stop Michelle
from going ahead. Thank you.

776
01:17:28,883 --> 01:17:33,047
Not at all... It's my duty,
my pleasure, my pride.

777
01:17:37,158 --> 01:17:38,318
I trust that was all right?

778
01:17:46,501 --> 01:17:47,729
Is anything the matter?

779
01:17:50,905 --> 01:17:53,305
Then the books, Mr. Sahai.
Please take them to Michelle.

780
01:17:59,614 --> 01:18:01,582
How do I go out?

781
01:18:04,185 --> 01:18:07,586
How... how do I go out?

782
01:18:08,857 --> 01:18:10,290
I beg your pardon?

783
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:13,419
The way to go out?

784
01:18:14,429 --> 01:18:16,954
The door, Mr. Sahai...
it's right behind you.

785
01:18:17,365 --> 01:18:18,764
Exactly the way you came in.

786
01:18:22,804 --> 01:18:23,600
Yes...

787
01:18:27,776 --> 01:18:30,438
Mr. Sahai, is everything all right?

788
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:50,459
Tee... cher...

789
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:52,354
"New feelings were arising with age..."

790
01:19:53,027 --> 01:19:54,927
"something that I couldn't understand"

791
01:19:55,964 --> 01:19:59,024
"I knew no one besides you teacher"

792
01:20:01,035 --> 01:20:04,436
"That's why I thought of another
relationship with you teacher"

793
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:07,269
"Was it wrong for me to think this way?"

794
01:20:09,144 --> 01:20:10,543
"A lot was changing..."

795
01:20:11,412 --> 01:20:15,371
"but my failure was constant"

796
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:24,890
Time up, Michelle... time up.

797
01:20:25,426 --> 01:20:27,621
Michelle, you've already
had extra time.

798
01:20:28,396 --> 01:20:31,388
Michelle... I'll take
the paper out then.

799
01:20:34,269 --> 01:20:35,566
No... no...
- Please...

800
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:36,737
Leave it...
- Please...

801
01:20:36,938 --> 01:20:40,465
Leave it... no... leave it...

802
01:20:41,576 --> 01:20:43,908
Knowing the answers is not enough...

803
01:20:44,112 --> 01:20:48,105
You have let me down completely.
I am angry... I am very angry...

804
01:20:49,117 --> 01:20:52,416
no... knowing the
answers is not enough...

805
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,645
you need to put them down
on paper too, understand?

806
01:21:01,629 --> 01:21:03,324
Don't just stand there
like a failure!

807
01:21:07,535 --> 01:21:10,003
It's all right.
- No. It's not all right, Mrs. McNally.

808
01:21:10,605 --> 01:21:12,436
It's not only her failure,
it's mine too.

809
01:21:12,941 --> 01:21:15,239
This is the third year in a row
that she's failed.

810
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:17,439
For three years we have been doing
those same lessons.

811
01:21:17,812 --> 01:21:20,474
She's just too slow at typing.

812
01:21:20,982 --> 01:21:22,847
Hey, Michelle... Michelle...

813
01:21:23,184 --> 01:21:24,446
Where do you think you are going?

814
01:21:24,652 --> 01:21:28,110
Leave this bag...
Leave it, leave it...

815
01:21:28,389 --> 01:21:29,253
Leave this bag!

816
01:21:29,457 --> 01:21:32,017
Enough! I want to go home.

817
01:21:32,227 --> 01:21:34,286
No. No... you're not going anywhere.

818
01:21:34,495 --> 01:21:36,019
I don't want to stay.
I don't want to study.

819
01:21:36,231 --> 01:21:39,792
No... no... You will stay...
you will study. You understand?

820
01:21:40,001 --> 01:21:42,799
You will study. In three years even
the Braille letters have worn out...

821
01:21:43,004 --> 01:21:46,804
but nothing has entered your brain.
- Let her be, Mr. Sahai!

822
01:21:47,041 --> 01:21:49,805
Mrs. McNally, I haven't spent

823
01:21:50,078 --> 01:21:51,978
I'm not going to allow her
to be a failure.

824
01:21:52,247 --> 01:21:54,306
Hey... come here... you...
come here...

825
01:21:54,515 --> 01:21:56,210
Listen, you will...
you will not...

826
01:21:56,317 --> 01:22:01,220
you will not run away from failure.
Understand? Not run away from failure!

827
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:06,387
Michelle... what is this? Don't you
dare disrespect a book!

828
01:22:06,594 --> 01:22:08,323
Pick it up... Come on.
Pick it up., pick up the book...

829
01:22:08,529 --> 01:22:10,997
pick up the book... Michelle...
Michelle...

830
01:22:11,366 --> 01:22:12,993
Pick up the book...

831
01:22:14,035 --> 01:22:14,660
Stop it

832
01:22:25,213 --> 01:22:27,511
As long as I am alive,
you will study.

833
01:22:28,049 --> 01:22:30,677
I don't want to learn.

834
01:22:30,885 --> 01:22:33,376
Yes! You will learn.
You will graduate.

835
01:22:33,721 --> 01:22:36,383
The black robe. Our dream...

836
01:22:36,891 --> 01:22:41,851
I don't want a robe.
My world is black

837
01:22:42,063 --> 01:22:47,262
No. Your world... your world is
not black. It is full of light!

838
01:22:47,468 --> 01:22:52,201
My world is black, black, black!

839
01:22:52,407 --> 01:22:55,865
Black... black...

840
01:23:24,272 --> 01:23:28,402

841
01:23:29,677 --> 01:23:30,905
in less than 2 minutes.

842
01:23:34,615 --> 01:23:37,584
She's not slow anymore Mrs McNally

843
01:23:39,854 --> 01:23:42,414
Time for celebration.

844
01:23:43,758 --> 01:23:47,626
Time for... an icecream, my dear

845
01:23:49,664 --> 01:23:51,632
Ice-cream?
- Yes...

846
01:23:52,133 --> 01:24:01,166
Mrs. McNally. Life is an ice-cream.
Enjoy it before it melts.

847
01:24:16,124 --> 01:24:17,284
Can I have two?

848
01:24:20,461 --> 01:24:21,860
Ice creams, of course...

849
01:24:28,302 --> 01:24:30,099
Sir... ice-cream...

850
01:24:32,573 --> 01:24:33,301
Ice-cream sir.

851
01:24:40,848 --> 01:24:42,645
What happened?
- Tee...

852
01:24:43,518 --> 01:24:44,314
What's wrong with you?

853
01:24:48,689 --> 01:24:49,656
Your change, sir.

854
01:24:51,492 --> 01:24:52,652
Sir, your change?

855
01:25:23,925 --> 01:25:32,196
Tee... Tee...

856
01:25:37,572 --> 01:25:42,202
tee... tee... tee...

857
01:25:53,087 --> 01:25:59,890
Are you alright?
Call for a doctor!

858
01:26:04,765 --> 01:26:05,561
Mr. Sahai?

859
01:26:08,102 --> 01:26:09,069
Mr. Sahai?

860
01:26:10,638 --> 01:26:13,198
You are here...
I've been looking for you.

861
01:26:14,609 --> 01:26:15,234
Yes?

862
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:17,641
Don't you recognize me?

863
01:26:18,346 --> 01:26:19,779
It's me... Fernandez

864
01:26:22,783 --> 01:26:23,909
Michelle's Principal.

865
01:26:25,486 --> 01:26:29,217
Oh... yes. Of course.
I'll get Michelle for you.

866
01:26:29,457 --> 01:26:32,153
Michelle!
- Michelle can't hear, Mr. Sahai.

867
01:26:38,599 --> 01:26:41,568
I'll just call her.

868
01:26:44,772 --> 01:26:47,605
Mrs. Gomes!!!
- Michelle is not at home.

869
01:26:54,315 --> 01:26:55,009
She's here.

870
01:27:08,496 --> 01:27:12,125
To forget my name,
to forget the door...

871
01:27:12,833 --> 01:27:16,769
all this is fine... but to forget
Michelle like this...

872
01:27:17,905 --> 01:27:19,839
something is seriously wrong,
Mr. Sahai.

873
01:27:20,508 --> 01:27:23,341
I really think you should
get some help and see a doctor...

874
01:27:26,681 --> 01:27:27,807
Good night. Mr. Sahai.

875
01:28:08,289 --> 01:28:11,349
I'm... sorry.

876
01:28:14,729 --> 01:28:16,390
It's ok.
- It's ok.

877
01:28:17,932 --> 01:28:19,900
Don't ever forget me...

878
01:28:27,241 --> 01:28:27,866
I promise...

879
01:28:29,243 --> 01:28:30,870
I will never forget... you

880
01:28:32,713 --> 01:28:35,443
You worry about me?

881
01:28:39,153 --> 01:28:43,021
No. Don't... worry about me...

882
01:28:44,925 --> 01:28:49,919
just... getting old.

883
01:28:53,134 --> 01:28:55,967
No... Don't worry.

884
01:28:59,106 --> 01:29:01,939
Go to... sleep.

885
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,944
Sing you... a lullaby...

886
01:29:10,718 --> 01:29:12,242
No, I can't sing...

887
01:29:27,101 --> 01:29:33,939
Hush, my baby.
On the treetop.

888
01:29:35,976 --> 01:29:42,404
When the wind blows,
the cradle will rock...

889
01:29:44,385 --> 01:29:46,615
hush my baby...

890
01:29:48,055 --> 01:29:50,990
"A storm had scattered my dreams"

891
01:29:51,659 --> 01:29:54,492
"All those dreams those
were most dear to me"

892
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:59,465
"That day was the first time
I felt fear..."

893
01:30:00,735 --> 01:30:04,796
"how would I live
if you forget me?"

894
01:30:07,775 --> 01:30:09,970
What happened now?
- She doesn't want to come downstairs

895
01:30:10,144 --> 01:30:12,635
She is feeling awkward to come
in front of your in-laws.

896
01:30:12,847 --> 01:30:14,246
She thinks she'll spoil the evening.

897
01:30:14,615 --> 01:30:16,310
Then why did she bother
coming till here?

898
01:30:16,517 --> 01:30:17,484
Stop it Sara!!!

899
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:22,180
She's worried about
Mr. Sahai's health, please...

900
01:30:22,757 --> 01:30:25,225
it really hurts me to see
the two of you fight like this...

901
01:30:25,993 --> 01:30:27,517
now you get her ready
and you bring her down.

902
01:30:27,728 --> 01:30:28,888
I have a lot of work to finish...

903
01:30:34,802 --> 01:30:38,670
Michelle, I'm requesting you...

904
01:30:39,273 --> 01:30:42,208
till now whatever you did
was special.

905
01:30:42,977 --> 01:30:46,413
But today is a very
special day for me.

906
01:30:47,114 --> 01:30:51,107
I'm in love and I am getting
engaged before you.

907
01:30:51,786 --> 01:30:53,276
I know this could upset you.

908
01:30:53,721 --> 01:30:56,315
Maybe this evening will
never come in your life

909
01:30:56,891 --> 01:30:59,485
And you may be feeling that
you will never fall in love.

910
01:31:01,362 --> 01:31:03,853
I hope you will.
I really do...

911
01:31:04,398 --> 01:31:06,366
but, until then...

912
01:31:06,734 --> 01:31:12,138
please don't... spoil. My. Evening. Ok?

913
01:31:22,917 --> 01:31:26,375
I am very happy today because all the
people I care about in the world...

914
01:31:26,587 --> 01:31:31,047
are in this room. On this occasion,
I'd love to say a few words.

915
01:31:37,765 --> 01:31:40,962
I'm a very lucky girl that
I got parents like you.

916
01:31:41,769 --> 01:31:43,168
And a sister like Michelle.

917
01:31:44,104 --> 01:31:46,732
I haven't been the best
daughter or the best sister.

918
01:31:47,107 --> 01:31:49,632
But I want to tell you all
I that really love you very much.

919
01:31:51,445 --> 01:31:52,742
And I love this house.

920
01:31:53,948 --> 01:31:55,506
There are so many memories here.

921
01:31:56,951 --> 01:31:59,579
I remember one time Michelle
and I were playing outside.

922
01:31:59,787 --> 01:32:02,085
We were running through
the grass holding hands.

923
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:07,090
And while running, both of us fell
down and both of us started crying.

924
01:32:07,628 --> 01:32:14,591
Mama and Papa came running outside and
picked up Michelle and left me outside...

925
01:32:16,136 --> 01:32:18,866
and there I was...
with my arms stretched out.

926
01:32:19,139 --> 01:32:20,003
Waiting.

927
01:32:22,142 --> 01:32:23,268
I'm still waiting.

928
01:32:26,146 --> 01:32:30,446
As a child. I...
I used to be so angry with her.

929
01:32:31,986 --> 01:32:35,114
The amount I loved her the
same amount I was jealous of her...

930
01:32:35,656 --> 01:32:38,124
whatever food I didn't like,
I'd feed her.

931
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:43,459
I used to wake Michelle in the
middle of the night and ask her...

932
01:32:44,164 --> 01:32:48,032
do you want to drink water? Michelle
used to nod her head and say yes...

933
01:32:49,503 --> 01:32:51,471
and I used to turn my head
and go back to sleep.

934
01:32:53,841 --> 01:32:55,638
She would wait for me
all night long.

935
01:33:00,681 --> 01:33:02,148
I can't believe I did that.

936
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,714
Can you Marc?

937
01:33:12,192 --> 01:33:16,060
For all those things that I did,
and all the misplaced...

938
01:33:16,864 --> 01:33:19,731
anger... I'd like to say I'm sorry.

939
01:33:22,202 --> 01:33:23,499
Did I say something wrong?

940
01:33:24,371 --> 01:33:26,339
Then please let me finish.
- I don't want to listen,

941
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:27,734
It's important to me. Michelle.

942
01:33:42,056 --> 01:33:45,685
Michelle...
- Enough!!!!

943
01:33:54,401 --> 01:33:55,527
Sit down.

944
01:33:57,905 --> 01:33:59,964
SIT... DOWN.

945
01:34:15,756 --> 01:34:17,781
For this joyous and
eventful evening...

946
01:34:19,927 --> 01:34:23,385
Michelle had prepared
a speech for Sara,

947
01:34:24,098 --> 01:34:29,730
I would read and Michelle
would sign...

948
01:34:30,938 --> 01:34:35,238
but I don't think that Michelle
is in any mood for signs.

949
01:34:36,944 --> 01:34:43,076
It's important however, that we
should all hear what she said.

950
01:34:45,452 --> 01:34:51,755
"I was eight years old, wild, violent
always angry at life."

951
01:34:54,962 --> 01:34:58,762
"I felt that I would never experience
the beautiful moments of life."

952
01:34:59,967 --> 01:35:03,095
"Then mother put Sara in my arms
for the first time..."

953
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:15,612
"and then I knew that I'd see the world
through Sara's eyes."

954
01:35:16,817 --> 01:35:22,722
"Ma says, that I couldn't
stop smiling all day."

955
01:35:28,996 --> 01:35:32,295
"Sara shared all her happiness
with me..."

956
01:35:33,333 --> 01:35:36,530
"she would hold my hand
and take me everywhere."

957
01:35:36,837 --> 01:35:39,533
"When Ma wasn't around
she would feed me..."

958
01:35:40,007 --> 01:35:44,068
"she would wake me at night
and ask me if I wanted water."

959
01:35:49,516 --> 01:35:52,144
"You were the voice
to my silent fingers."

960
01:35:54,354 --> 01:35:56,879
"I am so looking forward
to your wedding day."

961
01:35:59,026 --> 01:36:00,323
"I'll dress up beautifully that day."

962
01:36:09,203 --> 01:36:11,569
"I may never be the bride,
but I will still be the bridesmaid."

963
01:36:16,543 --> 01:36:24,109
"Do teach Marc how to sign,
I have lots to complain about you."

964
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:29,245
"Thank you for allowing me
to be your bridesmaid, Sara."

965
01:36:30,724 --> 01:36:38,927
"I promise I will not cry... as you
walk with Marc towards a new life."

966
01:36:56,583 --> 01:36:58,949
So on this happy note...

967
01:37:02,256 --> 01:37:03,280
a toast...

968
01:37:06,093 --> 01:37:08,823
for Sara and Marc

969
01:38:07,821 --> 01:38:11,450
Do you, Marc Philip Bragger,
take Sara Maria McNally...

970
01:38:11,658 --> 01:38:15,116
to be you're lawfully wedded wife?
- I do.

971
01:38:15,662 --> 01:38:17,960
Marc... says yes.

972
01:38:18,165 --> 01:38:22,966
Do you, Sara Maria McNally...
- Now the priest is asking Sara...

973
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:25,035
take Marc Philip Bragger to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

974
01:38:25,239 --> 01:38:26,797
If she agrees...
- I do.

975
01:38:27,007 --> 01:38:28,907
Sara says..."Yes".

976
01:38:29,843 --> 01:38:32,710
I declare you to be man and wife

977
01:38:35,849 --> 01:38:39,148
Now they are exchanging rings.

978
01:38:39,353 --> 01:38:40,650
You may now kiss the bride.

979
01:38:40,854 --> 01:38:47,316
The priest has asked them
to kiss as man and wife.

980
01:38:51,031 --> 01:38:54,831
On the cheek?
- No, no, not on the cheek. On the lips.

981
01:39:44,251 --> 01:39:45,377
Tee...

982
01:39:54,261 --> 01:39:55,125
Te...

983
01:40:05,105 --> 01:40:07,903
What are you doing here?

984
01:40:09,609 --> 01:40:11,907
Wanted... to talk.

985
01:40:28,128 --> 01:40:31,928
Do you love... me?

986
01:40:41,808 --> 01:40:44,606
I'm suffering...

987
01:40:49,983 --> 01:40:55,046
I understand that you are suffering...

988
01:40:58,658 --> 01:41:05,063
I may never know... what it is
to... love... a man.

989
01:41:09,836 --> 01:41:20,644
Maybe you will never
experience physical love

990
01:41:26,686 --> 01:41:27,550
but...

991
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:38,820
will you kiss me once...

992
01:41:43,370 --> 01:41:44,166
please?

993
01:43:18,465 --> 01:43:19,432
Tee...

994
01:43:24,804 --> 01:43:25,600
Teee...

995
01:43:26,806 --> 01:43:30,003
"In giving me dignity
as a woman..."

996
01:43:30,477 --> 01:43:33,776
"you lost all dignity
as a teacher."

997
01:43:34,814 --> 01:43:37,442
"I realized that
I had asked too much."

998
01:43:38,318 --> 01:43:39,342
"I made a mistake."

999
01:43:40,487 --> 01:43:42,955
"You didn't even give me a chance
to ask for your forgiveness."

1000
01:43:44,324 --> 01:43:45,621
"I'm leaving"

1001
01:43:46,826 --> 01:43:51,695
"Like your walking-stick,
never forget one thing"

1002
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:58,134
"Darkness is desperately trying
to engulf you"

1003
01:43:59,172 --> 01:44:01,572
"But you must always
walk towards light"

1004
01:44:02,509 --> 01:44:06,912
"Every step of yours, filled with hope,
will keep me alive, Michelle"

1005
01:44:20,527 --> 01:44:22,825
"Once again light transcended
into darkness..."

1006
01:44:24,197 --> 01:44:26,722
"and sound into silence."

1007
01:44:27,367 --> 01:44:32,669
"For twelve years
I walked the path you showed me..."

1008
01:44:33,707 --> 01:44:35,834
"alone in the darkness."

1009
01:44:37,877 --> 01:44:41,938
"When after twelve years I had
found you near the same fountain..."

1010
01:44:42,716 --> 01:44:45,617
"and today after 12 days
this mark sheet."

1011
01:44:46,052 --> 01:44:48,680
"I'm now a graduate in the arts."

1012
01:44:49,723 --> 01:44:52,283
"I want you to be the first one
to hear the good news"

1013
01:44:53,226 --> 01:44:56,525
Mr. Sahai this is your bed,
please lie down.

1014
01:44:56,896 --> 01:45:00,696
Please... that's it. Mr. Sahai...

1015
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:03,869
This is your bed, Mr. Sahai!

1016
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:04,866
Nurse!

1017
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:07,206
Mr. Sahai...

1018
01:45:08,575 --> 01:45:11,703
please lie down... Mr. Sahai

1019
01:45:29,929 --> 01:45:30,725
Tee...

1020
01:45:48,948 --> 01:45:49,744
Teee!

1021
01:45:50,617 --> 01:45:51,345
Tee...

1022
01:45:54,954 --> 01:45:55,818
Tee!

1023
01:46:32,325 --> 01:46:34,953
"Amidst us today there
is a student..."

1024
01:46:35,161 --> 01:46:38,130
who has set an example
of grit and strength...

1025
01:46:38,665 --> 01:46:43,796
and has proved that
nothing is impossible.

1026
01:46:44,838 --> 01:46:47,466
She is the pride of our university.

1027
01:46:47,674 --> 01:46:51,474
And on this rare achievement, I would
want her to say a few words.

1028
01:46:51,678 --> 01:46:54,738
Ladies and Gentleman - Michelle McNally

1029
01:47:01,688 --> 01:47:03,212
That's my daughter.

1030
01:47:19,539 --> 01:47:21,166
After many attempts...

1031
01:47:22,041 --> 01:47:25,340
the spider, in spite of
falling several times...

1032
01:47:26,045 --> 01:47:27,512
has finally made her home.

1033
01:47:29,215 --> 01:47:31,115
The ant has climbed her mountain.

1034
01:47:32,218 --> 01:47:34,846
A tortoise has crossed the dessert...

1035
01:47:35,722 --> 01:47:39,180
and today Michelle McNally,
has finally become a graduate.

1036
01:47:44,397 --> 01:47:46,865
But there is a difference
between you and me.

1037
01:47:47,066 --> 01:47:51,696
What took you 20 years
has taken me 40.

1038
01:47:52,572 --> 01:47:54,199
But I finally did it!

1039
01:48:02,081 --> 01:48:07,212
As a child, I always
lagged behind others.

1040
01:48:09,923 --> 01:48:14,383
My parents were always ashamed of me.

1041
01:48:15,428 --> 01:48:19,489
Every year I would call home
and say, "Ma, I failed."

1042
01:48:22,435 --> 01:48:23,902
But today I can say...

1043
01:48:24,103 --> 01:48:26,162
"Ma, I passed."

1044
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:38,240
I know that my parents
are very proud of me.

1045
01:48:39,285 --> 01:48:42,982
Telling the world proudly that
I am their daughter

1046
01:48:43,623 --> 01:48:45,648
Thank you Mama, Papa...

1047
01:48:54,467 --> 01:49:03,398
As a child, I was always
searching for something.

1048
01:49:04,143 --> 01:49:07,112
But in the end,
I would only find darkness.

1049
01:49:08,147 --> 01:49:14,609
One day, my mother put me
in those unknown arms.

1050
01:49:15,989 --> 01:49:19,356
He was different from every one.
He was a magician.

1051
01:49:19,993 --> 01:49:26,557
For years he dragged me from
darkness into the light.

1052
01:49:29,836 --> 01:49:32,566
When it comes to God,
we are all blind.

1053
01:49:33,172 --> 01:49:36,369
None of you have ever
seen Him or heard Him.

1054
01:49:37,677 --> 01:49:43,138
But I have touched God.
I have felt his presence.

1055
01:49:44,517 --> 01:49:48,180
I call him "Tee.

1056
01:49:56,362 --> 01:49:58,262
For me everything was BLACK

1057
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:06,002
But my teacher taught me
the new meaning of Black

1058
01:50:10,376 --> 01:50:13,937
Black is not only darkness
and suffocation.

1059
01:50:17,216 --> 01:50:19,013
It is the colour of achievement.

1060
01:50:20,386 --> 01:50:21,751
The colour of knowledge.

1061
01:50:24,057 --> 01:50:26,525
The colour of the graduation robe.

1062
01:50:27,226 --> 01:50:29,091
The colour that we all share today.

1063
01:50:31,230 --> 01:50:33,095
But there is a difference
between you and me.

1064
01:50:33,399 --> 01:50:36,630
Today you all wear this
to celebrate graduation.

1065
01:50:37,070 --> 01:50:38,037
But not me.

1066
01:50:40,406 --> 01:50:44,502
Because I want my teacher
to be the first one to see me...

1067
01:50:45,111 --> 01:50:47,545
wear this black robe.

1068
01:50:54,921 --> 01:50:58,880
Every graduation day,
he brought me here.

1069
01:50:59,592 --> 01:51:02,459
Every year, we would stand
near that door...

1070
01:51:02,929 --> 01:51:05,989
and every year he would
write in my hand...

1071
01:51:06,599 --> 01:51:10,729
"One day I want to see you
on that stage Michelle"

1072
01:51:13,773 --> 01:51:15,070
It has taken me 40 years...

1073
01:51:15,274 --> 01:51:17,333
to fulfill his dream.

1074
01:51:18,277 --> 01:51:22,577
And today, for the first time,
I feel my lack of sight.

1075
01:51:23,282 --> 01:51:31,246
Because I want to see my teacher
standing at the door...

1076
01:51:31,457 --> 01:51:33,425
watching me fulfill our dream
with pride

1077
01:51:57,583 --> 01:51:58,550
"Teacher..."

1078
01:53:49,428 --> 01:53:57,233
"Our dream"...Tee... Woah...

1079
01:54:52,491 --> 01:54:53,287
Woah... woah

1080
01:55:03,836 --> 01:55:04,461
Woah

1081
01:55:06,505 --> 01:55:07,631
Woah...

1082
01:55:17,516 --> 01:55:18,483
Tee... Woah

1083
01:55:23,189 --> 01:55:24,053
woah

1084
01:55:40,539 --> 01:55:46,000
"Dear Ms. Nair, you'll be happy to
know that we have come into the light:

1085
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:52,511
"Today my teacher has remembered
his first word - Water."

1086
01:55:53,886 --> 01:55:55,854
"He is the greatest teacher
in the world..."

1087
01:55:56,222 --> 01:56:00,682
"who has proved again that there is
nothing impossible in this world."

1088
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:06,190
"Who has taught me that there is so much
happiness in living for someone else"

1089
01:56:06,899 --> 01:56:10,096
"Today is my teacher's
first day at school Miss Nair."

1090
01:56:10,569 --> 01:56:15,199
And his alphabets, just like mine,
will not start with A, B, C, D, and E.

1091
01:56:15,741 --> 01:56:21,043
But with B, L, A, C, K

1092
01:56:22,081 --> 01:56:23,105
"BLACK"
