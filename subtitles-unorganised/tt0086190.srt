1
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:32,348
Command station, this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.

2
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:35,395
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.

3
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,229
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...

4
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,647
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.

5
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:41,940
Stand by.

6
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:45,320
You are clear to proceed.

7
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:47,738
We're starting our approach.

8
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:17,852
Inform the commander
that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

9
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:19,060
Sir.

10
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:58,935
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected
pleasure. We're honoured.

11
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:01,351
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.

12
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:03,973
I'm here to put you back on schedule.

13
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,145
I assure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.

14
00:04:07,278 --> 00:04:10,694
Perhaps I can find
new ways to motivate them.

15
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:14,987
I tell you this station
will be operational as planned.

16
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:21,077
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

17
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,412
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

18
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:27,665
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.

19
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:32,425
- The emperor's coming here?
- That is correct, Commander...

20
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:37,298
<i>and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress.</i>

21
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,892
We shall double our efforts.

22
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,305
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

23
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,307
The emperor is not
as forgiving as I am.

24
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:07,707
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be too.

25
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:11,622
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

26
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:16,045
Don't be so sure.

27
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,465
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...

28
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:21,473
<i>you'd probably short-circuit.</i>

29
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:36,028
R2, are you sure
this is the right place?

30
00:05:41,162 --> 00:05:43,285
I'd better knock, I suppose.

31
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:49,038
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

32
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,541
Goodness gracious me!

33
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:20,190
I don't think
they're going to let us in, R2.

34
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:23,945
We'd better go.

35
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:34,629
R2, wait.

36
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,507
Oh, dear. R2.

37
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:41,921
R2, I really don't think
we should rush into all this.

38
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:45,013
Oh, R2!

39
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:46,720
R2, wait for me!

40
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,435
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here.

41
00:06:57,571 --> 00:06:59,528
Oh, my!

42
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:04,607
Oh, no.

43
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:11,166
Oh, my.

44
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:19,007
We bring a message
to your master,Jabba the Hutt.

45
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,926
And a gift.

46
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:26,384
What gift?

47
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:48,113
He says that our instructions
are to give it only to Jabba himself.

48
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:01,706
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.

49
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:07,551
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.

50
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:44,209
Good morning.

51
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:51,720
The message, R2.
The message.

52
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,441
<i>Greetings, Exalted One.</i>

53
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:05,857
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.</i>

54
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:09,855
<i>I am Luke Skywalker,
Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.</i>

55
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,329
<i>I know that you are powerful,
mighty Jabba...</i>

56
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:17,118
<i>and that your anger with Solo
must be equally powerful.</i>

57
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:21,033
<i>I seek an audience with Your Greatness
to bargain for Solo's life.</i>

58
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,461
<i>With your wisdom, I'm sure
we can work out an arrangement...</i>

59
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:29,301
<i>which will be mutually beneficial...</i>

60
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:32,096
<i>and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation.</i>

61
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,390
<i>As a token of my goodwill,
I present to you a gift-</i>

62
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,262
<i>these two droids.</i>

63
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:41,269
What did he say?

64
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:44,933
<i>Both are hard-working
and will serve you well.</i>

65
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:48,816
This can't be.
R2, you're playing the wrong message.

66
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,203
He's no Jedi.

67
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,664
There will be no bargain.

68
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:06,001
We're doomed.

69
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:13,093
I will not give up
my favourite decoration.

70
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:18,012
I like Captain Solo where he is.

71
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:21,803
R2, look. Captain Solo.

72
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:24,475
And he's still frozen in carbonite.

73
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:40,075
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?

74
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:45,073
Was it something I did? He never
expressed any unhappiness with my work.

75
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:47,752
How horrid!

76
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:18,987
Good. New acquisitions.

77
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:21,739
You are a protocol droid,
are you not?

78
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:23,780
I am C-3PO-

79
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:25,658
Yes or no will do.

80
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:27,286
Well, yes.

81
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:29,908
How many languages do you speak?

82
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:33,663
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily-

83
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,421
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...

84
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:39,886
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...

85
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:41,805
and disintegrated him.

86
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,510
Disintegrated?

87
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,229
Guard, this protocol droid
might be useful.

88
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:54,518
Fit him with a restraining bolt...

89
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:57,987
and take him back up to
His Excellency's main audience chamber.

90
00:11:58,115 --> 00:12:00,570
R2, don't leave me!

91
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:07,865
You're a feisty little one...

92
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:10,455
but you'll soon learn some respect.

93
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:13,871
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...

94
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:16,710
and I think you'll fill in nicely.

95
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:48,696
Ah! Do that again!

96
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:46,278
I have come for the bounty
on this Wookiee.

97
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:48,650
Oh, no. Chewbacca.

98
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:56,953
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

99
00:15:02,754 --> 00:15:05,541
Yes, I am here,
Your Worshipfulness.

100
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:07,997
Yes?

101
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:19,225
The illustrious Jabba
bids you welcome...

102
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:21,927
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.

103
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:25,022
I want 50,000. No less.

104
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:27,810
"50,000. No less. "

105
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,452
What did I say?

106
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:51,462
The mighty Jabba asks why
he must pay 50,000.

107
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:57,755
Because he's holding
a thermal detonator.

108
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:13,606
This bounty hunter
is my kind of scum...

109
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,361
fearless and inventive.

110
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:29,629
Jabba offers the sum of 35...

111
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,914
and I do suggest you take it.

112
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:39,096
He agrees!

113
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:31,672
Just relax for a moment.

114
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,430
You're free of the carbonite.

115
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:39,973
You have hibernation sickness.

116
00:19:40,108 --> 00:19:44,569
- I can't see.
- Your eyesight will return in time.

117
00:19:44,696 --> 00:19:47,982
- Where am I?
- Jabba's palace.

118
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:52,911
Who are you?

119
00:19:57,918 --> 00:20:00,373
- Someone who loves you.
- Leia.

120
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:05,875
I gotta get you out of here.

121
00:20:08,594 --> 00:20:10,338
What's that?

122
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:14,973
I know that laugh.

123
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:22,221
Hey,Jabba.

124
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:25,193
Look,Jabba, I was just
on my way to pay you back.

125
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,190
I got a little sidetracked.
It's not my fault.

126
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:32,023
It's too late for that, Solo.

127
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,869
You may have been a good smuggler...

128
00:20:36,998 --> 00:20:40,449
but now you're Bantha fodder.

129
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:46,080
Look-

130
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:49,423
Take him away.

131
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:51,296
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.

132
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:53,919
You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool.

133
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,009
Bring her to me.

134
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:05,105
We have powerful friends.

135
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:07,475
You're gonna regret this.

136
00:21:09,362 --> 00:21:11,236
I'm sure.

137
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:17,112
I can't bear to watch.

138
00:21:31,718 --> 00:21:33,177
Chewie?

139
00:21:34,972 --> 00:21:36,928
Chewie, is that you?

140
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:41,465
Wait a minute.
I can't see, pal.

141
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:44,471
What's going on?

142
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:48,603
Luke? Luke's crazy.

143
00:21:48,735 --> 00:21:52,269
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.

144
00:21:54,156 --> 00:21:56,030
AJedi knight?

145
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:00,693
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

146
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:06,041
I'm all right, pal.

147
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:09,461
I'm all right.

148
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,426
I must speak with Jabba.

149
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,599
No bargain.

150
00:23:12,734 --> 00:23:15,189
You will take me to Jabba now.

151
00:23:19,657 --> 00:23:21,448
You serve your master well.

152
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,320
And you will be rewarded.

153
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:37,463
At last! Master Luke's
come to rescue me.

154
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:39,002
Master.

155
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:44,179
Luke Skywalker,Jedi knight.

156
00:23:44,306 --> 00:23:48,553
I told you not to admit him.

157
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:50,476
I must be allowed to speak.

158
00:23:50,604 --> 00:23:53,355
He must be allowed to speak.

159
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:57,145
You weak-minded fool!

160
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:03,525
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

161
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:07,109
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

162
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:18,245
Your mind powers
will not work on me, boy.

163
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:20,539
Nevertheless...

164
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:23,629
I'm taking Captain Solo
and his friends.

165
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:27,593
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.

166
00:24:27,724 --> 00:24:30,678
It's your choice, but I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.

167
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:35,013
Master Luke, you're standing on-

168
00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:39,726
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.

169
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:44,480
I shall enjoy watching you die.

170
00:25:15,562 --> 00:25:18,136
Oh, no! The rancor!

171
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:09,144
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

172
00:28:09,274 --> 00:28:13,486
They will all suffer for this outrage.

173
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:29,372
Han.

174
00:28:32,922 --> 00:28:36,125
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Together again, huh?

175
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:38,666
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How are we doin'?

176
00:28:38,803 --> 00:28:41,472
- Same as always.
- That bad, huh?

177
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:44,089
- Where's Leia?
- I'm here.

178
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:49,187
Oh, dear.

179
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:53,148
His High Exaltedness,
the great Jabba the Hutt...

180
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:56,312
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately.

181
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:58,070
Good. I hate long waits.

182
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:03,064
You will therefore be taken
to the Dune Sea...

183
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:05,527
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...

184
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:07,951
nesting place
of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

185
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,280
Doesn't sound so bad.

186
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:13,284
In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering...

187
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,504
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.

188
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:20,131
On second thought,
let's pass on that.

189
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,884
You should have bargained,Jabba.

190
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:28,180
<i>That's the last mistake
you'll ever make.</i>

191
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,443
I think my eyes are getting better.

192
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,690
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

193
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,741
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here, you know.

194
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,704
<i>You're gonna die here,
you know. Convenient.</i>

195
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,119
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.

196
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,574
I've taken care of everything.

197
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,741
Great.

198
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:49,217
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

199
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,421
I'm terribly sorry.

200
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,476
R2, what are you doing here?

201
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,640
I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

202
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,727
They're going to execute Master Luke,
and if we're not careful, us too.

203
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,521
I wish I had your confidence.

204
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:32,051
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...

205
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,301
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honourably.

206
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,759
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...

207
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:43,895
the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.

208
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:53,452
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of worm-ridden filth...

209
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:56,199
he'll get no such pleasure from us!

210
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,121
Right?

211
00:32:01,418 --> 00:32:03,494
This is your last chance.

212
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:05,704
Free us or die.

213
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:12,964
Move him into position.

214
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:39,403
Put him in.

215
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:05,313
Easy, Chewie.

216
00:33:15,282 --> 00:33:16,740
Help!

217
00:33:23,498 --> 00:33:25,705
Chewie, you're hit?
Where is it?

218
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:33,257
Han, Chewie!

219
00:33:33,383 --> 00:33:34,414
Lando.

220
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:43,845
Boba Fett?

221
00:33:45,895 --> 00:33:47,306
Boba Fett? Where?

222
00:34:20,512 --> 00:34:22,505
- Lando, grab it!
- Lower it!

223
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,015
I'm trying!

224
00:34:46,162 --> 00:34:48,570
Grab me, Chewie.
Grab it!

225
00:35:01,302 --> 00:35:03,544
Grab it. Almost.
You almost got it.

226
00:35:12,938 --> 00:35:14,267
Gently, now.

227
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:16,438
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.

228
00:35:28,203 --> 00:35:29,746
Chewie, give me the gun.

229
00:35:29,872 --> 00:35:32,873
- Don't move, Lando.
- Wait! I thought you were blind!

230
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,993
I can see a lot better.
Don't move.

231
00:35:35,127 --> 00:35:36,669
A little higher!

232
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,832
Chewie, pull us up.

233
00:35:42,968 --> 00:35:44,510
Up, Chewie. Up.

234
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:47,924
We gotta get out of here.

235
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,432
Not my eyes! R2, help!

236
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,474
Quickly, R2!

237
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:55,052
Beast!

238
00:36:00,443 --> 00:36:02,270
Get the gun!

239
00:36:02,404 --> 00:36:03,649
Point it at the deck.

240
00:36:09,203 --> 00:36:10,745
Point it at the deck!

241
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,079
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly-

242
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:23,757
Come on.

243
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:34,263
- Let's go. Don't forget the droids.
- We're on our way.

244
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:15,550
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

245
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:18,305
<i>Hurry. The Alliance
should be assembled by now.</i>

246
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:21,106
<i>- I will.
- Luke, thanks.</i>

247
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:24,482
<i>Thanks for coming after me.
Now I owe you one.</i>

248
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:32,606
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

249
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,282
I have a promise to keep...

250
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:43,374
to an old friend.

251
00:38:34,553 --> 00:38:36,012
Rise, my friend.

252
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:45,978
The Death Star will be
completed on schedule.

253
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:49,264
You've done well, Lord Vader.

254
00:38:49,401 --> 00:38:55,236
<i>Now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.</i>

255
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,111
Yes, my master.

256
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:02,532
Patience, my friend.

257
00:39:02,664 --> 00:39:05,997
In time, he will seek you out.

258
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:10,538
<i>When he does,
you must bring him before me.</i>

259
00:39:10,671 --> 00:39:12,960
He has grown strong.

260
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:18,761
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

261
00:39:18,888 --> 00:39:20,632
As you wish.

262
00:39:22,267 --> 00:39:26,264
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.

263
00:39:52,713 --> 00:39:54,539
That face you make-

264
00:39:55,632 --> 00:39:58,170
Look I so old to young eyes?

265
00:39:58,301 --> 00:40:00,045
No, of course not.

266
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:03,096
I do.

267
00:40:06,226 --> 00:40:08,183
Yes, I do.

268
00:40:10,355 --> 00:40:12,846
Sick have I become.

269
00:40:12,982 --> 00:40:14,940
Old and weak.

270
00:40:19,614 --> 00:40:21,524
When 900 years old you reach...

271
00:40:21,658 --> 00:40:23,484
look as good you will not.

272
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,498
Soon will I rest.

273
00:40:32,627 --> 00:40:35,747
Yes. Forever sleep.

274
00:40:37,382 --> 00:40:39,006
Earned it I have.

275
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:41,802
Master Yoda, you can't die.

276
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:46,057
Strong am I with the Force...

277
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:48,139
but not that strong.

278
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:55,977
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

279
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:01,570
That is the way of things...

280
00:41:03,783 --> 00:41:05,906
the way of the Force.

281
00:41:07,827 --> 00:41:09,701
But I need your help.

282
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,996
I've come back
to complete the training.

283
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,248
No more training do you require.

284
00:41:15,377 --> 00:41:18,497
Already know you
that which you need.

285
00:41:21,634 --> 00:41:23,874
Then I am a Jedi.

286
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:32,469
Not yet.

287
00:41:32,602 --> 00:41:34,595
One thing remains-

288
00:41:35,647 --> 00:41:40,059
Vader. You must confront Vader.

289
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,988
Then- only then-
a Jedi will you be.

290
00:41:46,741 --> 00:41:48,864
And confront him you will.

291
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:54,998
Master Yoda...

292
00:41:58,753 --> 00:42:01,160
is Darth Vader my father?

293
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,790
Rest I need.

294
00:42:06,927 --> 00:42:08,338
Yes.

295
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,095
Rest.

296
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:13,972
Yoda, I must know.

297
00:42:18,314 --> 00:42:20,472
Your father he is.

298
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,318
Told you, did he?

299
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:32,452
Yes.

300
00:42:34,288 --> 00:42:36,576
Unexpected this is.

301
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:39,994
And unfortunate.

302
00:42:41,795 --> 00:42:43,834
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

303
00:42:43,964 --> 00:42:45,244
No.

304
00:42:48,468 --> 00:42:52,382
<i>Unfortunate that
you rushed to face him...</i>

305
00:42:52,513 --> 00:42:55,051
that incomplete
was your training...

306
00:42:56,142 --> 00:42:59,642
that not ready
for the burden were you.

307
00:43:01,648 --> 00:43:03,273
I'm sorry.

308
00:43:04,484 --> 00:43:09,988
Remember, a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

309
00:43:15,036 --> 00:43:16,779
But beware.

310
00:43:16,913 --> 00:43:20,447
Anger, fear, aggression...

311
00:43:20,582 --> 00:43:23,204
the dark side are they.

312
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:27,662
Once you start down the dark path...

313
00:43:27,798 --> 00:43:31,547
forever will it dominate your destiny.

314
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:40,552
Do not-

315
00:43:43,647 --> 00:43:48,144
Do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

316
00:43:49,236 --> 00:43:52,687
or suffer your father's fate you will.

317
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,200
When gone am I...

318
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,165
the last of the Jedi will you be.

319
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,751
The Force runs strong in your family.

320
00:44:14,261 --> 00:44:17,843
Pass on what you have learned.

321
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,482
There is...

322
00:44:30,652 --> 00:44:32,312
another...

323
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:40,820
Skywalker.

324
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,512
I can't do it, R2.

325
00:45:47,394 --> 00:45:49,800
I can't go on alone.

326
00:45:49,937 --> 00:45:52,096
<i>Yoda will always be with you.</i>

327
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,389
Obi-Wan.

328
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:04,074
Why didn't you tell me?

329
00:46:04,201 --> 00:46:08,069
You told me Vader betrayed
and murdered my father.

330
00:46:08,205 --> 00:46:13,710
Your father was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

331
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:17,751
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

332
00:46:17,882 --> 00:46:19,375
When that happened...

333
00:46:19,508 --> 00:46:22,675
<i>the good man who was
your father was destroyed.</i>

334
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,128
So what I told you was true...

335
00:46:26,265 --> 00:46:28,092
from a certain point of view.

336
00:46:28,225 --> 00:46:30,681
A certain point of view?

337
00:46:30,811 --> 00:46:34,678
Luke, you're going to find
that many of the truths we cling to...

338
00:46:34,814 --> 00:46:37,732
depend greatly
on our own point of view.

339
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:41,231
Anakin was a good friend.

340
00:46:42,197 --> 00:46:43,775
When I first knew him...

341
00:46:43,907 --> 00:46:46,066
<i>your father was already a great pilot...</i>

342
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:49,819
but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.

343
00:46:49,954 --> 00:46:53,904
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

344
00:46:54,042 --> 00:46:57,956
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

345
00:46:58,088 --> 00:46:59,368
I was wrong.

346
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,214
There is still good in him.

347
00:47:02,342 --> 00:47:05,093
He's more machine now than man...

348
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:07,176
twisted and evil.

349
00:47:08,931 --> 00:47:11,138
I can't do it, Ben.

350
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:13,176
You cannot escape your destiny.

351
00:47:13,311 --> 00:47:16,561
You must face Darth Vader again.

352
00:47:16,689 --> 00:47:19,476
I can't kill my own father.

353
00:47:22,736 --> 00:47:25,821
Then the emperor has already won.

354
00:47:26,866 --> 00:47:29,108
You were our only hope.

355
00:47:30,411 --> 00:47:32,533
Yoda spoke of another.

356
00:47:34,581 --> 00:47:37,155
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.

357
00:47:38,085 --> 00:47:40,042
But I have no sister.

358
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:43,081
To protect you both
from the emperor...

359
00:47:43,215 --> 00:47:46,798
<i>you were hidden from your father
when you were born.</i>

360
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:49,382
The emperor knew, as I did...

361
00:47:49,513 --> 00:47:53,213
if Anakin were to have any offspring...

362
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,888
they would be a threat to him.

363
00:47:56,019 --> 00:48:01,310
That is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous.

364
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:07,810
- Leia is my sister.
- Your insight serves you well.

365
00:48:09,115 --> 00:48:11,986
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

366
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:14,491
They do you credit...

367
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:17,705
but they could be made
to serve the emperor.

368
00:48:40,188 --> 00:48:42,857
Look at you. A general, huh?

369
00:48:42,982 --> 00:48:46,067
Someone must have told them about
my manoeuvre at the Battle of Tanaab.

370
00:48:46,194 --> 00:48:49,064
Don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

371
00:48:49,196 --> 00:48:52,150
I didn't know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack.

372
00:48:52,283 --> 00:48:54,406
I'm surprised they didn't
ask you to do it.

373
00:48:55,286 --> 00:48:57,243
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.

374
00:48:57,371 --> 00:48:59,163
You're the respectable one, remember?

375
00:49:07,506 --> 00:49:10,460
The emperor's made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.

376
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:15,127
The data brought to us by the Bothan
spies pinpoint the exact location...

377
00:49:15,264 --> 00:49:17,386
of the emperor's new battle station.

378
00:49:17,515 --> 00:49:19,307
We also know
that the weapon systems...

379
00:49:19,434 --> 00:49:21,676
of this Death Star
are not yet operational.

380
00:49:21,811 --> 00:49:24,766
With the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy...

381
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:26,392
in a vain effort to engage us...

382
00:49:26,525 --> 00:49:28,399
it is relatively unprotected.

383
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:30,566
But most important of all...

384
00:49:31,487 --> 00:49:33,397
we've learned that
the emperor himself...

385
00:49:33,531 --> 00:49:35,654
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

386
00:49:35,783 --> 00:49:38,239
of the construction
of this Death Star.

387
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,581
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

388
00:49:46,127 --> 00:49:47,455
Admiral Ackbar, please.

389
00:49:47,586 --> 00:49:52,712
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

390
00:49:52,842 --> 00:49:58,299
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational...

391
00:49:58,431 --> 00:50:01,930
the Death Star does have
a strong defence mechanism.

392
00:50:03,227 --> 00:50:05,516
It is protected by an energy shield...

393
00:50:05,646 --> 00:50:09,264
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of Endor.

394
00:50:14,906 --> 00:50:18,653
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

395
00:50:20,077 --> 00:50:23,991
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter...

396
00:50:24,123 --> 00:50:27,040
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure...

397
00:50:27,168 --> 00:50:30,121
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor.

398
00:50:33,006 --> 00:50:36,007
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

399
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:37,415
Good luck.

400
00:50:39,054 --> 00:50:41,011
You're gonna need it.

401
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:42,848
General Madine.

402
00:50:43,892 --> 00:50:46,809
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.

403
00:50:46,936 --> 00:50:51,148
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code...

404
00:50:51,274 --> 00:50:56,067
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

405
00:50:56,196 --> 00:50:57,441
Sounds dangerous.

406
00:50:57,572 --> 00:50:59,860
Wonder who they found
to pull that off.

407
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:02,992
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

408
00:51:03,786 --> 00:51:07,036
My team's ready. I don't have
a command crew for the shuttle.

409
00:51:08,207 --> 00:51:10,284
It's gonna be rough.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

410
00:51:12,754 --> 00:51:16,703
- That's one.
- General, count me in.

411
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:18,750
I'm with you too.

412
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,392
- What is it?
- Ask me again sometime.

413
00:51:28,436 --> 00:51:31,140
Hi, Han, Chewie.

414
00:51:32,272 --> 00:51:34,728
"Exciting" is hardly the word
I would choose.

415
00:51:50,332 --> 00:51:53,368
Look, I want you to take her.

416
00:51:53,502 --> 00:51:55,044
I mean it. Take her.

417
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:58,586
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

418
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:01,040
All right, old buddy.

419
00:52:01,176 --> 00:52:03,168
I know what she means to you.

420
00:52:03,303 --> 00:52:07,004
I'll take good care of her.
She won't get a scratch.

421
00:52:08,308 --> 00:52:09,719
All right?

422
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:11,132
Right.

423
00:52:18,026 --> 00:52:20,599
I got your promise.
Not a scratch.

424
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,895
Would you get going, you pirate?

425
00:52:24,657 --> 00:52:25,820
Good luck.

426
00:52:25,951 --> 00:52:27,445
You too.

427
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,543
- Got her warmed?
- Yeah, she's coming up.

428
00:52:41,215 --> 00:52:44,833
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees
in mind when they designed her, Chewie.

429
00:52:55,146 --> 00:52:57,103
Hey, you awake?

430
00:52:57,231 --> 00:53:00,682
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.

431
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:05,192
Come on, General. Let's move.

432
00:53:05,322 --> 00:53:08,656
Right. Chewie, let's see
what this piece of junk can do.

433
00:53:08,784 --> 00:53:10,990
- Ready, everybody?
- All set.

434
00:53:13,538 --> 00:53:15,329
Here we go again.

435
00:53:26,343 --> 00:53:28,251
All right, hang on.

436
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:47,060
What is thy bidding, my master?

437
00:53:48,114 --> 00:53:51,483
Send the fleet
to the far side of Endor.

438
00:53:54,496 --> 00:53:59,073
There it will stay until called for.

439
00:54:00,459 --> 00:54:04,504
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?

440
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,623
It is of no concern.

441
00:54:07,425 --> 00:54:11,672
Soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

442
00:54:11,804 --> 00:54:13,595
Your work here is finished, my friend.

443
00:54:13,722 --> 00:54:16,391
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.

444
00:54:16,517 --> 00:54:18,426
Yes, my master.

445
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:37,196
If they don't go for this, we're gonna
have to get out pretty quick.

446
00:54:39,456 --> 00:54:42,125
<i>We have you on our screen now.
Please identify.</i>

447
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,494
<i>Shuttle Tydirium requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.</i>

448
00:54:53,178 --> 00:54:57,222
<i>Shuttle Tydirium, transmit
the clearance code for shield passage.</i>

449
00:54:58,641 --> 00:55:00,052
Transmission commencing.

450
00:55:00,184 --> 00:55:03,185
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.

451
00:55:04,314 --> 00:55:06,472
It'll work. It'll work.

452
00:55:07,859 --> 00:55:10,017
Vader's on that ship.

453
00:55:10,153 --> 00:55:11,979
Don't get jittery, Luke.

454
00:55:12,112 --> 00:55:14,319
There are a lot of command ships.

455
00:55:15,408 --> 00:55:18,990
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't
look like you're keeping your distance.

456
00:55:20,246 --> 00:55:22,702
I don't know. Fly casual.

457
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:29,835
Where is that shuttle going?

458
00:55:30,714 --> 00:55:33,003
<i>Shuttle Tydirium,
what is your cargo and destination?</i>

459
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,050
<i>Parts and technical crew
for the forest moon.</i>

460
00:55:39,265 --> 00:55:41,885
Do they have a code clearance?

461
00:55:42,684 --> 00:55:44,926
It's an older code, sir,
but it checks out.

462
00:55:45,062 --> 00:55:47,019
I was about to clear them.

463
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,102
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

464
00:55:54,238 --> 00:55:56,526
It's your imagination, kid.

465
00:55:56,656 --> 00:55:59,408
Come on. Let's keep
a little optimism here.

466
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:09,001
Shall I hold them?

467
00:56:10,087 --> 00:56:12,956
No. Leave them to me.

468
00:56:13,089 --> 00:56:15,378
I will deal with them myself.

469
00:56:16,259 --> 00:56:18,465
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.

470
00:56:20,347 --> 00:56:22,220
They're not going for it, Chewie.

471
00:56:26,435 --> 00:56:28,143
<i>Shuttle Tydirium...</i>

472
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:30,643
<i>deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately.</i>

473
00:56:30,773 --> 00:56:33,062
<i>Follow your present course.</i>

474
00:56:33,192 --> 00:56:35,683
Okay. I told you
it was gonna work.

475
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:36,983
No problem.

476
00:57:10,395 --> 00:57:12,435
I told you it was dangerous here.

477
00:57:27,871 --> 00:57:31,322
- Should we try and go around?
- It'll take time.

478
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:34,459
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.

479
00:57:37,297 --> 00:57:39,585
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

480
00:57:39,715 --> 00:57:42,385
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.

481
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:43,885
Hey...

482
00:57:44,011 --> 00:57:45,292
it's me.

483
00:58:10,913 --> 00:58:12,905
Go for help! Go!

484
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,534
Great. Come on!

485
00:58:30,098 --> 00:58:32,056
Over there! Two more of them.

486
00:58:33,101 --> 00:58:35,390
I see them. Wait. Leia!

487
00:58:39,274 --> 00:58:40,732
Hey, wait!

488
00:58:47,032 --> 00:58:49,487
Quick, jam their comlink.
Centre switch.

489
00:59:01,129 --> 00:59:02,706
Move closer.

490
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:06,634
Get alongside that one.

491
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,173
Keep on that one.
I'll take these two.

492
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,843
General Solo, somebody's coming.

493
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:20,313
Where's Leia?

494
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:23,607
- She didn't come back?
- I thought she was with you.

495
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:26,235
We got separated.
We better go look for her.

496
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:29,408
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet
at the shield generator at 0300.

497
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,581
Come on, R2.
We'll need your scanners.

498
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:35,458
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.

499
01:02:36,965 --> 01:02:39,088
And you said it was pretty here.

500
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:03,739
Cut it out.

501
01:03:20,591 --> 01:03:22,667
I'm not gonna hurt you.

502
01:03:30,726 --> 01:03:33,396
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

503
01:03:35,397 --> 01:03:37,686
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.

504
01:03:38,734 --> 01:03:40,691
Maybe you can help me.

505
01:03:41,945 --> 01:03:43,653
Come on. Sit down.

506
01:03:45,699 --> 01:03:47,739
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.

507
01:03:49,495 --> 01:03:51,985
All right.
You want something to eat?

508
01:03:58,754 --> 01:04:00,212
That's right.

509
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:06,842
Come on.

510
01:04:27,073 --> 01:04:28,448
Look. It's a hat.

511
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:30,532
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.

512
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:39,623
You're a jittery little thing,
aren't you?

513
01:04:44,924 --> 01:04:46,466
What is it?

514
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:27,370
Freeze!

515
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:29,714
Come on. Get up.

516
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:36,925
- Get your ride. Take her back to base.
- Yes, sir.

517
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:42,892
What the-

518
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,529
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

519
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:47,412
I told you to remain
on the command ship.

520
01:06:49,128 --> 01:06:53,874
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

521
01:06:55,468 --> 01:06:57,176
Yes, I know.

522
01:06:58,722 --> 01:07:00,928
My son is with them.

523
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:07,226
- Are you sure?
- I have felt him, my master.

524
01:07:08,689 --> 01:07:11,181
Strange that I have not.

525
01:07:12,777 --> 01:07:17,984
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

526
01:07:18,115 --> 01:07:20,867
They are clear, my master.

527
01:07:20,993 --> 01:07:25,240
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.

528
01:07:25,373 --> 01:07:28,374
He will come to me?

529
01:07:30,628 --> 01:07:32,952
I have foreseen it.

530
01:07:33,088 --> 01:07:37,133
His compassion for you
will be his undoing.

531
01:07:37,259 --> 01:07:41,173
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.

532
01:07:41,972 --> 01:07:43,514
As you wish.

533
01:08:05,078 --> 01:08:06,489
Master Luke.

534
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:12,960
There's two more
wrecked speeders back there.

535
01:08:13,086 --> 01:08:14,995
And I found this.

536
01:08:16,505 --> 01:08:20,883
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

537
01:08:23,304 --> 01:08:24,929
I hope she's all right.

538
01:08:29,894 --> 01:08:31,009
What, Chewie?

539
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:35,516
What, Chewie?

540
01:08:49,163 --> 01:08:52,532
I don't get it.
It's just a dead animal.

541
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,249
Chewie, wait! Don't!

542
01:08:59,799 --> 01:09:01,257
Nice work.

543
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:04,878
Great, Chewie.

544
01:09:05,011 --> 01:09:07,088
Great. Always thinking
with your stomach.

545
01:09:07,222 --> 01:09:10,389
Take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.

546
01:09:10,517 --> 01:09:12,225
Han, can you reach my lightsabre?

547
01:09:12,353 --> 01:09:13,811
Yeah. Sure.

548
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:23,398
R2, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

549
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:25,523
It's a very long drop!

550
01:10:08,449 --> 01:10:11,367
Hey. Point that thing
someplace else.

551
01:10:15,914 --> 01:10:17,029
Hey!

552
01:10:17,165 --> 01:10:19,621
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

553
01:10:25,883 --> 01:10:28,338
Chewie, give them your crossbow.

554
01:10:30,428 --> 01:10:32,053
Oh, my head.

555
01:10:36,309 --> 01:10:38,101
Oh, my goodness.

556
01:11:09,926 --> 01:11:11,835
Do you understand
anything they're saying?

557
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:13,381
Oh, yes, Master Luke.

558
01:11:13,513 --> 01:11:16,299
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms-

559
01:11:16,432 --> 01:11:18,056
What are you telling them?

560
01:11:19,268 --> 01:11:21,344
"Hello," I think.

561
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:24,515
I could be mistaken-
they're using a very primitive dialect-

562
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:28,184
but I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.

563
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:36,986
Why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?

564
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:39,990
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

565
01:11:40,998 --> 01:11:42,373
Proper?

566
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:45,120
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.

567
01:11:45,252 --> 01:11:46,497
Why, you-

568
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,214
My mistake.

569
01:11:57,931 --> 01:11:59,888
He's an old friend of mine.

570
01:12:27,043 --> 01:12:28,418
Hey.

571
01:12:45,602 --> 01:12:48,058
I have a really bad feeling about this.

572
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:10,662
What did he say?

573
01:13:10,794 --> 01:13:13,119
I'm rather embarrassed,
General Solo...

574
01:13:13,254 --> 01:13:16,754
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honour.

575
01:13:34,275 --> 01:13:36,648
Your Royal Highness.

576
01:13:36,778 --> 01:13:38,521
These are my friends.

577
01:13:41,616 --> 01:13:45,827
3PO, tell them
they must be set free.

578
01:14:03,637 --> 01:14:06,804
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.

579
01:14:06,932 --> 01:14:10,847
3PO, tell them
if they don't do as you wish...

580
01:14:10,978 --> 01:14:12,935
<i>you'll become angry
and use your magic.</i>

581
01:14:13,063 --> 01:14:15,435
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly-

582
01:14:15,566 --> 01:14:17,108
Tell them.

583
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:35,117
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...

584
01:14:35,252 --> 01:14:36,829
just as I said they wouldn't.

585
01:14:36,962 --> 01:14:38,242
Wait.

586
01:14:46,888 --> 01:14:48,762
What's happening?

587
01:14:54,187 --> 01:14:55,895
Put me down!
Help!

588
01:14:56,023 --> 01:14:57,564
Somebody!

589
01:14:57,690 --> 01:14:59,018
Somebody help!

590
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:01,855
Master Luke! R2, quickly!

591
01:15:33,601 --> 01:15:34,976
Thank goodness.

592
01:15:47,322 --> 01:15:48,982
Thanks, 3PO.

593
01:15:50,242 --> 01:15:52,199
I never knew I had it in me.

594
01:15:59,793 --> 01:16:01,251
...Tatooine...

595
01:16:02,671 --> 01:16:05,078
Princess Leia... R2.

596
01:16:07,259 --> 01:16:08,718
...Darth Vader!

597
01:16:11,846 --> 01:16:13,589
...Death Star.

598
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:18,843
...Jedi... Obi-Wan Kenobi.

599
01:16:24,442 --> 01:16:26,315
Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.

600
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:30,776
Master Luke...

601
01:16:37,455 --> 01:16:41,072
<i>...Millennium Falcon... Cloud City.</i>

602
01:16:43,752 --> 01:16:44,832
...Vader!

603
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,125
Han Solo...

604
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,759
...carbon.

605
01:16:52,345 --> 01:16:53,590
...Sarlacc.

606
01:17:15,242 --> 01:17:18,077
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

607
01:17:31,841 --> 01:17:34,511
Wonderful. We are now
a part of the tribe.

608
01:17:35,929 --> 01:17:37,803
Just what I always wanted.

609
01:17:49,609 --> 01:17:51,898
Short help's better than
no help at all, Chewie.

610
01:17:57,533 --> 01:18:00,736
The scouts will show us the quickest
way to the shield generator.

611
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:02,827
Good. How far is it?

612
01:18:02,955 --> 01:18:04,580
Ask him.

613
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:07,915
We need some fresh supplies too.

614
01:18:08,044 --> 01:18:09,952
Try and get our weapons back.

615
01:18:11,463 --> 01:18:13,670
Hurry up.
I haven't got all day.

616
01:18:16,176 --> 01:18:18,050
Luke, what's wrong?

617
01:18:19,972 --> 01:18:23,424
<i>Leia, do you remember
your mother-</i>

618
01:18:23,559 --> 01:18:25,598
<i>your real mother?</i>

619
01:18:25,727 --> 01:18:29,227
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

620
01:18:29,356 --> 01:18:31,265
What do you remember?

621
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,973
Just images really. Feelings.

622
01:18:34,111 --> 01:18:35,688
Tell me.

623
01:18:37,406 --> 01:18:40,441
She was... very beautiful.

624
01:18:40,575 --> 01:18:43,196
Kind... but sad.

625
01:18:45,372 --> 01:18:48,159
Why are you asking me this?

626
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:50,747
I have no memory of my mother.

627
01:18:51,795 --> 01:18:53,787
I never knew her.

628
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:57,748
Luke, tell me.
What's troubling you?

629
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:06,465
Vader is here.
Now. On this moon.

630
01:19:08,103 --> 01:19:09,810
How do you know?

631
01:19:09,937 --> 01:19:11,846
I felt his presence.

632
01:19:12,898 --> 01:19:16,149
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.

633
01:19:16,277 --> 01:19:18,151
That's why I have to go.

634
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:21,731
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

635
01:19:22,784 --> 01:19:25,737
- I have to face him.
- Why?

636
01:19:30,749 --> 01:19:32,623
He's my father.

637
01:19:36,672 --> 01:19:38,214
Your father?

638
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:43,506
There's more. It won't be easy
for you to hear it, but you must.

639
01:19:43,637 --> 01:19:46,472
<i>If I don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.</i>

640
01:19:46,598 --> 01:19:48,093
Don't talk that way.

641
01:19:48,225 --> 01:19:52,720
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

642
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:54,847
You're wrong, Leia.

643
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:56,808
You have that power too.

644
01:19:56,941 --> 01:20:00,275
In time, you'll learn
to use it as I have.

645
01:20:04,908 --> 01:20:07,150
The Force is strong in my family.

646
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,612
My father has it.

647
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,913
I have it.

648
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:15,370
And...

649
01:20:16,669 --> 01:20:19,042
my sister has it.

650
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:28,464
Yes. It's you, Leia.

651
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:35,353
I know.

652
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:39,815
Somehow...

653
01:20:41,527 --> 01:20:43,105
I've always known.

654
01:20:43,237 --> 01:20:45,194
Then you know
why I have to face him.

655
01:20:47,325 --> 01:20:49,732
Luke, run away.
Far away.

656
01:20:49,869 --> 01:20:53,202
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.

657
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:56,580
- I wish I could go with you.
- No, you don't.

658
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:58,666
You've always been strong.

659
01:20:59,962 --> 01:21:02,251
But why must you confront him?

660
01:21:02,381 --> 01:21:06,082
Because there is good in him.
I've felt it.

661
01:21:06,218 --> 01:21:08,210
He won't turn me over
to the emperor.

662
01:21:08,345 --> 01:21:11,464
I can save him. I can turn him
back to the good side.

663
01:21:12,891 --> 01:21:14,682
I have to try.

664
01:21:33,203 --> 01:21:35,112
Hey, what's going on?

665
01:21:36,914 --> 01:21:40,200
Nothing. I just wanna
be alone for a little while.

666
01:21:41,586 --> 01:21:43,210
Nothing?

667
01:21:45,006 --> 01:21:46,915
Tell me.
What's going on?

668
01:21:52,096 --> 01:21:54,254
I can't tell you.

669
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:58,513
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?

670
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:17,995
I'm sorry.

671
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:23,416
Hold me.

672
01:23:16,721 --> 01:23:18,595
This is the rebel that surrendered to us.

673
01:23:18,723 --> 01:23:21,640
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them...

674
01:23:21,767 --> 01:23:24,472
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

675
01:23:25,562 --> 01:23:28,267
He was armed only with this.

676
01:23:30,276 --> 01:23:31,984
Good work, Commander.

677
01:23:32,111 --> 01:23:34,020
Leave us.

678
01:23:34,155 --> 01:23:37,819
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.

679
01:23:39,284 --> 01:23:41,028
Yes, my lord.

680
01:23:42,871 --> 01:23:44,994
The emperor has been expecting you.

681
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:47,786
I know, Father.

682
01:23:49,295 --> 01:23:51,619
So, you have accepted the truth.

683
01:23:52,797 --> 01:23:56,297
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

684
01:23:56,426 --> 01:23:59,629
That name no longer
has any meaning for me.

685
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:03,182
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

686
01:24:03,976 --> 01:24:05,599
I know there is good in you.

687
01:24:05,727 --> 01:24:08,348
The emperor hasn't
driven it from you fully.

688
01:24:12,317 --> 01:24:14,523
<i>That was why
you couldn't destroy me.</i>

689
01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:18,108
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

690
01:24:25,371 --> 01:24:28,408
I see you have constructed
a new lightsabre.

691
01:24:32,045 --> 01:24:34,998
Your skills are complete.

692
01:24:40,219 --> 01:24:44,798
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.

693
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:51,513
Come with me.

694
01:24:53,607 --> 01:24:56,478
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

695
01:24:57,778 --> 01:25:02,571
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

696
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:05,451
I must obey my master.

697
01:25:06,536 --> 01:25:09,952
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.

698
01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:13,906
If that is your destiny.

699
01:25:14,044 --> 01:25:17,828
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.

700
01:25:17,965 --> 01:25:20,585
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

701
01:25:21,843 --> 01:25:25,259
It is too late for me, son.

702
01:25:28,475 --> 01:25:32,804
The emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

703
01:25:32,938 --> 01:25:36,555
He is your master now.

704
01:25:40,612 --> 01:25:43,019
Then my father is truly dead.

705
01:26:26,031 --> 01:26:27,940
The main entrance
to the control bunker...

706
01:26:28,075 --> 01:26:30,068
is on the far side
of that landing platform.

707
01:26:30,953 --> 01:26:34,570
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- Don't worry.

708
01:26:34,706 --> 01:26:37,826
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

709
01:26:46,176 --> 01:26:47,800
What's he saying?

710
01:26:47,927 --> 01:26:51,261
He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.

711
01:27:10,491 --> 01:27:13,860
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.

712
01:27:14,746 --> 01:27:16,703
Proceed with the countdown.

713
01:27:17,915 --> 01:27:20,370
All groups assume attack coordinates.

714
01:27:23,754 --> 01:27:25,711
Don't worry.
My friend's down there.

715
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,378
He'll have that shield down on time.

716
01:27:31,345 --> 01:27:33,836
Or this'll be
the shortest offensive of all time.

717
01:27:35,807 --> 01:27:39,508
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

718
01:27:39,645 --> 01:27:41,602
All right. Stand by.

719
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:03,330
Back door, huh? Good idea.

720
01:28:11,718 --> 01:28:14,672
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

721
01:28:19,851 --> 01:28:22,686
It only takes one to sound the alarm.

722
01:28:22,812 --> 01:28:25,303
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

723
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,931
- Oh, my. Princess Leia.
- Quiet.

724
01:28:29,277 --> 01:28:31,067
I'm afraid our furry companion...

725
01:28:31,195 --> 01:28:33,318
has gone and done something
rather rash.

726
01:28:38,828 --> 01:28:40,785
There goes our surprise attack.

727
01:28:48,086 --> 01:28:50,328
Look, over there! Stop him!

728
01:29:02,225 --> 01:29:05,262
Not bad for a little furball.
There's only one left.

729
01:29:05,395 --> 01:29:07,851
You stay here.
We'll take care of this.

730
01:29:09,983 --> 01:29:12,190
I have decided that we shall stay here.

731
01:29:42,357 --> 01:29:43,352
Hey!

732
01:30:47,203 --> 01:30:49,990
Welcome, young Skywalker.

733
01:30:50,123 --> 01:30:52,448
I have been expecting you.

734
01:30:53,501 --> 01:30:55,459
You'll no longer need those.

735
01:31:00,925 --> 01:31:02,799
Guards, leave us.

736
01:31:10,226 --> 01:31:13,678
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

737
01:31:13,813 --> 01:31:18,889
In time, you will call me master.

738
01:31:19,026 --> 01:31:21,482
You're gravely mistaken.

739
01:31:21,612 --> 01:31:23,735
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

740
01:31:24,615 --> 01:31:28,364
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

741
01:31:30,495 --> 01:31:34,576
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...

742
01:31:36,001 --> 01:31:40,129
about a great many things.

743
01:31:41,841 --> 01:31:43,465
His lightsabre.

744
01:31:43,592 --> 01:31:47,257
Ah, yes. A Jedi's weapon.

745
01:31:48,054 --> 01:31:50,462
Much like your father's.

746
01:31:50,599 --> 01:31:55,391
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

747
01:31:55,521 --> 01:31:58,356
So will it be with you.

748
01:31:58,481 --> 01:32:00,521
You're wrong.

749
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:03,734
Soon I'll be dead-
and you with me.

750
01:32:07,198 --> 01:32:11,493
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.

751
01:32:12,329 --> 01:32:13,739
Yes.

752
01:32:13,871 --> 01:32:18,996
I assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.

753
01:32:20,169 --> 01:32:23,040
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

754
01:32:23,173 --> 01:32:26,292
Your faith in your friends is yours.

755
01:32:28,844 --> 01:32:32,427
It is pointless to resist, my son.

756
01:32:36,477 --> 01:32:41,934
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

757
01:32:42,066 --> 01:32:45,269
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

758
01:32:45,402 --> 01:32:49,732
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

759
01:32:51,659 --> 01:32:54,150
It was I who allowed the Alliance...

760
01:32:54,286 --> 01:32:57,701
to know the location
of the shield generator.

761
01:32:57,831 --> 01:33:01,876
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

762
01:33:02,002 --> 01:33:06,249
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

763
01:33:08,759 --> 01:33:12,507
I'm afraid the deflector shield...

764
01:33:12,637 --> 01:33:17,844
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

765
01:33:21,396 --> 01:33:22,725
All right!

766
01:33:22,856 --> 01:33:24,350
Up! Move!

767
01:33:24,483 --> 01:33:25,941
Quickly. Quickly.

768
01:33:30,446 --> 01:33:32,071
Han, hurry.

769
01:33:32,198 --> 01:33:34,072
The fleet will be here any moment.

770
01:33:35,785 --> 01:33:38,027
Charges. Come on. Come on!

771
01:33:40,165 --> 01:33:41,992
Oh, my. They'll be captured.

772
01:33:44,877 --> 01:33:46,585
Wait! Come back!

773
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:50,881
R2, stay with me.

774
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:53,551
Freeze!

775
01:33:56,931 --> 01:33:58,888
You rebel scum.

776
01:34:18,577 --> 01:34:21,946
- All wings report in.
- Red Leader standing by.

777
01:34:22,081 --> 01:34:25,247
- Grey Leader standing by.
- Green Leader standing by.

778
01:34:26,127 --> 01:34:28,249
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

779
01:34:31,923 --> 01:34:34,046
May the Force be with us.

780
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:40,639
We've gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield- up or down.

781
01:34:42,308 --> 01:34:44,978
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know-

782
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:47,598
if we're coming.

783
01:34:47,730 --> 01:34:51,230
Break off the attack.
The shield is still up.

784
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:53,435
I get no reading. You sure?

785
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:55,728
<i>Pull up! All craft pull up!</i>

786
01:35:00,243 --> 01:35:04,193
Take evasive action. Green Group,
stick close to Holding Sector MV-7.

787
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,792
Admiral, we have
enemy ships in Sector 47.

788
01:35:08,918 --> 01:35:10,413
It's a trap.

789
01:35:14,006 --> 01:35:15,963
Fighters coming in.

790
01:35:19,428 --> 01:35:20,757
There's too many.

791
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:27,468
Accelerate to attack speed.
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

792
01:35:27,603 --> 01:35:28,634
Copy, Gold Leader.

793
01:35:32,066 --> 01:35:33,560
Come, boy.

794
01:35:34,443 --> 01:35:36,400
See for yourself.

795
01:35:39,073 --> 01:35:44,279
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance...

796
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:48,243
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.

797
01:35:53,504 --> 01:35:55,828
You want this...

798
01:35:56,631 --> 01:35:58,505
don't you?

799
01:35:58,633 --> 01:36:03,129
The hate is swelling in you now.

800
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:06,089
Take your Jedi weapon.

801
01:36:06,224 --> 01:36:07,968
Use it.

802
01:36:08,101 --> 01:36:10,059
I am unarmed.

803
01:36:10,187 --> 01:36:12,060
Strike me down with it.

804
01:36:12,188 --> 01:36:14,726
Give in to your anger.

805
01:36:15,775 --> 01:36:20,900
<i>With each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant.</i>

806
01:36:27,495 --> 01:36:29,534
It is unavoidable.

807
01:36:30,623 --> 01:36:32,746
It is your destiny.

808
01:36:33,793 --> 01:36:36,913
You, like your father...

809
01:36:37,046 --> 01:36:38,671
are now...

810
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:41,214
mine.

811
01:36:59,359 --> 01:37:01,685
All right, move it.

812
01:37:09,702 --> 01:37:11,327
Hello. I say, over there.

813
01:37:12,288 --> 01:37:14,447
Were you looking for me?

814
01:37:15,792 --> 01:37:17,832
Bring those two down here.

815
01:37:25,468 --> 01:37:29,762
They're on their way.
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

816
01:37:29,889 --> 01:37:31,218
Freeze.

817
01:37:31,349 --> 01:37:32,464
Don't move.

818
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,510
We surrender.

819
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:42,057
The code's changed.

820
01:39:42,185 --> 01:39:44,558
- We need R2.
- Here's the terminal.

821
01:39:44,688 --> 01:39:46,681
R2, where are you?

822
01:39:46,815 --> 01:39:48,772
We need you at the bunker
right away.

823
01:39:50,861 --> 01:39:52,355
Going? What do you mean?

824
01:39:54,072 --> 01:39:55,696
Going where, R2?

825
01:39:55,824 --> 01:40:00,035
Wait. R2, this is
no time for heroics.

826
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:01,822
Come back!

827
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:29,855
Watch yourself, Wedge.
Three from above.

828
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:32,900
- Red Three, Red Two, pull in.
- Got it.

829
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:37,898
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

830
01:40:38,031 --> 01:40:39,739
Cut left.
I'll take the leader.

831
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:49,827
They're heading
for the medical frigate.

832
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,038
Pressure's steady.

833
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:08,510
Only the fighters are attacking.
What are the Stardestroyers waiting for?

834
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:14,858
We're in attack position, sir.

835
01:41:14,985 --> 01:41:18,152
- Hold here.
- We're not going to attack?

836
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:21,565
My orders are from the emperor himself.
He has something special planned.

837
01:41:21,699 --> 01:41:23,608
We only need to
keep them from escaping.

838
01:41:25,328 --> 01:41:29,408
As you can see,
my young apprentice...

839
01:41:29,541 --> 01:41:32,791
<i>your friends have failed.</i>

840
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:35,959
Now witness the firepower...

841
01:41:36,089 --> 01:41:41,427
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.

842
01:41:42,595 --> 01:41:45,133
Fire at will, Commander.

843
01:41:52,146 --> 01:41:53,854
Fire.

844
01:42:00,488 --> 01:42:03,026
That blast came from the Death Star.

845
01:42:03,991 --> 01:42:06,316
That thing's operational.

846
01:42:06,451 --> 01:42:08,278
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

847
01:42:08,412 --> 01:42:10,488
We saw it.
All craft prepare to retreat.

848
01:42:10,622 --> 01:42:12,829
You won't get
another chance at this, Admiral.

849
01:42:12,958 --> 01:42:15,710
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

850
01:42:15,836 --> 01:42:19,122
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.

851
01:42:19,256 --> 01:42:22,956
Han will have that shield down.
We've gotta give him more time.

852
01:42:41,778 --> 01:42:43,189
We're coming.

853
01:42:49,077 --> 01:42:50,405
Come on.

854
01:42:54,207 --> 01:42:55,582
R2, hurry!

855
01:43:01,631 --> 01:43:02,580
My goodness!

856
01:43:08,679 --> 01:43:10,672
Why did you have to be so brave?

857
01:43:13,851 --> 01:43:16,389
Well, I suppose I could
hot-wire this thing.

858
01:43:16,521 --> 01:43:17,979
I'll cover you.

859
01:43:59,563 --> 01:44:02,018
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can...

860
01:44:02,149 --> 01:44:04,853
and engage those Stardestroyers
at point-blank range.

861
01:44:04,984 --> 01:44:08,400
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Stardestroyers.

862
01:44:08,529 --> 01:44:11,151
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star...

863
01:44:11,282 --> 01:44:13,524
and we might
take a few of them with us.

864
01:44:16,454 --> 01:44:17,783
She's gonna blow!

865
01:44:21,876 --> 01:44:23,453
I'm hit!

866
01:44:28,633 --> 01:44:30,791
Your fleet is lost...

867
01:44:30,927 --> 01:44:34,971
and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.

868
01:44:37,266 --> 01:44:39,674
There is no escape...

869
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:42,432
my young apprentice.

870
01:44:44,649 --> 01:44:47,104
The Alliance will die...

871
01:44:48,985 --> 01:44:51,821
as will your friends.

872
01:44:55,451 --> 01:44:56,731
Good.

873
01:44:57,745 --> 01:45:00,995
I can feel your anger.

874
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:06,248
I am defenceless.
Take your weapon.

875
01:45:06,378 --> 01:45:09,498
Strike me down
with all of your hatred...

876
01:45:09,631 --> 01:45:14,127
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.

877
01:45:53,424 --> 01:45:55,464
- Look!
- Get him off of there.

878
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:50,612
I think I got it.

879
01:47:50,747 --> 01:47:51,992
I got it!

880
01:47:59,298 --> 01:48:00,578
Are you all right?

881
01:48:00,716 --> 01:48:02,589
- Let's see.
- It's not bad.

882
01:48:02,717 --> 01:48:03,997
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.

883
01:48:04,135 --> 01:48:05,629
Don't move.

884
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:12,805
- I love you.
- I know.

885
01:48:12,936 --> 01:48:14,264
Hands up.

886
01:48:15,397 --> 01:48:16,594
Stand up.

887
01:48:26,449 --> 01:48:27,908
Stay back.

888
01:48:35,833 --> 01:48:38,538
Get down here.
She's wounded.

889
01:48:38,669 --> 01:48:40,496
No, wait.

890
01:48:40,630 --> 01:48:42,207
I got an idea.

891
01:48:53,517 --> 01:48:55,011
Good.

892
01:48:55,144 --> 01:48:58,928
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

893
01:48:59,065 --> 01:49:01,768
Let the hate flow through you.

894
01:49:07,447 --> 01:49:11,030
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

895
01:49:14,496 --> 01:49:16,868
I will not fight you, Father.

896
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:33,757
You are unwise
to lower your defences.

897
01:49:58,706 --> 01:50:01,113
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

898
01:50:01,250 --> 01:50:04,370
I feel the good in you, the conflict.

899
01:50:04,503 --> 01:50:06,959
There is no conflict.

900
01:50:09,341 --> 01:50:11,299
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before...

901
01:50:11,427 --> 01:50:13,384
<i>and I don't believe
you'll destroy me now.</i>

902
01:50:13,512 --> 01:50:18,055
You underestimate
the power of the dark side.

903
01:50:18,183 --> 01:50:20,010
If you will not fight...

904
01:50:20,143 --> 01:50:22,717
then you will meet your destiny.

905
01:50:34,199 --> 01:50:35,397
Good.

906
01:50:35,533 --> 01:50:36,944
Good.

907
01:50:45,626 --> 01:50:49,245
- Watch out. Squad at.06.
- I'm on it, Gold Leader.

908
01:50:51,174 --> 01:50:52,585
Good shot, Red Two.

909
01:50:56,221 --> 01:50:59,304
We're sure in the middle of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy.

910
01:50:59,431 --> 01:51:01,092
Don't let me down.

911
01:51:05,646 --> 01:51:07,105
<i>It's over, Commander.</i>

912
01:51:07,231 --> 01:51:09,557
<i>The rebels have been routed.
They're fleeing.</i>

913
01:51:09,692 --> 01:51:12,230
<i>We need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit.</i>

914
01:51:13,321 --> 01:51:15,277
Send three squads to help.

915
01:51:15,406 --> 01:51:17,363
- Open the back door.
- Sir.

916
01:51:31,546 --> 01:51:32,957
Throw me another charge.

917
01:51:50,524 --> 01:51:53,311
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

918
01:51:54,570 --> 01:51:56,479
I will not fight you.

919
01:51:59,991 --> 01:52:03,027
Give yourself to the dark side.

920
01:52:04,621 --> 01:52:08,666
<i>It is the only way
you can save your friends.</i>

921
01:52:09,709 --> 01:52:11,417
Yes.

922
01:52:11,545 --> 01:52:13,501
Your thoughts betray you.

923
01:52:13,629 --> 01:52:16,167
Your feelings for them are strong...

924
01:52:16,299 --> 01:52:18,172
especially for...

925
01:52:20,345 --> 01:52:22,005
sister.

926
01:52:23,264 --> 01:52:27,594
So you have a twin sister.

927
01:52:27,727 --> 01:52:31,427
Your feelings have now
betrayed her too.

928
01:52:31,564 --> 01:52:35,644
Obi-Wan was wise
to hide her from me.

929
01:52:35,776 --> 01:52:40,154
Now his failure is complete.

930
01:52:41,657 --> 01:52:45,441
If you will not turn
to the dark side...

931
01:52:45,577 --> 01:52:48,365
then perhaps she will.

932
01:52:48,497 --> 01:52:49,410
Never!

933
01:53:35,043 --> 01:53:36,751
Good!

934
01:53:41,091 --> 01:53:43,795
Your hate has made you powerful.

935
01:53:45,094 --> 01:53:49,970
Now, fulfil your destiny...

936
01:53:50,099 --> 01:53:54,179
and take your father's place at my side.

937
01:54:09,243 --> 01:54:10,572
Never.

938
01:54:13,622 --> 01:54:15,780
I'll never turn to the dark side.

939
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:21,587
You've failed, Your Highness.

940
01:54:21,714 --> 01:54:23,671
I am a Jedi...

941
01:54:23,799 --> 01:54:25,839
like my father before me.

942
01:54:33,433 --> 01:54:36,885
So be it, Jedi.

943
01:54:37,104 --> 01:54:38,977
Move! Move!

944
01:54:51,618 --> 01:54:55,485
The shield is down. Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor.

945
01:54:55,622 --> 01:54:59,370
We're on our way. Red Group,
Gold Group, all fighters follow me.

946
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:01,409
I told you they'd do it.

947
01:55:08,551 --> 01:55:11,172
If you will not be turned...

948
01:55:11,303 --> 01:55:14,637
<i>you will be destroyed.</i>

949
01:55:21,814 --> 01:55:23,392
Young fool.

950
01:55:24,484 --> 01:55:27,187
Only now, at the end...

951
01:55:27,319 --> 01:55:29,193
do you understand.

952
01:55:42,417 --> 01:55:48,171
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.

953
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:55,842
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.

954
01:56:01,436 --> 01:56:03,263
Father, please!

955
01:56:18,578 --> 01:56:20,736
Now, young Skywalker...

956
01:56:22,874 --> 01:56:24,701
you will die.

957
01:56:51,069 --> 01:56:52,394
No.

958
01:56:54,728 --> 01:56:57,008
No!

959
01:57:47,757 --> 01:57:49,215
I'm going in.

960
01:57:52,386 --> 01:57:53,585
Here goes nothing.

961
01:58:00,686 --> 01:58:04,553
Lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.

962
01:58:06,775 --> 01:58:10,226
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.

963
01:58:25,918 --> 01:58:27,911
Split up and head back to the surface.

964
01:58:28,046 --> 01:58:31,213
See if you can get a few
of those TIE fighters to follow you.

965
01:58:31,341 --> 01:58:32,290
Copy, Gold Leader.

966
01:58:42,602 --> 01:58:44,179
That was too close.

967
01:58:48,191 --> 01:58:50,349
We've got to give
those fighters more time.

968
01:58:50,485 --> 01:58:53,520
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Star Destroyer.

969
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:01,783
Sir, we've lost our
bridge deflector shields.

970
01:59:01,912 --> 01:59:04,914
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.

971
01:59:07,418 --> 01:59:09,161
Intensify forward firepower!

972
01:59:11,004 --> 01:59:12,202
Too late!

973
01:59:57,300 --> 02:00:01,167
Help me take this mask off.

974
02:00:01,304 --> 02:00:03,178
But you'll die.

975
02:00:04,057 --> 02:00:07,555
Nothing can stop that now.

976
02:00:08,644 --> 02:00:10,269
Just for once...

977
02:00:11,230 --> 02:00:12,855
let me...

978
02:00:12,982 --> 02:00:16,433
look on you with my own eyes.

979
02:00:52,687 --> 02:00:57,065
Now go, my son.

980
02:00:58,777 --> 02:01:00,188
Leave me.

981
02:01:01,279 --> 02:01:03,735
No. You're coming with me.

982
02:01:03,865 --> 02:01:06,191
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

983
02:01:07,076 --> 02:01:10,777
You already have, Luke.

984
02:01:11,956 --> 02:01:13,830
You were right.

985
02:01:14,626 --> 02:01:16,951
You were right about me.

986
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:20,672
Tell your sister...

987
02:01:21,715 --> 02:01:23,922
<i>you were right.</i>

988
02:01:31,017 --> 02:01:32,096
Father.

989
02:01:36,438 --> 02:01:37,767
I won't leave you.

990
02:02:03,215 --> 02:02:04,211
There it is.

991
02:02:07,177 --> 02:02:09,549
Wedge, go for the power regulator
on the north tower.

992
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:12,965
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

993
02:02:32,202 --> 02:02:35,322
Move the fleet
away from the Death Star.

994
02:03:22,542 --> 02:03:24,202
They did it!

995
02:03:32,678 --> 02:03:35,085
I'm sure Luke wasn't
on that thing when it blew.

996
02:03:36,848 --> 02:03:38,675
He wasn't.

997
02:03:38,808 --> 02:03:40,468
I can feel it.

998
02:03:45,148 --> 02:03:46,726
You love him.

999
02:03:50,152 --> 02:03:51,563
Don't you?

1000
02:03:51,696 --> 02:03:53,155
Yes.

1001
02:03:53,281 --> 02:03:55,986
All right. I understand.

1002
02:03:56,117 --> 02:03:57,492
Fine.

1003
02:03:58,536 --> 02:04:00,328
When he comes back...

1004
02:04:01,414 --> 02:04:03,158
I won't get in the way.

1005
02:04:05,876 --> 02:04:07,834
It's not like that at all.

1006
02:04:11,549 --> 02:04:13,874
He's my brother.

1007
02:05:55,484 --> 02:05:57,109
Wesa free!
