00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,600
Your father makes me sick, too?

389
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Everybody makes me sick?

390
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Shit?

391
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,400
Your father ain't no real father?

392
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,400
He's a bum?

393

All I see is black folks?

473
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,000

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,000
Yeah?

823
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,000
You almost knocked me down?

824
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,000
The word is "excuse me?"

825
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,400
Excuse me?
I'm sorry?

826
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,400
You stepped on
my brand-new white AirJordans?

827
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,400
That's all you can say?

828
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,400
You're serious?

829
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah! I'll fuck
your prick two times!

830
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,000
Two times!

831
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,400
Who told you to be
in my neighborhood?

832
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
I own this brownstone?

833
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,600
Who told you to buy a brownstone
in my neighborhood?

834
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,200
What do you want to live

835
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,000
in a black neighborhood for,
anyway?

836
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,400
I understand this is
a free country?

837
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,000
A man can live
wherever he wants?

838
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,400
Free country?
I should fuckyou up for saying that?

839
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,000
Yo, man?
YourJordans are fucked up!

840
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,000
Might as well throw them shits out?
They're broke?

841
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,400
They looked good
before he messed them up?

842
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,400
He was even talking
aboutyour mama...

843
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,000
Shit, you used
to be so fine!

844
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,600
How much they cost?

845
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
$100!

846
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,200
$108 with tax?

847
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,600
You're lucky
I got a loving heart?

848
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,600
Next time, cross the street quick?

849
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,200
I'm out ofhere?

850
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,600
Break his feet!

851
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You should buy me another pair!

852
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Black Panther'd whip his ass!

853
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,400
You're lucky I'm
a righteous black man!

854
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Otherwiseyou'd be
in serious trouble! Serious!

855
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,000
Let's fuck him up?

856
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,600
Move back to Massachusetts!

857
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,400
I was born in Brooklyn?

858
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,000
- No!
- Oh!
- Man!

859
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,000
Get outta here!

860
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:31,400
I should send Vito
with you all the time?

861
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,400
Yeah? No more
90-minute deliveries

862
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,000
Around the corner?

863
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I work hard like
everybody else here, OK?

864
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You know that's true, Pino?

865
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,200
Vito, come here?

866
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Come here?

867
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,000
What's going on
between you two?

868
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,400
You boyfriend and girlfriend?

869
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,000
What did we just talk about?

870
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,000
What?

871
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,400
What did we just talk about?

872
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,000
What you talking about?

873
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,000
Smack him?

874
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,400
Any smacking
around here, I'll do?

875
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,400
You going to listen to him
tell you to smack me,

876
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,200
your older brother?

877
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,200
Rememberwhoyou are?

878
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,200
Your name is Vito Frangone,

879
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,200
not Vito Muhammad?

880
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
OK?

881
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,000
I'd love foryou
to stay out of my business?

882
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,000
Stop putting these thoughts
into my brother's head, OK?

883
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,400
Look, I don't play
that Muhammad shit, all right?

884
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,000
What Muhammad shit?

885
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,600
Look?? Don't fuck me, all right?

886
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Oh, man?

887
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,400
Fuck, man?

888
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,600
I hate this place?
I hate this place?

889
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,200
What a waste?

890
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,600
What a waste?

891
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,400
As I was saying

892
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,000
before we were
so rudely interrupted

893
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,000
by New York City's finest...

894
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,000
What was you saying?

895
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,000
The motherfucker
wasrt saying shit?

896
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,400
Yeah?
Look at that?

897
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
Look at what?

898
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,000
It's a goddamn shame?

899
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,400
What's a goddamn shame?

900
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,000
Sweet DickWillie?

901
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,400
That's my name?

902
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,000
Do I have to spell it out?

903
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,400
Make it plain?

904
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,000
OK, but listen up?

905
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,000
I'm going to break it down?

906
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,400
Let it be broke?

907
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,800
Can you dig it?

908
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,200
It's dug?

909
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,000
Look at those Korean motherfuckers
across the street?

910
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Bet they haven't been
offthe boat a year

911
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,600
before they opened
their own place?

912
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,200
Right? It's been about a year?

913
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
A motherfuckir year
off the motherfuckir boat,

914
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,600
and they got a business
in our neighborhood?

915
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,200
A good business,

916
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,600
occupying a building
that had been boarded up

917
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,000
for longer than
I care to remember,

918
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,000
and I've been here a long time?

919
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,400
Yeah, a long time?

920
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,400
Hear, boy?

921
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,600
Now, for the life of me??

922
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,400
You know, I can't
figure this out?

923
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,200
Either them Korean motherfuckers
are geniuses??

924
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,200
Oryou black asses
are just plain dumb?

925
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,000
Fuckyou?

926
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,000
It's got to be
because we're black?

927
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,400
Ain't no other explanation?

928
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,000
You know it's true?

929
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,200
They're always keeping
the black man to about shit!

930
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,600
Oh, oh! You motherfuckers
hold that shit down?

931
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,400
I'm tired ofthat
old excuse, that shit?

932
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,000
I swear, man,

933
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,200
I will be one happy fool

934
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,600
when we open
our own business

935
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,400
right here in our neighborhood?

936
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,200
I swear to God,

937
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,600
I'll be first to spend
what little money I got?

938
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,600
You motherfuckers
are always talking

939
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,600
that old Keith Sweat shit...

940
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,200
"I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna do that?"

941
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
You ain't gonna do nothing?

942
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,200
You're gonna sit on this corner?

943
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,600
When you going
to getyour business?

944
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,200
Just like I thought?

945
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,600
You ain't going to do
a goddamn thing?

946
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,200
But I'm going
to go give them Koreans

947
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,600
more ofmy money?

948
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,200
Out ofmyway?

949
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
It's Millertime, motherfuckers?

950
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,200
Old Moosehead fuckers

951
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,600
Coconut, you got nerve?

You got offthe boat, too?
Leave me alone?

953
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Kung Fu, give me

954
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,600
No more free beer?

955
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,200
No more free beer?

956
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,600
Don't push me, baby?

957

It's a motherfuckir shame?

962

Man, ain't that a bitch?

963

965
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,000
How old areyou?

967
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,400

My name is Eddie?

969
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,000

What am I buying?

975
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,200
Eddie, you're too smart
foryour own britches?

976
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,000

He ain't got no money for nobody?

986

Daddy, you know,
I've been thinking?

1372
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,000
Maybe we should sell this place?

1373
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,400
Get out while we're still ahead??

1374
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,200
And alive?

1375
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,400
You really thinkyou know
what's best for us, Pino?

1376
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,000
I mean, couldn't we sell this

1377
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,000
and open up a new one
in our own neighborhood?

1378
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,400
There's too many pizzerias
already there?

1379
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,000
Maybe we could try
something different?

1380
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,000
What am I going to do?

1381
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,400

I'm sick of niggers?

1384
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,000
It's like I come to work??

1385
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,400
It's "Planet of the Apes?"

1386
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,000
I don't like being around them?

1387
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,200
They're animals?

1388
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,800
Whyyou got so much anger in you?

1389
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,800
Why? I'll tell you why?

1390
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,200
My friends...
They laugh at me?

1391
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,800
They laugh right in my face?

1392
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,200
They tell me,
"Go to Bed-Stuy?

1393
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,000
Go feed the moulies?"

1394
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,200
Doyour friends put money
in your pocket, Pino?

1395
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,800
Food on your table?

1396
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,200
They payyour rent,
a roof overyour head?

1397
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,400
Huh?

1398
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,800
They're not your friends?

1399
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,800

00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,400
I don't want to be here?

1403
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,400
They don't want us here?

1404
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,400
We should stay
in our own neighborhood,

1405
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,400
in Bensonurst,

1406
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,000
and niggers in theirs?

1407
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,200
I never had no trouble
with these people?

1408
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,400
I sat in this window??

1409
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,400
All I see is
little kids get old?

1410
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,400
And I seen
the old people get older?

1411
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,400
Yeah, sure,
some of them don't like us,

1412
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,800
but most of them do?

1413
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,400
I mean, for chrissake, Pino,
they grew up on my food?

1414
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,000
On my food?

1415
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,000
I'm very proud ofthat?

1416
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,000
You may think it's funny,

1417
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,800
but I'm very proud ofthat?

1418
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,800

01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,200
You know, Mookie,
not for nothir,

1798
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,200
but ifyou were
just a little taller,

1799
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,200
I'd kickyour ass
forwhatyou're thinking?

1800
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,200
As a matter offact,

1801
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,000
I should kickyour ass
on principle alone?

1802
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,200
Here?
You got a delivery?

1803
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,800
This the right address?

1804
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,200
What is this??

1805
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,200
Yeah? It's the right address?

1806
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,800
That's the right address?

1807
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,200
I wrote it myself?

1808
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,800
Sometimes you make mistakes,

1809
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,400
and I deliver fucking pizzas

1810
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,200
to the wrong fucking address?

1811
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,800
I don't make mistakes?

1812
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,400
You don't make mistakes?

1813
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,800
Hurry back, OK?

1814
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,400
Don't get lost?
We're still open?

1815
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,200
Make a pizza, huh?

1816
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,400
Mr? Mayor?

1817
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,000
I saw whatyou did?

1818
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,000
That was foolish but brave?

1819
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,400
That child owes you his life?

1820
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,000
Wasrt trying to be a hero?

1821
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,400
I just seen what was happening,

1822
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,800
and I reacted... didn't even think?

1823
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,800
Probablywouldn't have done it

1824
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,200
ifl had thought?

1825
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,600
Da Mayor's getting old?

1826
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,200
Ain't run like that in years?

1827
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,600
Went from first to home
on a bunt single?

1828
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,200
Scored the winning run?

1829
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,600
Two outs?
Bottom of the ninth?

1830
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,200
August 1, 1939?
Snow Hill, Alabama?

1831
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,800
Mud Cat Bones
was the pitcher?

1832
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,200
He hated my guts?

1833
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,400
He come down offthat mound,

1834
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,000
and I took off

1835
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,800
like white lightning
up a black snake's ass?

1836
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,800
Maybe I, uh??

1837
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,400
Maybe I ought to be
a hero more often?

1838
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,000
Maybeyou shouldn't?

1839
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,400
Don't get happy?

1840
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,200
This changes nothing
between you and me?

1841
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,000
You did a good thing?

1842
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,000
Mother Sisterjust thanks you?

1843
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,800
I want to thankyou?

1844
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
You're welcome?

1845
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,800
Delivery from
Sal's Famous Pizzeria?

1846
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,800
Is it hot?

1847
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,400
I've never delivered a cold pizza?

1848
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,400
Come here?

1849
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,800
You thinkyou're slick, Tina?

1850
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,400
How else could
I getyou up here?

1851
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,000
I haven't seen you all week?

1852
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,400
I'm working?
Making money?

1853
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,000
You forgot the ice cream again?

1854
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,200
I forgot?

1855
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,800
Your memory's getting ridiculous?

1856
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,200
I got things on my mind?

1857
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,800
I reallywanted some ice cream?

1858
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,200
I'll run out and get some?

1859
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,200
No, no? That's out?
You won't come back?

1860
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,200
I can't be staying long?

1861
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,400
How long?

1862
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,000
Long enough to do the nasty?

1863
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Come on, Mookie?
That's out?

1864
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,200
First of all, it's too hot?

1865
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,000
Lfyou think
I'll letyou get some,

1866
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,400

1868
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,800

1869
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,200
I'll seeyou tomorrow?

1870
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,200
Yeah, right?

1871
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,000
So no nasty, huh?

1872
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,200
No?

1873
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,400
Something else?

1874
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,400
What?

1875
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,600
Trust me?

1876
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,000
Last time I trusted you,
we got a son?

1877
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Remember him?

1878
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,400
His name's Hector?

1879
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,800
You saying I'm a bad father?

1880
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
On the strength?

1881
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,000
Let me talk toyou?

1882
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
What? What?

1883
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,400
Over here?

1884
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,800
Tina, takeyour clothes off?

1885
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,200
I already told you

1886
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,200
it's too fucking hot
to make love?

1887
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,800
It's too fucking hot?

1888
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,800
Why are you always cursing?

1889
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,200
I don't fucking curse that much?

1890
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,200
What the hell you mean?

1891
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,200
All you do is curse?

1892
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,200
Anyway, no rawness
is jumping offtonight?

1893
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,800
All right?
That's it?

1894
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
No rawness?

1895
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,400
No? No rawness?

1896
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,400
Why's it always like that

1897
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,000
when you come over?

1898
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,800
It's not always like that?

1899
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,400
It's always...
What areyou doing?

1900
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,800
I'm not cursing?

1901
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,400
Mookie? Come on?

1902
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,000
I mean it?
I'm not playing?

1903
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,400
I'm not playing?

1904
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,200
Don't be so anxious?

1905
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,200
That's right?
Take it off?

1906
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
You're sweating?

1907
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,400
Of course I'm sweating?

1908
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:40,000
It's only 100 degrees in here?

1909
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,400
Look, freeze?
Don't move?

1910
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,000
I'll be right back?

1911
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
What doyou mean
you'll be right back?

1912
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,400
Where areyou going?

1913
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,000
I'll be right back?

1914
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,800
Whyyou got me
standing on the bed?

1915
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,200
Whereyou going?

1916
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,800
How's my son, Hector?

1917
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,800
Honey, doyou hear that?

1918
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,800
He wants to know
howyou are doing?

1919
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,800
And he has the straight face
of asking about it?

1920
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,200
Sinverguenza.

1921
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,800
Good for nothing?

1922
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,200
Callejero.

1923
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:18,200
Que se la pasa por la calle... - 

1924
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,800
English! English!

1925
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,200
I want my son speaking English?

1926
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,200
Get out of my kitchen?

1927
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,000
Bad enough his name's Hector?

1928
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,000
Get out of my kitchen?

1929
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,400
I don't want to hear anything?

1930
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,000
Out, I said?

1931
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,200
Yes, children?

1932
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:39,400
This is the cool-out corner?

1933
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,200
We're slowing it down

1934
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:44,600
for all the lovers in the house?

1935
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,200
I'll be giving you
all the helpyou need?

1936
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,400
Musically, that is?

1937
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,000
This shit is cold?

1938
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,800
Supposed to be cold?
It's an ice cube?

1939
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,200
Later foryour shit?

1940
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,800
Mira.

1941
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,200
Mira.

1942
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,200
What?

1943
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,200
You don't got a forehead?

1944
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,200
You got a eight-head?

1945
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,200
Mookie, you're full of shit?

1946
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:09,200
You got one of them
Sade foreheads?

1947
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,200
Fuckyou?

1948
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,400
Goddamn?
Big-ass forehead?

1949
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,200
I need an iceberg??

1950
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,200
Rather than this ice cube?

1951
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,000
Thank God for lips?

1952
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,400
Thank God for the neck?

1953
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,000
Thank God for kneecaps?

1954
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,400
Thank God for elbows?

1955
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,600
Thank God for thighs?

1956
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,200
Thank God
for the right nipple?

1957
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,200
Thank God
for the left nipple?

1958
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,200
Feels good?

1959
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,200
Ah? You likes?
You likes?

1960
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,000
You likes?

1961
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,400

My people, my people??

2461
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,000
What can I say?

2462
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:01,200
Saywhat I can?

2463
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:04,200
I saw it, but I didn't believe it?

2464
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:07,400
I didn't believe it, what I saw?

2465
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,600
Are we going to live together?

2466
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:12,800
Together are we going to live?

2467
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,200
This is your
Mister Seor Love Daddy

2468
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:17,800
talking toyou
from We-Love radio,

2469
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:20,200
108 FM on your dial,

2470
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:23,200
and that's the triple truth, Ruth?

2471
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:26,000
Today's weather?

2472
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:27,000
Hot!

2473
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:32,400
Wake up!

2474
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,800
Fuck!

2475
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,200
My money? Shit!

2476
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:39,000
Where are you going?

2477
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,200
To get my money?

2478
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:41,800
Don't try that shit, OK?

2479
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,800
You're going to run out,

2480
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,200
and I won't see your ass
for anotherweek?

2481
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:47,600
It's not like that?

2482
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:50,200
You don't give
a fucking shit about me,

2483
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:53,200
and you don't
give a shit aboutyour son?

2484
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,600
I care aboutyou and my son?

2485
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,600
Why don'tyou be a man?

2486
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I am a man?

2487
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:00,400
Then act like a man?

2488
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:03,000
Why don'tyou be
a fucking man, Mookie?

2489
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:05,000
I'm so tired ofyour shit?

2490
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:08,000
Why do we have to
go over this again?

2491
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:10,400
Becauseyou don't
fucking listen, Mookie!

2492
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:12,000
Lfyou listen to me,

2493
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,000
I wouldn't have to repeat myself

2494
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:15,400
like a fucking radio!

2495
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,400
What kind of motheryou are

2496
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:19,000
using fucking language like that?

2497
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
What kind of mother am I?

2498
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Your ass isn't even here!

2499
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,600
Get anothervocabulary, right?

2500
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,200
Get a fucking life?

2501
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,400
Yeah? Look??

2502
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:28,400
Lookwhat?

2503
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:30,000
I'll be back?

2504
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Don't leave, Mookie?
Don't leave?

2505
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,600
I'm tired ofthis shit?

2506
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
You walk out that door, that's it?

2507
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:37,000
All right?

2508
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:41,600
I have to get my money from Sal?
I'll be back?

2509
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:45,600
Your shit's to the curb,
and I'm tired ofit?

2510
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:47,000
You need to step off

2511
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:48,800
with your stupid-ass self?

2512
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,800
You need to get
a fucking life, Mookie,

2513
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,400
because the oneyou got
is not working!

2514
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:58,000
I ain't going to deal
with this shit no more!

2515
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Shit?
Fucking ass, stupid ass,

2516
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,600
fucking pendejo.

2517
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:04,400
Shit? Fuck?
Fucking shit?

2518
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:07,200
Good morning?

2519
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:11,400
Is it a good morning?

2520
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,800
Yes, indeed?

2521
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
You almost gotyourself
killed last night?

2522
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:20,600
I've done that before?

2523
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,400
Where did you sleep?

2524
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:30,800
I didn't?

2525
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:38,000
I hope the block is still standing?

2526
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,800
We're still standing?

2527
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,200
What doyou want?

2528
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,600
I want my money?
I want to get paid?

2529
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,800
You don't work here no more?

2530
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
I want my money?

2531
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,000
Your money couldn't begin to pay

2532
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:31,400
for the windowyou broke?

2533
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,000
Motherfuck a window?
Radio Raheem is dead?

2534
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,400
I know he's dead?
I was here, remember?

2535
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,400
He's dead because ofhis buddy?

2536
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:40,000
That cocksucker started this shit?

2537
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,000
He's responsible
for that kid's death?

2538
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:43,400
He wanted to close me,

2539
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,000
and you stood there like a fuck

2540
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,000
and watched them
burn me down!

2541
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:50,400
I also watched the cops
murder Radio Raheem?

2542
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:54,000
You'll get it all
from the insurance anyway, Sal?

2543
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

2544
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,200
This ain't about money?

2545
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,200
I could give a fuck
about money?

2546
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:00,400
You see this place?

2547
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,000
I built this fucking place!

2548
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,200
With my bare fucking hands!

2549
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:08,200
Every light socket,
every piece oftile?

2550
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,200
Me! With these fucking hands!

2551
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,200
You know what that means?

2552
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,800
It means pay me
my motherfucking money?

2553
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,400
That's what it means, Sal?

2554
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:18,400
OK, Mookie?

2555
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:20,800
How much do I oweyou?

2556
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,200
My salary is 250?
250 a week?

2557
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,200
1??

2558
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:35,200
That's 2??

2559
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:37,600
That's 3??

2560
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:39,400
That's 4??

2561
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,400
And that's 5?

2562
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:44,200
You got $500?
You're a rich fucking man?

2563
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,400
Are you happy?
You happy?

2564
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:49,400
He's got 500 fucking dollars!

2565
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:51,000
He's a big man!

2566
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:52,800
He's a rich fucking man!

2567
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,200
He's never going to have
any more trouble!

2568
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:57,400
Not Mookie!

2569
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,000
He's fucking rich!

2570
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:00,600
Who the fuckyou yelling at?

2571
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:02,200
You're wealthy, Mookie?

2572
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,200
You're a real fucking Rockefeller?

2573
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:08,600
You gotyour fucking pay?
Now leave me alone?

2574
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,600
Sal, my salary's 250 a week,
all right?

2575
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:15,400
I oweyou 50 bucks?

2576
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:16,400

You keep it?

2578
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:18,400
You keep it?

2579
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,400
You keep it?

2580
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:20,400
No, you keep it?

2581
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,800
You keep it?

2582
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:27,400
I don't believe this shit?

2583
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:28,800
Believe it?

2584
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,400
Areyou sick?

2585
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:36,400
I'm hot as a motherfucker?
I'm all right, though?

2586
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:40,200
Well, they say it's even going
to get hotter today?

2587
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:46,200
What areyou going
to do with yourself?

2588
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:48,400
Make that money?
Get paid?

2589
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:52,000
Sal, I got to go see my son

2590
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,600

2591
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:05,200
Hey, Mook.

I seeyou walking.
Go home toyour kid.

2593
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:09,600
Now the news and weather.

2594
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:12,600
Our mayor has commissioned
a blue-ribbon panel...

2595
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,600
"to get to the bottom

2596

2597
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,400
The City ofNew York

2598
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:20,000
will not let property
be destroyed by anyone."

2599
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
His Honor plans to visit
our block today.

2600
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,400
He should hook up
with our own Da Mayor,

2601
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,000
buy him a beer.

2602
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:28,600
Your Love Daddy
says register to vote.

2603
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:30,600
The election is coming up.

2604
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:33,600
There 's no end in sight
from this heat wave,

2605
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:36,000
so today,
the cash money word is chill.

2606
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:38,400
That's right. C-h-i-l-I.

2607
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:42,200
When you hear "chill,"

2612
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,800
and that's
the quintessential truth, Ruth.

2613
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:56,600
The next record goes out
to Radio Raheem.

2614
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,200
We love you, brother.

2615
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,400
# From the heart ofBed-Stuy #

2619
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,600
