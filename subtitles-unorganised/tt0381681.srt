Subtitled by

2
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:49,488
Do you consider the book to be
autobiographical?

3
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:55,585
Well, I mean,
is anything autobiographical?

4
00:01:56,824 --> 00:02:00,699
We all see the world through
our own tiny keyhole, right?

5
00:02:01,484 --> 00:02:03,737
I mean, I always think of
Thomas Wolfe, you know,

6
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:07,207
if you ever seen that little
one page note to reader

7
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:09,617
in the front of "Look Homeward, Angel",
you know what I'm talking about?

8
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:14,760
Anyway, he says that we are
the sum of all the moments of our lives,

9
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:16,854
and that anybody who sits down to write

10
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:18,760
is gonna use the clay of their own mind,

11
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:19,737
that you can't avoid that.

12
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:22,404
So when I look at my own life,

13
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:25,924
you know,  I have to admit,
right...that I've...

14
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:28,940
I've never been around
a bunch of guns, or violence.

15
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:29,941
You know, not really.

16
00:02:30,198 --> 00:02:34,877
No political intrigue or...
helicopter crash, right?

17
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,267
But my life, from my own point of view,
has been full of drama, right?

18
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:42,951
And, so, I thought that
if I could write a book that...

19
00:02:43,615 --> 00:02:46,961
...that could capture what
it's like to really meet somebody

20
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:49,062
I mean the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me

21
00:02:49,063 --> 00:02:51,731
is to really meet somebody,

22
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:53,306
make that connection,
and if I could...

23
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,074
...make that valuable,

24
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,287
you know, to capture that,

25
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,577
that would be the attempt or...

26
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:02,425
Did I answer your question?

27
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:05,565
I'll try to be more specific...

28
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:09,313
Were there ever a French young
woman on the train you met,

29
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,073
and... spent an evening with?

30
00:03:16,157 --> 00:03:17,502
See, to me, that...

31
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:20,586
that's not important, you know?

32
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,982
So that's a "yes".

33
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:24,703
All right, since I'm in France

34
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,014
and this is last stop in
my book tour,

35
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:26,995
"yes".

36
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,676
Mr. Wallace,

37
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:33,959
the book ends on an
ambiguous note.

38
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,713
We don't know!

39
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,974
Do you think they get back
together in six months,

40
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:40,487
like they promise each other?

41
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:43,925
Like they promised, uh...

42
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:48,406
I think I answered that. You know, it's...

43
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:50,217
It's a good test.

44
00:03:50,218 --> 00:03:52,237
Right? If you're a romantic
or a cynic.

45
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:56,462
I mean, you think...
you think they get back together,

46
00:03:56,463 --> 00:03:58,516
you don't, for sure,

47
00:03:58,517 --> 00:04:00,988
and you hope they do,
but, you know, youre not sure

48
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:01,898
so you're asking the question.

49
00:04:02,185 --> 00:04:04,245
And... do you think
they get back together?

50
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:06,451
I mean, did you, in real life?

51
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:09,574
Did I real...

52
00:04:10,836 --> 00:04:13,122
Look, see, in the words
of my grandfather, ok...

53
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:14,773
to answer that,

54
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:16,457
would take the piss
out of the whole thing.

55
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,185
Oh, no...

56
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:19,888
We just have the time
for one last question.

57
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,342
What is your next book?

58
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,688
I don't know, man,
I don't know...

59
00:04:28,183 --> 00:04:29,389
I've been...

60
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,181
I've been thinking about this...

61
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:34,525
Well, I always kind of wanted
to write a book

62
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:38,212
that all took place within
the space of a pop song,

63
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:39,817
you know, like 3 or 4 minutes long.

64
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:43,381
The story, the idea is that...

65
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,222
there's this guy.

66
00:04:45,223 --> 00:04:47,144
And...

67
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:48,357
he's totally depressed!

68
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:50,964
I mean, his great dream was to be

69
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:52,735
a lover, an adventurer,

70
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:55,323
you know, riding motorcycles
through South America,

71
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:57,426
and instead he's sitting
at a marble table,

72
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:58,672
eating lobster,

73
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,758
and he's got a good job
and a beautiful wife, right.

74
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:03,141
You know, everything that he needs.

75
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:05,120
But that doesn't matter,

76
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:08,054
'cause what he wants
is to fight for meaning.

77
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:12,515
You know, happiness is in the doing,
not in the...

78
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:13,350
getting what you want.

79
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:15,770
So, he's sitting there,

80
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:17,471
and just at a second,

81
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:20,145
his little five year old daughter

82
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:21,724
hops up on the table.

83
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:23,666
And he knows that
she should get down

84
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:24,928
'cause she could get hurt,

85
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:28,168
but she's dancing to this
pop song,

86
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,371
in a summer dress.

87
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:31,877
And he looks down,

88
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:35,119
and all of a sudden,
he is sixteen.

89
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:38,277
And... his high school sweetheart

90
00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:41,597
is dropping him off, at home.

91
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:43,617
And they've just lost their virginity,

92
00:05:43,618 --> 00:05:44,872
and she loves him,

93
00:05:44,873 --> 00:05:49,135
and the same song is
playing on the car radio,

94
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:52,718
and she climbs up and starts
dancing on the roof of the car.

95
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,270
And now,
now he's worried about her!

96
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,146
And she is beautiful, with a...

97
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,035
a facial expression
just like his daughters'.

98
00:05:59,036 --> 00:06:01,625
In fact, you know, maybe that's
why he even likes her

99
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:04,587
You see, he knows he's not
remembering this dance,

100
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:05,173
he's there.

101
00:06:05,174 --> 00:06:07,995
He's there in both
moments simultaneously.

102
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:09,751
And just like for an instance,

103
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:12,046
all his life is just folding into itself

104
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:14,404
and it's obvious to him
that time is a lie...

105
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,783
that's it's all happening all the time

106
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:22,973
and inside every moment
is another moment, all...

107
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:25,607
You know, happening simultaneously.

108
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:28,425
And, anyway, that's kind of
the idea... anyway

109
00:06:30,214 --> 00:06:32,262
Well, our author has to be
going to the airport soon,

110
00:06:32,263 --> 00:06:35,143
so he'll thank you all very much
for coming here this afternoon.

111
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:38,460
And a special thanks to Mr. Wallace
for being with us.

112
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:42,858
We hope to see you again here
on your next book!

113
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:45,602
<i>Merci a toutes et a tous
qu'etre venus.</i>

114
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:48,565
<i>Comme vous voyez y a du champagne,
y a des petites choses,</i>

115
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:49,728
<i>donc servez vous.</i>

116
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:51,118
Thank you all.

117
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,629
How much longer before
I have to go to the airport?

118
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,235
Oh, you should leave at 7:30.

119
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:57,007
7:30 at the very latest!

120
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:58,362
Ok

121
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:03,993
Hi

122
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:05,823
Hello

123
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:10,384
How are you?

124
00:07:10,385 --> 00:07:11,457
Good, and you?

125
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,507
I'm good, yeah,
I'm great, I'm...

126
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,100
Do you want...

127
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:19,536
maybe get a cup of coffee?

128
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,932
Didn't you just say you
have a plane to catch?

129
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:24,375
Uh, yeah...

130
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:26,893
but, I mean, I have a little time.

131
00:07:26,894 --> 00:07:27,894
Okay

132
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:32,098
I'll meat you outside, okay.

133
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:38,319
I'm just gonna go out,
get a cup of coffee,

134
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,266
Did you sign all this?

135
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:40,214
Yeah, I sure did.

136
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:41,897
Well, get your driver Philippe's card

137
00:07:41,898 --> 00:07:44,605
so that you can call on the cell
phone if you're running late.

138
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:45,833
And we will put your bags in the car

139
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,872
so you are not late going to the airport.

140
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:49,661
Thanks for everything.
Merci beaucoup.

141
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:53,717
Which one's Philippe?

142
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:56,764
<i>Philippe, passe lui ta carte pour
qu'il le forme numero portable.</i>

143
00:07:56,765 --> 00:07:57,530
<i>Merci.</i>

144
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:14,214
I can't believe you're here!

145
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:15,353
Well, I live here in Paris.

146
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,469
Are you sure you
don't have to stay,

147
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,753
you're not suppose to talk some more?

148
00:08:20,754 --> 00:08:21,827
No, no, no, they sicken me,

149
00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:23,151
I spent the night here last night.

150
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:23,687
Oh, you did?

151
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:25,415
Yeah, yeah, they've got a waft upstairs...

152
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,071
Anyway, how are you?
This is so weird.

153
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:29,694
I'm fine, it's...

154
00:08:30,483 --> 00:08:31,594
It's good to see you!

155
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:32,542
It's good to see you.

156
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,819
So you wanna go to a cafe?

157
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,908
Uh, yeah...

158
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,144
Okay, there's one a little further,

159
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:40,811
that I like.

160
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,689
I thought I was gonna
totally loose it in there.

161
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,181
When I first saw you...

162
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:46,692
I mean, how did you even
know I was going to be here?

163
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,473
Well, it's my favorite
bookstore in Paris. I...

164
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,058
You can sit down for
hours and read...

165
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:51,531
I love it.

166
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:53,045
There's flees, but,
you know...

167
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:55,582
I know, I think a cat slept
at my head last night.

168
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,871
So, I saw your picture on the
calendar about a month ago,

169
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,580
and that you were going to be here.

170
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:03,522
It's funny because I read
an article on your book,

171
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:06,273
it sounded vaguely familiar...

172
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:07,018
Vaguely, yeah...

173
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,369
Yes.

174
00:09:08,454 --> 00:09:12,438
But I didn't put it all together
until I saw your photo, so...

175
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:14,574
Did you have a chance to read it?

176
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:15,798
Yes, I...

177
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,969
I was really, really surprised
as you can imagine, I mean...

178
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,825
I had to read it twice, actually.

179
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:22,546
Yeah?

180
00:09:22,547 --> 00:09:23,593
Yeah.

181
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:24,996
Comme Si, Comme Ca?

182
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,457
No, I liked it!

183
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,110
It's very romantic, and I
usually don't like that...

184
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:30,682
but it's, it's really well written.

185
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:32,141
It's really well written,

186
00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:34,035
no, I really... Congratulations!

187
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:35,104
Wait!

188
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:38,794
Before we go any
anywhere, I have a...

189
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:40,893
I have to ask you...

190
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:41,957
Sure, what?

191
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,991
Did you show up in Vienna,
that December?

192
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:48,201
Uh, did you?

193
00:09:48,202 --> 00:09:50,646
No, I couldn't, but...

194
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:53,714
Did you? I need to know,
it's important to me!

195
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:54,988
Why, if you didn't?

196
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:57,547
Well, did you?

197
00:09:57,835 --> 00:09:58,248
No.

198
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:02,789
Oh, thank God you didn't!

199
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,611
Well, thank God you...

200
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:06,624
I mean, thank God I didn't,
and you didn't!

201
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,477
I mean, one of us had shown alone...

202
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:09,281
and that would have sucked.

203
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:10,845
I know, I know,
I was so concerned with that.

204
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:13,313
I always felt horrible about
not being there, but I couldn't!

205
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:15,736
You know, my grandma died
a few days before,

206
00:10:15,737 --> 00:10:16,690
and she was buried that day.

207
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:18,067
December 16th, that day!

208
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:18,843
She died, the one in Budapest?

209
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:20,413
Yes, you remember that?

210
00:10:20,414 --> 00:10:21,593
Yeah, I remember everything.

211
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:22,692
Of course, it wasn't in your book.

212
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:26,003
But anyway, I was about
to fly to Vienna, you know,

213
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:28,247
And I... and we heard
the news about her,

214
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:31,838
and of course I took her
to the funeral with my parents.

215
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,924
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

216
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:33,925
I know.

217
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:35,682
You weren't there anyway...

218
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:38,196
Why?

219
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:39,392
Why weren't you there?

220
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:41,017
I would have been there
if I could have,

221
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:43,404
I made plans, and we...

222
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:45,635
You better have a good reason!

223
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:46,636
What?

224
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:51,544
Oh, no!

225
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:53,190
No, you were there,
weren't you?

226
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:56,260
Oh, no, that's terrible!

227
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:58,319
I know I'm laughing,
but I don't mean it!

228
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,306
Did you hate me?
You must stop hating me.

229
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:01,430
Have you been hating me all this time?

230
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:02,081
You have!

231
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:04,015
- No, no...
- Yes, you have!

232
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:05,717
Oh, but you can't hate
me now, right?

233
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:07,970
- I mean, my grandma...
- I don't hate you, all right?

234
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:09,421
Come on, it's no big deal, all right?

235
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:12,272
I flew all the way over there,
you blew the thing off,

236
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,131
and then my life has been
a big nose dive since then,

237
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,446
but it's not a problem.

238
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:16,892
No, you can't say that!
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding...

239
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:20,441
Oh, I can't believe it,
you must have been so angry with me...

240
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:22,258
I'm so sorry, I really wanted to be there,

241
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:23,488
more than anything in the world!
I swear...

242
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:24,741
Honestly, I swear...

243
00:11:24,742 --> 00:11:26,584
I mean, you can't be angry...
my grandmother...

244
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:27,926
No, I know, I know,

245
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:30,191
I honestly thought that something
like that might have happened.

246
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:32,811
I was definitely bumped, but...

247
00:11:32,812 --> 00:11:35,702
Mostly, I was jut mad we hadn't
exchanged any phone numbers

248
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:37,017
or any information.

249
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:38,508
I know, that was so stupid,
no way to get in touch.

250
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:41,101
- I didn't even know your last name
- I know, I know...

251
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:43,835
I mean we were both afraid
that if we started writing

252
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,724
and calling,
that it would slowly...

253
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:46,905
you know, fade out.

254
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,021
- Yeah, it definitely wasn't a slow fade.
- No, it sure wasn't.

255
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:51,789
I know, we wanted to pick
it up were we left off.

256
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,973
- Which would have been fun if it worked...
- Yes, a good idea...

257
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:56,548
Ahh,

258
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,024
so...

259
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:00,619
How long were you in Vienna, then?

260
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,643
Just a couple of days.

261
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:05,182
Did you meet another girl?

262
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:09,085
Aah, yeah. Her name was Gretchen,
and she was amazing.

263
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:09,983
You did?
Yeah, the book is really

264
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:11,506
a composite of the two of you.

265
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:13,299
Really? Oh, no...
No, I'm kidding!

266
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,613
You wouldn't believe it,
I even went back to the train station.

267
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:19,281
I put up, you know, signs
of my number, and the hotel,

268
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:21,020
in case you've been delayed.
I was a total dork.

269
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:23,267
Let's go this way.
Did you get any calls?

270
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:25,719
Just a couple hookers,
looking for a gig.

271
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,435
No, it was awful.
What do you want me to say...

272
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:30,403
Oh, it's so sad. I'm so sorry!

273
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:33,623
I walked around for a couple of days.
Eventually, I flew home,

274
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:36,348
I owed my dad 2000 bucks,

275
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:39,096
who had warned me about
French chicks, I have to say.

276
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:40,594
What did he tell you about French women?

277
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:43,113
Nothing, the guy... he's never
met any French women.

278
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:44,949
He's never been east
of the Mississippi.

279
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,828
So why didn't you put "Six months later,
the French bitch didn't have show up"

280
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:51,177
You know, like...
But I did, I did.

281
00:12:51,178 --> 00:12:54,354
- You did?
- Yeah, no, I mean I made it more hopeful.

282
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:57,532
I wrote this whole fictional version
in which you actually do show up.

283
00:12:57,533 --> 00:12:59,662
- Oh, what happens?
- Uhm...

284
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:02,726
What?

285
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:06,167
Uhm, we make love for about ten
days straight, that's one part of it.

286
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:07,690
Oh, that's interesting.
So, the French slut...

287
00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:09,539
- Yeah
- Ok, ok...

288
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,159
It's just, then they, you know,
they start to know each other better

289
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,255
and they realize that
they don't get along at all.

290
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:15,796
I like that.
It's more real.

291
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:17,897
Yeah, well, my editor
didn't think that way.

292
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:20,278
No, everyone wants to believe in love.
It sells, right?

293
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,523
Yeah, exactly...

294
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,844
So things are going well for you, right?

295
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,669
I mean, your book is a
best seller in the US...

296
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,785
- It's a tiny best-seller.
- Oh, come on...

297
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:30,993
All right, yeah,
officially, yes,

298
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:33,030
but I mean all those people haven't
read Moby Dick,

299
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:34,327
you know, so why
should they read my book?

300
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:36,443
I haven't read Moby Dick,
and I liked your book, so...

301
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:37,887
Nice

302
00:13:37,888 --> 00:13:41,336
You know, I thought you
idealized the night a bit.

303
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:43,937
Oh, come on, it's officially fiction...

304
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:46,040
- I mean, I'm supposed to...
- No, no, I know, I know.

305
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,017
I know, I thought...

306
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:48,692
You know, there were times
when you made me a...

307
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:51,624
Huh, I mean her, right?

308
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,759
No, me...
Ok, whatever!

309
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,858
Ah... a little bit neurotic!

310
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:57,807
You are a little bit like
that, aren't you?

311
00:13:57,808 --> 00:14:00,513
- You think I'm neurotic?
- No, no, no, come on, I'm kidding!

312
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:02,711
Where did I do that?
I didn't do that.

313
00:14:02,712 --> 00:14:04,838
Maybe it's just me
You know...

314
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,712
Reading something knowing that
the character in the story is based on you...

315
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:11,815
it's both flattering and disturbing
at the same time.

316
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:13,167
How is it disturbing?

317
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:17,663
I don't know, just...
being part of someone else's memory.

318
00:14:17,664 --> 00:14:19,667
Seeing myself through your eyes.

319
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:22,540
How long did it take
you to write it?

320
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:26,100
Uhm, 3 or 4 years, on and off.

321
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:29,698
Wow, that's a really long time
to be writing about one night!

322
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,569
Yeah, I know, tell me about it.

323
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:34,930
I always assumed you
had forgotten me.

324
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:38,413
No, I had a pretty clear picture
of you in my mind.

325
00:14:38,414 --> 00:14:39,451
I have to tell you something.

326
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:41,330
- I just...
- What?

327
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:43,576
I wanted to talk to you for so long,
you know, now that...

328
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:44,577
- Yeah, me too
- ...it's just so real, you know,

329
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:46,501
I feel I can't get anything
out of my mouth.

330
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:49,057
I know, I know, how long do we have?
20 minutes and 30 seconds?

331
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:50,799
Let's go!
No, we got more than that.

332
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,760
I wanna know about you.

333
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:54,337
Tell what are you doing...
you know, what are you up to?

334
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:57,819
Uhm, where to start...
I work for Green Cross.

335
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,086
- It's an environmental organization.
- What are they all about?

336
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:04,181
Well, we basically work on
different environment issues,

337
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:06,598
from clean water to
disarmament of chemical weapons.

338
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:09,243
You know, international laws
that deal with the environment.

339
00:15:09,244 --> 00:15:11,786
And, and, what do you do for them?
We're going this way.

340
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:13,436
Uhm, different things.

341
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:15,875
Like last year,
I was in India for quite a while,

342
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:17,639
working on a water treatment plant.

343
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,240
- Wow!
- Well, yeah, the cotton industry there

344
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:21,923
is a major source of
pollution, so...

345
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:24,740
I mean, this sounds like you're
actually doing something, you know,

346
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,253
I mean, most people,
myself included, just...

347
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:29,419
sit around and bitch, you know,

348
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,927
America's consuming all the world resources,
SUVs suck, global warming is real...

349
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:36,732
You know, I'm really relieved
you're not one of those

350
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,750
Freedom Fries kind of Americans.

351
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,949
Hey, you know...
But, how did you get into that?

352
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,914
Ah, I came out of political science

353
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:44,704
and I was hoping to work
for the government.

354
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:47,228
And I did, for a while... eh, terrible!

355
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:48,229
- Not good?
- Yeah, no.

356
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,026
Anyway, I got really tired...
let's go this way

357
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:53,642
... of having those endless
conversations with friends

358
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:55,736
about how the world is falling to pieces.

359
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:58,427
So I decided what I really wanted to do

360
00:15:58,428 --> 00:16:02,010
was to find things that could be fixed,
and try to fix them, you know?

361
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:05,281
I always thought you'd be
doing something cool like that.

362
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:06,849
- I did!
- Thanks!

363
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:11,568
I just... no, really,
really like you to be doing a job that I like.

364
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:15,855
You know, I actually alternated
between thinking that...

365
00:16:15,856 --> 00:16:18,423
You know, everything is
irrevocably screwed up,

366
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:20,454
and that things might be
getting better in some ways.

367
00:16:20,455 --> 00:16:23,037
Better? How could you
possibly say that?

368
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:26,212
Well, I just mean, you know...
I mean, I know it sounds weird,

369
00:16:26,213 --> 00:16:28,524
but there are things
to be optimistic about.

370
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:32,262
Okay... I know the book you're selling,

371
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:34,175
which is great, I'm very
happy for you, but...

372
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:35,176
let me break the news for you, ok?

373
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:39,893
- The world is a mess right now!
- I wasn't saying that...

374
00:16:39,894 --> 00:16:42,519
Ok, we're moving all our
industry to developing nations.

375
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,345
We can get cheap labor
free of any environmental laws.

376
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:47,259
Ok, the weapon industry is booming,

377
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,155
Five million people die every year
for preventable water disease.

378
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:51,874
So, how is the world getting any better?

379
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,655
I'm not getting angry,
I'm not getting angry, but...

380
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:55,399
come on, I want to know,
I'm interested!

381
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,727
Ok, I realize that there are a lot
of serious problems in the world.

382
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:02,309
- Ok, thank you!
- I mean, I don't even have

383
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,216
one publisher in the
whole Asian market.

384
00:17:04,217 --> 00:17:07,123
Ok, all right.
Say "stop it"!

385
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:08,363
What, what? "Stop".

386
00:17:08,364 --> 00:17:11,566
No, look, all I'm saying is that there's
more awareness out there, right?

387
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:12,899
People are going to fight back!

388
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,934
You know, I mean I think the
world might be getting better

389
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,650
because people like you are
educated into speaking out.

390
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:21,879
Even the very notion of conservation,
environmental issues,

391
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,413
those weren't even in the vocabulary
until fairly recently,

392
00:17:24,414 --> 00:17:25,969
and now they're becoming a norm,

393
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,610
and eventually might be what's
expected all over the world!

394
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:30,307
I agree with what you're saying,

395
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:32,168
but at the same time,
it's dangerous!

396
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:34,469
An imperialist country can use
that kind of thinking

397
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,665
to justify the economy greed.
You know, human rights...

398
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,618
A particular imperialistic country
you have in mind there, Frenchy?

399
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:46,198
No, not really
Bon soir!

400
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:47,914
Bon soir

401
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,798
So, you want to sit over there?

402
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,096
Yeah, this is perfect.

403
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,824
Oh, wow, maybe what I'm saying
is the world might be evolving

404
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:00,470
the way a person evolves.

405
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:03,442
Right, I mean... me, for example
Am I getting worse?

406
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:05,927
Am I improving?
I don't know!

407
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:07,224
When I was younger...

408
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:10,903
I was healthier, but I was
racked with insecurity.

409
00:18:10,904 --> 00:18:15,314
Now I'm older, my problems are deeper,
but I'm... more equipped to handle them.

410
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:17,724
So, what are your problems?

411
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,458
Right now? I don't have any.

412
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:24,329
I don't. Just...

413
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,220
...damn happy to be here!

414
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:28,160
Me too.

415
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,008
So, how long have you been in Paris?

416
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:36,349
I got in last night.
I've done 10 cities in 12 days,

417
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:40,141
I'm a wreck...
I'm so glad it's over.

418
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:41,826
I'm tired of being a hugster.

419
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:43,914
<i>Ques-ce que je vous serve?</i>

420
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,644
What do you want?

421
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:46,667
A cup of coffee...

422
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,174
<i>Un cafe et un citrone,
s'il vous plait</i>

423
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:55,026
God, I love this cafe. I wish they
had places like this in the US.

424
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:58,396
Yeah, I missed cafes when
I was living over there.

425
00:18:58,397 --> 00:19:00,869
I mean, I find a few places
I really liked, but there was...

426
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,635
You...
You were living in the US?

427
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:05,339
Yes, from... '96 to '99.

428
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,785
I was studying at NYU.

429
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:10,397
Oh, God, don't tell me that, Celine!

430
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:12,174
- What?
- No, it's just...

431
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:14,169
- Nothing, I mean I...
- What?

432
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,319
I've been living in New York
since '98.

433
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,342
You know, we were there
at the same time!

434
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:19,068
- In New York?
- Yeah...

435
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:20,542
Oh, that's weird...

436
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:24,404
It actually crossed my mind a few times
that I might run into you, but...

437
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:27,036
The odds are so slim, right?
So...

438
00:19:27,037 --> 00:19:29,627
I didn't even know what city
you were living in.

439
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:30,704
Weren't you somewhere in Texas?

440
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:31,905
- You were in Texas...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

441
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:34,862
Definitely, I just...
I was for a long time, I just...

442
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:37,107
You know,
wanted to try New York.

443
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:40,214
What brought you back here?

444
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:44,684
I had finished my masters, for one.
And... no visa. No more visa.

445
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,433
And, anyway, I was starting
to get paranoid.

446
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:51,214
All... the violence in the medias.
Gang violence, murders...

447
00:19:51,215 --> 00:19:52,759
Especially serial killers.

448
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:57,501
But, the final stroll was:
One night I heard a...

449
00:19:57,502 --> 00:20:00,791
some noise on my fire escape,
so I called 911.

450
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:03,318
- And the cops came, eventually.
- Yeah, like 3 hours later.

451
00:20:03,353 --> 00:20:06,209
Yeah, after I had been raped
and killed about 30 times.

452
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,930
No, but... It was a man
and a woman officer,

453
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:11,070
and I was explaining to them
what I had heard,

454
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:13,725
when the woman had to run
downstairs to move the police car.

455
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:15,413
So, I was left alone with the male cop.

456
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,614
And right away, he asked
me if I had a gun...

457
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:19,402
And I said no,
of course not, I...

458
00:20:20,464 --> 00:20:23,519
And he told me:
"You better think about getting one."

459
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,762
"This is America,
not France". Okay?

460
00:20:26,797 --> 00:20:29,982
And I said to him, you know,
I have no idea how to shoot a gun,

461
00:20:29,983 --> 00:20:32,816
and, I have no interest
in firearms, whatsoever.

462
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:36,067
And that's when he pulled
out his gun, like this...

463
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:36,955
and he went:

464
00:20:36,956 --> 00:20:42,147
"On one day... you're gonna have
something like this in your face,

465
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:44,805
and if you wanna have a long life,

466
00:20:45,754 --> 00:20:46,906
you're gonna have to choose...

467
00:20:46,907 --> 00:20:47,907
between you... alone."

468
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,349
And they left...
And the next morning I called

469
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,044
for an application to get a gun.

470
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,676
Me, with a gun!
I mean, that's really scary...

471
00:20:58,015 --> 00:21:00,419
But then I realized something
was wrong, the way that cop

472
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,515
had pulled out his gun out,
and everything...

473
00:21:03,516 --> 00:21:06,077
So I canceled my demand
for the gun, and...

474
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:06,978
and I called the police station,

475
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:09,362
and tried to complain about
that cop's behavior, but...

476
00:21:09,363 --> 00:21:11,875
- What happened with that?
- It was so much paperwork...

477
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:15,022
and then I got scared,
with my shity student desire.

478
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,690
- Yeah, you thought you'd get deported.
- Yeah, exactly!

479
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:19,135
So I gave up and I forgot
about the whole thing.

480
00:21:19,651 --> 00:21:22,639
- Well, I guess I never forgotten.
- Obviously... yeah.

481
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:26,118
But, still, you know...
I really enjoyed being there.

482
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,924
There's a lot of things
I miss about the US

483
00:21:27,925 --> 00:21:29,125
Yeah, like what?

484
00:21:31,605 --> 00:21:32,727
Well...

485
00:21:32,728 --> 00:21:35,186
The overall good mood people have there,

486
00:21:35,187 --> 00:21:38,141
Like, you know, even if it
can be bullshit sometimes.

487
00:21:38,142 --> 00:21:41,283
Like "How you doin'?" "Great!"
"How you doin'?" "Great!"

488
00:21:41,284 --> 00:21:42,638
"Have a perfect day!"

489
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:44,657
I don't know...

490
00:21:44,658 --> 00:21:47,220
Parisians can be so grumpy,
have you noticed?

491
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:49,986
No, everybody seems pretty happy to me.

492
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,909
- They're not happy...
- They're not happy.

493
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:56,740
No, they are, I don't know.
Maybe I just meet French men...

494
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:57,645
They drive me nuts!

495
00:21:57,778 --> 00:21:59,078
What is it? What about them?

496
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,491
Well, they're very nice.
They're great, you know,

497
00:22:01,492 --> 00:22:04,248
to be around, they love food, wine.
They're great cooks...

498
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:06,868
But, I don't know, maybe
I've had really bad luck with them.

499
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:08,042
Why? What do you mean?

500
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:10,457
Uhm, well...

501
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,090
- I guess they're not as ...
- What?

502
00:22:12,091 --> 00:22:13,184
What's the word?

503
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:15,159
Uhm...

504
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Horny?

505
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:18,036
- They're not as horny...
- Horny?

506
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,212
All right, well, listen
to me on this one:

507
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,948
In that regard,
I'm proud to be an American.

508
00:22:22,949 --> 00:22:24,531
And you should be,
in that regard only.

509
00:22:24,861 --> 00:22:25,941
<i>Merci.</i>

510
00:22:26,628 --> 00:22:28,415
Have you ever spent some time
in Eastern Europe?

511
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,755
Eastern? No, no...

512
00:22:29,768 --> 00:22:31,559
No?

513
00:22:32,222 --> 00:22:34,646
I remember as a teenager
I went to Warsaw,

514
00:22:34,647 --> 00:22:37,262
when it was still
a strict communist regime.

515
00:22:37,553 --> 00:22:39,437
Which I don't approve of at all.

516
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:40,318
Sure you don't...

517
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,366
- No, I do...
-No, I'm just kidding!

518
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:45,436
But, anyway, something about being
there was very interesting, I found.

519
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:46,437
After a couple of weeks,

520
00:22:46,438 --> 00:22:48,599
something changed in me.

521
00:22:49,057 --> 00:22:51,097
The city was quite gloomy and gray...

522
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,459
but, after a while, my brain
seemed clearer.

523
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,336
I was writing a lot more in my journal,

524
00:22:57,337 --> 00:22:58,918
ideas I never thought of before.

525
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,246
Communist ideas?

526
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:02,103
- Listen, I'm not...
- I'm sorry, I can't...

527
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:04,635
Go on!

528
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,898
I'll send you to a Gulag!

529
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:09,918
No... But, it took me
a while to figure out why

530
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,452
it felt, you know, so different.

531
00:23:11,453 --> 00:23:13,989
And then, one day, as I was walking
through the Jewish cemetery,

532
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,290
I don't know why,
but it occurred to me there,

533
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:18,284
I realized that I had spent
the last 2 weeks

534
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:20,081
away from most of my habits.

535
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:24,734
TV was in a language I didn't understand,

536
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:26,983
So, all I've been doing was...

537
00:23:26,984 --> 00:23:29,446
walk around, thinking right!

538
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,383
My brain felt like it was at rest,
free from the consuming frenzy.

539
00:23:33,384 --> 00:23:35,581
And I have to say, it was
almost like a natural high.

540
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,538
I felt so peaceful inside,

541
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:40,350
no... strange urge to be
somewhere else,

542
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:41,408
to shop...

543
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:44,040
Maybe it could have seemed
like boredom at first,

544
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,261
but it quickly became very,
very sore full.

545
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:48,522
It's interesting, you know?

546
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:52,100
Can you believe that it was 9 years ago
that we were walking around Vienna?

547
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:54,937
Nine years?
No that's impossible...

548
00:23:54,938 --> 00:23:56,466
It was, it feels like two
months ago to me,

549
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,150
but it was summer '94.

550
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:02,199
Do I look any different?

551
00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:06,067
I do?

552
00:24:07,474 --> 00:24:08,679
I'd have to see you naked.

553
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,071
- What?
- I'm sorry...

554
00:24:10,934 --> 00:24:12,905
Your hair was different
back then, it was like...

555
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:15,762
- What, it's the same...
- Take it down, let's see!

556
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:16,794
- Down, it was down.
- Yeah.

557
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:18,008
Ok.

558
00:24:18,098 --> 00:24:19,508
Well, voila!

559
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,544
So?

560
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:25,682
Ok, come on, tell me.

561
00:24:29,482 --> 00:24:31,586
Skinnier, I think,
more thinner.

562
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,993
Did you think I was fat before?

563
00:24:34,994 --> 00:24:35,838
No.

564
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,618
Yeah, you thought I was a fatty.
No, you thought I was a fatty...

565
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,238
You wrote a book about
a fat French girl!

566
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:44,586
- Oh, no.
- Seriously, all right,

567
00:24:44,587 --> 00:24:46,021
you look beautiful.

568
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:48,089
Do I look any different?

569
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:49,902
No.

570
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:52,797
No, no real... oh, actually,
you have this line.

571
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:55,321
- I know.
- Looks like a scar.

572
00:24:55,322 --> 00:24:58,101
A scar? What, a gun shot wound?

573
00:24:58,102 --> 00:24:59,719
No, no, no, I lied to you,
I'm sorry.

574
00:25:01,264 --> 00:25:06,007
I had this funny... well,
horrible dream the other day.

575
00:25:06,993 --> 00:25:10,536
I was having this awful
nightmare, that I was 32,

576
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:13,440
and then I woke up, and I was 23!

577
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:14,334
So relieved...

578
00:25:14,335 --> 00:25:17,307
And then I woke up for real,
and I was 32.

579
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:19,306
- Scary!
- It happens.

580
00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:21,692
Yeah, time goes faster and faster.

581
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:24,425
Apparently, it's because we don't
renew our synapses live to 20.

582
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:26,041
So, it's pretty much
downhill from then on.

583
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,685
I like getting older,
you know, it feels...

584
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,773
I don't know,
it feels more immediate.

585
00:25:32,774 --> 00:25:34,804
You know, like I can
appreciate things more.

586
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,103
No, me too, actually.
I really love it.

587
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:39,473
I was once a...

588
00:25:40,394 --> 00:25:41,583
...a drummer in a band.

589
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:42,344
You were?

590
00:25:42,345 --> 00:25:44,461
Yeah, we were pretty good, actually.

591
00:25:44,462 --> 00:25:46,984
But the lead singer guy,
he was just so obsessed

592
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:49,247
with us getting a record deal.

593
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:51,171
You know, it's all we talked about,
it was all we thought about,

594
00:25:51,172 --> 00:25:52,077
getting bigger shows,

595
00:25:52,078 --> 00:25:54,676
and everything was just...
focus on the future, all the time!

596
00:25:54,677 --> 00:25:55,593
And now, the...

597
00:25:55,594 --> 00:25:57,497
... band doesn't even exist anymore.

598
00:25:57,498 --> 00:26:00,223
Right, I'm looking back at the...
at the shows we did play,

599
00:26:00,224 --> 00:26:02,936
even rehearsing,
... it was so much fun!

600
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,011
Now I'd be able to enjoy
every minute of it.

601
00:26:06,012 --> 00:26:06,984
Can I have a trier?

602
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,123
Well, your book has been
published, that's...

603
00:26:10,124 --> 00:26:12,978
that's pretty big deal, and you've
been all around Europe with it.

604
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:14,797
Are you enjoying
every minute of it?

605
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,188
- Not really...
- Not really?

606
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:20,588
Do you have another one of those?

607
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:22,325
Yes, of course.

608
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,004
Here.

609
00:26:26,691 --> 00:26:31,059
In my field, I see these people...
oh, sorry... coming to it with big

610
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:35,527
idealist visions of becoming the new
leader that will create a better world.

611
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:37,577
They enjoy the goal,
but not the process!

612
00:26:37,578 --> 00:26:38,384
Right.

613
00:26:38,385 --> 00:26:41,358
But the reality of it is that the
true work of improving things

614
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,242
is in the little achievements
of the day.

615
00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:45,335
And that's what you need to enjoy,
just take my field.

616
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:46,823
What, what do you mean, exactly?

617
00:26:46,824 --> 00:26:48,983
Well, for example, I was working
for this organization that helped

618
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,294
villages in Mexico.

619
00:26:50,295 --> 00:26:53,023
And their concerns was
how to get the pencils

620
00:26:53,024 --> 00:26:56,128
sent to the kid in these
little country schools.

621
00:26:56,129 --> 00:26:58,289
I was not about big
revolutionary ideas,

622
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,757
it was about pencils!

623
00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:02,393
I see the people that do the real work

624
00:27:02,394 --> 00:27:03,987
and what's really said,
in a way, is that...

625
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:06,653
the people that are
the most giving, hard working

626
00:27:06,654 --> 00:27:08,546
and capable of making this world better,

627
00:27:08,547 --> 00:27:11,828
usually don't have the ego
and ambition to be a leader.

628
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,397
They don't see the interest
in superficial rewards,

629
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:18,218
they don't care if their name
ever appear in the press,

630
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,215
they actually enjoy the process
of helping others,

631
00:27:21,616 --> 00:27:23,013
they're in the moment!

632
00:27:23,014 --> 00:27:24,750
Yeah, but that's so hard!

633
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:25,733
You know, to be in the moment,

634
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:26,871
and I just feel like I'm...

635
00:27:27,617 --> 00:27:31,500
designed to be slightly
dissatisfied with everything...

636
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:34,490
You know, I mean, like...
always trying to better my situation.

637
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:37,333
You know, I satisfy
one desire, and it just...

638
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:38,521
agitates another, you know?

639
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:39,799
Then I think:
to hell with everything, right?

640
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,670
I mean, desire is the fuel of life

641
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:43,908
I mean, do you think
it's true that if...

642
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,963
if we never wanted anything,
we'd never be unhappy?

643
00:27:47,964 --> 00:27:48,845
I don't know...

644
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:51,571
Not wanting anything,
isn't that...

645
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:53,291
a symptom of depression?

646
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:54,788
Yeah, that is, right?

647
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:56,748
I mean, it's healthy to desire, right?

648
00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:57,661
Yeah...

649
00:27:57,662 --> 00:27:59,069
I don't know,

650
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,129
I mean, it's what all those
Buddhist guys say, right?

651
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,631
You know, liberate yourself from desire

652
00:28:02,632 --> 00:28:05,244
and you'll find that you already
have everything you need.

653
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:07,183
Yeah, but I feel really
alive when I want

654
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:09,639
something more than
just basic survival needs.

655
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,695
I mean, wanting whether it's...
intimacy with another person,

656
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:14,648
or a new pair of shoes,
is kind of beautiful...

657
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:17,228
I like that we have those
ever-renewing desires.

658
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,222
Well, maybe it's just
a sense of entitlement.

659
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:21,815
You know, like whenever
you feel like you

660
00:28:21,816 --> 00:28:24,539
deserve that new pair
of shoes, you know.

661
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,759
It's ok to want things as long as
you don't get pissed off

662
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,972
if you don't get them.

663
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,580
- Yeah.
- Right, life's hard.

664
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:30,717
It's suppose to be.

665
00:28:30,718 --> 00:28:33,371
If we didn't suffer, we wouldn't
learn a thing, you know?

666
00:28:35,388 --> 00:28:37,186
So, what? Are you a Buddhist
or something?

667
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:38,962
No.

668
00:28:38,963 --> 00:28:40,481
No? Why not?

669
00:28:41,174 --> 00:28:42,815
I don't know, I...

670
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:45,455
Same reason I don't consider
myself anything, really.

671
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,300
Yeah, I know. I decided
a long time ago that

672
00:28:48,301 --> 00:28:49,828
I was gonna to be open to everything,

673
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:53,139
but, not buy into any
one-and-only belief system.

674
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,476
I went to this...

675
00:28:55,477 --> 00:28:57,550
trapist monastery,
a couple of years ago.

676
00:28:57,551 --> 00:28:58,620
Trapist?

677
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:00,814
Yeah, they're Catholics,
Cistercians.

678
00:29:02,053 --> 00:29:03,035
Why did you do that?

679
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:05,396
Why? I had just been
doing some reading, I guess...

680
00:29:05,397 --> 00:29:06,885
I don't know, I thought it'd be cool.

681
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:09,809
Have you ever spent any time
with any monks and nuns?

682
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,814
No...

683
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,248
It's not really my style.

684
00:29:12,247 --> 00:29:12,816
No?

685
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,952
I expected them to be all glowering
and stern, but they weren't...

686
00:29:17,953 --> 00:29:20,831
they were really quick to laugh,
really easy to be around.

687
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:23,214
Seriously, very attuned to everything.

688
00:29:23,215 --> 00:29:24,130
They were just...

689
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:26,309
You know, they weren't
trying to hustle anybody.

690
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,849
They're trying to live and die,
in peace with God, you know,

691
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,039
or whatever part of them
they feel is eternal.

692
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,347
It was just so
refreshing to be around.

693
00:29:34,348 --> 00:29:36,719
You know, you realize that most
of the people that you meet

694
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,702
are trying to get somewhere better,

695
00:29:38,703 --> 00:29:40,893
you know, they're trying
to make a little bit more cash,

696
00:29:40,894 --> 00:29:44,007
trying to get a little more respect,
have more people admire them, you know,

697
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:45,246
It's just exhausting!

698
00:29:45,247 --> 00:29:48,261
You know, it's exhausting to be
one of those people yourself.

699
00:29:48,262 --> 00:29:49,967
I mean, there I... there I am, right,

700
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:51,863
you know, all greedy to be more spiritual,

701
00:29:51,864 --> 00:29:53,270
you know, I wanna be a better person.

702
00:29:53,814 --> 00:29:54,807
You can't escape!

703
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,257
I had this...

704
00:29:57,258 --> 00:29:58,901
this boyfriend of mine,

705
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:01,597
many years ago,
that wanted to be a Buddhist, and...

706
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,207
so he went to Asia to visit
some of this monasteries.

707
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:07,013
Yeah, I thought about
doing that, too.

708
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,819
Yeah, you should.
I'll tell you why.

709
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,322
Aaa, he was quite good looking,

710
00:30:10,323 --> 00:30:12,512
and, each time he went
to one of those monasteries,

711
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:14,342
a monk offered to suck his cock.

712
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,050
True story...

713
00:30:17,557 --> 00:30:19,982
Well, then, it all comes
down to that, doesn't it?

714
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:22,893
I mean, I think that's why I really
admire what you're doing.

715
00:30:23,743 --> 00:30:25,184
What do you mean,
sucking cock?

716
00:30:25,185 --> 00:30:26,185
Ah, no...

717
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,632
I was gonna say...

718
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:32,753
you know, you're not
detached... from life.

719
00:30:32,754 --> 00:30:35,227
You know, you're putting
your passion into action.

720
00:30:35,228 --> 00:30:36,431
Well...

721
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:37,636
I try.

722
00:30:38,825 --> 00:30:40,012
You know something,

723
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:41,013
I'm...

724
00:30:41,014 --> 00:30:42,944
I'm gonna be on planes,
and like, an airport

725
00:30:42,945 --> 00:30:43,945
for the next 8 hours.

726
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:45,754
I'd just love to...

727
00:30:45,755 --> 00:30:47,606
to see a little bit more of Paris.

728
00:30:47,607 --> 00:30:49,088
- Could we walk, right...
- Yeah, yeah, let's do that!

729
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:50,742
- Do you mind?
- No, no, no, that's great!

730
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:52,542
- Do you want to?
- Yeah, yeah, that's great!

731
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:53,543
What do we owe here?

732
00:30:53,544 --> 00:30:54,542
4,50...

733
00:30:54,543 --> 00:30:55,921
No, no,
I got it, I got it.

734
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:58,871
Is this good for like a two?

735
00:30:58,872 --> 00:31:00,372
Yeah, that's fine!
That's more.

736
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:04,542
All right, is anywhere
to go around here?

737
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:05,735
It's sales day, today!

738
00:31:06,136 --> 00:31:06,836
What's that?

739
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:09,105
It's when everything
is on sale in Paris.

740
00:31:09,723 --> 00:31:10,673
It's twice a year.

741
00:31:10,974 --> 00:31:11,749
<i>Au revoir!</i>

742
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,409
<i>Au revoir, merci!</i>

743
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,793
All right, let's go shopping!

744
00:31:15,678 --> 00:31:18,386
No, no, no, that's a bad idea.
I don't want to inflict that on you.

745
00:31:18,387 --> 00:31:19,602
It's madness...

746
00:31:19,603 --> 00:31:20,409
Let's just go

747
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,254
to this garden path.

748
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:22,055
All right.

749
00:31:22,056 --> 00:31:23,081
It's really nice...

750
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,323
All right, that sounds better
than shopping, actually...

751
00:31:25,324 --> 00:31:27,204
I mean, not that I wouldn't
do whatever you wanted.

752
00:31:27,783 --> 00:31:30,074
You know, sometimes I don't
even need to buy anything. I just...

753
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:33,085
get high on trying on
and looking at things.

754
00:31:33,086 --> 00:31:35,109
Yeah, well a therapist would tell you...
Is this where we're going?

755
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,241
- Yeah!
- A therapist would tell you

756
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:37,242
it's all good.

757
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:38,243
- Really?
- Yeah.

758
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:39,544
- Are you ever in therapy?
- Oh, no!

759
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:41,244
Do I seem like
I'm in therapy?

760
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:42,590
I'm kidding...

761
00:31:43,593 --> 00:31:45,142
Has it helped your sex problems?

762
00:31:45,143 --> 00:31:47,138
My sex problems?

763
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:48,568
- No, I'm kidding...
- Like what? Tell me the truth.

764
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:50,754
We didn't have any
problems that night.

765
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:51,732
No, I'm kidding!

766
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:52,896
We didn't even have sex, anyway.

767
00:31:52,897 --> 00:31:54,420
But, that's a joke, right?

768
00:31:54,421 --> 00:31:55,353
No, we didn't!

769
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,303
I mean, that was the whole thing.

770
00:31:57,304 --> 00:31:58,304
No, of course we did!

771
00:31:58,305 --> 00:31:59,357
No, no, no, we didn't.

772
00:31:59,358 --> 00:32:01,085
You didn't have a condom,
and I never have sex without one.

773
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,086
Especially on a one night thing.

774
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,498
I mean, I'm extremely
paranoid about my health.

775
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:05,162
- There's no way I would have...
- Whoa, I find this very scary

776
00:32:05,163 --> 00:32:06,529
that you don't remember what happened.

777
00:32:06,936 --> 00:32:08,269
No, listen, ok...

778
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,935
I didn't write an entire book,

779
00:32:09,936 --> 00:32:11,422
but I kept a journal, ok?

780
00:32:11,423 --> 00:32:12,967
And I wrote the whole night in it.

781
00:32:12,968 --> 00:32:15,034
That's what I mean,
you idealizing the night!

782
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:16,470
All right, listen!

783
00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:19,365
I even remember what
brand of condom we used.

784
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:21,220
Okay, that's disgusting.
I don't want to hear it!

785
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:22,408
It's not disgusting...

786
00:32:24,182 --> 00:32:25,541
Ok, you know what,
when I get home,

787
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,793
I'll check my journal from '94,
but I know I'm right!

788
00:32:31,478 --> 00:32:33,165
- Wait a minute...
- What?

789
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,097
Was it in a cemetery?

790
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:36,376
No...

791
00:32:36,377 --> 00:32:39,074
No, we went to the
cemetery in the afternoon,

792
00:32:39,075 --> 00:32:40,176
it was in a park.

793
00:32:40,177 --> 00:32:41,682
Very late at night.

794
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:43,475
In the park!

795
00:32:43,476 --> 00:32:44,476
Wait a minute...

796
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:46,515
Okay...

797
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,815
Is it that forgettable?

798
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:50,846
I mean, you really don't
remember... in the park!

799
00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:52,051
Okay, wait a minute.

800
00:32:52,052 --> 00:32:52,690
I...

801
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:53,851
I think you might be right...

802
00:32:53,852 --> 00:32:55,427
All right now, you're
messing with me, now.

803
00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:56,853
Are you messing with me?

804
00:32:56,854 --> 00:32:58,174
Ok, no, I'm sorry!

805
00:32:58,175 --> 00:32:59,977
I think you...
I mean, you're right, okay?

806
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,696
Sometimes, I put things in drawers
inside my head, and forget about it.

807
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:06,971
I guess it's less painful to put certain
things away than to live with it!

808
00:33:06,972 --> 00:33:07,905
- I'm sorry!
- It's like that...

809
00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:09,741
... that night was a sad
memory for you?

810
00:33:09,742 --> 00:33:11,511
No, I didn't mean that
night in particular...

811
00:33:11,512 --> 00:33:13,748
I just meant certain things
are better off forgotten.

812
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:16,375
I remember that night better
than I do entire years.

813
00:33:16,758 --> 00:33:17,675
Me too.

814
00:33:17,676 --> 00:33:18,987
Really?

815
00:33:18,988 --> 00:33:20,881
Well, I thought I did...

816
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:24,817
But, maybe I...

817
00:33:24,818 --> 00:33:27,060
Maybe I put it away
because of the fact that...

818
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:29,302
My grandmother's funeral
was the day

819
00:33:29,303 --> 00:33:31,239
we were supposed to meet again.

820
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,817
It was a tough day for me,
but must have been worse for you.

821
00:33:33,818 --> 00:33:35,145
It was unreal.

822
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,769
I remember looking at a dead
body in the coffin.

823
00:33:39,175 --> 00:33:43,215
Her beautiful hands so warm, so sweet,
that used to hold me, that...

824
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:46,575
Nothing in that coffin resembled
what I remembered of her.

825
00:33:47,313 --> 00:33:48,647
All the warmth was gone.

826
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:50,446
Then I was crying...

827
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:53,576
so confused if I was crying because
I was never gonna see her again,

828
00:33:53,577 --> 00:33:54,467
I'd never gonna see...

829
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:56,439
... you again.

830
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,041
I'm sorry.

831
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:00,163
I'm sorry to go on like this,

832
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,468
I've been a little down this week,
I don't know...

833
00:34:01,469 --> 00:34:02,325
- Why?

834
00:34:02,326 --> 00:34:04,472
I don't know, nothing bad, just...

835
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:06,708
reading your book, maybe?

836
00:34:07,276 --> 00:34:08,213
No, but...

837
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:11,173
thinking about how hopeful
I was that summer and fall,

838
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,918
and since then it's
been kind of a...

839
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,236
I don't know.

840
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:18,211
Memory is a wonderful thing,
if you don't have to...

841
00:34:18,212 --> 00:34:19,377
deal with the past.

842
00:34:22,743 --> 00:34:25,192
Memory is a wonderful thing,
if you don't have to deal with the past.

843
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:26,556
Can I put that on a bumper stick?

844
00:34:26,557 --> 00:34:28,682
No, you know what? If you wrote
a book about our life,

845
00:34:28,683 --> 00:34:29,928
that would be a good title!

846
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:31,980
Yeah, it could be a
totally different book.

847
00:34:31,981 --> 00:34:33,517
Yeah, there'd be no sex nights.

848
00:34:34,476 --> 00:34:35,683
But you know what?

849
00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:36,394
What?

850
00:34:36,395 --> 00:34:37,484
Now that we've met again,

851
00:34:37,485 --> 00:34:40,181
we can change our memory
of that December 16th.

852
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:43,832
It no longer has that sad ending
of us never seeing each other again.

853
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:44,833
- Right?
- Right.

854
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,836
I guess a memory is never finished.

855
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:48,424
So long as you're alive...

856
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:50,060
Yeah, I know.

857
00:34:50,462 --> 00:34:52,546
I have this memory from my childhood,

858
00:34:52,547 --> 00:34:54,918
that, I realized recently,
never happened!

859
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:55,676
What?

860
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,673
Well, when I was 8 or 9,

861
00:34:57,674 --> 00:34:59,996
my mom was so paranoid
when I was walking home,

862
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,808
from my piano lesson at night,

863
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:03,600
she would always warn me
about dirty old men,

864
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,600
giving me candy,

865
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:06,150
and then showing me their penis...

866
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:08,464
She was so obsessed with it, that...

867
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:10,457
later in life, you know,
I had...

868
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:13,244
I had this image in my head
that that's really happened!

869
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:16,721
To the point that I even associated
sex with that walk home.

870
00:35:17,295 --> 00:35:19,266
I mean, sometimes, even now,

871
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:20,063
when I'm...

872
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,924
when I'm having sex, I see
myself walking down that street.

873
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:26,926
I swear!

874
00:35:26,927 --> 00:35:28,242
It's so weird, right?

875
00:35:28,243 --> 00:35:29,275
Well, is that street near by?

876
00:35:29,276 --> 00:35:30,290
I mean, could...

877
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,858
No...

878
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:33,585
Very far.

879
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,891
Did you ever keep a journal
when you were a kid?

880
00:35:37,892 --> 00:35:39,439
Uhm, yeah...

881
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,131
On and off,
I guess.

882
00:35:42,295 --> 00:35:43,526
It's funny, I read a...

883
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:45,875
one of mine from '83,
the other day.

884
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:46,576
Yeah

885
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,296
And, what really
surprised me, was that

886
00:35:48,297 --> 00:35:51,207
I was feeling with life,
the same way am now.

887
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:53,427
I was much hopeful and naive,

888
00:35:53,428 --> 00:35:54,571
but the core,

889
00:35:54,572 --> 00:35:56,006
and the way I was feeling things,

890
00:35:56,007 --> 00:35:57,522
is exactly the same!

891
00:35:57,923 --> 00:36:00,221
It made me realize I haven't
changed much at all.

892
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:01,658
Yeah, I don't think anybody does,

893
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,777
and people don't want
to admit it, but it's like we just...

894
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:05,686
we have this innate set points.

895
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:06,678
- Aha.
- You know, it's like...

896
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:10,117
nothing much that happens to us
changes our disposition.

897
00:36:10,118 --> 00:36:10,953
Really, you believe that?

898
00:36:10,954 --> 00:36:13,324
I think so. I read this study
where they followed people

899
00:36:13,325 --> 00:36:16,409
who won the lottery, and people
who had become paraplegic, right.

900
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,699
You'd think that...

901
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,068
you know, one extreme
is gonna make you...

902
00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:21,419
euphoric, and the other suicidal.

903
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,130
But the study shows that
after about 6 months,

904
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:25,211
- Uhum
- Right...

905
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:27,570
As soon as people got used to
their new situation,

906
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:29,319
they were more or less the same.

907
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,996
- The same?
- Well, yeah...

908
00:36:31,031 --> 00:36:34,174
Like if they were basically
an optimistic, jovial person,

909
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:36,686
they're now an optimistic,
jovial person, in a wheel chair.

910
00:36:36,687 --> 00:36:38,905
If they're a petty miserable asshole,

911
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:41,969
ok, they're a petty miserable asshole
with a new Cadillac, a house and a boat.

912
00:36:42,878 --> 00:36:44,208
So, you now be forever depressed,

913
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:46,344
no matter what great
things happen in my life?

914
00:36:46,345 --> 00:36:47,405
Definitely!

915
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:48,998
- Great!
- No, come on...

916
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,056
Are you depressed now?

917
00:36:50,057 --> 00:36:51,489
No, no, I'm not depressed.

918
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:53,968
But, sometimes I worry that

919
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:57,093
I'll get to the end of my life feeling
I haven't done all I've all I wanted to do.

920
00:36:57,094 --> 00:36:58,117
Oh, what do you wanna do?

921
00:36:58,914 --> 00:37:02,443
Oh, I want to paint more,
I wanna...

922
00:37:02,444 --> 00:37:03,979
play my guitar everyday,

923
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,290
I wanna learn Chinese,

924
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:06,874
I wanna write more songs...

925
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:09,200
There're so many things I wanna do,

926
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:10,510
and end up doing not much.

927
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:14,671
All right, well,
let me ask you this:

928
00:37:14,672 --> 00:37:15,907
Do you believe in, like...

929
00:37:15,908 --> 00:37:17,457
ghosts or spirits?

930
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,187
Uhm, no.

931
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:21,688
- No?
- No.

932
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:23,736
Ok, what about reincarnation?

933
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:25,668
Not at all.

934
00:37:25,669 --> 00:37:26,236
God?

935
00:37:26,237 --> 00:37:27,040
No.

936
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:29,737
That sounds terrible.

937
00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:30,551
No, no, no

938
00:37:30,552 --> 00:37:31,210
But, at the same time

939
00:37:31,211 --> 00:37:34,491
I don't wanna be one of those people
that don't believe in any kind of magic.

940
00:37:34,492 --> 00:37:35,681
So, then astrology.

941
00:37:35,816 --> 00:37:37,393
- Yes, of course!
- There we go!

942
00:37:37,428 --> 00:37:38,661
I mean, that makes sense, right?

943
00:37:38,662 --> 00:37:40,850
You're a Scorpio, I'm a Sag,
so we get along.

944
00:37:44,107 --> 00:37:44,952
No, no.

945
00:37:44,953 --> 00:37:47,681
There's an Einstein quote
I really, really like.

946
00:37:47,877 --> 00:37:51,755
He said: "If you don't believe in any
kind of magic, or mystery,

947
00:37:51,756 --> 00:37:53,399
basically, (you're) as good as dead."

948
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:54,869
Yeah, I like that.

949
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:58,141
I've always felt there was some kind
of mystical chord in the Universe.

950
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:01,011
More recently, I started to think that...

951
00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:04,019
that me... you know,
my personality, whatever, that...

952
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,657
I don't have any
permanent place here.

953
00:38:06,658 --> 00:38:08,677
You know, in Eternity,
or whatever, you know.

954
00:38:08,678 --> 00:38:10,851
And the more I think that,
I can't go through life

955
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:12,952
saying that this is
no big deal, you know.

956
00:38:12,953 --> 00:38:14,054
I mean, this is it!

957
00:38:14,055 --> 00:38:14,873
This is actually happening.

958
00:38:14,874 --> 00:38:17,099
What do you... think is interesting,
what do you think is funny,

959
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,594
what do you think is important?

960
00:38:18,595 --> 00:38:19,595
You know, every day is our last!

961
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:22,872
When I feel that way, I...

962
00:38:22,873 --> 00:38:25,359
usually call my mom to tell her
how much I love her.

963
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,029
Yeah

964
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,136
And she's always:
"Are you ok?"

965
00:38:28,137 --> 00:38:29,284
"Do you have cancer?"

966
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:31,235
"Are you going to commit suicide?"

967
00:38:31,236 --> 00:38:32,688
It's almost not worth it.

968
00:38:35,142 --> 00:38:36,310
So...

969
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:37,498
So, what about us?

970
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:39,062
What about us?

971
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:42,535
No, what I mean is, if we were
both going to die, tonight...

972
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:44,290
What, like if the Apocalypse was coming?

973
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:45,378
No, no, that's too dramatic.

974
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:46,093
But, what if...

975
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:48,721
you know, just the two of us
were going to die.

976
00:38:48,722 --> 00:38:52,141
I mean, would we talk about
your book, the environment or...

977
00:38:53,202 --> 00:38:54,175
If today was our last day?

978
00:38:54,176 --> 00:38:56,613
Yeah, what would we talk about,
what would you tell me, for example?

979
00:38:56,614 --> 00:38:57,672
Well...

980
00:38:57,673 --> 00:38:59,941
- That's hard.
- No, I'll do it, I'll do it.

981
00:38:59,942 --> 00:39:00,827
I definitely...

982
00:39:00,828 --> 00:39:02,676
would stop talking about my book.

983
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:04,923
I have to admit I would probably
drop the environment.

984
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:06,625
But, I would still...

985
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:07,510
want to talk about,

986
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,707
you know, magic and the Universe.

987
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,175
I'd just wanna do it from a...

988
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:12,637
What?

989
00:39:12,638 --> 00:39:14,005
... a hotel room.

990
00:39:14,006 --> 00:39:16,299
You know, in between
sessions of us...

991
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,661
... wildly... fucking,
until we die.

992
00:39:18,662 --> 00:39:19,662
Wow!

993
00:39:19,663 --> 00:39:21,694
Well, why waste time with an hotel room?

994
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:24,138
Why not do it right there...
on the bench?

995
00:39:25,603 --> 00:39:27,063
- No...
- Come here, come here...

996
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:29,115
Ok

997
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,824
We're not gonna die tonight.

998
00:39:30,825 --> 00:39:32,374
- Ok?
- All right, too bad...

999
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:33,397
I'm sorry.

1000
00:39:33,398 --> 00:39:35,025
That was an extreme example.

1001
00:39:35,026 --> 00:39:36,646
- I'm sorry.
- Ok.

1002
00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:39,512
What I... My point was, you know,

1003
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:42,364
to truly communicate with
people is very hard to do

1004
00:39:42,365 --> 00:39:45,428
I know, I mean most of our...
most of our day to day exchanges

1005
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:46,815
Yeah, I know, I mean...

1006
00:39:46,816 --> 00:39:49,139
not to bring everything back to sex

1007
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,685
But, why not?

1008
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:50,886
No, no, this example,

1009
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:51,868
this friend of mine, she...

1010
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:55,703
she was talking about she
and her boyfriend, problems at bed...

1011
00:39:55,704 --> 00:39:56,215
Right...

1012
00:39:56,216 --> 00:39:58,759
... and how when,
they had been dating for a year,

1013
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,721
she started telling him what
he could do to please her more.

1014
00:40:01,722 --> 00:40:03,006
And it totally freaked him out!

1015
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:03,861
- Why?
- Totally.

1016
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:07,355
Well, he felt all threatened
and he thought he was a bad lover.

1017
00:40:07,356 --> 00:40:08,418
Maybe she shouldn't
have waited so long.

1018
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:09,874
- You know, after an year...
- Well, yeah, but,

1019
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,550
men are so easily offended!

1020
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:12,656
Oh, what, more than women, you think?

1021
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:14,527
- Oh, definitely on that subject!
- You think so?

1022
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:15,528
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1023
00:40:16,477 --> 00:40:18,099
Well, maybe it's because, you know...

1024
00:40:18,653 --> 00:40:19,584
Men are...

1025
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:21,483
easier to...

1026
00:40:21,484 --> 00:40:22,252
you know,

1027
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:22,899
... to please.

1028
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,863
- Well, I don't know...
- Yeah, they are, they definitely...

1029
00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:25,948
definitely.

1030
00:40:25,949 --> 00:40:28,612
Anyway, this friend of mine,
she was telling me that,

1031
00:40:28,613 --> 00:40:29,885
next time she dates another man,

1032
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,136
she's gonna make
a little questionnaire,

1033
00:40:32,137 --> 00:40:34,230
about what they like and dislike,
for the event...

1034
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,840
Like written down, or out loud?

1035
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:37,681
Yeah, yeah, written down,
mostly written down.

1036
00:40:37,682 --> 00:40:38,682
But it wouldn't be just...

1037
00:40:39,483 --> 00:40:40,441
you know, yes or no,

1038
00:40:40,442 --> 00:40:41,738
it would be a little more
complex than that.

1039
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,227
Like for example, if the question is:

1040
00:40:43,228 --> 00:40:44,782
"Are you into S and M?"

1041
00:40:44,783 --> 00:40:47,489
The answer could be "No, but..."

1042
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,903
"... a good spanking
once in a while, doesn't hurt."

1043
00:40:49,904 --> 00:40:51,882
- Right?
- Right. Or like:

1044
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:54,296
"Do you like talking dirty in bed?"

1045
00:40:54,297 --> 00:40:55,102
That kind of thing?

1046
00:40:55,103 --> 00:40:56,211
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but not just like...

1047
00:40:56,212 --> 00:40:57,508
any dirty talk.

1048
00:40:57,509 --> 00:41:00,207
Just like: "What specific word
would you like to hear?"

1049
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,216
- You know, like...
- What, me?

1050
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:01,974
Well, yeah.

1051
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:04,560
Like, for example, like what specific
word would you like to hear?

1052
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:05,681
I don't know...

1053
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:07,451
Uhm...

1054
00:41:07,452 --> 00:41:09,996
What do you feel about
the word "Pussy"?

1055
00:41:10,465 --> 00:41:12,351
I... love it.

1056
00:41:13,618 --> 00:41:14,281
Good.

1057
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,630
It's amazing what...

1058
00:41:16,631 --> 00:41:18,136
perverts we've become
in the past 9 years.

1059
00:41:18,137 --> 00:41:18,835
I know, I know.

1060
00:41:18,836 --> 00:41:20,280
Well, at least now we
don't have to pretend that

1061
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:23,359
each new sexual experience is
like a life altering event.

1062
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,118
I know, by now, you know
you've stuck it in so many places,

1063
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,119
it's like, about to fall off.

1064
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,872
I mean, you know,
I can't realistically

1065
00:41:28,873 --> 00:41:31,467
expect you to have become
anything but a total hole, at this point.

1066
00:41:31,468 --> 00:41:32,428
Yeah, thank you.

1067
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:34,021
No, I'm sor...

1068
00:41:35,261 --> 00:41:37,119
That's true, what can you do?

1069
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,436
What can you do...

1070
00:41:38,745 --> 00:41:40,302
So...

1071
00:41:40,303 --> 00:41:41,805
What kind of songs do you write?

1072
00:41:41,806 --> 00:41:43,298
- I didn't know you did that.
- What kind?

1073
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:45,558
- Yeah, sure.
- I don't know, just songs.

1074
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:47,863
Like some are, you know, people,

1075
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:50,621
Uhm, relationships...
one's about my cat!

1076
00:41:50,622 --> 00:41:51,429
Sing one!

1077
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,993
- Just...
- No, I can't, I don't have a guitar.

1078
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:54,586
Come on, acapella.

1079
00:41:54,587 --> 00:41:57,167
No, no, no, I'm not singing
a song without a guitar, you're nuts!

1080
00:41:58,681 --> 00:42:00,347
Why not?

1081
00:42:00,348 --> 00:42:01,125
It's...

1082
00:42:01,126 --> 00:42:02,366
Oh, ok, not now.

1083
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,104
No.

1084
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:04,679
If not now, when?

1085
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,521
You want to meet here
in six months, with a guitar?

1086
00:42:06,522 --> 00:42:09,666
You know, I'll fly all they way over here,
you may or may not make the metro...

1087
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:10,934
Ok, that's...
that's funny.

1088
00:42:11,844 --> 00:42:14,090
We've got to get going
back to the bookstore!

1089
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:15,880
You'll miss your flight.
Come on, let's go!

1090
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:17,483
- All right, all right.
- We can walk down La Sennes.

1091
00:42:17,484 --> 00:42:18,745
It's a nice thing.

1092
00:42:20,529 --> 00:42:21,839
So, you're flying back to New York?

1093
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,212
Yeah, yeah.

1094
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:28,340
So I read in that article that
you're married, with a kid.

1095
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:30,195
That's great!

1096
00:42:30,196 --> 00:42:31,612
Yeah, he's... he's...

1097
00:42:31,613 --> 00:42:32,613
He's 4.

1098
00:42:32,914 --> 00:42:34,023
Uhum, what's his name?

1099
00:42:34,024 --> 00:42:34,502
Henry.

1100
00:42:34,503 --> 00:42:35,543
Little Hen,

1101
00:42:35,544 --> 00:42:36,654
he's so much fun.

1102
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:38,242
Oh, wow,
I'm sure!

1103
00:42:38,243 --> 00:42:39,573
And, your wife,
what does she do?

1104
00:42:39,574 --> 00:42:41,329
She teaches elementary school.

1105
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:42,916
Do you have kids?

1106
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:43,678
Yes, two.

1107
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:44,586
Hih, shit!

1108
00:42:44,587 --> 00:42:45,887
- What?
- I left them in the car!

1109
00:42:45,888 --> 00:42:47,737
With the windows up,
it was 6 months ago...

1110
00:42:48,577 --> 00:42:49,587
No, I'm kidding...

1111
00:42:49,588 --> 00:42:52,743
No, but... I want to have kids someday,
I'm just not ready, yet.

1112
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:55,305
Yeah, I'm in a good relationship, though.

1113
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,646
- Oh, yeah? That's good.
- Yeah.

1114
00:42:57,047 --> 00:42:58,034
What's he do?

1115
00:42:58,035 --> 00:42:59,035
He's a photo journalist,

1116
00:42:59,036 --> 00:43:00,940
he does war coverage.

1117
00:43:01,353 --> 00:43:04,328
He's away a lot, which in a way is
good for me, because I'm so busy...

1118
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:05,261
Yeah, but isn't it dangerous?

1119
00:43:05,262 --> 00:43:07,738
I mean, aren't a lot of this guys
getting killed this days?

1120
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:10,530
He promises me he
doesn't take risks.

1121
00:43:10,531 --> 00:43:11,860
But I often worry,

1122
00:43:11,861 --> 00:43:14,493
he goes in this trance when he
starts to photograph some things.

1123
00:43:14,494 --> 00:43:15,494
What do you mean?

1124
00:43:15,495 --> 00:43:17,691
Well, once we were in New Delhi

1125
00:43:17,692 --> 00:43:20,407
and we pass a bum,
that was lying down the sidewalk,

1126
00:43:20,408 --> 00:43:21,429
- A bump?
- A bum!

1127
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,395
A homeless...

1128
00:43:22,396 --> 00:43:23,234
- A bum, all right.

1129
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:24,310
Anyway, like,

1130
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:25,448
he looked like he needed help,

1131
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:27,408
but his first reaction
was to photograph him!

1132
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:29,173
He went, like, really close to his face,

1133
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:30,535
fixing his collar, to make it look better.

1134
00:43:30,536 --> 00:43:32,376
He was like totally
detached from the person.

1135
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:34,603
Yeah, but you can act to be
like that, to be good at that job.

1136
00:43:34,604 --> 00:43:36,515
Yeah, I mean, I'm not...

1137
00:43:36,516 --> 00:43:38,324
you know, I'm not...
I'm not judging him for it,

1138
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:40,213
you know, what he does is
essential and incredible.

1139
00:43:40,214 --> 00:43:41,885
All I'm saying is that
I could never do it.

1140
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:43,288
Let's get on that boat!

1141
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:44,289
- Come on!

1142
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:45,591
- No!
- No, come on, it will be fun!

1143
00:43:45,592 --> 00:43:47,081
You don't have time!
We gotta go.

1144
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,697
It's just about to take off.
Look, I've got... I've got...

1145
00:43:48,698 --> 00:43:50,994
15 more minutes...
Do you have a cell phone?

1146
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,195
- Yeah.
- Look, I got that...

1147
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,654
that driver guy's number,
and I can call him, and then they...

1148
00:43:54,655 --> 00:43:56,533
... pick us up at where ever
they stop this.

1149
00:43:56,534 --> 00:43:59,365
- Ok, I've never been on this boats,
it's for tourists, it's embarrassing!

1150
00:43:59,366 --> 00:44:01,125
Ok, all right.

1151
00:44:01,126 --> 00:44:02,956
Uhm, c'est bon?
Pouvons-nous entrer?

1152
00:44:03,464 --> 00:44:05,894
- Deux tickettes, s'il vous plait!
- No, I'll get it, I'll get it.

1153
00:44:06,195 --> 00:44:08,521
- Non, non, c'est bon!
- All right, all right, all right.

1154
00:44:09,882 --> 00:44:12,074
<i>C'est qu'il s'arette du prochain arette?</i>

1155
00:44:14,133 --> 00:44:16,185
So, you're in love with that guy?

1156
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,594
What guy?

1157
00:44:17,595 --> 00:44:18,693
The...
the war photographer.

1158
00:44:18,694 --> 00:44:19,957
Yes!
Of course.

1159
00:44:21,035 --> 00:44:21,725
Merci.

1160
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:26,368
I'm sorry, do you...
do you have that cell phone?

1161
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:27,446
Oh, yeah.

1162
00:44:30,522 --> 00:44:31,769
All right, what do I tell him?

1163
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,117
Tell him to pick you up at
"Quai Henry IV"

1164
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:36,571
Oh, shit.
At "Que..."

1165
00:44:36,872 --> 00:44:38,088
Henry quatre

1166
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:39,317
Quai Henry IV

1167
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:41,836
... HENRY QUATRE...

1168
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,530
What's wrong with you?

1169
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:44,531
No, do you want me to...

1170
00:44:44,532 --> 00:44:45,573
Henry quatre.

1171
00:44:45,574 --> 00:44:46,150
Henry four?

1172
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:46,797
Yes!

1173
00:44:47,198 --> 00:44:47,798
Come on, why didn't you says so?

1174
00:44:47,799 --> 00:44:48,811
I'm sorry!

1175
00:45:02,405 --> 00:45:04,358
Yes, is this Philippe?

1176
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:06,331
Yeah, Philippe, this is Jesse Wallace...

1177
00:45:06,741 --> 00:45:08,586
Yeah,

1178
00:45:08,564 --> 00:45:10,364
Listen, I'm...

1179
00:45:10,365 --> 00:45:11,791
I'm on one of those
boats, right?

1180
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,404
And we're gonna arrive at...

1181
00:45:14,787 --> 00:45:15,293
at...

1182
00:45:15,294 --> 00:45:19,611
Henry Four... four,
Henry Four, you know that is?

1183
00:45:19,612 --> 00:45:22,155
All right, gre...
And you have my bags, right?

1184
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:25,141
Yeah, so will be there in...
I don't know, it's the next stop.

1185
00:45:25,542 --> 00:45:27,017
Ok, au revoir.

1186
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,743
- Ok?
- Yeah, yeah.

1187
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,220
Oh, wow!

1188
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,930
Notre Dame...
check that out!

1189
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,765
I heard this story once,
about when the...

1190
00:45:38,766 --> 00:45:42,197
the Germans were occupying Paris
and they had to retreat back,

1191
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:44,600
they wired Notre Dame to blow.

1192
00:45:44,601 --> 00:45:45,755
But they had to...

1193
00:45:45,756 --> 00:45:49,096
they had to leave one guy
in charge of hitting the switch.

1194
00:45:49,097 --> 00:45:51,064
And the guy, the soldier, he...

1195
00:45:51,065 --> 00:45:52,189
he couldn't do it!

1196
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:53,698
You know, he just sat
there, knocked out

1197
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:54,799
by how beautiful the place was.

1198
00:45:56,284 --> 00:45:57,863
And then, when the allied
troops came in,

1199
00:45:57,864 --> 00:46:00,420
they found all the explosives
just lying there...

1200
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:03,287
and the switch unturned.
And they found the same thing at...

1201
00:46:03,288 --> 00:46:04,276
Saicre Coeur...

1202
00:46:04,277 --> 00:46:05,339
Eiffel Tower...

1203
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,439
a couple of other places,
I think.

1204
00:46:08,328 --> 00:46:09,581
Is that true?

1205
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:11,692
I don't know...

1206
00:46:11,693 --> 00:46:13,513
I always liked that story, though.

1207
00:46:13,514 --> 00:46:15,252
Yeah, that's a great story.

1208
00:46:15,253 --> 00:46:18,097
Did you have to think that
Notre Dame will be gone one day...

1209
00:46:18,322 --> 00:46:20,816
There used to be another church
or cathedral, at the same...

1210
00:46:20,817 --> 00:46:21,598
right there.

1211
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,763
- What, right in the same spot?
- Yeah.

1212
00:46:25,886 --> 00:46:28,614
Yeah, this is great,
I've never done this!

1213
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:31,433
I forget about how beautiful Paris was.

1214
00:46:31,434 --> 00:46:33,301
It's not so bad being
a tourist, you know.

1215
00:46:33,302 --> 00:46:34,602
Thank you for getting
me on the boat.

1216
00:46:34,603 --> 00:46:35,603
Well, you're welcome.

1217
00:46:35,804 --> 00:46:37,144
You know, I think that
book that I wrote,

1218
00:46:37,145 --> 00:46:38,968
in a way, was like
building something.

1219
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:42,880
So that I wouldn't forget the details
of the time that we spent together.

1220
00:46:43,361 --> 00:46:45,267
You know, like just a reminder that...

1221
00:46:45,268 --> 00:46:49,235
that once we really did meet,
you know, that this was real,

1222
00:46:49,236 --> 00:46:50,236
this happened.

1223
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,506
And, how can you say that? Because...

1224
00:46:52,725 --> 00:46:55,630
I mean, I always feel like a freak
because I'm never able to move on like...

1225
00:46:55,631 --> 00:46:56,931
...this! You know.

1226
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,789
People just have an affaire, or
even... entire relationships...

1227
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:03,633
They break up and they forget!

1228
00:47:04,346 --> 00:47:07,212
They move on like they would
have changed a brand of Cereals!

1229
00:47:08,545 --> 00:47:11,461
I feel I was never able to forget
anyone I've been with.

1230
00:47:12,058 --> 00:47:14,113
Because each person have...

1231
00:47:14,114 --> 00:47:15,114
you know,

1232
00:47:15,888 --> 00:47:17,942
specific qualities.

1233
00:47:17,943 --> 00:47:18,943
You can never replace anyone.

1234
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:22,187
What is lost is lost.

1235
00:47:24,024 --> 00:47:26,469
Each relationship, when it ends,
really damages me.

1236
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,090
I haven't fully recovered.

1237
00:47:28,305 --> 00:47:30,761
That's why I'm very careful with
getting involved, because...

1238
00:47:31,651 --> 00:47:33,278
It hurts too much!

1239
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:35,346
Even getting laid!

1240
00:47:35,347 --> 00:47:36,764
I actually don't do that...

1241
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:40,064
I will miss of the person
the most mundane things.

1242
00:47:40,465 --> 00:47:42,189
Like I'm obsessed with little things.

1243
00:47:43,282 --> 00:47:45,028
Maybe I'm crazy, but...

1244
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:48,388
When I was a little girl, my mom
told me that I was always late to school.

1245
00:47:48,976 --> 00:47:50,959
One day she followed me to see why...

1246
00:47:51,462 --> 00:47:54,805
I was looking at chestnuts
falling from the trees,

1247
00:47:54,806 --> 00:47:56,597
rolling on the sidewalk, or...

1248
00:47:57,105 --> 00:47:58,564
ants, crossing the road...

1249
00:47:58,565 --> 00:48:01,363
the way a leaf casts a shadow
on a tree trunk...

1250
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:02,976
Little things.

1251
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,347
I think it's the same with people.

1252
00:48:06,741 --> 00:48:09,762
I see in them little details,
so specific to each other,

1253
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:11,835
that move me, and that I miss, and...

1254
00:48:11,836 --> 00:48:12,836
will always miss.

1255
00:48:13,956 --> 00:48:15,596
You can never replace anyone,

1256
00:48:15,597 --> 00:48:18,759
because everyone is made of such
beautiful specific details.

1257
00:48:23,256 --> 00:48:24,917
Like I remember the way...

1258
00:48:24,918 --> 00:48:26,805
your beard has a little
bit of red in it.

1259
00:48:27,328 --> 00:48:29,451
And how the sun was
making it glow that...

1260
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:31,979
that morning, right before you left.

1261
00:48:33,959 --> 00:48:35,581
I remember that, and...

1262
00:48:35,847 --> 00:48:36,958
I missed it!

1263
00:48:38,017 --> 00:48:39,539
I'm really crazy, right?

1264
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:41,190
All right, now I know for sure.

1265
00:48:41,191 --> 00:48:43,419
You wanna know why
I wrote that stupid book?

1266
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:44,760
Why?

1267
00:48:44,761 --> 00:48:46,912
So that you might come
to a reading in Paris,

1268
00:48:46,913 --> 00:48:48,572
and I go walk up to you
and ask:

1269
00:48:48,573 --> 00:48:50,302
"Where the fuck were you?"

1270
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:52,322
No,

1271
00:48:52,323 --> 00:48:53,593
you think I'd be here today?

1272
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:55,727
I'm serious, I think I...

1273
00:48:55,728 --> 00:48:58,014
I wrote it, in a way,
to try to find you.

1274
00:48:59,177 --> 00:49:00,210
Ok, that's...

1275
00:49:00,211 --> 00:49:02,711
I know that's not true,
but that's sweet of you to say it.

1276
00:49:02,712 --> 00:49:03,618
I think it is true.

1277
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:06,023
What do you think the chances
were of us ever meeting again?

1278
00:49:06,964 --> 00:49:08,925
After that December,
I'd say almost zero.

1279
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:12,439
If we're not real, anyway, right?

1280
00:49:12,914 --> 00:49:13,588
We're just...

1281
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:15,963
characters in that old lady's dream.

1282
00:49:16,302 --> 00:49:18,679
She's on her death bed,
fantasizing about her youth...

1283
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,167
So, of course we have to meet again!

1284
00:49:20,852 --> 00:49:22,932
Oh, God!

1285
00:49:22,933 --> 00:49:24,794
Why weren't you there in Vienna?

1286
00:49:26,107 --> 00:49:27,291
I told you why!

1287
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:29,300
Well, I know why, I just...

1288
00:49:29,752 --> 00:49:31,490
I wish you would've been!

1289
00:49:32,588 --> 00:49:34,393
Our lives might have been
so much different!

1290
00:49:34,965 --> 00:49:36,104
You think so?

1291
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,196
I actually do...

1292
00:49:39,232 --> 00:49:42,489
Maybe not, maybe we would
have hated each other, eventually.

1293
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:44,331
Oh, what, like we hate each other now?

1294
00:49:46,348 --> 00:49:47,911
No, maybe we're...

1295
00:49:48,274 --> 00:49:49,999
we're only good at...

1296
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,883
brief encounters,
walking around in European cities,

1297
00:49:52,884 --> 00:49:54,095
in one climate!

1298
00:49:55,614 --> 00:49:58,660
Oh, God, why didn't we
exchange phone numbers and stuff?

1299
00:49:58,927 --> 00:50:00,100
Why didn't we do that?

1300
00:50:01,288 --> 00:50:03,098
Because we were young and stupid?

1301
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,090
You think we still are?

1302
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:08,767
I guess when you're young...
you just believe...

1303
00:50:08,768 --> 00:50:11,314
there'll be many people
with whom you'll connect with.

1304
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:14,425
Later in life you only realize
it only happens a few times.

1305
00:50:14,426 --> 00:50:15,657
Yeah, you can screw it up!

1306
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:17,377
You know, misconnect...

1307
00:50:18,017 --> 00:50:20,692
Well, the past is the past.
It was meant to be that way.

1308
00:50:20,693 --> 00:50:22,109
Yeah, you really believe that?

1309
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,345
That everything is faded?

1310
00:50:23,923 --> 00:50:24,653
Well,

1311
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:27,583
you know, the world might be
less free than you think.

1312
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:28,900
Yeah?

1313
00:50:30,074 --> 00:50:34,111
Yeah, when given this exact circumstances,
that's that will happen every time.

1314
00:50:34,112 --> 00:50:37,231
Two part hydrogen, one part oxygen,
you'll get water every time.

1315
00:50:37,232 --> 00:50:37,992
No, no...

1316
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,804
I mean, what if your grandmother
had lived a week longer, you know?

1317
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:42,557
Or passed away a week earlier,

1318
00:50:42,558 --> 00:50:43,658
days even, you know.

1319
00:50:43,659 --> 00:50:45,224
Things might have been different,
I believe that!

1320
00:50:45,225 --> 00:50:46,790
- No, you can't think like that.
- I mean...

1321
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:49,365
I know you shouldn't
on most things, but...

1322
00:50:49,702 --> 00:50:51,225
It's just...

1323
00:50:51,226 --> 00:50:53,064
On this one, it seemed like
something was off!

1324
00:50:53,065 --> 00:50:54,142
You know, I mean...

1325
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:57,424
In the months leading
up to my wedding, ok,

1326
00:50:57,425 --> 00:50:59,111
I was thinking about you, all the time.

1327
00:50:59,112 --> 00:51:01,271
I mean, even on my way there...
I'm in the car,

1328
00:51:01,272 --> 00:51:03,138
and a buddy of mine
is driving me downtown,

1329
00:51:03,139 --> 00:51:04,675
and I'm staring at the window...

1330
00:51:04,676 --> 00:51:06,468
and I think I see you.

1331
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:08,283
Not far from the church, right.

1332
00:51:08,284 --> 00:51:12,321
Folding up an umbrella, and walking
into a deli, on the corner of...

1333
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:14,476
13th and Broadway.

1334
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,624
And I thought I was going
crazy, you know?

1335
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:18,443
But now I think it probably was you...

1336
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:21,305
I lived on 11th and Broadway.

1337
00:51:22,778 --> 00:51:24,086
You see.

1338
00:51:26,308 --> 00:51:29,473
So, what is it like to be married.
You haven't talked much about that.

1339
00:51:30,761 --> 00:51:31,805
I haven't?

1340
00:51:32,251 --> 00:51:33,395
How weird?!

1341
00:51:34,874 --> 00:51:36,195
I don't know, me met...

1342
00:51:36,837 --> 00:51:38,414
you know, when I was in college...

1343
00:51:39,014 --> 00:51:39,799
And...

1344
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,076
we broke up and got back together,
for a period of years,

1345
00:51:43,077 --> 00:51:44,082
and then...

1346
00:51:45,787 --> 00:51:46,657
What?...

1347
00:51:46,658 --> 00:51:48,064
We were sort of back together, and...

1348
00:51:48,065 --> 00:51:49,281
she was pregnant...

1349
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,228
So, marriage.

1350
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:53,682
Maybe she lied.

1351
00:51:54,772 --> 00:51:57,318
She's a great teacher,
a good mom...

1352
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:59,092
Uhm, she's smart...

1353
00:51:59,093 --> 00:52:00,093
pretty...

1354
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:03,102
I remember thinking at the time, that...

1355
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:06,030
so many of the men that
I admire most, you know,

1356
00:52:06,031 --> 00:52:07,339
that their lives were...

1357
00:52:08,145 --> 00:52:10,498
were dedicated to something
greater than themselves...

1358
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:14,317
So, you got married because men
you admire were married?

1359
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:15,718
No, no, no, it...

1360
00:52:16,187 --> 00:52:17,715
It's more like I have this...

1361
00:52:17,716 --> 00:52:20,123
this idea of my best self!

1362
00:52:20,366 --> 00:52:20,908
You know?

1363
00:52:20,909 --> 00:52:22,466
And I wanted to pursue that...

1364
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:25,505
even if might have been overwriting
my honor other self!

1365
00:52:25,506 --> 00:52:26,652
You know what I'm saying?

1366
00:52:27,298 --> 00:52:28,628
I mean, it's funny like...

1367
00:52:28,629 --> 00:52:30,969
in the moment, I remember thinking
that it didn't much matter

1368
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:32,010
the "Who?" of it all...

1369
00:52:32,011 --> 00:52:34,324
I mean, that nobody is
gonna be everything to...

1370
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:37,855
And that ultimately, it's just a simple
action of committing yourself,

1371
00:52:37,856 --> 00:52:39,870
you know, meeting your
responsibilities that...

1372
00:52:39,871 --> 00:52:41,175
that matters.

1373
00:52:41,363 --> 00:52:42,652
I mean, what is love?

1374
00:52:42,653 --> 00:52:45,698
Right, if it's not respect,
trust, admiration? And I...

1375
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:47,695
I felt all those things!

1376
00:52:48,347 --> 00:52:51,405
So, cut to the present tense,
I feel like I'm running a small nursery

1377
00:52:51,406 --> 00:52:52,453
with somebody I...

1378
00:52:52,454 --> 00:52:53,742
used to date.

1379
00:52:54,222 --> 00:52:55,029
I mean,

1380
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:56,429
I'm like a monk, you know.

1381
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:57,805
I mean, I've had sex less than...

1382
00:52:57,806 --> 00:53:00,294
... 10 times in the last 4 years.

1383
00:53:01,651 --> 00:53:02,439
What?

1384
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,078
What, what?

1385
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,081
Are you laughing at me?

1386
00:53:04,082 --> 00:53:04,769
No

1387
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:05,658
It sounds pathetic?

1388
00:53:05,659 --> 00:53:08,995
What monastery you know
where monks have sex 10 times?

1389
00:53:08,996 --> 00:53:10,583
Ok, I'm doing better than
most monks. All right?

1390
00:53:11,047 --> 00:53:13,187
But I do, I feel like if somebody were
to touch me, you know,

1391
00:53:13,188 --> 00:53:15,630
I would dissolve into molecules.

1392
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,823
Well, we're here.
We've gotta go.

1393
00:53:17,824 --> 00:53:18,824
Come on.

1394
00:53:26,187 --> 00:53:29,489
- Bon soir!
- Bon soir!

1395
00:53:33,265 --> 00:53:34,428
I'm sorry, uhm...

1396
00:53:34,429 --> 00:53:35,409
to hear that...

1397
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:36,459
- You know, that...
- What?

1398
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,655
you're not that happy
with your marriage.

1399
00:53:39,948 --> 00:53:41,486
Well, this friend of mine,
she's a shrink, and...

1400
00:53:41,487 --> 00:53:42,678
Yeah? How's she doing?

1401
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:43,801
She's a mess, but...

1402
00:53:44,485 --> 00:53:47,275
No, she was telling me that
she's been dealing with a lot of couples

1403
00:53:47,276 --> 00:53:48,969
that are breaking up
for the same exact reason.

1404
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:50,153
Uhum, what reason is that?

1405
00:53:50,154 --> 00:53:52,782
Well, all this couples expected
after a few years of living together

1406
00:53:52,783 --> 00:53:56,125
for the passion, that consuming desire,
to be the same as in the beginning.

1407
00:53:56,126 --> 00:53:57,598
- It's impossible!
- No, I know, I know that...

1408
00:53:57,799 --> 00:53:59,490
I mean, God, otherwise we
would end up with aneurism

1409
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:01,992
if we were in that constant
state of excitement, right?

1410
00:54:01,993 --> 00:54:04,356
We would end up doing nothing
at all with our lives.

1411
00:54:04,614 --> 00:54:05,950
Do you think you would you would
have finished your book, if...

1412
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,819
if you were fucking
somebody every 5 minutes?

1413
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,037
I might have welcomed the challenge...

1414
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,208
But, you know, it's not true,

1415
00:54:12,209 --> 00:54:14,043
for your wife,
after the birth of your son...

1416
00:54:14,044 --> 00:54:16,441
She has to give all her
love to the little one!

1417
00:54:16,442 --> 00:54:18,736
Imagine that she was totally
obsessed with sex, right?

1418
00:54:18,737 --> 00:54:19,691
And you like walk out...

1419
00:54:19,692 --> 00:54:21,402
That wouldn't make any sense, right?

1420
00:54:21,403 --> 00:54:23,461
Everything you say makes sense!

1421
00:54:23,462 --> 00:54:25,307
It's... it's not about sex. I...

1422
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:26,763
No, I know, it's...

1423
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:27,764
obvious.

1424
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:28,983
I...

1425
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,173
You know, couples are
so confused lately.

1426
00:54:34,126 --> 00:54:35,399
I think it must be that...

1427
00:54:36,682 --> 00:54:39,902
men... need to feel essential,
and they don't anymore.

1428
00:54:40,661 --> 00:54:43,130
Because it's been imprinted
in their heads, for so many years,

1429
00:54:43,131 --> 00:54:44,911
that they had to be the provider...

1430
00:54:45,352 --> 00:54:46,223
Like, I...

1431
00:54:46,224 --> 00:54:49,285
I'm a strong independent woman
in my professional life.

1432
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,235
I don't need a man to feed me,
but I still need a man to love me,

1433
00:54:52,236 --> 00:54:53,733
and that I could love, you know.

1434
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:56,564
So...

1435
00:54:56,565 --> 00:54:57,765
Your driver's here.

1436
00:54:58,311 --> 00:54:59,993
Well, I guess this is goodbye, and...

1437
00:54:59,994 --> 00:55:01,316
- You'd better give me your...
- No, no...

1438
00:55:01,317 --> 00:55:03,765
Why don't we just give you a ride home,
wherever you're going.

1439
00:55:04,615 --> 00:55:05,780
Well, I can take the Metro...

1440
00:55:05,781 --> 00:55:06,617
No, no, no.

1441
00:55:06,618 --> 00:55:08,455
My flight it's not until 10, right?

1442
00:55:08,456 --> 00:55:11,293
I think I'm arriving two hours early.
This way we can keep talking.

1443
00:55:11,748 --> 00:55:12,409
Monsieur...

1444
00:55:13,671 --> 00:55:17,223
<i>Ca vous arrive me deposer au passaje
Dix Rue et Curie?</i>

1445
00:55:17,524 --> 00:55:19,017
<i>Oui, oui.</i>

1446
00:55:19,018 --> 00:55:20,296
<i>Allons-y!</i>

1447
00:55:21,337 --> 00:55:22,740
<i>No, no, ce n'est pas de probleme!</i>

1448
00:55:22,741 --> 00:55:25,721
<i>Vous pouvez me laissez au metro...
au metro Chateau d'Eau.</i>

1449
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:26,922
<i>- Ca ira tres bien.
- Entendu!</i>

1450
00:55:27,626 --> 00:55:28,381
<i>Merci!</i>

1451
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:30,164
You told him where you are
and all that?

1452
00:55:30,165 --> 00:55:31,680
Oui, oui, yeah.

1453
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,416
- So, he knows where he's going?
- Yes.

1454
00:55:38,273 --> 00:55:39,442
Let's hope he does.

1455
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:42,116
Now, this is better than Metro, right?

1456
00:55:42,117 --> 00:55:43,117
Definitely!

1457
00:55:47,103 --> 00:55:48,305
I was thinking...

1458
00:55:48,306 --> 00:55:51,316
For me it's better I don't
romanticize things as much anymore.

1459
00:55:51,317 --> 00:55:53,311
I was suffering so much all the time.

1460
00:55:53,312 --> 00:55:56,743
I still have lots of dreams, but they're
not in regard to my love life.

1461
00:55:57,044 --> 00:55:59,369
It doesn't make me sad,
it's just the way it is.

1462
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:02,154
Is that why you're in a relationship
with somebody who's...

1463
00:56:02,155 --> 00:56:03,590
never around?

1464
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:07,498
Yes, obviously, I can't deal with
the day to day life of a relationship.

1465
00:56:08,043 --> 00:56:09,181
Yeah, we have, you know,

1466
00:56:09,182 --> 00:56:11,638
this exciting time together
and then he leaves and I miss him,

1467
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:13,413
but at least I'm not dying inside.

1468
00:56:13,997 --> 00:56:16,477
When someone is always
around me, I'm like suffocating!

1469
00:56:16,478 --> 00:56:19,519
No, wait, you just said that
you need to love and be loved...

1470
00:56:19,644 --> 00:56:22,233
Yeah, but when I do,
it quickly makes me nauseous!

1471
00:56:22,634 --> 00:56:23,734
It's a disaster...

1472
00:56:24,235 --> 00:56:27,064
I mean, I'm really happy
only when I'm on my own.

1473
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:28,361
Even being alone...

1474
00:56:28,362 --> 00:56:29,480
it's better than...

1475
00:56:29,481 --> 00:56:31,970
sitting next to a lover
and feeling lonely.

1476
00:56:33,068 --> 00:56:34,915
It's not so easy for me to be a romantic.

1477
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:36,165
You start off that way, and,

1478
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:38,277
after you've been
screwed over a few times...

1479
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:41,329
You... you forget about all your
delusional ideas, and you

1480
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,177
just take what comes into your life.

1481
00:56:43,367 --> 00:56:44,844
That's not even true, I haven't been...

1482
00:56:44,845 --> 00:56:47,235
screwed over, I've just had too many...

1483
00:56:47,472 --> 00:56:50,835
bla relationship. They weren't mean,
they cared for me, but...

1484
00:56:50,836 --> 00:56:54,311
they were no real...
connection, or excitement.

1485
00:56:54,631 --> 00:56:56,600
At least, not from my side.

1486
00:56:56,601 --> 00:56:57,817
God, I'm sorry, is it...

1487
00:56:57,818 --> 00:56:59,223
Is it really that bad?

1488
00:56:59,224 --> 00:57:00,970
It's not, right?

1489
00:57:02,731 --> 00:57:03,503
You know...

1490
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,601
it's not even that, I was...

1491
00:57:05,602 --> 00:57:06,956
I was fine.

1492
00:57:06,957 --> 00:57:08,773
Until I read your fucking book!

1493
00:57:09,401 --> 00:57:11,082
It stirred shit out from you,

1494
00:57:10,986 --> 00:57:14,542
It reminded me how...
genuinely romantic I was,

1495
00:57:14,543 --> 00:57:16,428
how I had so much hope in things and...

1496
00:57:16,661 --> 00:57:17,629
now it's like...

1497
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,436
I don't believe in anything
that relates to love,

1498
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,491
I don't feel things for people anymore.

1499
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:24,492
In a way...

1500
00:57:25,089 --> 00:57:27,205
I put all my romanticism
into that one night

1501
00:57:27,206 --> 00:57:29,661
and I was never able
to feel all this again.

1502
00:57:29,938 --> 00:57:30,854
Like...

1503
00:57:30,855 --> 00:57:33,230
somehow this night took
things away from me and...

1504
00:57:33,231 --> 00:57:35,241
I expressed them to you and
you took them with you!

1505
00:57:35,242 --> 00:57:37,166
It made me feel cold,
like if love wasn't for me!

1506
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:38,272
I... I don't believe that.

1507
00:57:38,573 --> 00:57:39,978
I don't believe that.

1508
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,115
You know what?

1509
00:57:42,116 --> 00:57:44,969
Reality and love are almost
contradictory for me.

1510
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:46,535
It's funny...

1511
00:57:46,902 --> 00:57:48,864
Every single of my ex-es...

1512
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:49,811
they're now married!

1513
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,262
Man go out with me,

1514
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:51,988
we break up,

1515
00:57:51,989 --> 00:57:53,267
and then they get married!

1516
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:56,535
And later they call me to thank
me for teaching them what love is, and...

1517
00:57:56,536 --> 00:57:59,507
that I taught them to care
and respect women!

1518
00:57:59,508 --> 00:58:00,508
I think I'm one of those guys.

1519
00:58:00,509 --> 00:58:01,883
You know, I want to kill them!

1520
00:58:01,884 --> 00:58:03,799
Why didn't they ask me to marry them?

1521
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,825
I would have said "No",
but at least they could have asked!!!

1522
00:58:05,826 --> 00:58:08,235
But it's my fault, I know that
it's my fault, because...

1523
00:58:08,236 --> 00:58:09,942
I never felt it was the right man.

1524
00:58:09,943 --> 00:58:10,743
Never!

1525
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:13,447
But what does it mean the right man?
The love of your life?

1526
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,288
The concept is absurd,

1527
00:58:14,289 --> 00:58:16,815
the idea that we can only be
complete with another person is...

1528
00:58:16,616 --> 00:58:17,450
EVIL!

1529
00:58:17,451 --> 00:58:18,141
Right?

1530
00:58:18,566 --> 00:58:19,336
Can I talk?

1531
00:58:19,337 --> 00:58:21,185
You know, I guess I've been
heart broken too many times.

1532
00:58:21,386 --> 00:58:22,386
And then I recovered.

1533
00:58:23,007 --> 00:58:26,035
So now, you know,
form the starts, I make no effort.

1534
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:27,764
- Because I know exactly what hap...
- You can't do that.

1535
00:58:27,765 --> 00:58:29,933
You can't do that,
you can't live your life

1536
00:58:29,934 --> 00:58:31,754
trying to avoid pain,
at the expense of en...

1537
00:58:31,755 --> 00:58:32,747
Ok, you know what?
Loose our words!

1538
00:58:32,748 --> 00:58:34,479
I've gotta... I've gotta
get away from you...

1539
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,618
Stop the car, I want to get out!

1540
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:37,233
No, no, no,
don't... don't get out...

1541
00:58:37,234 --> 00:58:39,100
- You know, it's being around you...
- Keep talking...

1542
00:58:39,101 --> 00:58:39,895
Don't touch me!

1543
00:58:39,896 --> 00:58:41,564
- You know, I wanna get on a cab...
- Monsieur...

1544
00:58:41,565 --> 00:58:42,333
<i>Monsieur, aretes vous!</i>

1545
00:58:42,334 --> 00:58:43,866
<i>Non, non, c'est bon, aux faux la!</i>

1546
00:58:43,867 --> 00:58:45,649
No, no, no, don't, keep going...

1547
00:58:46,628 --> 00:58:49,315
No, listen, I'm just so happy...
thank you, just keep going...

1548
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:51,088
All right.

1549
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:55,914
Look, I'm just so happy,
all right...

1550
00:58:55,915 --> 00:58:56,915
to be with you.

1551
00:58:57,348 --> 00:58:59,692
I am. I'm so glad you
didnt' forget about me.

1552
00:59:01,243 --> 00:59:02,109
No, I didn't...

1553
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,373
and it pisses me off, ok?

1554
00:59:03,861 --> 00:59:05,399
You come here to Paris,

1555
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,425
all romantic,

1556
00:59:06,426 --> 00:59:07,457
and married.

1557
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:08,196
Ok?

1558
00:59:08,197 --> 00:59:09,197
Screw you!

1559
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:12,359
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not trying to get you, or anything.

1560
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,600
I mean, all I need is married man!

1561
00:59:15,558 --> 00:59:17,316
There's been so much water
under the bridge, it's...

1562
00:59:17,317 --> 00:59:20,197
it's not even about you anymore,
it's about that time, that moment in time,

1563
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:21,620
that is forever gone, I don't know!

1564
00:59:21,621 --> 00:59:23,977
You... you say all that, but you
didn't even remember having sex.

1565
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:24,978
So...

1566
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:26,402
Of course I remember it...

1567
00:59:28,972 --> 00:59:29,852
You did?

1568
00:59:29,853 --> 00:59:30,819
Yes!

1569
00:59:31,496 --> 00:59:33,125
Women pretend things like that.

1570
00:59:33,645 --> 00:59:35,070
They do?

1571
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,760
Yeah, what was I supposed to say?
That I remember the wine in the park, and...

1572
00:59:39,161 --> 00:59:42,783
us looking about the stars
fading away as the sun came up!

1573
00:59:42,984 --> 00:59:45,017
We had sex twice, you idiot!

1574
00:59:47,763 --> 00:59:48,705
All right,
you know what?

1575
00:59:48,706 --> 00:59:49,800
I'm just...

1576
00:59:49,801 --> 00:59:55,237
happy to see you, even if... you've
become an angry, maniac depressive activist.

1577
00:59:55,238 --> 00:59:57,679
I still like you,
I still enjoy being around you!

1578
00:59:59,522 --> 01:00:00,970
And I feel the same.

1579
01:00:00,971 --> 01:00:02,916
I'm... I'm sorry,
I don't know what happened.

1580
01:00:02,917 --> 01:00:03,640
I just...

1581
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:06,337
- I had to let it all out. I...
- Don't worry about it.

1582
01:00:06,338 --> 01:00:10,582
I'm so miserable in my love life,
in my relationship, I always act as...

1583
01:00:11,026 --> 01:00:11,610
Like...

1584
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:13,106
you know, I'm detached,
but I'm...

1585
01:00:13,107 --> 01:00:14,307
I'm dying inside.

1586
01:00:14,659 --> 01:00:16,037
I'm dying because I'm so numb,

1587
01:00:16,038 --> 01:00:17,549
I don't feel pain, or excitement...

1588
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,477
I'm not even bitter, I'm just...

1589
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:21,902
You think you're the one dying inside.

1590
01:00:22,548 --> 01:00:23,714
My life,

1591
01:00:23,715 --> 01:00:25,475
is twenty-for-seven...

1592
01:00:25,476 --> 01:00:26,431
MAD.

1593
01:00:27,189 --> 01:00:28,671
- I'm sorry...
- No, no, no...

1594
01:00:28,672 --> 01:00:31,789
I mean, the only happiness I get
is when I'm out with my son.

1595
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,227
I've been to marriage counseling,

1596
01:00:33,428 --> 01:00:36,086
I've done things I never
thought I would have to do,

1597
01:00:36,087 --> 01:00:39,571
I lit candles, bought
self-help books, lingerie...

1598
01:00:39,572 --> 01:00:40,762
Did the candles help?

1599
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:42,088
Hell, no!

1600
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:45,012
All right, I'm in love with the way
she needs to be loved, and...

1601
01:00:45,013 --> 01:00:46,250
I don't even see a future for us.

1602
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:48,617
But then I look at... at my little boy,

1603
01:00:49,172 --> 01:00:51,148
sitting at the table across from me,

1604
01:00:51,149 --> 01:00:52,993
and I think I would have suffered any torture

1605
01:00:52,994 --> 01:00:55,412
to be with him for all
the minutes of his life.

1606
01:00:55,413 --> 01:00:57,108
You know, I don't wanna
miss out on one.

1607
01:00:57,372 --> 01:00:59,133
But then, then...
there's no joy,

1608
01:00:59,134 --> 01:01:01,017
or laughter, in my home.

1609
01:01:01,718 --> 01:01:03,354
You know, and I don't want him
growing up in that!

1610
01:01:03,355 --> 01:01:04,655
Oh, no laughter?

1611
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:07,899
That's terrible, my parents have been
together for 35 years

1612
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,673
and even when they have a bad fight,
they end up laughing like crazy...

1613
01:01:10,674 --> 01:01:13,085
I just... I don't wanna be
one of those people who are...

1614
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,746
getting divorced at 52,
and falling down into tears,

1615
01:01:16,747 --> 01:01:18,982
admitting that they never
really loved their spouse,

1616
01:01:18,983 --> 01:01:21,091
and they feel that their life has been...

1617
01:01:21,554 --> 01:01:23,677
sucked up into a vacuum cleaner!

1618
01:01:24,315 --> 01:01:26,093
You know, I want a great life.

1619
01:01:26,094 --> 01:01:27,905
I want her to have a great life.

1620
01:01:27,906 --> 01:01:29,518
She deserves that!

1621
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:31,929
All right.
But we're just living in a pretense

1622
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:34,190
of a marriage responsibility,
and all this...

1623
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,077
just...

1624
01:01:35,078 --> 01:01:36,278
ideas of how people
are suppose to live.

1625
01:01:39,751 --> 01:01:40,647
Then I...

1626
01:01:41,048 --> 01:01:42,869
I have this dreams...

1627
01:01:44,922 --> 01:01:46,133
What dreams?

1628
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:48,162
I have this dreams,

1629
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:48,978
you know, that...

1630
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,123
I'm standing on a platform,

1631
01:01:53,957 --> 01:01:54,779
and...

1632
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,050
you keep going by on a train,

1633
01:01:57,051 --> 01:01:57,996
and...

1634
01:01:58,974 --> 01:02:01,915
you go by, and you go by,
and you go by,

1635
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:03,800
and I wake up with
the fucking sweats, you know?

1636
01:02:03,801 --> 01:02:05,226
And then I have this other dream,

1637
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:07,180
oh... where you're...

1638
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:11,847
pregnant, in bed, beside me, naked,
and I want so badly to touch you,

1639
01:02:11,848 --> 01:02:13,009
but you tell me not to,

1640
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:14,021
and then you look away.

1641
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:14,895
And...

1642
01:02:15,296 --> 01:02:16,783
and I... I...

1643
01:02:16,784 --> 01:02:17,917
I touch you anyway,

1644
01:02:18,876 --> 01:02:21,182
right on your ankle,
and your skin is so soft,

1645
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:23,635
and I wake up in sobs, all right?

1646
01:02:24,172 --> 01:02:26,109
And my wife is sitting there,
looking at me,

1647
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:29,536
and I feel like I'm a million miles from
her and I know that there's something...

1648
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:30,587
... wrong!

1649
01:02:30,588 --> 01:02:31,713
You know, that I ca...

1650
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:34,969
that I can't keep living like this, that
there's gotta be something more to love

1651
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:35,991
than commitment...

1652
01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:38,056
But then I think that...

1653
01:02:38,057 --> 01:02:39,192
I might have given up...

1654
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:41,877
on the whole idea of romantic love.

1655
01:02:41,878 --> 01:02:42,681
That I...

1656
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:44,785
I might have put it to bed, that...

1657
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:46,965
that day when you weren't there.

1658
01:02:48,285 --> 01:02:49,956
You know, I think I might have done that.

1659
01:02:52,405 --> 01:02:53,973
Why are you telling me all this?

1660
01:02:55,545 --> 01:02:56,534
I'm sorry.

1661
01:02:56,535 --> 01:02:59,180
I don't know, I'm...
I... I should... I...

1662
01:03:01,067 --> 01:03:02,128
I shouldn't have.

1663
01:03:03,152 --> 01:03:04,349
You know, it's so weird...

1664
01:03:04,813 --> 01:03:07,780
people think they are the only one
going through tough times.

1665
01:03:09,084 --> 01:03:10,443
I mean, when I read the article,
I thought...

1666
01:03:10,444 --> 01:03:12,251
your life was perfect.

1667
01:03:13,463 --> 01:03:16,322
A wife, a kid,
a published author!

1668
01:03:18,275 --> 01:03:20,584
Your personal life was
more of a mess than mine...!

1669
01:03:21,736 --> 01:03:22,840
I'm sorry!

1670
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,791
Well...
I'm glad it's...

1671
01:03:25,792 --> 01:03:26,703
good for something.

1672
01:03:26,704 --> 01:03:27,542
<i>Oh, monsieur, c'est la!</i>

1673
01:03:27,543 --> 01:03:28,543
<i>Rentre dans la place la.</i>

1674
01:03:29,946 --> 01:03:31,620
This is... this is...
this is where you live?

1675
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:32,587
Yeah.

1676
01:03:34,194 --> 01:03:37,199
So, you're just relieved that I'm in
even more deep shit than you are?

1677
01:03:38,533 --> 01:03:39,306
Yes.

1678
01:03:39,307 --> 01:03:40,508
You've made me feel better.

1679
01:03:40,509 --> 01:03:42,245
Oh, good, I'm glad...

1680
01:03:42,927 --> 01:03:44,381
No, I really wish you the best.

1681
01:03:45,498 --> 01:03:48,992
It's not because I'm incapable of
having a good relationship or a family

1682
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:51,679
that I wish everyone to be doing like me.

1683
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,933
I'm sure you may be
a great mom someday!

1684
01:03:54,181 --> 01:03:55,425
Really, you think so?

1685
01:03:55,426 --> 01:03:57,792
Oh, yeah. A few anti-depressants...
you know, you'll do great!

1686
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:00,916
Ok, say "Stop"!

1687
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:01,737
Uhm, "Stop"!

1688
01:04:01,738 --> 01:04:02,738
Heey!

1689
01:04:04,084 --> 01:04:04,989
You're ready?

1690
01:04:16,429 --> 01:04:16,899
So...

1691
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:17,947
I will try something.

1692
01:04:18,248 --> 01:04:19,591
What?

1693
01:04:22,627 --> 01:04:25,989
Wanna see if you stay together
or if you dissolve into molecules...

1694
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:29,086
How am I doing?

1695
01:04:30,011 --> 01:04:31,070
Still here.

1696
01:04:32,273 --> 01:04:33,577
Good, I like being here.

1697
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:39,470
Is this your apartment?

1698
01:04:39,881 --> 01:04:41,394
Oh, no, I live down there.

1699
01:04:41,889 --> 01:04:42,778
- Down there?
- Yeah.

1700
01:04:44,094 --> 01:04:45,095
Uhm, monsieur...

1701
01:04:45,096 --> 01:04:46,423
I'm gonna walk her to her door.

1702
01:04:46,724 --> 01:04:49,197
<i>Il va m'accompanier... a la porte.</i>

1703
01:04:55,735 --> 01:04:57,030
This is incredible!

1704
01:04:57,031 --> 01:04:58,177
This is where you live?

1705
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,017
Yeah.

1706
01:05:00,018 --> 01:05:01,359
How long have you been here?

1707
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,513
Four years.

1708
01:05:04,966 --> 01:05:05,946
So tell me...

1709
01:05:05,947 --> 01:05:06,721
What?

1710
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:09,105
Is it all true, about your dreams, or...

1711
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:11,471
you just say that to
hopefully get in my pants?

1712
01:05:12,072 --> 01:05:13,697
Oh, I just said that
to get into your pants!

1713
01:05:13,698 --> 01:05:15,052
- I use that all the time...
- Oh, ok.

1714
01:05:15,404 --> 01:05:16,276
Does it work?

1715
01:05:16,277 --> 01:05:18,273
Eh, you know...
sometimes.

1716
01:05:20,554 --> 01:05:21,350
Here is my Che!

1717
01:05:21,351 --> 01:05:24,000
Oh, so cute...!
Look at her.

1718
01:05:24,301 --> 01:05:26,124
You know what I love about
this cat? It's that...

1719
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:28,593
every morning I bring him
down to the courtyard...

1720
01:05:28,594 --> 01:05:30,249
And every single morning...

1721
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:32,956
he looks at everything
like it was the first time!

1722
01:05:33,717 --> 01:05:36,900
Every corner, every tree,
every plant...

1723
01:05:38,043 --> 01:05:40,780
He smells everything with
his little cute nose...

1724
01:05:40,781 --> 01:05:42,311
Uh, I love my kitty!

1725
01:05:42,553 --> 01:05:43,924
I love my kitty!

1726
01:05:45,932 --> 01:05:46,752
What's his name?

1727
01:05:46,753 --> 01:05:47,857
Che.

1728
01:05:48,158 --> 01:05:49,345
Che?

1729
01:05:50,401 --> 01:05:51,335
Aham.

1730
01:05:51,546 --> 01:05:52,413
What?

1731
01:05:52,876 --> 01:05:53,754
Commie!

1732
01:05:55,857 --> 01:05:58,326
No, "Che" in Argentina means "Hey"!

1733
01:06:01,677 --> 01:06:02,727
Oh, baby!

1734
01:06:02,728 --> 01:06:04,603
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1735
01:06:08,686 --> 01:06:10,305
We're having a little party.

1736
01:06:10,306 --> 01:06:11,661
It's so much fun!

1737
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,292
<i>Qu'est-ce que vous avez
fait bon pour ce soir?</i>

1738
01:06:15,293 --> 01:06:16,311
<i>Un tabule!</i>

1739
01:06:16,312 --> 01:06:18,218
<i>Je vais descende in cinq minutes!</i>

1740
01:06:18,219 --> 01:06:19,371
<i>Salut!</i>

1741
01:06:19,372 --> 01:06:19,848
Uhm...

1742
01:06:19,849 --> 01:06:21,087
<i>Salut!</i>

1743
01:06:22,634 --> 01:06:23,501
So...

1744
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:26,697
<i>C'est qui celui la? Il est minion!</i>

1745
01:06:26,698 --> 01:06:28,656
<i>- Il mange avec nous?
- Non, il prend l'avion.</i>

1746
01:06:31,647 --> 01:06:33,520
<i>Pour-quo'il ne mange pas avec nous?</i>

1747
01:06:33,521 --> 01:06:34,698
<i>Il n'aime pas ton short!</i>

1748
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:37,175
<i>Mais qu'es-ce qu'il a mon short?</i>

1749
01:06:40,712 --> 01:06:41,531
You know what I've...

1750
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:43,252
I was thinking, uhm...

1751
01:06:43,253 --> 01:06:45,106
Would you play me one of your songs?

1752
01:06:45,107 --> 01:06:47,211
- You're gonna miss your flight!
- I won't, I won't!

1753
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:49,924
I will be sitting in the airport for
over an hour, reading the newspaper.

1754
01:06:50,478 --> 01:06:52,463
Wishing you played me
one of your songs.

1755
01:06:53,901 --> 01:06:54,994
- One song?
- Yeah.

1756
01:06:54,995 --> 01:06:55,979
Ok, but quickly.

1757
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,351
Ok.

1758
01:07:03,382 --> 01:07:05,047
God, I love this old staircases.

1759
01:07:44,913 --> 01:07:45,642
Hold this!

1760
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:48,436
Hey there, buddy!

1761
01:07:50,527 --> 01:07:51,631
Che...

1762
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:05,229
Would you like some tea?

1763
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:06,864
Yeah, sure.

1764
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,133
Is chamomile ok?

1765
01:08:12,134 --> 01:08:13,134
Yeah.

1766
01:08:13,135 --> 01:08:14,135
Great.

1767
01:08:14,813 --> 01:08:15,648
Merci!

1768
01:08:15,849 --> 01:08:16,849
Messy?

1769
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:18,565
You think my apartment is messy?

1770
01:08:18,566 --> 01:08:21,800
No, no, no.
Merci, merci... merci beaucoup.

1771
01:08:22,305 --> 01:08:23,456
Ah, "merci".

1772
01:08:24,772 --> 01:08:27,387
I meant to tell you...
Your French has improved a lot.

1773
01:08:28,739 --> 01:08:29,473
- Really?
- Yeah!

1774
01:08:29,792 --> 01:08:31,714
Yeah, you've really
mastered the language...

1775
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:34,641
All right, all right.

1776
01:08:34,642 --> 01:08:36,167
What song are you gonna play me, huh?

1777
01:08:38,888 --> 01:08:39,731
Now, I...

1778
01:08:39,732 --> 01:08:41,842
I can't. It's too embarrassing.
It's been...

1779
01:08:41,843 --> 01:08:42,398
Wow!

1780
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:43,476
No way, no way!

1781
01:08:43,477 --> 01:08:45,839
I came all the way up here,
you cannot crap out of me now.

1782
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,573
One song, anything will be great.

1783
01:08:47,574 --> 01:08:49,526
No, but listen, you're
gonna laugh at me...

1784
01:08:49,827 --> 01:08:51,258
- You think so?
- Yes!

1785
01:08:51,772 --> 01:08:52,449
I doubt it.

1786
01:08:56,464 --> 01:08:57,210
Ok.

1787
01:08:57,942 --> 01:08:59,143
What do you want to hear?

1788
01:08:59,144 --> 01:09:00,244
I have a...

1789
01:09:00,316 --> 01:09:01,966
I have 3 songs in English.

1790
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:04,638
One's about my cat,

1791
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,877
one's about...

1792
01:09:06,178 --> 01:09:07,212
my ex-boyfriend,

1793
01:09:07,213 --> 01:09:08,644
well, ex-ex-boyfriend,

1794
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:10,091
...tuoba eno s'ereht dna

1795
01:09:11,811 --> 01:09:12,525
well,

1796
01:09:12,526 --> 01:09:14,023
it's just a...

1797
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:15,403
little waltz.

1798
01:09:15,404 --> 01:09:16,862
A waltz?
Yeah.

1799
01:09:17,363 --> 01:09:18,792
Put the waltz.

1800
01:09:19,933 --> 01:09:22,547
I haven't played it in a while,
you sure?

1801
01:09:28,217 --> 01:09:29,483
All right, the waltz.

1802
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:44,662
"Let me sing you,

1803
01:09:44,663 --> 01:09:45,663
a waltz.

1804
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:49,534
Out of nowhere,

1805
01:09:49,535 --> 01:09:51,789
out of my thoughts.

1806
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:54,306
Let me sing you,

1807
01:09:54,307 --> 01:09:55,307
a waltz.

1808
01:09:57,178 --> 01:10:00,416
About this one night stand.

1809
01:10:01,943 --> 01:10:02,971
You

1810
01:10:02,972 --> 01:10:04,010
were

1811
01:10:03,811 --> 01:10:05,085
for me

1812
01:10:05,086 --> 01:10:06,286
that night,

1813
01:10:07,717 --> 01:10:12,043
everything I always
dreamt of in life.

1814
01:10:13,861 --> 01:10:16,534
But now you're gone.

1815
01:10:17,561 --> 01:10:18,774
You

1816
01:10:18,775 --> 01:10:19,608
are

1817
01:10:19,609 --> 01:10:20,609
far gone.

1818
01:10:22,505 --> 01:10:24,834
All the way to your

1819
01:10:24,835 --> 01:10:27,529
island of rain.

1820
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:28,507
It was

1821
01:10:28,508 --> 01:10:29,163
for you

1822
01:10:29,164 --> 01:10:31,052
just a one night

1823
01:10:31,053 --> 01:10:32,610
thing.

1824
01:10:33,616 --> 01:10:34,661
But you were

1825
01:10:34,662 --> 01:10:36,445
much more to me,

1826
01:10:36,446 --> 01:10:38,508
just so you know.

1827
01:10:40,129 --> 01:10:43,656
I don't care what they say

1828
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:45,717
I know what you meant

1829
01:10:45,418 --> 01:10:47,188
for me

1830
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:48,739
that day.

1831
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:49,601
I

1832
01:10:49,602 --> 01:10:51,297
just wanted

1833
01:10:51,298 --> 01:10:52,427
another

1834
01:10:52,428 --> 01:10:53,711
try.

1835
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:55,020
I just

1836
01:10:55,021 --> 01:10:56,063
wanted

1837
01:10:56,064 --> 01:10:57,324
another

1838
01:10:57,325 --> 01:10:58,785
night.

1839
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:00,965
Even

1840
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:01,766
if it

1841
01:11:01,767 --> 01:11:03,320
doesn't seem

1842
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:05,113
quite right.

1843
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:08,193
You meant for me

1844
01:11:08,194 --> 01:11:10,191
much more

1845
01:11:10,192 --> 01:11:11,896
than anyone

1846
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:14,747
I've met before.

1847
01:11:14,748 --> 01:11:16,683
One single night

1848
01:11:16,684 --> 01:11:17,985
with you, little...

1849
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:20,793
Jesse...

1850
01:11:21,376 --> 01:11:23,510
is worth a thousand

1851
01:11:23,511 --> 01:11:25,846
with any-body.

1852
01:11:27,752 --> 01:11:29,875
I have no bitterness,

1853
01:11:29,876 --> 01:11:31,394
my sweet.

1854
01:11:31,395 --> 01:11:33,495
I'll never forget

1855
01:11:33,496 --> 01:11:35,046
this one night

1856
01:11:35,047 --> 01:11:36,147
thing.

1857
01:11:36,506 --> 01:11:37,411
Even

1858
01:11:37,412 --> 01:11:38,428
tomorrow

1859
01:11:38,429 --> 01:11:40,236
in other

1860
01:11:40,237 --> 01:11:42,369
arms.

1861
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:43,666
My heart

1862
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:46,418
will stay yours until I

1863
01:11:46,419 --> 01:11:48,116
die.

1864
01:11:52,963 --> 01:11:53,857
Let me

1865
01:11:53,858 --> 01:11:54,918
sing you

1866
01:11:55,219 --> 01:11:57,537
a waltz.

1867
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,601
Out of nowhere,

1868
01:12:00,602 --> 01:12:03,239
out of my blues.

1869
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:03,931
Let me

1870
01:12:03,932 --> 01:12:05,209
sing you

1871
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:07,057
a waltz.

1872
01:12:08,332 --> 01:12:09,860
About this

1873
01:12:09,861 --> 01:12:10,761
lovely

1874
01:12:10,762 --> 01:12:12,018
one night

1875
01:12:12,019 --> 01:12:13,119
stand."

1876
01:12:30,861 --> 01:12:32,049
No! One more,
one more.

1877
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:34,262
- Please, please.
- No! No, no, it was our deal.

1878
01:12:34,765 --> 01:12:35,999
One... one song!

1879
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:36,941
No, no, no.

1880
01:12:36,942 --> 01:12:38,709
You can have your tea,
and then...

1881
01:12:45,326 --> 01:12:47,008
All right, let me...
Let me ask you one question.

1882
01:12:47,727 --> 01:12:51,138
Do you just... plug that name in
for every guy that comes up here?

1883
01:12:51,692 --> 01:12:52,820
Oh, yes, of course!

1884
01:12:52,821 --> 01:12:55,016
What do you think,
that I wrote this song about you?

1885
01:12:55,017 --> 01:12:56,281
Are you nuts?

1886
01:13:01,821 --> 01:13:02,621
Oh, is this you?

1887
01:13:02,622 --> 01:13:04,184
Little cross-eyed Celine?

1888
01:13:04,185 --> 01:13:04,995
Yes.

1889
01:13:05,453 --> 01:13:06,449
That's funny...

1890
01:13:08,177 --> 01:13:09,778
Is that your grandmother?

1891
01:13:09,779 --> 01:13:10,779
Yeah.

1892
01:13:13,372 --> 01:13:14,585
Oh, wow.

1893
01:13:15,845 --> 01:13:16,968
You want some honey?

1894
01:13:16,969 --> 01:13:18,668
Yeah, sure.

1895
01:14:08,534 --> 01:14:10,344
Did you ever see Nina Simone in concert?

1896
01:14:11,023 --> 01:14:12,283
No, I never did...

1897
01:14:12,284 --> 01:14:13,484
Can't believe she's gone...!

1898
01:14:13,984 --> 01:14:15,515
I know, it's so sad!

1899
01:14:16,595 --> 01:14:17,483
Thanks.

1900
01:14:22,105 --> 01:14:23,165
I saw her twice,

1901
01:14:23,166 --> 01:14:24,204
in concert.

1902
01:14:25,725 --> 01:14:26,936
She was so great!

1903
01:14:28,295 --> 01:14:30,330
That's one of my favorite
songs of hers.

1904
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:37,095
"...I know where I'm going...

1905
01:14:39,379 --> 01:14:41,259
...No more doubt of fear...

1906
01:14:43,172 --> 01:14:46,083
...Found my way...
click, click, click."

1907
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:48,447
She was so great!

1908
01:14:50,302 --> 01:14:51,897
She was so funny in concert!

1909
01:14:52,727 --> 01:14:53,788
She would...

1910
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,674
she would be right in the
middle of a song,

1911
01:14:55,675 --> 01:14:56,569
and then...

1912
01:14:57,166 --> 01:14:58,732
you know, stop, and...

1913
01:14:59,262 --> 01:15:01,065
and... and walk from the piano,

1914
01:15:01,066 --> 01:15:03,184
all the way to the edge of the stage.

1915
01:15:03,185 --> 01:15:05,200
Like, really slowly...

1916
01:15:08,718 --> 01:15:11,137
And she'd start talking
to someone in the audience...

1917
01:15:12,137 --> 01:15:13,235
Oh, yeah, baby...

1918
01:15:13,536 --> 01:15:14,573
Oh, yeah...

1919
01:15:14,574 --> 01:15:15,599
Uhum...

1920
01:15:16,368 --> 01:15:17,613
I love you too...

1921
01:15:18,913 --> 01:15:20,204
And then she'd walk back,

1922
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:22,000
took her time,

1923
01:15:22,001 --> 01:15:23,478
no hurry,
you know.

1924
01:15:23,479 --> 01:15:24,469
She had that...

1925
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,753
big... cute ass!

1926
01:15:27,321 --> 01:15:28,510
She would move... whuh!

1927
01:15:30,389 --> 01:15:31,804
And then she would...

1928
01:15:31,805 --> 01:15:34,272
go back to the piano,
and play some more.

1929
01:15:36,887 --> 01:15:38,162
And then she would...

1930
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:39,272
I don't know, just...

1931
01:15:39,273 --> 01:15:42,317
start another song, in the middle
of another, you know, like...

1932
01:15:42,318 --> 01:15:43,265
stop again...

1933
01:15:44,071 --> 01:15:45,104
Like...

1934
01:15:45,105 --> 01:15:46,200
"Oh, you...

1935
01:15:46,767 --> 01:15:48,476
can you move that thing?

1936
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:49,477
Uhum.

1937
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:50,178
Wow...

1938
01:15:50,179 --> 01:15:51,479
you're cute!

1939
01:16:11,273 --> 01:16:12,267
Oh...

1940
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:14,754
Oh, yeah! Uhum.

1941
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:20,103
Maybe...

1942
01:16:20,104 --> 01:16:21,031
you are...

1943
01:16:21,032 --> 01:16:22,839
gonna - miss - that - plane!

1944
01:16:24,733 --> 01:16:25,889
I know...
