So, what are you gonna do
while we're closed?

84
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:47,928
I don't know.

85
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,599
Maybe go work
at my uncle's pizza joint.

See you, Carmine.

91

No, you shouldn't...

My hat.

94
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:15,756
Heard it was missing,
so I looked into it.

95
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:17,691
I wanted to kill that broad.

96
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:18,992
No, no. It wasn't her fault.

97
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:21,829
Who had the balls
to clip Gio's hat?

98
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:23,430
Don't worry about it.
I took care of it.

99
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:25,899
Yeah, I hope you gave him
some beating.

It was a pleasure,

00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:14,001
The curve is hit
deep into right field...

166
00:08:18,307 --> 00:08:22,142
We did it! We got it!

167
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:23,210
- Yeah!
- There it is!

168
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:26,046
- All right.
- Three-one, baby. Three-one.

169
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:29,082
- Coming back.
- Roger, baby, way to go!

170
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:30,884
- Three-one.
- Way to go!

171
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,420
Do it again.
Let's do it again.

172
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:35,022
Come on, baby.

173
00:08:35,024 --> 00:08:36,123
No, Tony.

174
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,227
Go get dressed.
We're gonna eat.

175
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:41,061
All right.

176
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,297
No game seven, no game seven.

177
00:08:54,143 --> 00:08:56,443
From thy bounty,
through Christ, our Lord.

178
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:59,446
- Amen.
- Amen.

179
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:03,016
And if anyone hears of a job
for Tony, let us know.

180
00:09:03,018 --> 00:09:04,484
- Dolor.
- What?

181
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:06,219
Please.

182
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:07,954
What happened? You get fired?

183
00:09:07,956 --> 00:09:09,189
- No.
- No.

184
00:09:09,191 --> 00:09:10,891
The Copa's closing for repairs,

185
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:12,861
so he just needs something
for a couple of months.

186
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:24,204
All the people he knows, he'll
find something in no time.

187
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:27,474
Well, he had a great job
at the Sanitation Department.

188
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:29,443
You shouldn't have punched out
the foreman.

189
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,411
He shouldn't have woke me up.

190
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:35,683
That's Tony.

191
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:37,284
I can't believe they lost.

192
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,219
- Don't worry, don't worry.
- Relax.

193
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:45,025
That never happened before.

194
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:47,027
They're gonna win
the World Series.

195
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,503
I'm telling you,
this is gonna be

196
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:58,472
the easiest 50 bucks
you're ever gonna make.

197
00:09:58,474 --> 00:09:59,707
Yeah, we'll see.

198
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:02,242
Hey, there they are.

199
00:10:02,244 --> 00:10:03,944
Hi, Johnny.

200
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:05,112
- Tony, how are you?
- Hey, Paulie.

201
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:07,180
- How you doing?
- I'm good, I'm good.

202
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:09,015
So, uh, Johnny here
tells me you ate

203
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:11,184
48 White Castle burgers
all in one sitting.

204
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:13,019
Cheeseburgers.

205
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:14,421
You tell him, Frankie.

206
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:15,556
I don't believe it.

207
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:18,024
What do we care
if you believe it?

208
00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:19,259
Hey, Gorman.

209
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:21,294
What's the record here
for hot dogs?

210
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:23,997
18, Fat Paulie.

211
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,298
Why wasn't Lip in
on that contest?

212
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,333
What contest?

213
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,034
I was hungry.

214
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:30,070
Well,
the bet's simple.

215
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:32,439
Half a C-note.
Most hot dogs in an hour wins.

216
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:34,076
With toppings.

217
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:38,145
- What the hell you weigh?
- 260.

218
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:40,180
Hey, two...
Your left ass weighs 260.

219
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,750
May my mother-in-law drop dead
on the spot if I'm lying.

220
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,021
- All right. You're on.
- Good.

221
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:51,592
Pick it up, Lip!

222
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:54,361
The baby elephant just hit 19!

223
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,229
Let's go, Lip! Let's go!

224
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:58,465
Come on, let's go, Lip!
Let's get this going!

225
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:00,333
You're embarrassing!

226
00:11:00,335 --> 00:11:02,570
You're embarrassing your son!

227
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:05,040
He is killing you!

228
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:14,114
Hey, Nicky,
you doing your homework?

229
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:15,783
- Yep.
- Good.

230
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,586
Where you been?

231
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:20,420
Gorman's.

232
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:22,489
I'm making dinner.

233
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,259
Fat Paulie bet me 50 bucks

234
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:28,094
he could eat
more hot dogs than me.

235
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:29,529
He knocked off 24.

236
00:11:29,531 --> 00:11:31,264
Guy's an animal.

237
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:32,532
Are you crazy?

238
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:34,267
You lost $50?

239
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:36,573
Dolores, please.

240
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:39,508
I ate 26.

241
00:11:44,313 --> 00:11:47,047
You are so lucky.

242
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:48,415
You know that?

243
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,183
Rent is due on Monday.

244
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,525
You gonna get that?

245
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:01,294
- Yeah?
- Hey, Lip.

246
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:03,330
Some guy called over here.
A doctor.

247
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:05,165
He's looking for a driver.

248
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:07,100
- You interested?
- Yeah.

249
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,670
They're interviewing guys
tomorrow afternoon.

250
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:14,675
The address is, uh,
881 7th Avenue.

251
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:16,577
2:15.

252
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:38,298
Hey. Excuse me.

253
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,100
We're not open right now,
but you're welcome

254
00:12:40,102 --> 00:12:42,135
to purchase tickets
to tonight's performance.

255
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,303
Nah, that's all right.

256
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,606
I, uh... I think
I got the wrong address,

257
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:48,375
but, uh, is there
a doctor's office in here?

258
00:12:48,377 --> 00:12:49,710
A doctor's office?

259
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:51,444
Dr. Shirley?

260
00:12:51,446 --> 00:12:53,179
You have the correct address.

261
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:55,384
Dr. Shirley lives upstairs,
above the Hall.

262
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,625
How you doing?

263
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,404
I'm here for the driver job.

264
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:18,206
Tony Lip.

265
00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:21,642
No Tony Lip.

266
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:24,144
No, I should be on there.

267
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:26,313
Uh...

268
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:30,350
no, um, I have a Tony Val...
Valle-la-la...

269
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,218
Vallelonga. Yeah.

270
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,555
That's me.

271
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:36,222
Fill it out while you wait.

272
00:13:36,224 --> 00:13:37,424
What?

273
00:13:37,426 --> 00:13:39,492
Fill it out while you wait.

274
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:41,430
Oh. Yeah.

275
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:05,253
Have a seat.

276
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:36,349
Mr. Vallelonga.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

277
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:37,718
Oh.

278
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:40,821
I'm Dr. Donald Shirley.

279
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:42,556
Tony.

280
00:14:42,558 --> 00:14:45,360
Yes. Please sit down.

281
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:50,765
Some place you got here.

282
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,800
Are them horns real?

283
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:55,404
Elephant tusks, yes.

284
00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:57,772
What about that?

285
00:14:57,774 --> 00:14:59,408
Is that a molar?

286
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:02,242
A what?

287
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:04,544
A molar, a-a shark tooth.

288
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:07,014
Or a tiger's, maybe.

289
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:09,583
It was a gift.

290
00:15:09,585 --> 00:15:12,553
I thought, uh... I thought
I was going to an office.

291
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:15,455
They said a doctor
needed a driver.

292
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,791
That's all they told you?

293
00:15:16,793 --> 00:15:18,525
Yeah.

294
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,462
Actually, it's a bit more
complicated than that.

295
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,667
Have you ever driven
professionally before?

296
00:15:25,702 --> 00:15:27,500
Yeah. Sanitation.

297
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:29,269
Garbage trucks.

298
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:31,839
Plus, I drive my boss home
at night.

299
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:33,674
But I can drive anything.

300
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:35,743
Limos. Tow trucks.

301
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:37,444
Snowplows. Whatever.

302
00:15:37,446 --> 00:15:38,612
I see.

303
00:15:38,614 --> 00:15:40,547
What other experience
do you have?

304
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:42,282
I worked a lot of joints.

305
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:44,552
Wagon Wheel,
Peppermint Lounge, Copa.

306
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:46,352
In what capacity?

307
00:15:46,354 --> 00:15:47,555
What do you mean?

308
00:15:47,557 --> 00:15:49,489
What did you do there?

309
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,226
Uh...

310
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,894
Public relations.

311
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:57,665
Well, first of all, Tony,
I'm not a medical doctor.

312
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:58,866
I'm a musician.

313
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:01,301
You mean, like, songs?

314
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:02,535
Yes.

315
00:16:02,537 --> 00:16:04,504
And I'm about to embark
on a concert tour,

316
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,439
the majority of which
will be down south.

317
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:07,675
Atlantic City.

318
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:08,843
No.

319
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:10,510
The Deep South.

320
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,445
First, we're starting
in the Midwest,

321
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:13,848
and then we're taking
a hard left.

322
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,850
Kentucky, North Carolina,
Tennessee,

323
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:17,818
and on down through the Delta.

324
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,888
Do you foresee any issues
in working for a black man?

325
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,090
No.

326
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:24,658
No, no, no.

327
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,727
It was just the other day,
me and the wife

328
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:28,765
had a couple of colored guys
over at the house.

329
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,800
For-for drinks.

330
00:16:32,802 --> 00:16:34,367
Hmm. I see.

331
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,535
You're married.

332
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,840
Yeah. Two kids.

333
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:42,442
I'm not sure this is the
proper job for a married man.

334
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:44,444
Why? Are we bringing broads?

335
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:47,915
My point is we'll be gone
for eight straight weeks.

336
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:50,584
No breaks,
right up until Christmas.

337
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:52,920
You're quite sure you can leave
your family for that long?

338
00:16:52,922 --> 00:16:54,789
Depends what you're paying.

339
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,824
A hundred dollars a week,
plus room and board.

340
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:57,925
Hmm.

341
00:16:57,927 --> 00:17:00,460
But let me be crystal clear.

342
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:02,428
I'm not just hiring
a chauffeur.

343
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,566
I need someone
who can handle my itinerary.

344
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:08,401
Be a personal assistant.
I need a valet.

345
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,874
I need someone who can launder
my clothes and shine my shoes.

346
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:15,812
Good luck, Doc.

347
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:19,816
Tony.

348
00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:26,720
I had my record label
ask around town

349
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:28,656
to find me the right man.

350
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:31,326
Your name came up
more than once.

351
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:35,596
You've impressed several people
with your...

352
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:37,667
innate ability
to handle trouble.

353
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:40,801
And that is why I called
and inquired

354
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:42,772
about your availability.

355
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:47,440
Okay, here's the deal.

356
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,475
I got no problem
being on the road with you.

357
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:50,611
But I ain't no butler.

358
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:52,512
I ain't ironing no shirts,

359
00:17:52,514 --> 00:17:53,881
and I'm not polishing
nobody's shoes.

360
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:56,183
You need somebody to get you
from point A to point B?

361
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:57,585
You need someone to make sure

362
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:58,752
there's no problems
along the way?

363
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:00,754
And believe me,
you and the Deep South,

364
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:02,590
there's gonna be problems.

365
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:03,858
So, if you want me,

366
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,893
it's a buck and a quarter
a week.

367
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:08,494
Or go hire that little Chink
just pranced out of here.

368
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:10,532
See how far you get.

369
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:15,501
Well, Mr. Vallelonga,

370
00:18:15,503 --> 00:18:17,838
thank you for stopping by.

371
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:32,019
Hey, Bobby.

372
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:33,921
Give me a Rheingold.

373
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:35,791
Ice cold.

374
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:45,801
Mr. Tony.

375
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,469
Augie asking about you.

376
00:18:50,907 --> 00:18:52,640
Come on!
I'm dying of thirst over here.

377
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:53,674
Shut up!

378
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:55,510
I'm talking.

379
00:18:58,247 --> 00:18:59,613
When?

380
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:01,817
Now. He in his box.

381
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:29,444
Tony Lip.

382
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,980
What the hell happened
at the Copa?

383
00:19:32,982 --> 00:19:34,917
I hear you almost split
a guy's face open.

384
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:38,819
That guy you hit,
Mikey Cerrone,

385
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:40,823
part of
Charlie the Hand's crew.

386
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:43,993
Guess he should have
known better.

387
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:50,597
Hand asked me to look into it.

388
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,599
I spoke to Podell.

389
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:55,805
Whole thing was, uh,
over a piece of ass, right?

390
00:19:56,939 --> 00:19:58,772
Yeah.

391
00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:02,542
Beef like that should never
happen inside the club.

392
00:20:02,544 --> 00:20:04,745
They were out of line.

393
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:06,749
So we squashed it.

394
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:11,719
You, uh, looking to earn
a little extra <i>scharole?</i>

395
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:14,621
I can keep you busy
while the Copa is down.

396
00:20:14,623 --> 00:20:15,925
What do I gotta do?

397
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:19,929
Things.

398
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:24,164
Appreciate it, but, uh,

399
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,667
I want to spend some time
with the family.

400
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:28,569
Don't be stupid.

401
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:31,672
You make yourself a few extra
bucks, you buy something nice

402
00:20:31,674 --> 00:20:33,941
for that pretty little wife
of yours.

403
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:35,911
Hmm.

404
00:20:38,014 --> 00:20:39,947
Nah, I'm good.

405
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:41,917

♪ Lover's Island...

416
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:18,085
So, come on.
I'm dying to hear.

417
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:19,820
What happened
with the doctor interview?

418
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:21,822
He ain't a real doctor.

419
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:23,223
He's a piano player.

420
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:25,092
Well, I don't understand.

421
00:21:25,094 --> 00:21:26,960
Why did they say
that he was a doctor?

422
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:29,096
I don't know.
I think he's, like,

423
00:21:29,098 --> 00:21:31,632
a doctor of, uh,
piano playing or something.

424
00:21:31,634 --> 00:21:32,966
You can be that?

425
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:34,635
I guess.

426
00:21:34,637 --> 00:21:36,904
He lives on top
of Carnegie Hall.

427
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:38,772
You should've seen
this place, Dee.

428
00:21:38,774 --> 00:21:41,175
It was filled with statues
and all kinds of fancy crap.

429
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:43,710
And he was sitting on top
of a friggin' throne

430
00:21:43,712 --> 00:21:46,146
all dressed up like, uh, like
the king of the jungle bunnies.

431
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:49,018
He's colored?

432
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:53,854
Well, you wouldn't last
a week with him.

433
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:56,423
For the right money, I would.

434
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:08,435
Yeah.

435
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:10,037
Oh.

436
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:12,840
Look...

437
00:22:12,842 --> 00:22:14,708
Really?

438
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,909
- Uh, okay.
- You okay?

439
00:22:15,911 --> 00:22:17,211
Okay, hang on a sec.

440
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:21,448
It's, uh, Dr. Shirley,
the piano guy.

441
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,250
He wants to talk to you.

442
00:22:23,252 --> 00:22:24,918
- Me?
- Yeah.

443
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,720
What? No.

444
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:28,021
Come on.

445
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:29,256
- Take it.
- No. Tony...

446
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:30,893
Just... just talk.

447
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:35,764
Hello?

448
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:39,133
Uh, good morning, Doctor.

449
00:22:39,135 --> 00:22:41,170
It's nice to talk to you.

450
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,878
Well, uh, yes,
that is a long time.

451
00:22:51,814 --> 00:22:53,115
It is.

452
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:57,017
Yes. I'm sure.

453
00:22:57,019 --> 00:22:58,952
Thank you.

454
00:22:58,954 --> 00:23:01,155
Thank you for calling.

455
00:23:01,157 --> 00:23:02,791
Bye, now.

456
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,029
What'd he say?

457
00:23:08,264 --> 00:23:10,297
He wanted to know
if I'd be okay

458
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:15,169
with him taking my husband away
from his family for two months.

459
00:23:15,171 --> 00:23:18,674
He said he'd pay you
what you asked for.

460
00:23:23,746 --> 00:23:25,281
- Hey.
- Hmm?

461
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:29,116
It's good money.

462
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:30,986
We need it.

463
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:36,992
Can't be eating 26 hot dogs
every day.

464
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:41,328
I know.

465
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,668
I told him it was okay
for you to go.

466
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:49,169
All right, hey, look, so here's
the first half of your pay.

467
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:51,104
You're gonna get the rest
when the tour's over.

468
00:23:51,106 --> 00:23:52,839
No, I gotta get paid
every week.

469
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,841
Sorry. That's not how
the record company does it.

470
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:57,010
We got to have some guarantee
you're gonna finish the job.

471
00:23:57,012 --> 00:23:59,913
Why wouldn't I finish the job?
I took it, didn't I?

472
00:23:59,915 --> 00:24:03,250
Well, then we got nothing
to worry about.

473
00:24:03,252 --> 00:24:05,919
Here's the deal,
Mr. Vallelonga.

474
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:08,288
Okay, it's your job to get Don
to all his tour dates on time.

475
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,823
Now, if he misses any shows,

476
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,024
you're not getting
your back end.

477
00:24:11,026 --> 00:24:13,227
- He's not gonna miss any show.
- Good.

478
00:24:13,229 --> 00:24:15,996
Oh, you're gonna need this.

479
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:18,065
Now, this is the book
I was telling you about.

480
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:20,133
Now, sometimes you guys
are staying in the same hotel,

481
00:24:20,135 --> 00:24:22,269
sometimes you're not.

482
00:24:22,271 --> 00:24:24,871
- Oh, yeah, the...
- Yeah, yeah.

483
00:24:24,873 --> 00:24:28,041
All right, don't let me down.
Let's go.

484
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,050
<i>Madonne,</i> is this the new one?

485
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:39,052
Yeah, the record company
rented it.

486
00:24:39,054 --> 00:24:40,821
- It's nice, huh?
- Beautiful.

487
00:24:40,823 --> 00:24:42,422
So, what'd my sister
have to say

488
00:24:42,424 --> 00:24:44,424
about you being gone
for three weeks?

489
00:24:44,426 --> 00:24:46,827
Eight weeks.

490
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:48,596
Ten to one,

492
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,601
- Come here.
- All right, boys, huddle up.

493
00:24:53,603 --> 00:24:55,902
- Say good-bye to your father.
- Frankie, Nicky. Come here.

All right.

499

- Don't go too far.
- We won't.

500
00:25:10,185 --> 00:25:13,253
- Did you go to the AAA for the maps?
- Yes.

501
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:15,922
No. I mean, the record
companies gave me the maps

502
00:25:15,924 --> 00:25:17,926
and the itinerary,
and this thing.

503

<i>The Negro Motorist's
Green Book.</i>

504
00:25:21,297 --> 00:25:24,298
Yeah, it lists all the places
coloreds can stay down south.

505
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,200
Like a... you know,
traveling while black.

506
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:30,070
- "Traveling while black"?
- Yeah, if you're black

507
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:31,938
and you gotta travel,
for some reason.

508
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,941
- Got a special book for that?
- I guess.

509
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:37,144
- Did you pack the iron?
- I ain't lugging no iron, Dee.

510
00:25:37,146 --> 00:25:39,279
- Come on.
- How are you gonna press your pants, Tony?

511
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:41,948
I'll put 'em
under the mattress.

512
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,017
I want you
to write me a letter.

513
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:46,086
- Every chance you get.
- I can't write letters.

514
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:47,655
Yes, you can.

515
00:25:47,657 --> 00:25:49,222
- I can't write.
- Take you five minutes.

516
00:25:49,224 --> 00:25:50,357
- Promise me.
- It's embarrassing.

517
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:52,159
It ain't gonna be no good.

518
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:54,928
It's a lot cheaper than
calling long-distance, Tony.

519

Promise me you're gonna write.

520

Dee, put this in a bank today.

00:33:18,674 --> 00:33:21,675
Guess we'll find out, huh?

653
00:33:21,677 --> 00:33:24,444
Hey, you know,
when you first hired me,

654
00:33:24,446 --> 00:33:26,814
my wife went out
and bought one of your records.

655
00:33:26,816 --> 00:33:28,949
The one about the orphans.

656
00:33:28,951 --> 00:33:30,684
Orphans?

657
00:33:30,686 --> 00:33:32,519
Yeah.

658
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:35,524
Cover had a bunch of kids
sitting around a campfire.

659
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,827
Orpheus.

660
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:40,493
Yeah.

661
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:41,629
<i>Orpheus in the Underworld.</i>

662
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:43,130
It's based on a French opera.

663
00:33:43,132 --> 00:33:45,633
And those weren't children
on the cover.

664
00:33:45,635 --> 00:33:48,501
Those were demons
in the bowels of hell.

665
00:33:48,503 --> 00:33:50,604
No shit.

666
00:33:50,606 --> 00:33:52,909
Must have been naughty kids.

667
00:34:06,856 --> 00:34:08,856
What are...
what are you doing?

668
00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:11,524
Gotta take a leak, Doc.

669
00:34:11,526 --> 00:34:13,561
Here? Now?

670
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:15,763
You want me to piss my pants?

671
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:36,351
♪ Whatcha gonna do?

672
00:35:33,676 --> 00:35:35,809
- Oh, hey, Doc.
- Good afternoon.

673
00:35:37,246 --> 00:35:39,713
Take this for any incidentals
we may need.

674
00:35:39,715 --> 00:35:42,482
If you want to buy something,
you don't have to ask.

675
00:35:42,484 --> 00:35:44,484
Just keep the receipts, please.

676
00:35:44,486 --> 00:35:46,553
When it runs low, let me know.

677
00:35:46,555 --> 00:35:47,855
Oh. Thanks.

678
00:35:47,857 --> 00:35:49,491
One more thing.

679
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:55,062
We'll be attending many events
before and after the concerts.

680
00:35:55,064 --> 00:35:56,797
Interacting
with some of the wealthiest

681
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:59,667
and most highly educated people
in the country.

682
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:01,969
It is my feeling
that your diction,

683
00:36:01,971 --> 00:36:04,571
however charming it may be
in the tristate area,

684
00:36:04,573 --> 00:36:06,974
could use some... finessing.

685
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:10,478
You mean diction...
like in what way?

686
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:13,816
Like in the only way
the word is ever used.

687
00:36:15,017 --> 00:36:17,117
- Okay.
- Your intonation, inflection,

688
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,919
your choice of words.

689
00:36:18,921 --> 00:36:20,921
Hey, I got my own problems.

690
00:36:20,923 --> 00:36:22,790
Now I gotta worry
about what people think

691
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:24,959
- about the way I talk?
- There are simple techniques

692
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:27,594
I can teach you that are quite
effective. I can help you.

693
00:36:27,596 --> 00:36:29,129
I-I don't need no goddamn help.
People don't like

694
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:31,567
the way I talk,
they can go take a shit.

695
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:34,835
The profanity is another issue.

696
00:36:34,837 --> 00:36:37,037
Why are you breaking my balls?

697
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:39,740
Because you can do better,
Mr. Vallelonga.

698
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:41,976
Which brings me
to one more point.

699
00:36:41,978 --> 00:36:43,877
As the guest of honor,
I'll be introduced

700
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:45,846
when entering
these intimate events.

701
00:36:45,848 --> 00:36:47,681
You will be introduced as well.

702
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:49,783
In my humble opinion,

703
00:36:49,785 --> 00:36:52,753
"Vallelonga" may be difficult
to pronounce.

704
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:54,989
So I was thinking...

705
00:36:54,991 --> 00:36:57,124
Valle would be more appropriate.

706
00:36:57,126 --> 00:36:59,893
Tony Valle. Short and sweet.

707
00:36:59,895 --> 00:37:00,961
Eh...

708
00:37:00,963 --> 00:37:02,129
nah.

709
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:03,998
They got a problem
with Vallelonga,

710
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,733
they can call me Tony Lip.

711
00:37:05,735 --> 00:37:07,634
These are genteel people.

712
00:37:07,636 --> 00:37:10,004
"Tony the Lip" may be
a little...

713
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:12,006
worldly for them.

714
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:14,575
Well, then it's
Tony Vallelonga.

715
00:37:14,577 --> 00:37:17,878
All these high-class people,
so much smarter than me,

716
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,980
with their intelligence
and speaking abilities,

717
00:37:19,982 --> 00:37:21,915
you're telling me
they can't pronounce my name?

718
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:24,018
They don't like it,
they can shove it up their ass.

719
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,022
I'll just wait outside.

720
00:37:27,056 --> 00:37:29,690
A sound compromise.

721
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:47,741
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight we are privileged

722
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:51,879
to present
a great American artist.

723
00:37:51,881 --> 00:37:53,781
He gave his first
public performance

724
00:37:53,783 --> 00:37:54,982
at the age of three.

725
00:37:54,984 --> 00:37:56,683
At age 18,

726
00:37:56,685 --> 00:37:58,685
at Arthur Fiedler's invitation,

727
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:01,055
our guest made
his concert debut

728
00:38:01,057 --> 00:38:03,023
with the Boston Pops.

729
00:38:03,025 --> 00:38:06,026
He holds doctorates
in psychology, in music

730
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:08,629
and in the liturgical arts.

731
00:38:08,631 --> 00:38:10,764
And he has performed
at the White House twice

732
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:12,399
in the past 14 months.

733
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:15,035
He is a true virtuoso.

734
00:38:15,037 --> 00:38:16,837
- And it's a...
- "Virtuoso."

735
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,773
- It's a special treat for me...
- That's Italian.

736
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:23,177
Means, uh, means really good.

737
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:25,846
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

738
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:28,017
the Don Shirley Trio.

739
00:40:01,343 --> 00:40:03,143
A new pair of shoes!

740
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:07,247
- Hard ten! Lady's friend.
- He keeps on winning!

741
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:09,983
It's your dice.
I'm just having a lucky night.

742
00:40:09,985 --> 00:40:11,218
You cheating, brother!

743
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,987
- Tony.
- Get him again. Get him again.

744
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:16,056
- Boss man's calling.
- He ain't my boss.

745
00:40:16,058 --> 00:40:17,858
I work for the record company.

746
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,826
Yeah, I work
for the record company, too.

747
00:40:19,828 --> 00:40:21,228
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, come on, man.

748
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,297
Hey, give us a chance
to win back our loot, huh?

749
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:24,965
I'm sorry, fellas, duty calls.

750
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:27,067
- Come on, man.
- "Duty calls"?

751
00:40:27,069 --> 00:40:29,303
My man, my duty is
to get my money back.

752
00:40:29,305 --> 00:40:31,305
I've been looking for you.

753
00:40:31,307 --> 00:40:34,374
Yeah, sorry. The guys
were having a little game.

754
00:40:34,376 --> 00:40:37,844
Next time you need
extra money, just ask me.

755
00:40:37,846 --> 00:40:39,346
It's more fun winning it.

756
00:40:39,348 --> 00:40:41,148
And what if you lost?

757
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:44,117
Grab some cards.
I don't lose, Doc.

758
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:46,119
I don't lose.

759
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:47,921
So stooping down in the gravel

760
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:50,090
pitching dice for pocket change
makes you a winner?

761
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:51,992
What are you
giving me shit for?

762
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:53,860
Everybody was doing it.

763
00:40:53,862 --> 00:40:57,331
They didn't have a choice
whether to be inside or out.

764
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,201
You did.

765
00:41:02,304 --> 00:41:05,007
Now, wipe off your knees.
You have dirt on them.

766
00:41:25,227 --> 00:41:28,061

On the radio.

Little Richard.

784

Really?
That's Little Richard?

Yeah.

786

788

I don't know.
Sounds fairly complicated.

789
00:42:29,191 --> 00:42:31,892
Got that right.

790
00:42:31,894 --> 00:42:34,394
So, where did this "Tony
the Lip" moniker come from?

791
00:42:34,396 --> 00:42:37,397
It's not Tony the Lip.

792
00:42:37,399 --> 00:42:40,067
It's Tony Lip. One word.

793
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:42,402
I got it when I was kid,
'cause my friend said

794
00:42:42,404 --> 00:42:45,205
I was the best bullshit artist
in the Bronx.

It doesn't bother you
that your friends,

the people closest to you,
consider you a liar?

799
00:42:53,515 --> 00:42:55,148
Who said "liar"?

800
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,284
I said "bullshit artist."

801
00:42:57,286 --> 00:42:59,019
And what's the difference?

802
00:42:59,021 --> 00:43:01,288
'Cause I don't lie. Ever.

803

I'm just good
at talking people into...

By bullshitting them.

00:43:20,175 --> 00:43:22,008
Of course I've heard of him.

813
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:24,010
- I've just never heard his music before.
- I mean...

814
00:43:24,012 --> 00:43:26,279
But I like this.
This is nice.

815
00:43:26,281 --> 00:43:28,281
He's got a silky voice,
very smooth.

816
00:43:28,283 --> 00:43:30,016
Yeah, he's terrific.

817
00:43:30,018 --> 00:43:32,018
This is what everybody's
dancing to now.

818
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,355
- This stuff...
- Eyes on the road, Tony.

819
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:37,057
♪ Baby, here I am...

820
00:43:37,059 --> 00:43:38,392
You know this song.

821
00:43:38,394 --> 00:43:40,127
I don't think so, no.

822
00:43:40,129 --> 00:43:42,529
How could you
not know this music?

823
00:43:42,531 --> 00:43:44,732
Aretha Franklin.

824
00:43:44,734 --> 00:43:47,267
Chubby Checker,
Little Richard, Sam Cooke.

825
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:50,971
I mean, come on, Doc.
These are your people.

826
00:43:50,973 --> 00:43:53,507
♪ And it won't be long

827
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:55,444
♪ No, it won't be long...

828
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,053
Do you want anything?
I'm getting a pack of smokes.

829
00:44:07,055 --> 00:44:08,924
No, thank you.

830
00:44:38,153 --> 00:44:40,187
Grabbed the rock
and put it in his pocket.

831
00:44:40,189 --> 00:44:41,556
Thank you, Oleg.

832
00:44:41,558 --> 00:44:43,123
Nice turtleneck.

833
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,493
Way to mix it up.

834
00:44:47,362 --> 00:44:49,362
Got you an apple, Doc.

835
00:44:54,604 --> 00:44:58,173
Before we pull out, Tony,
we need to have a talk.

836
00:44:59,374 --> 00:45:00,808
Yeah?

837
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,542
Oleg told me what you did.

838
00:45:02,544 --> 00:45:04,211
What'd I do?

839
00:45:04,213 --> 00:45:06,446
You stole a jade stone
from the store.

840
00:45:06,448 --> 00:45:08,583
- No, I didn't.
- He watched you do it.

841
00:45:08,585 --> 00:45:10,484
I didn't steal no stone.

842
00:45:10,486 --> 00:45:12,419
You picked it up
and put it in your pocket.

843
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:14,254
I picked up a rock
off of the ground.

844
00:45:14,256 --> 00:45:15,322
I didn't steal from a box.

845
00:45:15,324 --> 00:45:17,457
Now, why would you pick up
a rock off the ground?

846
00:45:17,459 --> 00:45:19,326
I don't know.

847
00:45:19,328 --> 00:45:21,328
'Cause it ain't stealing.

848
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:22,529
It's just a regular rock.

849
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:24,498
And why would you want
a regular rock?

850
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,132
To have.

851
00:45:26,134 --> 00:45:27,835
For luck, maybe.

852
00:45:27,837 --> 00:45:29,135
A lucky rock.

853
00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:31,139
- Yeah.
- Let me see it.

854
00:45:42,484 --> 00:45:44,852
Mm-mm.

855
00:45:44,854 --> 00:45:47,287
Take it back and pay for it.

856
00:45:49,157 --> 00:45:51,291
I told you that kraut
was a snake.

857
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:53,460
Rats me out for something
I didn't even do!

858
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:55,563
Pay for the stone, Tony;
you'll feel better.

859
00:45:55,565 --> 00:45:58,666
I feel fine. And I ain't paying
for no regular rock

860
00:45:58,668 --> 00:46:01,234
I found in the dirt.

861
00:46:01,236 --> 00:46:04,437
Do not drive, Mr. Vallelonga.

862
00:46:06,609 --> 00:46:08,611
Put it back.

863
00:46:32,569 --> 00:46:35,168
- Feel better?
- No.

864
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,905
If you'd like, Tony,
I'd happily buy you the stone.

865
00:46:37,907 --> 00:46:41,341
Don't bother.
You took all the fun out of it.

866
00:47:17,947 --> 00:47:20,513
Excuse me. Sir.

867
00:47:20,515 --> 00:47:22,315
I'm with the band.

868
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:23,450
You're all set up.

869
00:47:23,452 --> 00:47:25,653
This isn't the piano, right?

870
00:47:25,655 --> 00:47:26,954
That's it.

871
00:47:26,956 --> 00:47:28,656
It ain't a Steinway.

872
00:47:28,658 --> 00:47:30,390
So what?

873
00:47:30,392 --> 00:47:33,226
Dr. Shirley only plays
on Steinway grand pianos.

874
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:35,261
It's in his written contract.

875
00:47:35,263 --> 00:47:36,529
Who's Dr. Shirley?

876
00:47:36,531 --> 00:47:38,799
Dr. Shirley.
The Don Shirley Trio.

877
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:40,668
They're playing tonight.

878
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:42,402
Does it really matter?

879
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:45,240
Yeah, it does.
It's in his contract.

880
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,408
Come on, man.
Man, these coons

881
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:50,479
can play on anything
you put in front of them.

882
00:47:54,617 --> 00:47:56,416
But it's a piece of shit.

883
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:58,418
And there's garbage in there.

884
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,320
So take it out.

885
00:48:00,322 --> 00:48:01,557
What'd you say?

886
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:04,259
You heard me.

887
00:48:07,362 --> 00:48:09,462
Hey. You got two, three hours.

888
00:48:09,464 --> 00:48:11,498
Just get
a clean Steinway in here.

889
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,567
Oh, there ain't a Steinway
on campus.

890
00:48:13,569 --> 00:48:15,368
Not my problem.

891
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:16,771
I bet
there's not two Steinways

892
00:48:16,773 --> 00:48:18,438
in the whole state of Indiana.

893
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,675
I guess you'd better move
your ass, then.

894
00:48:20,677 --> 00:48:22,712
Who you think you're
talking to, greaseball?

895
00:48:52,675 --> 00:48:54,407
<i>Dear Dolores:</i>

896
00:48:54,409 --> 00:48:56,476
<i>This morning
I had steak and eggs</i>

897
00:48:56,478 --> 00:48:57,745
<i>for breakfast.</i>

898
00:48:57,747 --> 00:49:01,749
<i>The band has been playing
at very ritzy joints.</i>

899
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:04,051
<i>Dr. Shirley and I
are getting along pretty good.</i>

900
00:49:04,053 --> 00:49:06,787
<i>But sometimes
I think he gets sad,</i>

901
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:09,355
<i>and that's why
he drinks too much.</i>

902
00:49:09,357 --> 00:49:12,760
<i>I never knew how very beautiful
this country was.</i>

903
00:49:12,762 --> 00:49:15,295
<i>Now that I'm seeing it, I know.</i>

904
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:17,464
<i>You won't believe
how beautiful nature is.</i>

905
00:49:17,466 --> 00:49:19,767
<i>It is as beautiful as they say.</i>

906
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:22,636
<i>And the traffic out here
in the country is nothing,</i>

907
00:49:22,638 --> 00:49:24,537
<i>which is fine by me.</i>

908
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:27,575
<i>Right now I'm eating spaghetti
and meatballs in a diner</i>

909
00:49:27,577 --> 00:49:31,311
<i>that tastes like ketchup
on Chinese noodles.</i>

910
00:49:31,313 --> 00:49:32,545
<i>We are heading down south now.</i>

911
00:49:32,547 --> 00:49:35,850
<i>I will write you another letter
when we get down south.</i>

912
00:49:35,852 --> 00:49:38,586
<i>I love you. Your husband, Tony.</i>

913
00:49:38,588 --> 00:49:40,621
<i>P.S. Kiss the kids for me.</i>

914
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:51,098
Got any family, Doc?

915
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,633
Not really.

916
00:49:52,635 --> 00:49:55,403
Not really?
Either you do or you don't.

917
00:49:56,706 --> 00:49:58,773
It's a long story, Tony.

918
00:49:58,775 --> 00:50:01,942
What, we're in a hurry now?

919
00:50:01,944 --> 00:50:04,412
Let's hear it.

920
00:50:05,447 --> 00:50:07,547
I have a brother somewhere.

921
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:10,517
We used to get together
once in a while,

922
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:12,787
but it got more and more
difficult to stay in touch.

923
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:16,123
Curse of being
a musician, I guess.

924
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:18,559
Always on the road.

925
00:50:18,561 --> 00:50:20,661
Like a carnival worker.

926
00:50:20,663 --> 00:50:23,697
- Hmm.
- Or a criminal.

927
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:26,366
Took quite the toll
on my marriage as well.

928
00:50:26,368 --> 00:50:27,968
- You're married?
- Was.

929
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:29,904
June.

930
00:50:29,906 --> 00:50:31,739
Good person.

931
00:50:31,741 --> 00:50:33,941
Terrible grammar,
but a kind soul.

932
00:50:33,943 --> 00:50:35,843
You'd quite like her.

933
00:50:35,845 --> 00:50:37,443
June.

934
00:50:37,445 --> 00:50:39,582
Like, uh, like Lassie's mom.

935
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:43,951
Unfortunately,
I couldn't do a husband act

936
00:50:43,953 --> 00:50:46,452
and a concert pianist act.

937
00:50:46,454 --> 00:50:49,457
Couldn't seem to manage
both worlds.

938
00:50:51,594 --> 00:50:53,761
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

939
00:50:53,763 --> 00:50:55,461
In Kentucky!

940
00:50:55,463 --> 00:50:57,567
When's that ever gonna happen?

941
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:10,878
All right!

942
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,580
Hey, you want some?

943
00:51:12,582 --> 00:51:14,582
I'm fine. Thank you, Tony.

944
00:51:14,584 --> 00:51:16,449
All right.

945
00:51:16,451 --> 00:51:20,754
Mmm. I think this is
the best Kentucky Fried Chicken

946
00:51:20,756 --> 00:51:22,690
I ever had.

947
00:51:22,692 --> 00:51:24,725
Probably 'cause it's fresher
down here, right?

948
00:51:24,727 --> 00:51:27,493
I don't think I've ever met
anyone with your appetite.

949
00:51:27,495 --> 00:51:29,864
No. I got the bucket
so you could have some.

950
00:51:29,866 --> 00:51:32,733
I've never had fried chicken
in my life.

951
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,702
Who you bullshitting?

952
00:51:34,704 --> 00:51:36,604
You people love
the fried chicken,

953
00:51:36,606 --> 00:51:38,706
the grits
and the collard greens.

954
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:41,507
I love it, too.
Negro cooks used to make it

955
00:51:41,509 --> 00:51:43,644
all the time
when I was in the Army.

956
00:51:43,646 --> 00:51:46,046
You have a very narrow
assessment of me, Tony.

957
00:51:46,048 --> 00:51:48,682
Yeah, right? I'm good.

958
00:51:48,684 --> 00:51:50,985
No. No, you're not good.
You're bad.

959
00:51:50,987 --> 00:51:53,020
I'm saying, just because
other Negroes enjoy

960
00:51:53,022 --> 00:51:55,689
certain types of music,
it doesn't mean I have to.

961
00:51:55,691 --> 00:51:58,524
- Nor do we all eat the same kind of food.
- Whoa.

962
00:51:58,526 --> 00:51:59,860
Wait a minute.

963
00:51:59,862 --> 00:52:01,862
If you said
all guineas like pizza

964
00:52:01,864 --> 00:52:04,064
and spaghetti and meatballs,
I'm not gonna get insulted.

965
00:52:04,066 --> 00:52:05,799
You're missing the point.

966
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:07,935
For you to make the assumption
that every Negro...

967
00:52:07,937 --> 00:52:10,037
- Hey, you want some or not?
- No.

968
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:11,805
Here. Come on.

969
00:52:11,807 --> 00:52:13,607
- Tell me that don't smell good.
- It...

970
00:52:13,609 --> 00:52:15,508
- Huh?
- It smells okay.

971
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:18,679
I prefer not to get grease
on my blanket.

972
00:52:18,681 --> 00:52:20,814
Ooh, I'm gonna get
grease on my blankey.

973
00:52:20,816 --> 00:52:22,850
Come on, have a piece.
It ain't gonna kill you.

974
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:24,685
- Come on, take it, eat it.
- No.

975
00:52:24,687 --> 00:52:26,820
Take it.
I'm throwing it in the back.

976
00:52:26,822 --> 00:52:28,956
- You... Don't you dare.
- Then you better take it.

977
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:31,692
How? Do you have plates
or utensils?

978
00:52:31,694 --> 00:52:33,060
Eat it with your hands!

979
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:34,828
- That's how you're supposed to.
- I can't do that.

980
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:36,563
Eat it. Come on.
Take it, take it, take it.

981
00:52:36,565 --> 00:52:37,965
I gotta drive.
Ten and two on the wheel.

982
00:52:37,967 --> 00:52:39,633
- Come on. Take it, take it, take it.
- Tony...

983
00:52:39,635 --> 00:52:40,834
Come on, come on.

984
00:52:40,836 --> 00:52:42,836
There you go.

985
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:44,705
Huh?

986
00:52:44,707 --> 00:52:46,573
I-I can't do this, Tony.

987
00:52:46,575 --> 00:52:48,742
Eat the goddamn thing!

988
00:52:48,744 --> 00:52:50,713
Jesus.

989
00:53:00,723 --> 00:53:03,123
- What, no good?
- Mm.

990
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,698
It just seems...

991
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,000
so un... unsanitary.

992
00:53:13,002 --> 00:53:14,868
Who gives a shit?

993
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:17,004
Just relax and enjoy it.

994
00:53:17,006 --> 00:53:20,040
You know,
my father used to say...

995
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:22,776
"Whatever you do,
do it a hundred percent."

996

998
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:30,751
You want another piece?

999
00:53:30,753 --> 00:53:32,586
Here. Have a breast.

1000
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:33,823
Delicious.

1001
00:53:34,991 --> 00:53:36,790
Take it. Here you go.

1002

1003

What, you too high and mighty?

1036
00:55:48,858 --> 00:55:51,158
No, no,
let him alone, let him alone.

1037
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,027
He just afraid of getting that

1050
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:06,833
Get up.

1051
00:57:06,835 --> 00:57:09,038
Tony, come on. Hurry up.

1052
00:57:10,539 --> 00:57:12,839
Dr. Shirley's in trouble.

1053
00:57:12,841 --> 00:57:14,975
I went out for a drink,
I walk into this bar,

1054
00:57:14,977 --> 00:57:16,843
and Dr. Shirley's in there
getting bounced around.

1055
00:57:16,845 --> 00:57:19,246
I didn't want to leave him,
but I didn't know what to do.

1056
00:57:19,248 --> 00:57:20,881
Who let him out of his cage?

1057
00:57:20,883 --> 00:57:22,849
And they put that little tie
on him, too.

1058
00:57:22,851 --> 00:57:24,051
- Why you all dressed up?
- Yeah.

1059
00:57:26,088 --> 00:57:27,990
Get your hands off him.

1060
00:57:30,092 --> 00:57:33,260
What in the good goddamn
we got here, fellas?

1061
00:57:33,262 --> 00:57:34,795
Hand him over.

1062
00:57:34,797 --> 00:57:36,930
We walk out.
Won't be a problem.

1063
00:57:36,932 --> 00:57:39,066
I just wanted a drink, Tony.

1064
00:57:39,068 --> 00:57:41,134
Hey, I told you we'll leave.

1065
00:57:41,136 --> 00:57:44,004
- Not a big deal. Come on.
- He ain't going nowhere.

1066
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:46,039
We need a Brillo Pad
to wash these dishes with.

1067
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:47,908
Listen, assholes.

1068
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:50,277
Do yourselves a favor
and let him go.

1069
00:57:50,279 --> 00:57:51,747
Now!

1070
00:57:53,882 --> 00:57:55,818
Say it nice.

1071
00:57:56,885 --> 00:57:58,952
I just said it nice.

1072
00:57:58,954 --> 00:58:02,222
This boy is gonna get
what he's got coming to him.

1073
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:07,963
And you, you ain't got no say.

1074
00:58:10,032 --> 00:58:11,398
Maybe.

1075
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,901
But whatever happens here,
I'm gonna put a bullet

1076
00:58:14,903 --> 00:58:17,037
right in the middle
of your thick skull.

1077
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:20,140
He ain't got no gun, Ray.

1078
00:58:20,142 --> 00:58:22,309
He's full of shit.

1079
00:58:22,311 --> 00:58:24,880
What if he ain't?

1080
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,417
Well, I sure ain't.

1081
00:58:30,419 --> 00:58:34,256
And I ain't about to let this
come to pass in my place.

1082
00:58:37,092 --> 00:58:38,925
Let the spook go.

1083
00:58:38,927 --> 00:58:39,962
Let him go.

1084
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:43,030
Come on.

1085
00:58:43,032 --> 00:58:45,065
Get him out of here.

1086
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:48,869
I want these Yankees
off of my property.

1087
00:58:48,871 --> 00:58:51,271
- Go on.
- Go on, George. Go. Go.

1088
00:58:51,273 --> 00:58:53,275
I got you, Doc.

1089
00:58:55,311 --> 00:58:56,378
Go on.

1090
00:59:03,485 --> 00:59:05,886
- You out of your mind?
- I'm sorry.

1091
00:59:05,888 --> 00:59:08,889
I didn't mean to put you
in that position.

1092
00:59:08,891 --> 00:59:10,257
Wait, wait, wait.

1093
00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:13,262
Are you gonna throw up again?

1094
00:59:14,963 --> 00:59:16,396
I'm okay.

1095
00:59:16,398 --> 00:59:18,298
Honest to God, Doc,
I don't understand you.

1096
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,967
You could have drunk here.
You got a whole bottle.

1097
00:59:20,969 --> 00:59:23,070
I just needed some air.

1098
00:59:23,072 --> 00:59:24,104
Air?

1099
00:59:24,106 --> 00:59:26,008
Do you know where you are?

1100
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:29,242
Does geography really matter?

1101
00:59:29,244 --> 00:59:31,244
What?

1102
00:59:31,246 --> 00:59:34,915
If I was in a bar
in your neighborhood,

1103
00:59:34,917 --> 00:59:38,320
would the conversation
be any different?

1104
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:43,390
From now on, you don't go
nowhere without me.

1105
00:59:43,392 --> 00:59:46,026
Nowhere!

1106
00:59:46,028 --> 00:59:48,430
- Got it?
- I-I understand.

1107

1111
00:59:57,707 --> 01:00:00,140
Course not.

1112
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:02,846
Doc, where's your goddamn room?

1113
01:00:06,716 --> 01:00:08,215
- Come on.
- There it is.

1114
01:00:08,217 --> 01:00:09,483
Over there?

1115
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:11,084
You gotta get to bed, Doc.

1116
01:00:11,086 --> 01:00:13,954
You got a big show

01:01:11,447 --> 01:01:13,313
Athletes practice.
They don't rehearse.

1133
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:17,554
Ah, shit.

1134
01:02:41,638 --> 01:02:45,573
Ladies and gentlemen,
a very special guest

1135
01:02:45,575 --> 01:02:47,575
from the far north,

1136
01:02:47,577 --> 01:02:50,045
Don Shirley.

1137
01:02:53,515 --> 01:02:57,150
Accompanying Mr. Shirley,
the members of his trio,

1138
01:02:57,152 --> 01:03:01,689
Oleg Malacovich, George Dyer,
and his associate

1139
01:03:01,691 --> 01:03:05,693
Tony Valle... Valle...
Vallelong-longia.

1140
01:03:10,733 --> 01:03:13,400
Oh, this is my lovely wife,
Margaret.

1141
01:03:13,402 --> 01:03:14,569
If you gentlemen don't mind,

1142
01:03:14,571 --> 01:03:15,903
we're going to steal
Donnie away

1143
01:03:15,905 --> 01:03:17,640
for some, uh, introductions.

1144
01:03:20,142 --> 01:03:22,442
I'd like you all
to meet Don Shirley.

1145
01:03:22,444 --> 01:03:24,612
- Yeah. I'll take one.
- Hmm.

1146
01:03:24,614 --> 01:03:26,146
What's that?

1147
01:03:26,148 --> 01:03:27,648
A pimento and cheese
sandwich, sir.

1148
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,451
Yeah, I'll try one of them.

1149
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,222
Oof.

1150
01:03:39,762 --> 01:03:41,396
Sorry. Not for me.

1151
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:52,172
Earlier this week,
we asked our help

1152
01:03:52,174 --> 01:03:54,374
what Mr. Shirley
might like for supper.

1153
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:57,410
So the boys in the kitchen
whipped up a special menu

1154
01:03:57,412 --> 01:03:58,579
- in honor of our guest.
- Oh!

1155
01:03:58,581 --> 01:04:00,648
Gentlemen.

1156
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:02,550
Home-cooked fried chicken.

1157
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:11,224
There we go.

1158
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:13,259
Bring it in. Serve it up hot.

1159
01:04:42,692 --> 01:04:46,161
Thank you. Thank you.

1160
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:49,396
We'll return after
a brief intermission.

1161
01:04:52,234 --> 01:04:54,300
Excuse me, Don.

1162
01:04:54,302 --> 01:04:56,671
- Lovely work in there.
- Why, thank you.

1163
01:04:56,673 --> 01:04:58,505
Uh, are you looking
for the commode?

1164
01:04:58,507 --> 01:05:00,574
- Yes. I...
- Yeah, here. Let me help you.

1165
01:05:00,576 --> 01:05:02,511
It's right out there
before that pine.

1166
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,583
I'd prefer not to use that.

1167
01:05:09,585 --> 01:05:10,818
Well, don't be silly, Don.

1168
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,853
It looks a lot worse
from the outside.

1169
01:05:12,855 --> 01:05:15,422
And I suppose you'd know
from experience.

1170
01:05:15,424 --> 01:05:18,193
Well, I've never had
any complaints.

1171
01:05:21,764 --> 01:05:23,631
Well, I could return
to my motel

1172
01:05:23,633 --> 01:05:25,866
and use the facilities there,

1173
01:05:25,868 --> 01:05:29,204
but that would take
at least a half an hour.

1174
01:05:32,608 --> 01:05:34,610
We don't mind waiting.

1175
01:05:35,845 --> 01:05:37,745
<i>Why don't I just pull over?</i>

1176
01:05:37,747 --> 01:05:39,312
You can piss in the woods.

1177
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:40,480
Animals go in the woods.

1178
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:41,782
It's gonna be
at least 20 minutes,

1179
01:05:41,784 --> 01:05:43,884
I gotta go all the way back
to your motel.

1180
01:05:43,886 --> 01:05:45,385
So let's just get there

1181
01:05:45,387 --> 01:05:47,320
so I can go back
and finish the show.

1182
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:49,757
See, that's the
difference between you and me.

1183
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:51,458
I'd have zero problem
going in the woods.

1184
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:52,693
I'm well aware.

1185
01:05:52,695 --> 01:05:54,628
What are you sore at me for?

1186
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:56,529
I don't make the rules
down here.

1187
01:05:56,531 --> 01:05:57,898
No?

1188
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,767
Then who does?

1189
01:05:59,769 --> 01:06:01,602
Oh.

1190
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:04,437
You're saying just 'cause
I'm white and they're white?

1191
01:06:04,439 --> 01:06:05,873
You know, that's a very
prejudiced thing

1192
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:07,507
you just said there.

1193
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:08,642
A very prejudiced thing.

1194
01:06:08,644 --> 01:06:10,745
I got more in common
with the Hymies

1195
01:06:10,747 --> 01:06:12,545
at 2nd Avenue Deli than I do

1196
01:06:12,547 --> 01:06:14,081
with these hillbilly pricks
down here.

1197
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:15,482
Eyes on the road.

1198
01:06:15,484 --> 01:06:16,316
You always say that

1199
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:17,852
when you don't like
what I'm saying.

1200
01:06:17,854 --> 01:06:19,655
Eyes on the road.

1201
01:06:23,492 --> 01:06:25,425
I don't get it.

1202
01:06:25,427 --> 01:06:28,528
How does he smile and shake
their hands like that?

1203
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:30,765
They try to pull
that outhouse shit on me,

1204
01:06:30,767 --> 01:06:32,802
I'd piss right
on the living room floor.

1205
01:06:34,604 --> 01:06:36,538
Don't-don't do that.

1206
01:06:37,907 --> 01:06:40,710
We have many
concert dates left.

1207
01:06:42,845 --> 01:06:45,378
Yeah? So?

1208
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:48,283
You realize we're contractually
obliged to perform them?

1209
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:50,785
Course I do.

1210
01:06:50,787 --> 01:06:53,419
You don't play,
we don't get paid.

1211
01:06:53,421 --> 01:06:54,822
What's your point?

1212
01:06:54,824 --> 01:06:57,925
Ugly circumstances
are going to happen again,

1213
01:06:57,927 --> 01:07:00,393
so control yourself.

1214
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:02,799
Don't lecture me, you rat.

1215
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,967
Dr. Shirley could have
stayed up north,

1216
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:09,670
getting rear end kissed
at Park Avenue parties

1217
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:11,572
for three times money.

1218
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:13,874
But he ask for this.

1219
01:07:18,446 --> 01:07:19,649
Why?

1220
01:07:39,467 --> 01:07:41,735
What on God's green Earth
are you doing?

1221
01:07:41,737 --> 01:07:43,637
A letter.

1222
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:46,874
Looks more like
a piecemeal ransom note.

1223
01:07:46,876 --> 01:07:48,744
May I?

1224
01:07:55,618 --> 01:07:57,751
"Dear Dolores."

1225
01:07:57,753 --> 01:07:59,186
D-E-A-R.

1226
01:07:59,188 --> 01:08:00,788
This is an animal.

1227
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:03,489
"I'm meeting all
the highly leading citizens

1228
01:08:03,491 --> 01:08:05,759
"of the town.

1229
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:09,495
"People that use big words,
all of them.

1230
01:08:09,497 --> 01:08:12,032
"But you know me. I get by.

1231
01:08:12,034 --> 01:08:13,901
I'm a good bullshitter."

1232
01:08:13,903 --> 01:08:16,670
Two T's in "bullshitter."

1233
01:08:16,672 --> 01:08:20,808
"As I'm writing this letter,
I'm eating potato chips,

1234
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:24,544
"and I'm starting
to get thirsty.

1235
01:08:24,546 --> 01:08:28,048
"I washed my socks
and dried them on the TV.

1236
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:30,818
I should have brung the iron."

1237
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:32,655
You know this is pathetic,
right?

1238
01:08:33,789 --> 01:08:35,789
Tell me what you're trying
to say.

1239
01:08:35,791 --> 01:08:38,058
I don't know.

1240
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,493
You know, I miss her and shit.

1241
01:08:40,495 --> 01:08:41,662
Then say that.

1242
01:08:41,664 --> 01:08:43,697
But do it in a manner
that no one else

1243
01:08:43,699 --> 01:08:45,498
has ever done it before.

1244
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,936
And without the profanity.

1245
01:08:47,937 --> 01:08:50,470
Something like, uh...

1246
01:08:50,472 --> 01:08:52,575
Put this down.

1247
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:56,076
"Dear Dolores."

1248
01:08:56,078 --> 01:08:58,511
Hold on. I'll start a new one.

1249
01:08:58,513 --> 01:09:01,684
"D-E-A-R Dolores."

1250
01:09:03,753 --> 01:09:06,820
"When I think of you,

1251
01:09:06,822 --> 01:09:11,524
I'm reminded of
the beautiful plains of Iowa."

1252
01:09:11,526 --> 01:09:13,027
What planes?

1253
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:14,828
The plains.

1254
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:16,563
P-L-A-I-N-S.

1255
01:09:16,565 --> 01:09:17,831
Those big fields we saw.

1256
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:20,067
Oh. Yeah, those were nice.

1257
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:22,102
Plains.

1258
01:09:22,104 --> 01:09:25,839
"Which is what they call...

1259
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:29,509
big fields around here."

1260
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:31,511
Tony, no expounding.

1261
01:09:31,513 --> 01:09:33,847
- No what?
- Just write what I say.

1262
01:09:33,849 --> 01:09:35,716
No good.

1263
01:09:35,718 --> 01:09:38,986
"The distance between us...

1264
01:09:38,988 --> 01:09:41,624
is breaking my spirit."

1265
01:09:42,858 --> 01:09:45,025
"Between us..."

1266
01:09:45,027 --> 01:09:47,661
"My time and experiences
without you

1267
01:09:47,663 --> 01:09:49,699
"are meaningless to me.

1268
01:09:53,002 --> 01:09:54,802
"Falling in love with you

1269
01:09:54,804 --> 01:09:57,738
was the easiest thing
I've ever done."

1270
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:02,042
"Falling in love with you..."

1271
01:10:02,044 --> 01:10:05,545
This is very fucking romantic.

1272
01:10:05,547 --> 01:10:07,014
<i>...was the easiest thing</i>

1273
01:10:07,016 --> 01:10:08,849
<i>I have ever done.</i>

1274
01:10:08,851 --> 01:10:11,852
<i>Nothing matters to me but you,</i>

1275
01:10:11,854 --> 01:10:15,055
<i>and every day I'm alive,
I'm aware of this.</i>

1276
01:10:15,057 --> 01:10:19,326
<i>I loved you the day I met you,
I love you today,</i>

1277
01:10:19,328 --> 01:10:22,832
<i>and I will love you
the rest of my life.</i>

1278
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:27,801
So, can I put, uh...
"P.S. Kiss the kids"?

1279
01:10:27,803 --> 01:10:29,136
A P.S.?

1280
01:10:29,138 --> 01:10:30,873
Yeah, like, at the end.

1281
01:10:31,907 --> 01:10:33,741
That's like clanging a cowbell

1282
01:10:33,743 --> 01:10:35,878
at the end
of Shostakovich's Seventh.

1283
01:10:37,646 --> 01:10:39,648
Right. And that's good?

1284
01:10:40,783 --> 01:10:42,752
It's perfect, Tony.

1285
01:10:46,355 --> 01:10:49,356
Everybody talks
about Willie Mays, 1954.

1286
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:51,658
It wasn't even the greatest
catch in the Polo Grounds.

1287
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:54,628
That was Joe DiMaggio, 1936,

1288
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:55,963
second game
of the World Series.

1289
01:10:55,965 --> 01:10:58,934
Final out, 500 feet...

1290
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:03,871
You like that, Doc?

1291
01:11:03,873 --> 01:11:05,072
That's a handsome suit.

1292
01:11:05,074 --> 01:11:07,674
- Sharp.
- Mm-hmm.

1293
01:11:07,676 --> 01:11:09,977
Guy looks just like you.

1294
01:11:09,979 --> 01:11:11,914
He does?

1295
01:11:13,082 --> 01:11:15,584
Well, size-wise. Yeah.

1296
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,920
It is about a 42.

1297
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:22,990
- Why don't you try it on?
- Hmm...

1298
01:11:22,992 --> 01:11:26,026
What, you gotta wear
a tuxedo onstage every night?

1299
01:11:26,028 --> 01:11:27,995
You could mix it up
a little, Doc.

1300
01:11:27,997 --> 01:11:29,863
Come on, let's see
how it looks on you.

1301
01:11:29,865 --> 01:11:30,998
We got plenty of time.

1302
01:11:33,803 --> 01:11:35,402
I'll be right back.

1303
01:11:35,404 --> 01:11:38,238
- How you doing?
- May I help you, sir?

1304
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,107
Yeah, we want
to try on that, uh,

1305
01:11:40,109 --> 01:11:41,809
beautiful gray suit
in the window.

1306
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:43,077
You got it in a 42?

1307
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:44,980
Of course.

1308
01:11:47,149 --> 01:11:48,849
That's the one.

1309
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:50,717
Dressing room
is in the back, sir.

1310
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,086
Thank you.

1311
01:11:52,088 --> 01:11:54,421
- I'll be just a moment.
- Take your time, Doc.

1312
01:11:54,423 --> 01:11:56,158
I'll check out
some ties for you.

1313
01:11:57,726 --> 01:11:59,726
Uh, e-excuse me.

1314
01:11:59,728 --> 01:12:02,098
Uh, you're not allowed
to try that on.

1315
01:12:03,732 --> 01:12:05,065
I beg your pardon?

1316
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:07,434
Uh, if you'd like
to purchase it first,

1317
01:12:07,436 --> 01:12:10,139
we'd be happy
to tailor it to your needs.

1318
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:14,977
I see.

1319
01:13:16,071 --> 01:13:17,773
Yeah.

1320
01:13:18,908 --> 01:13:20,743
That's me.

1321
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,086
Hey, Officer.

1322
01:13:33,088 --> 01:13:35,189
I got a call about Dr. Shirley.

1323
01:13:35,191 --> 01:13:37,226
Come on.

1324
01:13:41,897 --> 01:13:44,231
His friend's here.

1325
01:13:44,233 --> 01:13:46,233
Thank you.

1326
01:13:50,839 --> 01:13:53,273
Get a guy a towel,
for Christ's sake.

1327
01:13:53,275 --> 01:13:54,975
You a lawyer?

1328
01:13:54,977 --> 01:13:56,243
- No.
- Well, you should call one.

1329
01:13:56,245 --> 01:13:58,178
- We're taking your auntie in.
- For what?

1330
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:00,983
Manager caught him
and the other guy.

1331
01:14:04,353 --> 01:14:06,954
Well, can we get
the cuffs off him,

1332
01:14:06,956 --> 01:14:09,189
let him put his pants on,
we talk about this?

1333
01:14:09,191 --> 01:14:10,857
Sure, we could.

1334
01:14:10,859 --> 01:14:12,826
But we ain't.

1335
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:15,862
Okay, look, we're out of here
tomorrow morning.

1336
01:14:15,864 --> 01:14:17,297
You'll never see us again.

1337
01:14:17,299 --> 01:14:19,868
There's gotta be something
we can do to work this out.

1338
01:14:21,837 --> 01:14:23,003
What if you let him go

1339
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:25,138
and I give you something
to thank you?

1340
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:28,375
- You bribing us?
- No.

1341
01:14:28,377 --> 01:14:29,810
Hell no.

1342
01:14:29,812 --> 01:14:30,978
A gift.

1343
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,279
A thank-you.

1344
01:14:32,281 --> 01:14:34,815
What kind of thank-you?

1345
01:14:34,817 --> 01:14:36,350
Like a...

1346
01:14:36,352 --> 01:14:38,318
you know, donation
to the police force.

1347
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,020
Youse guys.

1348
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:42,089
Whatever you want.

1349
01:14:42,091 --> 01:14:44,858
You like suits?

1350
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:46,960
I was walking through
your nice town today,

1351
01:14:46,962 --> 01:14:49,997
and I seen a store
that was selling suits.

1352
01:14:49,999 --> 01:14:51,865
Primo suits.

1353
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:55,335
What if, as a thank-you...
a donation...

1354
01:14:55,337 --> 01:14:58,305
I buy youse each a suit?

1355
01:14:58,307 --> 01:15:00,107
You get all dressed up,

1356
01:15:00,109 --> 01:15:02,309
you take the wife out
for dinner.

1357
01:15:02,311 --> 01:15:04,311
I mean, guys like you,
you work hard.

1358
01:15:04,313 --> 01:15:06,315
You deserve it.

1359
01:15:12,988 --> 01:15:14,988
They were wrong
for the way they treated me,

1360
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:17,059
and you rewarded them.

1361
01:15:18,861 --> 01:15:21,194
I was hired to get you
from one show to the next.

1362
01:15:21,196 --> 01:15:23,030
How I do it
shouldn't matter to you.

1363
01:15:23,032 --> 01:15:24,898
I just wish you hadn't
paid 'em off.

1364
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,234
I did what I had to do.

1365
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:29,637
You know, if this got out,
it would kill your career.

1366
01:15:29,639 --> 01:15:31,938
Okay, Tony.

1367
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:33,974
I need you to stop it
with the phony altruism

1368
01:15:33,976 --> 01:15:35,409
and concern for my career.

1369
01:15:35,411 --> 01:15:37,144
What the hell does that mean?

1370
01:15:37,146 --> 01:15:38,945
You were only thinking
about yourself back there

1371
01:15:38,947 --> 01:15:40,347
because you know,
if I miss a show,

1372
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:41,948
it'll come out
of your pocketbook.

1373
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,984
Of course I don't want you
to miss a show,

1374
01:15:43,986 --> 01:15:45,185
you ungrateful bastard.

1375
01:15:45,187 --> 01:15:47,287
You think I'm doing this
for my health?

1376
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:49,356
Tonight, I saved your ass.

1377
01:15:49,358 --> 01:15:52,059
So show a little
appreciation, maybe.

1378
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:56,363
Besides, I told you never
to go nowhere without me!

1379
01:15:56,365 --> 01:16:00,400
I assumed you'd want this
to be the exception.

1380
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:37,270
Want me to get some makeup
or something

1381
01:16:37,272 --> 01:16:38,505
for the show tomorrow?

1382
01:16:38,507 --> 01:16:40,107
No, I'm fine.

1383
01:16:40,109 --> 01:16:42,275
You sure? Bruise kind of shows.

1384
01:16:42,277 --> 01:16:43,479
I said I'm fine.

1385
01:16:45,013 --> 01:16:46,982
Okay.

1386
01:16:53,422 --> 01:16:55,255
He didn't ask me to do that.

1387
01:16:55,257 --> 01:16:57,424
Dom, I'm telling you,
that's what he told me.

1388
01:16:57,426 --> 01:16:59,025
He didn't ask me.

1389
01:16:59,027 --> 01:17:01,528
Oh. Tony Lip.

1390
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:03,130
- Dominic, Mags.
- What the hell...?

1391
01:17:03,132 --> 01:17:04,498
What the hell you guys
doing down here?

1392
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,032
Hey, Brooklyn sent us down.

1393
01:17:06,034 --> 01:17:08,237
- Take care of a few things.
- Yeah.

1394
01:17:43,071 --> 01:17:44,908
I'm working here.

1395
01:17:53,783 --> 01:17:56,349
Sorry, Doc. They're some
friends from New York.

1396
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:58,351
Hey, can you get
Dr. Shirley's luggage?

1397
01:17:58,353 --> 01:17:59,455
All right.

1398
01:18:32,287 --> 01:18:33,621
Called his room.

1399
01:18:33,623 --> 01:18:35,457
Be down in a minute.

1400
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:45,566
Hey, Doc.

1401
01:18:45,568 --> 01:18:47,436
Where are you off to?

1402
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:51,104
Just going downstairs.

1403
01:18:51,106 --> 01:18:53,041
To have a drink.

1404
01:19:03,352 --> 01:19:05,151
Tony...

1405
01:19:05,153 --> 01:19:08,856
I think you're doing
a wonderful job.

1406
01:19:08,858 --> 01:19:11,124
So...

1407
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:12,627
I'd like to formally offer you

1408
01:19:12,629 --> 01:19:14,427
the position
of my road manager.

1409
01:19:14,429 --> 01:19:19,332
With the title also comes
more responsibility, but...

1410
01:19:19,334 --> 01:19:21,336
that also means a raise in pay.

1411
01:19:22,404 --> 01:19:24,504
No. No.

1412
01:19:24,506 --> 01:19:27,474
No, thanks.

1413
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:31,646
We agreed on 125 a week,
plus expenses.

1414
01:19:31,648 --> 01:19:34,584
That's our deal, right?

1415
01:19:36,251 --> 01:19:38,184
I ain't going nowhere, Doc.

1416
01:19:38,186 --> 01:19:40,489
I-I was just going down
to tell them.

1417
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:52,334
Tony.

1418
01:19:57,205 --> 01:19:59,576
I'm sorry about last night.

1419
01:20:02,712 --> 01:20:05,147
Don't worry about it.

1420
01:20:06,683 --> 01:20:10,150
I've been working nightclubs
in New York City my whole life.

1421
01:20:10,152 --> 01:20:14,222
I know it's a...
complicated world.

1422
01:20:26,468 --> 01:20:28,201
<i>So, where'd you learn</i>

1423
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:29,436
how to play like that?

1424
01:20:29,438 --> 01:20:31,371
- My mother.
- Your mother?

1425
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:33,342
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1426
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:38,646
She taught me how to play
on an old spinet.

1427
01:20:38,648 --> 01:20:41,214
Soon as I could walk, we'd...

1428
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,450
travel around
the Florida Panhandle,

1429
01:20:43,452 --> 01:20:47,187
put on my little shows
in parishes and halls.

1430
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:49,389
Fortunately,
a man who had seen me play

1431
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:50,658
arranged for me to study

1432
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:52,693
at the Leningrad Conservatory
of Music.

1433
01:20:52,695 --> 01:20:55,528
I was the first Negro
ever accepted there.

1434
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:57,965
That's where they taught you
all them songs you play?

1435
01:20:57,967 --> 01:21:01,201
Actually, I was trained
to play classical music.

1436
01:21:01,203 --> 01:21:05,474
Brahms, Franz Liszt,
Beethoven, Chopin.

1437
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:08,809
It's all I ever wanted to play.

1438
01:21:08,811 --> 01:21:11,746
But I was persuaded
by my record company

1439
01:21:11,748 --> 01:21:15,616
to pursue a career
in popular music instead.

1440
01:21:15,618 --> 01:21:18,218
They insisted that audiences
would never accept

1441
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:20,387
a Negro pianist
on a classical stage.

1442
01:21:20,389 --> 01:21:25,291
Wanted to turn me into just
another colored entertainer.

1443
01:21:25,293 --> 01:21:28,696
You know, the guy who's smoking
while he's playing

1444
01:21:28,698 --> 01:21:31,565
and sets a glass of whiskey
on his piano,

1445
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:34,300
and then complains
because he's not respected

1446
01:21:34,302 --> 01:21:35,703
like Arthur Rubinstein.

1447
01:21:35,705 --> 01:21:38,606
You don't see Arthur Rubinstein

1448
01:21:38,608 --> 01:21:41,243
putting a glass of whiskey
on his piano.

1449
01:21:42,578 --> 01:21:44,612
I don't know.
Personally, I think,

1450
01:21:44,614 --> 01:21:46,413
if you stuck
to the classic stuff,

1451
01:21:46,415 --> 01:21:48,015
it would've been a big mistake.

1452
01:21:48,017 --> 01:21:49,617
A mistake?

1453
01:21:49,619 --> 01:21:52,853
Performing the music I trained
my entire life to play?

1454
01:21:52,855 --> 01:21:55,455
Trained?
What are you, a seal?

1455
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:57,323
People love what you do.

1456
01:21:57,325 --> 01:21:59,760
Anyone could sound
like Beethoven or...

1457
01:21:59,762 --> 01:22:02,328
"Joe Pan"
or them other guys you said,

1458
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:06,268
but your music, what you do...

1459
01:22:07,704 --> 01:22:09,504
...only you can do that.

1460
01:22:12,374 --> 01:22:13,743
Thank you, Tony.

1461
01:22:18,748 --> 01:22:21,383
But not everyone
can play Chopin.

1462

We had to turn
off the main road,

Step out of the car.

What'd I do?

1500

Out of the car.

01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:36,877
Why are you on this road?

1502
01:25:36,879 --> 01:25:38,245
I told you.

1503
01:25:38,247 --> 01:25:41,817
We had to make a detour,
and we got lost.

1504
01:25:46,255 --> 01:25:48,088
And why are you driving him?

1505
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:50,693
He's my boss.

1506
01:25:56,498 --> 01:25:58,565
He can't be out here at night.

1507
01:25:58,567 --> 01:26:00,500
This is a sundown town.

1508
01:26:00,502 --> 01:26:01,804
What's that?

1509
01:26:03,105 --> 01:26:05,906
Get him out of the car
and check his I.D.

1510
01:26:05,908 --> 01:26:07,074
Oh, come on.

1511
01:26:07,076 --> 01:26:08,208
It's pouring rain.

1512
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:11,544
Sir, I can just get it
right here through the window.

1513
01:26:11,546 --> 01:26:12,746
Get him out of the car.

1514
01:26:12,748 --> 01:26:14,615
Come on, get out, now.

1515
01:26:14,617 --> 01:26:16,516
Get out, now. Get out.

1516
01:26:16,518 --> 01:26:18,921
Got I.D.?

1517
01:26:20,957 --> 01:26:23,924
How you say this last name?

1518
01:26:23,926 --> 01:26:26,060
Vallelonga.

1519
01:26:26,062 --> 01:26:28,528
Yeah, what kind of name
is that?

1520
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:29,897
It's Italian.

1521
01:26:29,899 --> 01:26:31,031
Oh.

1522
01:26:31,033 --> 01:26:32,633
Oh, I see.

1523
01:26:32,635 --> 01:26:34,937
That's why
you're driving him around.

1524
01:26:36,973 --> 01:26:38,739
You're half a nigger yourself.

1525
01:26:39,742 --> 01:26:41,575
Hands in the air!

1526
01:26:41,577 --> 01:26:42,878
Now! Now!

1527
01:26:46,615 --> 01:26:48,516
Excuse me.

1528
01:26:51,787 --> 01:26:55,556
Excuse me, sirs.

1529
01:26:55,558 --> 01:26:58,759
I-I understand why my associate
is being held,

1530
01:26:58,761 --> 01:27:01,731
but what exactly am I
being charged with?

1531
01:27:04,633 --> 01:27:07,835
You seem like reasonable men.

1532
01:27:07,837 --> 01:27:09,136
Perhaps you could let me out

1533
01:27:09,138 --> 01:27:11,638
so that we could discuss
the situation further.

1534
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,574
Just put the apple butter
away, boy.

1535
01:27:13,576 --> 01:27:16,577
You ain't going nowhere
no time soon.

1536
01:27:16,579 --> 01:27:19,680
You cannot hold me
without cause.

1537
01:27:19,682 --> 01:27:21,015
Well, I got cause.

1538
01:27:21,017 --> 01:27:23,786
'Cause you let the sun set
on your black ass.

1539
01:27:25,121 --> 01:27:27,721
I want to speak to my lawyer.

1540
01:27:27,723 --> 01:27:29,890
I want my call.

1541
01:27:29,892 --> 01:27:33,160
This is a flagrant violation
of my rights.

1542
01:27:33,162 --> 01:27:36,597
You know...

1543
01:27:36,599 --> 01:27:40,736
he does have, uh, rights.

1544
01:27:45,174 --> 01:27:48,609
Give the Negro
his goddamn phone call.

1545
01:27:48,611 --> 01:27:50,079
You happy?

1546
01:27:54,617 --> 01:27:56,383
You know a lawyer?

1547
01:27:56,385 --> 01:27:57,787
Call him.

1548
01:28:09,198 --> 01:28:10,931
I walk up
to the car, and I say,

1549
01:28:10,933 --> 01:28:12,800
"Sir, you know
how fast you were going?"

1550
01:28:12,802 --> 01:28:15,069
He says, "I'm sorry, Officer.
I didn't mean to speed, but..."

1551
01:28:15,071 --> 01:28:16,703
As my mother always said,

1552
01:28:16,705 --> 01:28:19,173
"What kind
of brand-new fool are you?"

1553
01:28:19,175 --> 01:28:21,141
Look at them over there.

1554
01:28:21,143 --> 01:28:23,777
Take a good look
at the officer you hit.

1555
01:28:23,779 --> 01:28:26,146
Look at him. He's over there
having a grand old time,

1556
01:28:26,148 --> 01:28:30,417
chatting up with his pals,
enjoying a nice cup of coffee.

1557
01:28:30,419 --> 01:28:32,653
And where are you?

1558
01:28:32,655 --> 01:28:35,656
In here, with me,
who did nothing.

1559
01:28:35,658 --> 01:28:37,958
Yet I'm the one
who pays the price.

1560
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:40,861
I'm the one who's gonna miss
the Birmingham show.

1561
01:28:40,863 --> 01:28:42,763
Hey, I'm gonna lose
a lot of money, too,

1562
01:28:42,765 --> 01:28:44,164
if you don't play Birmingham.

1563
01:28:44,166 --> 01:28:47,636
So that little temper tantrum,
was it worth it?

1564
01:28:48,737 --> 01:28:50,737
Hmm?

1565
01:28:50,739 --> 01:28:52,739
You never win
with violence, Tony.

1566
01:28:52,741 --> 01:28:54,908
You only win when you maintain
your dignity.

1567
01:28:54,910 --> 01:28:59,012
Dignity always prevails.

1568
01:28:59,014 --> 01:29:02,218
And tonight,
because of you, we did not.

1569
01:29:07,089 --> 01:29:09,723
I wouldn't touch
that mattress, Doc.

1570
01:29:09,725 --> 01:29:12,061
Maryville Police.

1571
01:29:14,797 --> 01:29:16,697
No, sir.

1572
01:29:16,699 --> 01:29:19,133
No, no, I-I'm not, sir.

1573
01:29:19,135 --> 01:29:21,935
Yes, sir.
He's right here, sir. Yes, sir.

1574
01:29:21,937 --> 01:29:23,036
Yes, sir.

1575
01:29:23,038 --> 01:29:25,205
Give me.

1576
01:29:25,207 --> 01:29:27,174
Chief Pratt. Who's this?

1577
01:29:27,176 --> 01:29:29,111
Baloney.

1578
01:29:31,313 --> 01:29:32,913
Yes, sir.

1579
01:29:32,915 --> 01:29:36,183
I can hear it now, Governor.

1580
01:29:36,185 --> 01:29:38,919
Uh...

1581
01:29:38,921 --> 01:29:40,821
No, sir, I'm sorry. I...

1582
01:29:40,823 --> 01:29:43,192
No, of course I can recognize
your voice. It's...

1583
01:29:46,228 --> 01:29:48,228
Sir?

1584
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:52,067
You're saying the boy
we got locked up called who?

1585
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:57,070
Oh, and he called you.

1586
01:29:57,072 --> 01:29:59,006
No, no, sir.

1587
01:29:59,008 --> 01:30:02,178
An officer was assaulted
in the line of duty.

1588
01:30:04,947 --> 01:30:07,848
No, sir. No.
I don't want no National Guard

1589
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:09,816
coming down here, neither, sir.

1590
01:30:09,818 --> 01:30:12,221
I'll get to it immediately,
Governor.

1591
01:30:13,522 --> 01:30:15,958
Good night to you
and the missus.

1592
01:30:20,062 --> 01:30:21,828
- Get 'em out.
- What?

1593
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:23,163
Cut 'em goddamn loose.

1594
01:30:23,165 --> 01:30:25,232
That dago wop hit me!

1595
01:30:25,234 --> 01:30:26,967
You want to keep
your goddamn job?

1596
01:30:26,969 --> 01:30:29,002
Then you do what I goddamn
tell you to do

1597
01:30:29,004 --> 01:30:31,104
when I goddamn tell you
to do it!

1598
01:30:31,106 --> 01:30:34,107
And I'm telling you
to get 'em the goddamn out!

1599
01:30:34,109 --> 01:30:35,878
Who the hell did you call?

1600
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:41,215
Bobby Kennedy
just saved our asses.

1601
01:30:41,217 --> 01:30:44,351
Madonne. <i>How great is that?</i>

1602
01:30:44,353 --> 01:30:45,986
It's not great.

1603
01:30:45,988 --> 01:30:47,555
It's not great at all.

1604
01:30:47,557 --> 01:30:49,923
- It's humiliating.
- The hell you talking about?

1605
01:30:49,925 --> 01:30:52,359
We were screwed. Now we ain't.

1606
01:30:52,361 --> 01:30:55,095
And I just put the attorney
general of the United States

1607
01:30:55,097 --> 01:30:56,296
in an incredibly awkward
position.

1608
01:30:56,298 --> 01:30:57,864
So what?

1609
01:30:57,866 --> 01:30:59,233
That's what the guy
gets paid for.

1610
01:30:59,235 --> 01:31:00,867
What else he got to do?

1611
01:31:00,869 --> 01:31:03,270
That man and his brother

1612
01:31:03,272 --> 01:31:04,871
are trying to change
this country.

1613
01:31:04,873 --> 01:31:07,307
That's what else he got to do.

1614
01:31:07,309 --> 01:31:10,944
Now he thinks
I'm some kind of...

1615
01:31:10,946 --> 01:31:14,348
Calling from some
backwoods swamp jail,

1616
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:17,818
asking to attenuate
assault charges? Who does that?

1617
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:20,053
Garbage. That's who.

1618
01:31:20,055 --> 01:31:21,421
You shouldn't have hit him.

1619
01:31:21,423 --> 01:31:23,223
I didn't like the way
he was treating you.

1620
01:31:23,225 --> 01:31:25,025
Making you stand out
in the rain like that.

1621
01:31:25,027 --> 01:31:28,128
Please, you hit him
because of what he called you.

1622
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:30,264
I've had to endure that kind
of talk my entire life.

1623
01:31:30,266 --> 01:31:32,399
You should be able to take it
for at least one night.

1624
01:31:32,401 --> 01:31:34,401
What? I can't get mad
at that stuff he was saying

1625
01:31:34,403 --> 01:31:35,936
'cause I ain't black?

1626
01:31:35,938 --> 01:31:37,170
Christ, I'm blacker
than you are.

1627
01:31:37,172 --> 01:31:38,872
- Excuse me?
- You don't know shit

1628
01:31:38,874 --> 01:31:40,374
about your own people.

1629
01:31:40,376 --> 01:31:43,877
What they eat, how they talk,
how they live.

1630
01:31:43,879 --> 01:31:45,445
You don't even know who
Little Richard is.

1631
01:31:45,447 --> 01:31:46,913
Oh, so knowing
who Little Richard is

1632
01:31:46,915 --> 01:31:47,981
makes you blacker than me?

1633
01:31:47,983 --> 01:31:51,084
Oh, Tony, I wish you could
hear yourself sometimes.

1634
01:31:51,086 --> 01:31:53,053
You wouldn't talk so damn much.

1635
01:31:53,055 --> 01:31:54,121
Bullshit.

1636
01:31:54,123 --> 01:31:56,423
I know exactly who I am.

1637
01:31:56,425 --> 01:31:58,358
I'm the guy who lived
in the same neighborhood

1638
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,927
in the Bronx my entire life
with my mother, my father,

1639
01:32:00,929 --> 01:32:02,630
my brother,
and now my wife and kids.

1640
01:32:02,632 --> 01:32:04,632
That's it. That's who I am.

1641
01:32:04,634 --> 01:32:07,100
I'm the asshole who has
to hustle every goddamn day

1642
01:32:07,102 --> 01:32:08,869
to put food on the table.

1643
01:32:08,871 --> 01:32:11,905
You, Mr. Big Shot,
you live on top of a castle,

1644
01:32:11,907 --> 01:32:14,441
traveling around the world
doing concerts for rich people.

1645
01:32:14,443 --> 01:32:17,144
I live on the streets.
You sit on a throne.

1646
01:32:17,146 --> 01:32:20,015
So yeah, my world is way more
blacker than yours.

1647
01:32:21,183 --> 01:32:23,050
Pull over.

1648
01:32:23,052 --> 01:32:24,217
What?

1649
01:32:24,219 --> 01:32:26,219
- Pull over.
- I ain't pulling over.

1650
01:32:26,221 --> 01:32:28,090
Stop the car, Tony!

1651
01:32:30,492 --> 01:32:31,992
What?

1652
01:32:31,994 --> 01:32:34,161
What are you doing?

1653
01:32:34,163 --> 01:32:35,998
Doc.

1654
01:32:37,966 --> 01:32:40,067
Doc, what the hell
are you doing?

1655
01:32:40,069 --> 01:32:41,101
Doc.

1656
01:32:41,103 --> 01:32:43,003
Get back in the car.

1657
01:32:43,005 --> 01:32:45,841
Yes, I live in a castle, Tony!
Alone.

1658
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:50,210
And rich white people pay me
to play piano for them

1659
01:32:50,212 --> 01:32:52,012
because it makes them
feel cultured.

1660
01:32:52,014 --> 01:32:54,481
But as soon as I step off
that stage, I go right back

1661
01:32:54,483 --> 01:32:56,950
to being just another nigger
to them.

1662
01:32:56,952 --> 01:32:58,985
Because that is
their true culture.

1663
01:32:58,987 --> 01:33:01,021
And I suffer that slight alone,

1664
01:33:01,023 --> 01:33:02,522
because I'm not accepted
by my own people

1665
01:33:02,524 --> 01:33:05,058
'cause I'm not like them,
either.

1666
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:08,261
So, if I'm not black enough
and if I'm not white enough

1667
01:33:08,263 --> 01:33:12,101
and if I'm not man enough,
then tell me, Tony, what am I?

1668
01:33:46,034 --> 01:33:48,036
I need some sleep.

1669
01:33:51,173 --> 01:33:53,173
All right.

1670
01:33:53,175 --> 01:33:55,175
I'll stop at the next place
we see

1671
01:33:55,177 --> 01:33:56,443
and sneak you into my room.

1672
01:33:56,445 --> 01:33:58,211
No. No.

1673
01:33:58,213 --> 01:34:00,313
I refuse to stay
in an establishment

1674
01:34:00,315 --> 01:34:02,184
where I'm not welcome.

1675
01:34:04,253 --> 01:34:06,188
Yeah. Okay.

1676
01:34:24,206 --> 01:34:26,442
Tony, do you have
to smoke everywhere?

1677
01:34:28,778 --> 01:34:31,144
I didn't know it bothered you.

1678
01:34:31,146 --> 01:34:34,114
You should have told me.

1679
01:34:34,116 --> 01:34:36,385
All you gotta do
is say the word, Doc.

1680
01:34:48,798 --> 01:34:52,232
You do realize you'll be home
before that letter arrives.

1681
01:34:52,234 --> 01:34:53,801
Yeah, I know.

1682
01:34:53,803 --> 01:34:55,502
Just thought I'd bring it
with me.

1683
01:34:55,504 --> 01:34:58,071
Save on stamps.

1684
01:34:58,073 --> 01:34:59,574
All right.

1685
01:34:59,576 --> 01:35:02,044
Tony, give it here.
I'll fix it.

1686
01:35:03,078 --> 01:35:04,812
No offense, Doc,

1687
01:35:04,814 --> 01:35:07,983
but I think
I got the hang of it now.

1688
01:35:14,156 --> 01:35:16,089
"Dear Dolores:

1689
01:35:16,091 --> 01:35:19,294
"Sometimes you remind me
of a house.

1690
01:35:21,530 --> 01:35:25,198
"A house with
beautiful lights on it,

1691
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:28,203
where everyone
is happy inside."

1692
01:35:33,108 --> 01:35:35,576
Yes, Tony. You got it.

1693
01:35:35,578 --> 01:35:38,144
Yeah?

1694
01:35:39,448 --> 01:35:42,117
Thanks.

1695
01:35:43,653 --> 01:35:48,421
Hey, Doc, thanks for helping me
with, uh, the letters.

1696
01:35:48,423 --> 01:35:51,224
You're really good
at writing 'em.

1697
01:35:51,226 --> 01:35:53,395
My pleasure, Tony.

1698
01:35:54,564 --> 01:35:56,530
You know, um,
when you get home,

1699
01:35:56,532 --> 01:36:00,469
maybe you should write...
write one to your brother.

1700
01:36:02,471 --> 01:36:05,673
He knows where I am
if he ever wants to reconnect.

1701
01:36:05,675 --> 01:36:08,377
Eh. I wouldn't wait.

1702
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:13,179
You know, world's full
of lonely people

1703
01:36:13,181 --> 01:36:15,183
afraid to make the first move.

1704
01:36:22,559 --> 01:36:25,394
Yeah, I'll finish this
tomorrow.

1705
01:36:36,338 --> 01:36:40,340
You know, Doc, something's been
eating at me this whole trip.

1706
01:36:40,342 --> 01:36:42,311
Hmm?

1707
01:36:43,713 --> 01:36:46,681
That Titsburgh
was a major disappointment.

1708
01:36:46,683 --> 01:36:48,549
I didn't notice
any difference at all.

1709
01:36:48,551 --> 01:36:50,216
Did you?

1710
01:36:50,218 --> 01:36:52,220
Good night, Tony.

1711
01:37:03,231 --> 01:37:05,532
- Good evening.
- Welcome, welcome.

1712
01:37:05,534 --> 01:37:07,269
Come on in.

1713
01:37:09,572 --> 01:37:12,609
All righty.

1714
01:37:14,443 --> 01:37:16,276
Welcome, Mr. Shirley.

1715
01:37:16,278 --> 01:37:18,378
Graham Kindell.
I'm the general manager.

1716
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:19,647
It is a pleasure to meet you.

1717
01:37:19,649 --> 01:37:21,381
Thank you, Mr. Kindell.

1718
01:37:21,383 --> 01:37:22,750
This is Mr. Tony Vallelonga.

1719
01:37:22,752 --> 01:37:24,517
- Nice to meet you, Tony.
- How you doing?

1720
01:37:24,519 --> 01:37:26,186
Uh, let's keep the car
right here

1721
01:37:26,188 --> 01:37:27,487
in our "guest of honor" spot.

1722
01:37:27,489 --> 01:37:28,756
Right this way, gentlemen.

1723
01:37:28,758 --> 01:37:30,523
- Hmm. Nice.
- How was your drive up?

1724
01:37:30,525 --> 01:37:31,692
Oh, it was wonderful.

1725
01:37:31,694 --> 01:37:33,360
Good to hear. Good to hear.

1726
01:37:33,362 --> 01:37:34,795
Now, as you can imagine,
our Christmas show

1727
01:37:34,797 --> 01:37:36,529
is our biggest show
of the year,

1728
01:37:36,531 --> 01:37:38,766
and we are so happy
to have you here, Mr. Shirley.

1729
01:37:38,768 --> 01:37:40,266
So, if you need anything,

1730
01:37:40,268 --> 01:37:42,268
anything at all,
you let me know.

1731
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:44,537
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.
- Now, here we are.

1732
01:37:44,539 --> 01:37:48,475
We got about an hour
before showtime. Any questions?

1733
01:37:48,477 --> 01:37:49,810
Where's the restaurant?

1734
01:37:49,812 --> 01:37:51,746
Well, you continue
down the hall here, Tony,

1735
01:37:51,748 --> 01:37:53,748
to the right
and across the lobby.

1736
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:56,284
- Good luck. Break a leg.
- Thank you.

1737
01:37:57,987 --> 01:38:00,220
Well, he said we got an hour.

1738
01:38:00,222 --> 01:38:01,589
You must be starving, Doc.

1739
01:38:01,591 --> 01:38:03,660
Go ahead. I'll meet you there.

1740
01:38:29,518 --> 01:38:31,186
May we join you?

1741
01:38:31,854 --> 01:38:33,723
Mm. Go ahead.

1742
01:38:39,494 --> 01:38:40,761
Cocktail, gentlemen?

1743
01:38:40,763 --> 01:38:42,462
I'm good.

1744
01:38:42,464 --> 01:38:43,698
Three shots vodka.

1745
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:45,633
Oh.

1746
01:38:45,635 --> 01:38:47,868
Last show. Cold War over.

1747
01:38:47,870 --> 01:38:49,337
Time for truce.

1748
01:38:50,807 --> 01:38:52,807
Is Dr. Shirley
in his dressing room?

1749
01:38:52,809 --> 01:38:55,475
Yeah.
More like half a broom closet.

1750
01:38:55,477 --> 01:38:58,815
Tell you, I don't know
how he puts up with that shit.

1751
01:39:02,552 --> 01:39:06,620
Six years ago, in 1956,

1752
01:39:06,622 --> 01:39:09,322
Nat King Cole
was invited to perform

1753
01:39:09,324 --> 01:39:12,626
at the Municipal Auditorium
here in Birmingham.

1754
01:39:12,628 --> 01:39:15,629
Mr. Cole was the first Negro
asked to play

1755
01:39:15,631 --> 01:39:18,065
at a white establishment
in this city.

1756
01:39:18,067 --> 01:39:20,333
As soon as he started playing,
a group of men

1757
01:39:20,335 --> 01:39:22,504
attack him for playing
white people's music.

1758
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:26,506
They pull him off stage

1759
01:39:26,508 --> 01:39:28,609
and beat him badly.

1760
01:39:28,611 --> 01:39:31,513
Jesus Christ.

1761
01:39:34,382 --> 01:39:39,419
You asked me once
why Dr. Shirley does this.

1762
01:39:39,421 --> 01:39:41,521
I tell you.

1763
01:39:41,523 --> 01:39:44,692
Because genius is not enough.

1764
01:39:44,694 --> 01:39:48,396
It takes courage
to change people's hearts.

1765
01:39:55,403 --> 01:39:56,572
Thanks.

1766
01:39:57,874 --> 01:40:00,540
Thank you.

1767
01:40:00,542 --> 01:40:01,675
No?

1768
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:05,581
<i>Danke schön.</i>

1769
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:09,750
- Good evening.
- Can I help you?

1770
01:40:09,752 --> 01:40:11,286
Oh, um...

1771
01:40:14,422 --> 01:40:16,389
Um, there.
Some friends of mine.

1772
01:40:16,391 --> 01:40:19,294
Uh, y-you-you can't come
in here.

1773
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:29,770
- I understand, but...
- Hey. What's going on?

1774
01:40:29,772 --> 01:40:34,507
This... gentleman says that I'm
not permitted to dine here.

1775
01:40:34,509 --> 01:40:35,810
No, you don't understand.

1776
01:40:35,812 --> 01:40:37,477
He's playing tonight.
He's the main event.

1777
01:40:37,479 --> 01:40:39,479
- Come on.
- I-I'm sorry, but...

1778
01:40:39,481 --> 01:40:41,381
it is the policy
of the restaurant.

1779
01:40:41,383 --> 01:40:42,650
Everything all right?

1780
01:40:42,652 --> 01:40:44,450
Uh, no, it's not all right.

1781
01:40:44,452 --> 01:40:46,452
This guy's saying Dr. Shirley
can't eat here.

1782
01:40:46,454 --> 01:40:49,522
Oh, well, I apologize,
but...

1783
01:40:49,524 --> 01:40:51,926
these are long-standing
traditions, club rules.

1784
01:40:51,928 --> 01:40:53,493
I'm sure you understand.

1785
01:40:53,495 --> 01:40:55,729
No, I do not understand.

1786
01:40:55,731 --> 01:40:57,463
In 45 minutes,
I will be right up there

1787
01:40:57,465 --> 01:40:59,166
on that stage
entertaining your guests,

1788
01:40:59,168 --> 01:41:00,701
yet I can't eat here?

1789
01:41:00,703 --> 01:41:02,603
I'm sorry.

1790
01:41:02,605 --> 01:41:04,537
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me

1791
01:41:04,539 --> 01:41:05,973
the bozos in his band

1792
01:41:05,975 --> 01:41:08,742
and all these people
who came here to see him play,

1793
01:41:08,744 --> 01:41:11,411
they can eat here,
but the star of the show,

1794
01:41:11,413 --> 01:41:12,980
the-the parking spot of honor,
he can't?

1795
01:41:12,982 --> 01:41:15,481
I'm afraid not.

1796
01:41:15,483 --> 01:41:18,520
Well, he's gotta eat.
I mean, he's gotta have dinner.

1797
01:41:20,488 --> 01:41:22,488
Okay.
I'll tell you what.

1798
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:24,524
Why don't we bring something
to his dressing room, huh?

1799
01:41:24,526 --> 01:41:25,793
John, show him a menu.

1800
01:41:25,795 --> 01:41:27,027
No.

1801
01:41:27,029 --> 01:41:29,866
I'm not eating
in that storage room.

1802
01:41:31,499 --> 01:41:33,701
Okay, uh, well, if you prefer,

1803
01:41:33,703 --> 01:41:35,035
there's a very popular
establishment

1804
01:41:35,037 --> 01:41:36,904
right down the road,
the Orange Bird,

1805
01:41:36,906 --> 01:41:38,875
they'd be happy to feed you.

1806
01:41:41,210 --> 01:41:43,644
Doc, come here.

1807
01:41:43,646 --> 01:41:45,511
Just one second, one second.

1808
01:41:45,513 --> 01:41:48,649
You know what, maybe that
other place is better anyway.

1809
01:41:48,651 --> 01:41:50,718
I mean, the dinner rolls here
are like rocks.

1810
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:53,823
You just go over and...
you go over and come back.

1811
01:41:57,727 --> 01:41:59,727
It's the last show.

1812
01:41:59,729 --> 01:42:00,961
It's the bottom of the ninth.

1813
01:42:00,963 --> 01:42:02,696
Let's just get it over with,

1814
01:42:02,698 --> 01:42:05,465
and we can go home,
get away from these pricks.

1815
01:42:05,467 --> 01:42:06,800
Huh?

1816
01:42:06,802 --> 01:42:08,702
Ah, there you go.

1817
01:42:08,704 --> 01:42:11,007
The fish is wonderful tonight.

1818
01:42:16,012 --> 01:42:19,246
Either I eat in this room,

1819
01:42:19,248 --> 01:42:21,717
or I'm not performing tonight.

1820
01:42:25,554 --> 01:42:28,024
May I have a word with you?

1821
01:42:33,029 --> 01:42:34,697
No.

1822
01:42:39,869 --> 01:42:42,703
Mr. Villanueva,

1823
01:42:42,705 --> 01:42:44,805
you have to talk sense
to Mr. Shirley.

1824
01:42:44,807 --> 01:42:46,073
Please make him understand.

1825
01:42:46,075 --> 01:42:47,808
We're not insulting him
personally.

1826
01:42:47,810 --> 01:42:49,843
This is just the way
things are done down here.

1827
01:42:49,845 --> 01:42:51,779
Yeah, well,
he's not from down here.

1828
01:42:51,781 --> 01:42:53,914
Yeah, just-just ask him
to be reasonable.

1829
01:42:53,916 --> 01:42:55,549
I got 400 guests in there

1830
01:42:55,551 --> 01:42:56,784
expecting to be entertained
tonight.

1831
01:42:56,786 --> 01:42:59,019
And Dr. Shirley expects
to eat tonight.

1832
01:42:59,021 --> 01:43:01,724
Why can't you just make
an exception this one time?

1833
01:43:03,125 --> 01:43:05,726
Let me tell you a story.

1834
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:09,063
You ever hear of the
Boston Celtics basketball club?

1835
01:43:09,065 --> 01:43:10,097
- Yeah.
- Well...

1836
01:43:10,099 --> 01:43:11,732
those boys came through here

1837
01:43:11,734 --> 01:43:13,867
couple years ago
on a barnstorming tour, and...

1838
01:43:13,869 --> 01:43:15,736
seeing as they was
the world champions

1839
01:43:15,738 --> 01:43:18,038
of the league and all, we were
tickled to have them here,

1840
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:19,873
and we rolled out
the welcome wagon.

1841
01:43:19,875 --> 01:43:21,575
So, do you know what table

1842
01:43:21,577 --> 01:43:23,744
their big coon ate at
that night?

1843
01:43:23,746 --> 01:43:25,746
No.

1844
01:43:25,748 --> 01:43:28,882
I don't, either,
but it wasn't one of ours.

1845
01:43:28,884 --> 01:43:31,018
Now, let's cut the bullshit.

1846
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:32,920
Tell me what it's
gonna take, huh?

1847
01:43:32,922 --> 01:43:35,624
Say, uh, a hundred dollars,
you get your boy to play?

1848
01:43:37,626 --> 01:43:39,626
You think you can buy me?

1849
01:43:39,628 --> 01:43:41,562
With all due respect, sir,

1850
01:43:41,564 --> 01:43:44,131
you wouldn't be in a job like
this if you couldn't be bought.

1851
01:43:44,133 --> 01:43:46,133
Stop.

1852
01:43:46,135 --> 01:43:47,703
Tony.

1853
01:43:49,005 --> 01:43:50,773
It's all right.

1854
01:43:52,808 --> 01:43:57,580
I'll play if you want me to.

1855
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:12,059
All right.

1856
01:44:12,061 --> 01:44:13,796
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1857
01:44:15,064 --> 01:44:17,664
What do you mean,
"Let's get out of here"?

1858
01:44:17,666 --> 01:44:19,666
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

1859
01:44:19,668 --> 01:44:21,935
Don, don't do this. Now, you
signed a contract, and I...

1860
01:44:21,937 --> 01:44:24,171
I know you're the kind of man
who honors a contract.

1861
01:44:24,173 --> 01:44:26,206
Connie, Bill, everything's
gonna be fine. It's all right.

1862
01:44:26,208 --> 01:44:28,175
You got a show to do, mister.

1863
01:44:28,177 --> 01:44:29,943
You turn yourself around
right now, goddamn it!

1864
01:44:29,945 --> 01:44:32,046
Right now!

1865
01:44:32,048 --> 01:44:34,114
This is why you people
don't work down here.

1866
01:44:34,116 --> 01:44:36,083
'Cause you're unreliable,
you hear me?

1867
01:44:36,085 --> 01:44:39,555
I shipped that goddamn Steinway
in from Atlanta for you!

1868
01:44:46,762 --> 01:44:49,963
Tony, are you hungry?

1869
01:44:49,965 --> 01:44:52,701
Does Betty like butta... er?

1870
01:44:56,105 --> 01:44:59,640
<i>One, two...</i>

1871
01:45:36,779 --> 01:45:38,679
You a cop?

1872
01:45:38,681 --> 01:45:40,182
Do I look Irish?

1873
01:45:41,217 --> 01:45:42,783
What you want, baby?

1874
01:45:42,785 --> 01:45:44,184
Two Cutty Sarks, neat.

1875
01:45:44,186 --> 01:45:45,888
Coming up.

1876
01:45:52,761 --> 01:45:55,698
Mm. Whatever your
specialty is, we'll take it.

1877
01:45:56,765 --> 01:45:58,767
Two Orange Birds!

1878
01:46:10,779 --> 01:46:13,180
I like what you did
back there, Doc.

1879
01:46:13,182 --> 01:46:15,651
You stood up for yourself.

1880
01:46:17,253 --> 01:46:19,753
It's like what your friend,
the president, said.

1881
01:46:19,755 --> 01:46:22,222
"Ask not...

1882
01:46:22,224 --> 01:46:25,792
"your country
what you can do for it.

1883
01:46:25,794 --> 01:46:27,997
Ask what you do for yourself."

1884
01:46:29,064 --> 01:46:31,167
You know?

1885
01:46:32,735 --> 01:46:35,302
So, darling, what you do?

1886
01:46:35,304 --> 01:46:37,037
All dressed up like that.

1887
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:39,006
Nothing particularly important.

1888
01:46:40,809 --> 01:46:42,242
Shouldn't judge a man
by his clothes.

1889
01:46:43,312 --> 01:46:46,246
He's only the greatest
piano player in the world.

1890
01:46:46,248 --> 01:46:47,814
That right?

1891
01:46:47,816 --> 01:46:49,816
You good?

1892
01:46:49,818 --> 01:46:52,152
Don't be shy, Doc.

1893
01:46:52,154 --> 01:46:53,854
Tell her who you are.

1894
01:46:53,856 --> 01:46:55,289
Don't tell me nothing.

1895
01:46:55,291 --> 01:46:57,226
Show me.

1896
01:47:03,032 --> 01:47:04,967
Come on.

1897
01:48:51,073 --> 01:48:54,310
Yeah! Yeah!

1898
01:50:23,298 --> 01:50:25,365
That's how you break a key.

1899
01:50:28,036 --> 01:50:29,436
Oh, that was a good time.

1900
01:50:29,438 --> 01:50:31,438
I'd do that once a month
for free.

1901
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,073
You were unbelievable.

1902
01:50:33,075 --> 01:50:34,474
Hey, Tony.

1903
01:50:34,476 --> 01:50:37,310
I bet, if we leave right now,
we can make it.

1904
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:38,579
Make what?

1905
01:50:38,581 --> 01:50:41,316
Christmas Eve,
in New York City.

1906
01:50:45,755 --> 01:50:47,421
Oh, shit!

1907
01:50:57,166 --> 01:51:00,936
Don't ever flash
your wad of cash in a bar.

1908
01:51:09,612 --> 01:51:12,212
I knew you had a gun.

1909
01:51:13,282 --> 01:51:15,951
♪ No more heartaches

1910
01:51:17,085 --> 01:51:20,353

1916
01:51:37,105 --> 01:51:39,239
This could get bad, Doc.

1917
01:51:39,241 --> 01:51:40,507
Yes.

1918
01:51:40,509 --> 01:51:42,442
It's a shame we don't
have something

1919
01:51:42,444 --> 01:51:44,511
to protect us on our journey.

1920
01:51:44,513 --> 01:51:46,581
Oh, I know.

1921
01:51:46,583 --> 01:51:50,118
Why don't you put your lucky
rock up on the dash, Tony?

1922
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:53,520
Come on, Tony.
