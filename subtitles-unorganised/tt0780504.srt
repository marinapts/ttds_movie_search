1
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,316
There's a hundred thousand streets in the city.

2
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,487
Now, you give me a time and a place.

3
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:58,994
I give you a five-minute window,
anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours...

4
00:01:59,029 --> 00:01:59,995
No matter what.

5
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,043
Anything happens in either side of that,
then you are on your own.

6
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,046
Do you understand?

7
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,842
Good.

8
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,181
And you won't be able to reach
me on this phone again.

9
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,757
Hey, there you are!

10
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,093
She's down there.

11
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,137
Plain Jane boring, just like you asked for.

12
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,808
But, I dropped in 300 horses on the inside,
She's gonna fly.

13
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,894
You look like a zombie kid.
You get any sleep?

14
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,650
Can I offer you some Benzadrine,
Dextradine, Caffeine... Nicotine???

15
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:15,320
Oh, you don't smoke, that's right.
You're better off.

16
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,448
There she is!

17
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,620
Chevy Impala,
most popular car in the state of California.

18
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,999
No one will be looking at you.

19
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:55,462
<i>All units be advised,
possible 731 in progress.</i>

20
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,093
<i>10:10 shots fired at 421 South Alemida.</i>

21
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,486
<i>Car 52 what's you twenty?</i>

22
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:26,118
<i>Car 52 to dispatch, currently at ten pager on 7th,
ETA approximately one minute.</i>

23
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,065
<i>All unit be advised,

24
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,066
<i>Late model, silver Impala.</i>

25
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,863
<i>Car 16 to dispatch,</i>

26
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,115
<i>We sealed off south parameter
and moving on.</i>

27
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,899
- Which floor?
- 4th please.

28
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,286
Director wants to see a rollover.

29
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:30,537
You okay with that?

30
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:34,458
Remember, if you don't feel good;
Just abort the shot.

31
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:35,459
There's no shame in that,
alright?

32
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:39,296
You're doubling for the star.
It's not like you are A player or anything.

33
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:41,924
And I got you $500 more. Huh?

34
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:42,925
Of course we split that.

35
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,136
You okay? Ready to go?

36
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:47,804
Alright, I'm counting on you.

37
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,845
Oh Kid! That's fantastic.

38
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,846
Just fantastic!

39
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:31,223
Okay, how're you doing?

40
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:34,393
You okay?
Good, that was perfect.

41
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,139
Where should I put these?

42
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:38,016
In the kitchen. Thank you.

43
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,199
Scary.

44
00:17:58,162 --> 00:17:59,705
- Hey, You want a tooth-pick?
- Sure.

45
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,005
You want a glass of water?

46
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:09,965
Okay.

47
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:21,852
Thanks.

48
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,316
So, did you just moved to L.A?

49
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,612
No, I've been here for a while.

50
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,740
- You are just new here?
- Mm-hmm.

51
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,873
That's Benicio's father.

52
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,543
Where is he?

53
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,171
He's in prison.

54
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:53,550
What do you do?

55
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:57,513
I drive.

56
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,642
Like a limo driver?

57
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:04,228
No, like for movies.

58
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,358
Doing all those car chases and stuff?

59
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,610
Yeah.

60
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:12,611
Isn't that dangerous?

61
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,040
It's only part time.

62
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,002
- Mostly I work at the garage.
- Where?

63
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:31,630
Receda Boulevard.

64
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:41,598
I gotta go.

65
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,060
Well, thank you.

66
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,605
Thanks for the water.

67
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:50,691
Say bye.

68
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:35,777
Chicken Chow mein?
And, some peking duck.

69
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,362
Where are the chopsticks?

70
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:43,035
- Uh... the guy
- Go get 'em. I don't want that.

71
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,455
Chopsticks and a fortune cookie.

72
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,291
Put out the fucking cigrette,
I'm eating.

73
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,836
- Sorry.
- What's the matter with you?

74
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,969
You run a perfectly good business.
I don't know, why you wanna change that.

75
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,931
You know how much
my business made last year?

76
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:04,932
30 grand.

77
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:10,896
I can build a car in six months and
in six seconds these jerks write it off as a stunt

78
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,731
that won't even make it to the movie.

79
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:16,735
See, all I need is a hard used start car.

80
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:18,654
That's all.

81
00:21:18,689 --> 00:21:22,741
I figure we start off small town circuit;
We work our way up.

82
00:21:22,776 --> 00:21:25,494
Once we get to the show,
we are talking millions.

83
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,627
So, you still haven't give me your number.

84
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,048
Alright, 430,000 dollars.

85
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,049
Oh!

86
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:44,304
Mr. Ross, I wouldn't come to you with this.
Unless, I'm absolutely sure about it!

87
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,473
How can you be sure, Shannon.

88
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:49,268
What do you got that
the professional race team don't?

89
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,689
I got a driver.

90
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,191
You just told me there're half a dozen drivers.

91
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:57,192
Not like this one.

92
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,695
This kid is special.

93
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:02,656
Been working with him for a while,
I've never seen anybody like it.

94
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:05,784
If I had the money,
I'd back him myself.

95
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:06,785
Yeah, but you don't have the money.

96
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:12,624
Mr. Ross,
you put this kid behind the wheel...

97
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:13,625
There's nothing he cannot do.

98
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,049
What are you doing eating
chink food in my fucking restaurant?

99
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:23,886
What's a Jew doing running a pizzeria?

100
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:24,887
You remember Shannon?

101
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:30,601
Take a fucking hike.

102
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,144
I wanna talk to my partner.

103
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:36,773
Hah, I'm just fucking with you.

104
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,735
How're you doing Shannon.
How's the fucking leg?

105
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,488
I've paid my debt.

106
00:22:43,523 --> 00:22:47,159
I'll think about it. Okay?

107
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,994
But I wanna meet the kid first.

108
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:50,996
That's all I ask.

109
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,343
C'mon, I want you to meet somebody.

110
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:07,596
Whatever you do like about the car,
don't say anything.

111
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:09,223
I want to drive the price down a little bit.

112
00:23:09,258 --> 00:23:11,975
Kid, I want you to meet Mr. Bernie Ross.

113
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,645
Nice to meet you.

114
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,735
My hands are a little dirty.

115
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,863
So are mine.

116
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:32,287
- Good driving out there.
- Thanks.

117
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,168
So? What do you think?

118
00:23:38,203 --> 00:23:39,336
Do we get the 400?

119
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,549
I'll give you 300 for 70 percent.

120
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:47,886
Done!

121
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:54,476
You won't be sorry!

122
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,496
Hey pal, just drop it down here.
We're pushing it alright.

123
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,416
We wanna push her into number three.

124
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,668
- The car. Not you.
- Oh, good.

125
00:24:19,703 --> 00:24:22,129
- Hi...
- Hi.

126
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,258
- Uhh... You two know each other?
- Don't.

127
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,302
Oh, look at that.

128
00:24:28,337 --> 00:24:29,303
- We're neighbours.
- Neighbours, very good.

129
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:32,472
Well, we'll try to be neighbourly too.

130
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,411
You blinked.

131
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:56,371
What?

132
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:58,457
- Can I call a cab from here.
- Yeah, sure.

133
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:02,294
What am I talking 'bout.

134
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:05,672
You and the kid are neighbours, right.
He can take you.

135
00:25:05,707 --> 00:25:07,716
Oh, no.
I feel bad.

136
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,261
No, no... Don't even think twice about it.
He'll be happy to do it.

137
00:25:11,296 --> 00:25:12,262
He's a good guy.

138
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,518
You know, he walked into my shop here
about five or six years ago...

139
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:20,812
right out of the blue,
asking for a job.

140
00:25:20,847 --> 00:25:23,857
So, I put him to the test,
to see what he could do.

141
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:26,652
The kid is amazing.

142
00:25:26,687 --> 00:25:29,530
So, I hired him on the spot.
Boom!

143
00:25:29,565 --> 00:25:34,076
At about half the wages I normally pay.
He didn't even blink an eye.

144
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:37,204
Hey kid,
come over here for a sec will you.

145
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:41,041
And I have been exploiting him ever since.

146
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:44,753
Don't tell him.

147
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:48,173
Looks like we've bigger problem
than I thought.

148
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:51,301
We're gonna have to keep
the car here for a few days.

149
00:25:51,336 --> 00:25:55,389
So, I offered your services to take,
Benicio and Irene home.

150
00:25:55,424 --> 00:25:56,390
Would that be okay?

151
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,812
Yeah, sure.

152
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:07,234
I don't have wheels...
in my car.

153
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,445
It's one think you should know about me.

154
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,446
Well put the tyres on.

155
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:13,949
- You got about five minutes?
- Yeah.

156
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:38,891
Hey, do you wanna see something?

157
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:43,854
Yeah.

158
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:47,900
Okay.

159
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:46,602
You did good. We had a good time.

160
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:57,821
Me too.

161
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:06,330
Sorry, if I put you on the spot or anything.

162
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:07,915
It's okay.

163
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:33,565
I'm not doing anything this weekend.

164
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,365
If you wanna go out or something.

165
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,672
Don't worry about these bumps and bruises.
Thats easily replaceable.

166
00:31:20,707 --> 00:31:23,258
We coat a paint on there with sponsors detail.

167
00:31:23,293 --> 00:31:25,761
Look at the thread on the tyre,
still good huh, we are in business.

168
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,766
You paid 300 fucking grand for this piece of shit?

169
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,351
I paid for it.

170
00:31:32,386 --> 00:31:34,478
Out of my own pocket.

171
00:31:34,513 --> 00:31:35,479
This is just the shell.

172
00:31:35,514 --> 00:31:38,273
It's the inside that counts.
Not the outside.

173
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:39,399
Right, Shannon?

174
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:40,484
You are correct sir.

175
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:43,487
Fuck that shit. If I paid 300 for something.
I want everybody to see it.

176
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:44,488
Of course you do.

177
00:31:44,523 --> 00:31:46,698
Now this.

178
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:51,453
That is one motherfucking fine ass pussy mobile,
motherfucker!

179
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:53,580
Damn!

180
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:55,666
Shannon, sell him that car.

181
00:31:55,701 --> 00:31:59,044
He won't be able to find a pussy
in a whorehouse.

182
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:03,006
You know what?
This car will make you even good looking.

183
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,134
How's it going?

184
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:11,265
When's our first race?

185
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:14,935
Uhh, pretty soon.

186
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:17,688
You gonna be ready?

187
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:21,149
I hope so.

188
00:32:21,184 --> 00:32:22,150
Huh... I hope so.

189
00:32:22,185 --> 00:32:26,029
Hey no false modesty.
I got a lot of money on this.

190
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,117
Did Shannon ever tell you how we met?

191
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:35,164
I used to produce movies.

192
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:36,165
In the 80's.

193
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,169
Kinda like action films and sexy stuff.

194
00:32:40,204 --> 00:32:41,170
One critic called them 'European'.

195
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:44,131
I thought they were shit.

196
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,550
Anyway he arrange all the cars for me.
Did all the stunts.

197
00:32:46,585 --> 00:32:50,137
I liked him. I like having him around.

198
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:52,514
Eventhough, he'd overcharge the shit out of me.

199
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,268
His next business venture.

200
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,729
He got involved with some of Nino's friends.

201
00:32:58,764 --> 00:32:59,730
They didn't go for the overcharging bit.

202
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:03,025
They broke his pelvis.

203
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,402
He's never had a lot of luck.

204
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:11,450
The reason I'm telling you this is,
He's got a lot invested in you.

205
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:12,951
So do I.

206
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,288
So. You need anything...
You call me.

207
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:19,208
We're a team now.

208
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,670
I'm excited.
Let's get out of here.

209
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:26,715
Nino.

210
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:44,107
- You see the bad guy?
- Yeah.

211
00:33:44,142 --> 00:33:45,108
How can you tell?

212
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:49,905
'Cos he's a shark.

213
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:52,616
There's no good shark?

214
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:55,953
No... I mean, just look at him.

215
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,664
Does he look like a good guy to you?

216
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:53,719
That was my husband's lawyer.

217
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:56,930
He's coming home in a week.

218
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:24,977
You know, we're here celebrating.
Its a shameful thing...

219
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:28,105
what I did.

220
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:32,860
And I have a lot of making up to do,
to everyone.

221
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:40,909
But second chances are rare.

222
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:43,036
Right?

223
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:46,373
And that's worth celebrating.
Right?

224
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:53,046
So, I want to make a toast.
To that lady right there.

225
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:58,677
Thanks for staying.
I love you, Inny.

226
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,346
Salud.

227
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:14,336
Hey?

228
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:17,381
Hi.

229
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:26,807
Sorry about the noise.

230
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:32,437
I was gonna call the cops.

231
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,109
I wish you would.

232
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:42,823
You're getting heavier.

233
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:53,250
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Hi.

234
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,252
This guy has been telling a lot about you.

235
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:59,089
He says, you've been coming around and
helping out a lot.

236
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,759
Yeah? Helping out.
Is that right?

237
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:06,263
Is that right?

238
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:11,351
That's very nice.
That's nice of you.

239
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:13,437
- Than you.
- You're welcome.

240
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:19,234
- You drive for the movies?
- Yeah.

241
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:25,365
- I can take that.
- No, no. I got it.

242
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,663
Let mommy talk to her friend.

243
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:54,728
You have a good night.

244
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:33,892
You're Shannon's buddy, Right?

245
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:38,105
We met last year.

246
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:41,942
You drove me and my brother
back from palm springs.

247
00:40:46,655 --> 00:40:48,365
We hired another wing man.

248
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,743
I spend six months in jail and
my brother got himself killed.

249
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:58,000
I've got a sweet job coming up.

250
00:40:58,035 --> 00:40:59,001
How about this?

251
00:40:59,036 --> 00:41:00,002
You shut you mouth.

252
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:04,339
Or I'll kick your teeth down
your throat and i'll shut it for you.

253
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,516
Nice seeing you again.

254
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:34,054
Come here.

255
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:36,557
Don't be scared.

256
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:41,687
Look, don't tell mommy. Okay?

257
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:46,984
Okay, it's a secret between us boys.

258
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:50,821
Oh, fuck.

259
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:52,758
Who are they?

260
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,386
What the fuck are you gonna do?
You gonna go and beat them out for me?

261
00:43:56,421 --> 00:43:58,680
Huh, stunt guy.

262
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:02,351
Why the fuck do you
wanna know who they are?

263
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:18,200
There's some guy who want me to do a job for him,
But I'm not gonna do it.

264
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:24,998
What's the job?

265
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,377
He want me to rob a pawn shop in the valley.

266
00:44:30,963 --> 00:44:32,047
Why?

267
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:35,259
'Cos I owe them protection money,
for when I was in the inside.

268
00:44:35,294 --> 00:44:36,260
It's two thousand bucks.

269
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,561
And as soon as I got out.

270
00:44:39,596 --> 00:44:42,975
Oh, it's 5,000 bucks.
Oh, it's actually 10,000 dollars.

271
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,769
20,000 dollars,
tomorrow I don't know what it's gonna be.

272
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:50,149
What are you gonna do?

273
00:44:51,525 --> 00:44:53,152
That's a very good question.

274
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:58,907
They said they're gonna come after
Benicio and Irene next.

275
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:23,432
You okay?

276
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:26,560
You want something to drink?

277
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:32,524
What's that you got there?

278
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:36,695
Can I see?

279
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:51,835
- One of those man gave you this?
- Mmm-hm.

280
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,006
They told me not to loose it.

281
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,721
You want me to keep this for you?

282
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:04,932
Okay.

283
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:31,333
- How's Benice?
- Good.

284
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:38,632
You just saying that?

285
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:43,428
No, what do you mean?

286
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:50,060
I saw that Standard...

287
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:52,104
was in an accident.

288
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:53,397
Yeah.

289
00:46:57,734 --> 00:46:59,111
What happened?

290
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:04,366
He got beat up.

291
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,830
Why?

292
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:13,041
Just drunk kids.

293
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:26,471
You should come over.

294
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:30,976
You should come and see him.

295
00:47:38,817 --> 00:47:39,860
You wanna...

296
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:42,488
You wanna hear a story?

297
00:47:42,523 --> 00:47:44,865
- You wanna hear how mommy and me met?
- Yeah.

298
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:49,411
We're at a pary.

299
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:51,997
And she was nineteen years old.

300
00:47:52,032 --> 00:47:53,624
Seventeen.

301
00:47:53,659 --> 00:47:54,625
- You're not seventeen.
- I was.

302
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,044
Wow, so that's illegal.

303
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:04,343
Alright, so I illegally walked over
to a seventeen year old girl.

304
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:06,595
I walked up and I say...

305
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,931
"Hello Miss"

306
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:11,475
What is your name?

307
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:14,228
And she didn't say anything.

308
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,814
And I said, well...
My name's Standard Gabriel.

309
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:19,149
Then what did you said.

310
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:25,823
I said...

311
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:29,159
"Where's the deluxe version"

312
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:41,129
Oh, man, that killed me.

313
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:47,135
And then a year later,
you popped out man.

314
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:55,686
Best day of my life.

315
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:46,236
Where we're going afterwards.

316
00:49:46,271 --> 00:49:48,780
I give you a five-minutes when we get there.

317
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:52,326
Anything happens in that five minutes
and I'm yours no matter what.

318
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:53,327
Anything a minute either side of that...

319
00:49:53,362 --> 00:49:55,913
then you are on your own.

320
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,499
I don't sit in while you're running it down;

321
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:00,459
I don't carry a gun...

322
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:02,669
I drive.

323
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:04,338
You look like you are hard to work with.

324
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:07,257
Not as long as we understand each other.

325
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:10,511
What's there to understand?

326
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:12,304
I cannot do this thing alone.

327
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:13,305
You got Blanche.

328
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,306
C'mon man.

329
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:18,644
She's beautiful,
Look at her.

330
00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:23,482
What the fuck are you rolling your eyes at for?

331
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:27,319
You know get the fuck out of here.

332
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:28,445
Get up!

333
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,948
Standard, take her with you,
and go get her a fucking coke.

334
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:39,331
Okay, here's the deal.

335
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,001
This much for Blanche,

336
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:48,090
This much for that asshole...
Minus what he owes me.

337
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:51,718
And this much for you.

338
00:50:56,056 --> 00:50:57,349
You're still interested?

339
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:00,811
Good!

340
00:51:00,846 --> 00:51:01,812
Anything else?

341
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:05,399
When you get your money,

342
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,692
His debt's paid.

343
00:51:06,727 --> 00:51:07,693
His out for good.

344
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:11,238
You never go near his family ever again.

345
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:14,408
Do you understand?

346
00:51:18,871 --> 00:51:20,247
To my family.

347
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:21,790
To my new friend.

348
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,296
And toast to the future.

349
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:31,216
Our future.

350
00:51:56,408 --> 00:51:57,493
I'll see you in five minutes.

351
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:05,459
See you in four.

352
00:56:44,905 --> 00:56:46,532
How much did Cook said,
we're gonna get?

353
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:51,703
40 grand.

354
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:01,797
Stay here.

355
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:23,193
When was the last time you saw your husband?

356
00:57:27,573 --> 00:57:29,491
Can you answer... the question?

357
00:57:39,835 --> 00:57:40,586
Hello?

358
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:42,379
Benicio, is that you?

359
00:57:42,414 --> 00:57:43,380
Yeah.

360
00:57:46,884 --> 00:57:47,968
Your mother there?

361
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:52,723
Uh, she's sitting down...
talking to a police.

362
00:57:54,183 --> 00:57:56,810
Okay, just tell her I'm gonna call her back.
Okay?

363
00:57:56,852 --> 00:57:58,812
Okay, bye.

364
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:12,493
<i>He's been identified as Standard Gabriel,</i>

365
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:16,830
<i>Other details are unclear but...</i>

366
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:20,167
<i>the owner of the pawn shop, told the reporter
that Gabriel acted alone.</i>

367
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:22,711
<i>And that, the items he had stolen
has been recovered.</i>

368
00:58:45,859 --> 00:58:47,319
If he saw you take the money...

369
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:50,656
and saw you get in the car;

370
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:54,868
Then why didn't they say anything?

371
00:58:57,037 --> 00:58:58,330
I have no idea.

372
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,469
Did you have any idea that
there would be a second car?

373
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:20,018
I already told you, I didn't.

374
00:59:26,108 --> 00:59:28,152
Now, you've just got
a little boy's father killed.

375
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,155
And you almost got us killed.

376
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:34,032
And now, you are lying to me.

377
00:59:34,067 --> 00:59:36,160
So, how about this?

378
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:43,083
From now on,
every words out of your mouth is the truth.

379
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:45,627
Or I'm gonna hurt you.

380
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:49,047
Do you understand?

381
00:59:50,215 --> 00:59:51,967
Now, what did Cook tell you?

382
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:55,762
He said there'd be another car hold us up.

383
00:59:55,797 --> 00:59:58,348
But he didn't say anything about all these money.

384
00:59:58,383 --> 01:00:01,602
He didn't say anything about anyone
getting killed.

385
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:04,563
And he was gonna rip us off?

386
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,322
What's his real name?

387
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:15,782
He said it's Chris...
But I just call him Cook.

388
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:24,208
You're gonna take me to him...
Right now.

389
01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:27,961
Do you understand?

390
01:00:27,996 --> 01:00:30,380
Yeah.

391
01:03:56,837 --> 01:03:59,298
This guy Cook,
he have a real name?

392
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:01,800
Chris.

393
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:04,970
Maybe.

394
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:09,933
I'll ask Bernie,
see if he knows him.

395
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:14,062
Jesus!
I can't stop thinking about...

396
01:04:14,097 --> 01:04:15,689
what we could do with all that dough.

397
01:04:15,724 --> 01:04:17,316
- Would you stop?
- Alright!

398
01:04:17,351 --> 01:04:19,568
You know, a lot of guys messing around
with married women...

399
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:23,155
but you're the only one I know who robs a joint,
to pay back the husband.

400
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:25,282
Crazy!

401
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:27,284
Don't worry about it.

402
01:04:27,326 --> 01:04:29,077
I'll take care of it.

403
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:02,194
Where's Cook?

404
01:05:02,229 --> 01:05:03,529
He's in the dressing room.

405
01:05:04,947 --> 01:05:06,031
Where's that?

406
01:05:07,491 --> 01:05:08,659
It's over there.

407
01:05:28,428 --> 01:05:29,763
You're a fucking dead man.

408
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:40,023
Whose money do I have?

409
01:05:41,692 --> 01:05:43,277
Don't worry...
they're gonna come and get it.

410
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:47,698
Call them.

411
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:49,366
Somebody call Nino.

412
01:06:01,587 --> 01:06:02,588
Do you remember this?

413
01:06:27,321 --> 01:06:28,113
Hello?

414
01:06:29,698 --> 01:06:30,449
Nino?

415
01:06:30,491 --> 01:06:33,410
No, sorry pal.
Why don't you call back later, we're closed.

416
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:37,372
I could, but I think Nino would be upset
that you made him wait.

417
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,459
Can I ask what this is about?

418
01:06:40,494 --> 01:06:43,128
I have something of his.

419
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:45,714
And that would be?

420
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:48,467
A million dollars.

421
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:51,136
Please hold.

422
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,521
Nino: You have something that
fucking belongs to me.

423
01:07:06,568 --> 01:07:07,611
Seems that way.

424
01:07:10,864 --> 01:07:13,158
And you're calling me...

425
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,535
Why?

426
01:07:16,537 --> 01:07:18,455
You're expecting to buy my own shit back from you?

427
01:07:18,497 --> 01:07:19,873
I'm not selling it.

428
01:07:19,915 --> 01:07:23,585
I'm gonna give you a time and place,
and you're gonna come and get it.

429
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:25,879
Do you Understand?

430
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:29,174
What are you getting out of it?

431
01:07:30,843 --> 01:07:31,760
Just that.

432
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,555
"Out of it."

433
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:37,182
And your partners are happy with that?

434
01:07:39,685 --> 01:07:40,978
I don't have any partners.

435
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:46,066
You discuss this with anybody else?

436
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:49,027
No, just with you.

437
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:52,823
You're not very good at this.
Are you?

438
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:47,628
Can I talk to you for a minute?

439
01:08:49,713 --> 01:08:51,173
I can't talk, I have to go.

440
01:08:54,676 --> 01:08:56,345
Can I just walk with you... for?

441
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:19,326
I have to tell you something.

442
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:28,460
Standard was into some...

443
01:09:28,495 --> 01:09:32,881
guys in prison for a lot of money.

444
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:38,053
And it would ruin you and benicio
if he wouldn't pay it.

445
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:43,559
He asked me for my help.

446
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:49,565
It just went wrong, you know.

447
01:09:53,152 --> 01:09:54,069
I'm sorry.

448
01:09:59,825 --> 01:10:00,909
I still got the money.

449
01:10:05,664 --> 01:10:07,374
You can have it, if you wanted to.

450
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:12,462
You can take Benicio... and.

451
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:26,685
I just thought,
we could get out of here. If you wanted.

452
01:10:30,689 --> 01:10:31,815
I could come with you.

453
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:37,863
I could look out for you.

454
01:10:43,285 --> 01:10:45,787
Sorry... uh... wrong floor.

455
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:11,618
He came into my apartment, Shannon.

456
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:15,414
How did they know where I live?

457
01:14:18,458 --> 01:14:19,209
I told you,
I was gonna call Bernie.

458
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:20,669
I just want him know that...

459
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:23,839
that it wasn't about that,
you are not interested in the money.

460
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:25,007
And that you just did it for the girl.

461
01:14:34,057 --> 01:14:36,101
You told him about Irene!!!

462
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:43,442
I just wanted him to know that...

463
01:14:43,477 --> 01:14:46,737
as soon as you return the money,
that was the end of it.

464
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:49,907
I didn't know.
How was I suppose to know that?

465
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:51,408
Okay?

466
01:14:52,284 --> 01:14:53,577
Look, let me just talk to Bernie...
Okay?

467
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:57,998
Why did you have to fuck everything up, Shannon?

468
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:00,542
How was I suppose to know that?

469
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:08,509
They're gonna come looking for me.

470
01:15:08,675 --> 01:15:09,718
And they're gonna come for you.

471
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:11,845
Do you understand?

472
01:15:12,054 --> 01:15:14,264
You gotta get out of here.

473
01:15:14,299 --> 01:15:15,432
And you gotta get out now.

474
01:15:17,476 --> 01:15:19,895
Listen to me.
Listen to me, Shannon.

475
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:23,774
You get out of here and you never fucking come back.

476
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:27,236
You never come back.

477
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:34,618
What are you gonna do?

478
01:15:52,136 --> 01:15:53,762
I already gave you my advice.

479
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:57,558
You should've taken the money,
and left the guy alone.

480
01:15:57,599 --> 01:15:58,934
It's just not that simple Bernie.

481
01:15:58,976 --> 01:16:01,645
No! Of course not!
Now everything's bounced up in your face!

482
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:05,149
You know, I owe you this guy.
Just give me a little time and I'll get rid of him.

483
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:07,359
Shut the fuck up.

484
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:09,444
You fucking monkey!

485
01:16:10,445 --> 01:16:14,741
The money, belongs to some half-assed wise guy,
out of Philly. Now...

486
01:16:14,776 --> 01:16:15,909
I got tipped off...

487
01:16:15,951 --> 01:16:19,705
he was stashing a million bucks in a pawn shop;
He's gonna invest it here in L.A.

488
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,082
He was gonna set up a rival operation.

489
01:16:22,124 --> 01:16:24,751
So, you stole from the east-coast mob?

490
01:16:24,786 --> 01:16:27,296
No! I stole from some jump up punk.

491
01:16:28,088 --> 01:16:29,840
He was trying to step on our action.

492
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:33,886
Yeah... then why didn't you come to me,
before you set up this dummy robbery?

493
01:16:35,804 --> 01:16:37,389
Before you hire this piece of shit.

494
01:16:37,431 --> 01:16:40,642
This was something on the side, Bernie.
I didn't wanna involve you on this.

495
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:42,227
Well, I'm involved now!

496
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,106
Let me tell you something...

497
01:16:46,148 --> 01:16:53,864
If anybody finds out you stole
from the family, we are both dead.

498
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:55,741
What fucking family?

499
01:16:57,117 --> 01:16:59,328
The family who still calls me a fucking kike?

500
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:02,289
To my face!

501
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:08,545
You know, I'm fifty nine years old Bernie,
they still pinched my cheek like I'm some fucking kid.

502
01:17:10,589 --> 01:17:11,548
Family.

503
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:14,343
The money flows up, easy.

504
01:17:14,378 --> 01:17:16,261
You know that.

505
01:17:17,638 --> 01:17:19,389
That's why this driver's gotta go, Bernie.

506
01:17:21,225 --> 01:17:22,059
He's gotta go.

507
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,186
And your pal, Shannon.

508
01:17:24,228 --> 01:17:27,689
It's these two guys,
that can tie me to this robbery.

509
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:10,107
Now, it's your turn to clean up after me.

510
01:19:14,379 --> 01:19:16,048
All this priceless cars...

511
01:19:16,089 --> 01:19:18,258
One would think you'd have better locks.

512
01:19:22,888 --> 01:19:24,181
Doors is always open to you.

513
01:19:24,223 --> 01:19:26,058
Going somewhere?

514
01:19:32,189 --> 01:19:33,607
I was thinking about it.

515
01:19:35,067 --> 01:19:36,693
I'm looking for your driver.

516
01:19:39,154 --> 01:19:41,490
You breaking in here,
I figure its bad news.

517
01:19:41,532 --> 01:19:42,866
No, Shannon.

518
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:44,701
It's bad luck.

519
01:19:45,661 --> 01:19:49,122
Two thousand heist a year in this city,

520
01:19:49,157 --> 01:19:51,250
he has to pick the wrong one.

521
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:53,460
He tried to put it right.

522
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:55,712
Well, he picked the wrong guy for that too.

523
01:19:55,754 --> 01:19:59,800
My partner is a belligerent asshole,
with his back against the wall.

524
01:20:01,385 --> 01:20:02,678
Right now, so am I.

525
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:06,181
If I don't set this straight,
I'm in big trouble.

526
01:20:10,227 --> 01:20:12,104
Any idea where he might be?

527
01:20:15,732 --> 01:20:16,817
Mexico.

528
01:20:16,852 --> 01:20:19,611
Or maybe it was Balise.

529
01:20:23,115 --> 01:20:24,241
Really?

530
01:20:31,123 --> 01:20:33,542
I was excited about this whole thing.

531
01:20:34,543 --> 01:20:36,044
My name on a car!

532
01:20:37,129 --> 01:20:38,922
I mean, look how beautiful.

533
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:42,301
I wanted to see my name on this thing.

534
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:47,055
I think we would've made a go with this business.

535
01:21:03,197 --> 01:21:04,031
Don't worry.

536
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:05,032
Don't worry.

537
01:21:05,067 --> 01:21:05,866
That's it.

538
01:21:05,901 --> 01:21:09,536
It's done.
There is no pain, its over. Its over.

539
01:28:41,864 --> 01:28:43,824
I think this has gone on long enough.

540
01:28:45,617 --> 01:28:47,744
You see any reason for this to continue?

541
01:28:49,872 --> 01:28:51,582
What do you say we meet?

542
01:28:54,877 --> 01:28:56,378
Why would I wanna do that?

543
01:28:57,963 --> 01:28:58,755
Well...

544
01:28:58,797 --> 01:29:02,509
You, me and your girlfriend
are the only players left.

545
01:29:02,551 --> 01:29:04,761
How's that for a reason?

546
01:29:07,264 --> 01:29:08,182
When?

547
01:29:09,224 --> 01:29:10,267
Tomorrow.

548
01:29:11,602 --> 01:29:12,769
There's a place on Sherman Way...

549
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:15,022
there's a restaurant called "The Great Wall".

550
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:15,898
You know it?

551
01:29:16,857 --> 01:29:18,108
I'll find it.

552
01:29:45,052 --> 01:29:46,303
Can I talk to you?

553
01:29:49,556 --> 01:29:50,933
I won't keep you long.

554
01:29:56,188 --> 01:29:58,023
I have to go somewhere now.
I don't think I can come back.

555
01:30:10,369 --> 01:30:14,414
Just getting to be around you...
was the best thing that ever happened to me.

556
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:08,218
Did you bring the money?

557
01:31:14,808 --> 01:31:16,351
Here's what I'm prepared to offer...

558
01:31:17,644 --> 01:31:19,480
You give me the money,
the girl is safe.

559
01:31:20,606 --> 01:31:23,775
Forever, nobody knows about it.
She's off the limits.

560
01:31:26,028 --> 01:31:27,863
I can't offer you the same.

561
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:31,158
So, this is what I would suggest.

562
01:31:32,618 --> 01:31:34,453
We conclude our deals...
we shake hands.

563
01:31:35,829 --> 01:31:37,789
You'll start the rest of you life.

564
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:44,588
Any dreams you have,
plans or hopes for the future;

565
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:47,591
I think you got to put that on holds.

566
01:31:49,259 --> 01:31:51,553
For the rest of your life,
you're gonna be looking over your shoulder.

567
01:31:51,595 --> 01:31:55,766
I'm just telling you this,
'cos I want you to know the truth.

568
01:31:57,601 --> 01:31:58,936
But the girl is safe.
