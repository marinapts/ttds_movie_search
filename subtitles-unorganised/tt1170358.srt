1
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,268
- Watch it.
- Sorry, Darling.

2
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:06,473
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

3
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,382
Come here.

4
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,213
Mind if I join you?
Can I have the same?

5
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:57,422
I should introduce myself, my name is Gandalf.

6
00:02:58,423 --> 00:03:01,426
- Gandalf the Grey.
- I know who you are.

7
00:03:02,327 --> 00:03:07,332
Well, now, this is a fine chance.

8
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:12,336
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?

9
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:20,444
I received word that my Father had been seen
wondering the wild near Dungland

10
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:25,449
I went looking,
found no sign of him.

11
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:30,454
Thorin, It's been a long time since
anything but rumor was heard of Thrain.

12
00:03:30,554 --> 00:03:34,258
He still lives.
I am sure of it.

13
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:42,266
My father came to see you
before he went missing.

14
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:43,467
What did you say to him?

15
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:46,470
I urged him to march upon Erebor.

16
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,473
To rally the seven armies of the dwarves.

17
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:53,376
To destroy the dragon and take back
the lonely mountain.

18
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:59,282
And I would say the same to you,
take back your homeland.

19
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:06,289
This is no chance meeting, is it, Gandalf?

20
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,091
No. It is not.

21
00:04:10,092 --> 00:04:16,399
The lonely mountain troubles me, Thorin.
That dragon has sat there long enough.

22
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:21,404
Sooner or later the darker
minds would turn towards Erebor.

23
00:04:21,504 --> 00:04:26,312
I ran into some unsavoury characters while I was
traveling amongst the green road,

24
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:31,313
- they mistook me for a vagabond.
- No matter, they regretted that.

25
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:33,615
One of them was carrying a message.

26
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:39,321
This is Black speach

27
00:04:40,522 --> 00:04:44,326
- A promise of payment.
- For what?

28
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:47,529
Your head.

29
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,532
Someone wants you dead.

30
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:57,438
Thorin, you can wait no longer,
you are the heir to the throne of Durin.

31
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:04,445
Unite the army's of the dwarves.
Together you have the might and power to retake Erebor.

32
00:05:04,545 --> 00:05:09,315
Summon a meeting of the seven dwarf families.
Demand they stand by their oath

33
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,555
The seven armies swore that oath to the
one who wields the king's jewel, the Arkenstone.

34
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:20,460
It is the only thing that will unite them, and in case you have
forgotten, that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

35
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:27,468
What if I were to
help you reclaim it.

36
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:33,574
Oh. The Arkenstone lies half a world away.

37
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:38,378
- Buried beneath the feet of a fire breathing dragon.
- Yes, that's right.

38
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:41,581
That is why we're going to need a burglar...

39
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:46,386
12 MONTHS LATER

40
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:36,835
Re-sync & translation:
ArthurM

41
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,608
How close to the pack?
- To close.

42
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:48,646
Couple of leagues, no more, but that is not the worst of it.
- The orc's picked up our scent.

43
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:52,550
Not yet, but they will do. We've another problem.
- Did they see you?

44
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,052
They saw you.
- No, that's not it.

45
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:57,455
What did I tell you,
Quiet as a mouse.

46
00:06:57,655 --> 00:07:02,460
Exelent burglar material.
- Will you just listen!

47
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,662
I'm trying to tell you there is something else
out there.

48
00:07:06,664 --> 00:07:11,569
What form did it take, like a bear?

49
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,672
Y... Yes. But bigger, much bigger.

50
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:18,676
You knew about this beast?

51
00:07:19,476 --> 00:07:22,479
- I say we go back.
- And be run down by a pack of orcs?

52
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,788
- There is a house.

53
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:32,488
It's not far from here where we might take refuge.
- Who's house?

54
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:35,592
Friend or foe.
- Neither.

55
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:40,697
He will help us or he will kill us.

56
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:43,500
What choice do we have?

57
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:47,504
None.

58
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:56,612
Come on!

59
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:08,524
This way, quickly!

60
00:08:08,624 --> 00:08:10,626
Go!

61
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:13,629
Bombur, come!

62
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,735
To the house!

63
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:22,638
Run!

64
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:32,547
Come on, get inside!

65
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,661
Open the door!

66
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:48,863
Quickly!

67
00:08:58,573 --> 00:08:59,774
Push!

68
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,779
Come on!

69
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,685
What is that?

70
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:15,789
That is our host...

71
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,794
His name is Beorn.

72
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,699
And he's a skin changer.

73
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,804
Sometimes he is a huge black bear and sometimes
he's a great strong man.

74
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:36,609
The bear is unpredictable,
but the man can be reasoned with.

75
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:40,713
However, he is not overfund of dwarves.

76
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,718
- He's leaving.
- Come away from there!

77
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,721
It's not natural. None of it!

78
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,824
It's obvious, he's under some dark spell.

79
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,628
Don't be a fool. He's under no enchantment but his own.

80
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:01,834
Well, now, get some sleep, all of you.
You'll be safe here tonight.

81
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,641
I hope.

82
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:26,758
Attack them now.

83
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:29,861
Kill the dwarf filth while they sleep.

84
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:31,863
No

85
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,669
The beast stands guard.

86
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:45,777
We will kill them on the road.

87
00:10:57,788 --> 00:11:00,691
They are gathering in Dol Guldur.

88
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:04,895
The Master has summoned you!

89
00:12:48,095 --> 00:12:50,998
We grow in number.

90
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,902
We grow in strength.

91
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:57,805
You will lead my armies.

92
00:12:57,905 --> 00:12:59,907
What of Oakenshield?

93
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,013
War is coming.

94
00:13:06,914 --> 00:13:08,916
You promised me his head.

95
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:12,819
Death will come at all.

96
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:19,826
Do we call off the hunt?

97
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:25,031
Bolg!

98
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:41,047
I have a task for you.

99
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:46,052
Do you still thirst for Dwarf blood?

100
00:14:49,113 --> 00:14:52,916
So you are the one they call Oakenshield

101
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:58,922
Tell me, why is Azog the Defiler hunting you?

102
00:14:59,123 --> 00:15:05,128
- You know of Azog, how?
- My people were the first to live in the mountains.

103
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,033
Before the orcs came down from the north.

104
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:13,036
The defiler killed most
of my family.

105
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:20,143
But some he enslaved.
Not for work, you understand, but for the sport.

106
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:27,150
Caging skinchangers and torturing them
seemed to amuse him.

107
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:31,053
There are others like you?

108
00:15:31,954 --> 00:15:34,257
Once there were many.

109
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:36,058
And now?

110
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,162
Now there is only one.

111
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:45,968
You need to reach the mountains before the last day of
autumn.

112
00:15:46,068 --> 00:15:51,073
- Before Durin's day falls, yes.
- You're running out of time.

113
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:56,178
- Which is why we must go through Mirkwood.
- A darkness lies upon that forrest.

114
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,082
Foul things creep beneath those trees.

115
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:06,088
There is an alliance between the orcs of Moria and
the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.

116
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:10,292
I would not venture there,
except in great need.

117
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:15,997
- We will take the elven road. That path is still safe.
- Safe?

118
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:22,203
The woodelves of Mirkwood are not like their kin.
They're less wise and more dangerous.

119
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:26,107
But it matters not.

120
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:29,010
What do you mean?

121
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:35,116
These lands are crowling with orcs.
Their numbers are growing.

122
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:41,021
And you are on foot,
you will never reach the forest alive.

123
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:48,128
I don't like dwarves.

124
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:59,139
They are greedy and blind, blind
to the lives of those they deem lesser than their own.

125
00:17:05,145 --> 00:17:09,049
But orcs I hate more.

126
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:12,052
What do you need?

127
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:19,058
Go now, while you have the light.

128
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:23,062
Your hunters are not far behind.

129
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:48,287
The elven gate

130
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:52,291
Here lies our path through Mirkwood.

131
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:56,395
No sign of the orcs.
We have luck on our side.

132
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:08,106
Set the ponies loose,
let them return to their master.

133
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:17,115
This forest feels sick.
As if an disease lies upon it.

134
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:21,219
Is there no way around?

135
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:26,123
Not unless we go 200 miles north,
or twice that distance...

136
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:30,328
South.

137
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:50,347
Come back to me...

138
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:58,255
Something moves is the shadows unseen.

139
00:18:59,256 --> 00:19:02,259
Hidden from our sight.

140
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:05,362
Every day it grows in strength.

141
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:09,165
Beware the Necromancer...

142
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,169
He's not what he seems.

143
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:20,176
If our enemy has returned we must know.

144
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:24,180
Go to the tombs in the mountains.

145
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:28,184
The high fells.

146
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:33,389
So be it...

147
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:39,194
Not my horse, I need it.

148
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:44,199
- You're not leaving us.
- I would not do this unless I had to.

149
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:53,408
You've changed, Bilbo Baggins.

150
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,214
You're not the hobbit as one left the Shire.

151
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:02,417
I was going to tell you...

152
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:07,418
I...

153
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:12,419
...found something in the goblin tunnels

154
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:15,229
Found what?

155
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,334
What did you find?

156
00:20:23,537 --> 00:20:26,440
My courage.

157
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,445
Good. Well that's good!

158
00:20:32,546 --> 00:20:37,401
You'll need it.
I'll be waiting for you at the over-look.

159
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:42,256
Before the slips of Erebor.
Keep the map and key safe.

160
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,459
Do not enter that mountain without me.

161
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:59,472
This is not the Greenwood of old. The very air of the forest is heavy,
with illusion. It'll seek to enter your mind,

162
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:02,375
and lead you a strait
- Lead us a strait?

163
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:04,277
What does that mean?

164
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:11,484
You must stay on the path, do not leave it.
If you do, you'll never find it again.

165
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:17,490
No matter what comes, stay on the path!
- Come on we must reach the mountain...

166
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,393
...before the sun sets on Durin's day.
- Let's go.

167
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:23,496
It's our one chance to find the hidden door.

168
00:21:34,406 --> 00:21:35,607
The path turns this way.

169
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,334
This way.

170
00:22:11,642 --> 00:22:14,545
Air... I need air!

171
00:22:15,446 --> 00:22:19,350
My head, it's spinning, what's happening?

172
00:22:19,385 --> 00:22:22,553
Keep moving.
Dori?

173
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:26,457
- Why Have we stopped?
- The path, it's disappeared.

174
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,561
- What's going on?
- We've lost the path.

175
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:32,528
Find it!

176
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:35,566
All of you, look...
Look for the path!

177
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:50,580
I don't remember this,
none of it is familiar.

178
00:23:15,122 --> 00:23:16,200
Attercop...

179
00:23:43,732 --> 00:23:46,635
Look... A tobacco pouch.

180
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:49,502
There's dwarves in these woods.

181
00:23:49,537 --> 00:23:54,442
Dwarves from the blue mountains,
this is exactly the same as mine.

182
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:55,643
Because it is yours.

183
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:58,746
You understand? We're going around in circles,
we are lost.

184
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:01,449
We're not lost, we keep heading east.

185
00:24:01,484 --> 00:24:03,068
But which way is east?

186
00:24:03,103 --> 00:24:04,652
We've lost the sun.

187
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:11,759
The sun... We have to find the sun...

188
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:16,664
Up there.
- We need to...!

189
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:26,473
What's that? Enough! Quiet!

190
00:24:26,573 --> 00:24:28,575
All of you...

191
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,578
We're being watched...

192
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,727
I can see a lake...

193
00:25:22,628 --> 00:25:27,633
...and a river, and the Lonely mountain!

194
00:25:28,634 --> 00:25:30,635
We're almost there!

195
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:33,538
Can you hear me?

196
00:25:34,739 --> 00:25:36,841
I know which way to go.

197
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:41,646
Hello?

198
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:52,657
Hello.

199
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:07,772
No, no!

200
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:54,675
Their hide is tough...
There's good juice inside...

201
00:27:55,676 --> 00:28:04,785
- Stick it again, stick it again!
- Finish it! It's alive! Kill 'em, kill 'em now, let us feast.

202
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:11,792
Feast... Feast... Feast...

203
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:20,701
What is it?

204
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:31,711
Fat and juicy...

205
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,716
Just a little taste.

206
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:49,729
Where is it?
Where is it?

207
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,831
Here.

208
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:55,935
It stings!
Stings!

209
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,742
Sting?

210
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,944
That's a good name.

211
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,947
Sting.

212
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,769
- Alright...
- Where's Bilbo?

213
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,370
- Bilbo.
- I'm up here!

214
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:08,805
Come on!

215
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,112
Where is it... Where is it!

216
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:17,914
Where is it?

217
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:41,838
No!

218
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:45,041
Gloin kill him!

219
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:47,043
Kill them all!

220
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:53,849
You die!

221
00:31:18,573 --> 00:31:19,874
Mine.

222
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:59,012
Come on, keep up!

223
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:21,935
Do not think I won't kill you, dwarf.

224
00:32:22,135 --> 00:32:24,137
It would be my pleasure.

225
00:32:28,941 --> 00:32:30,143
- No!
- Kili!

226
00:32:49,061 --> 00:32:50,162
Throw me a dagger!

227
00:32:50,963 --> 00:32:51,263
Quick!

228
00:32:52,164 --> 00:32:55,867
You think I'm giving you a wapon, dwarf?
You're mistaking.

229
00:33:01,973 --> 00:33:05,177
Search them.

230
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:10,947
Give it back! That's private!

231
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:13,284
Who is this?
Your brother?

232
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:15,186
That is my wife.

233
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:21,993
- And what is this horrid creature? A goblin mutant?
- That's my lad, Gimli.

234
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:29,000
Yeah...

235
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,101
Are the spiders dead?

236
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:32,203
Yes, but more will come.

237
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:35,206
They're growing bolder.

238
00:33:43,113 --> 00:33:46,116
This is an ancient Elvish blade.

239
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:50,220
Forged by my kin.

240
00:33:53,223 --> 00:33:54,224
Where did you get this?

241
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,326
It was given to me.

242
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,033
Not just a thief but a liar as well.

243
00:34:03,233 --> 00:34:07,037
Take them!

244
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:11,041
- Thorin where Bilbo?
- Let's go!

245
00:34:23,152 --> 00:34:24,153
Close the gate.

246
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:29,216
Aren't you going to search me?

247
00:35:30,318 --> 00:35:34,321
- I could have anything down my trousers...
- Or nothing.

248
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,433
Why does the dwarf stare at you,
Tauriel?

249
00:35:47,134 --> 00:35:52,339
Who can say?
He's quite tall for a dwarf.

250
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,942
- Do you not think?
- Taller than some...

251
00:35:57,344 --> 00:35:59,346
...but no less ugly.

252
00:36:10,457 --> 00:36:12,358
Leave it!

253
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:16,162
There is no way out.
This is no orc dungeon.

254
00:36:16,262 --> 00:36:19,165
These are the halls of the woodland realm.

255
00:36:19,265 --> 00:36:21,132
No one leaves here...

256
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:23,369
...but by the king consent.

257
00:36:27,373 --> 00:36:31,177
Some may imagine a noble quest is at hand.

258
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:36,382
A quest to reclaim a homeland,
and slay a dragon.

259
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:42,387
I myself suspect a more prosec motive...

260
00:36:43,188 --> 00:36:48,193
Attempted burglary, or something of that ilk.

261
00:36:50,495 --> 00:36:56,501
You have found a way in.
You seek that which would be stole upon you the right to rule.

262
00:36:58,203 --> 00:37:00,305
The king's jewel.

263
00:37:00,405 --> 00:37:02,407
The Arkenstone.

264
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:07,412
It is precious to you beyond measure.

265
00:37:09,214 --> 00:37:11,316
I understand that.

266
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:15,319
There are gems in the mountain
that I too desire...

267
00:37:16,421 --> 00:37:20,324
White gem's, pure starlight.

268
00:37:20,424 --> 00:37:23,327
I offer you my help.

269
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,333
- I am listening.
- I will let you go.

270
00:37:30,434 --> 00:37:33,337
If you but return what is mine.

271
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,443
A favor for a favor...
- You have my word.

272
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:43,347
One king to another.

273
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:56,259
I would not trust Thranduil, the great king,
to honor his word, should the end of all days be upon us!

274
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,462
You have a lack of honor!

275
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:03,466
I've seen how you treat
your friends.

276
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:09,272
We came to you once, starving,
homeless, seeking your help.

277
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:15,978
But you turned your back.
You turned away from the suffering of my people.

278
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:21,283
The infernal that destroyed us!

279
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:26,388
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.
I know it's rot and ruin.

280
00:38:30,593 --> 00:38:35,297
I have faced the great serpents of the north.

281
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:41,703
I warned your grandfather
of what his greed would summon.

282
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:45,507
But he would not listen.

283
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:51,413
You are just like him.

284
00:38:54,416 --> 00:39:01,422
Stay here if you will, and rot.
A hundred year is a near blink in the life of an elf.

285
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:06,527
I'm patience. I can wait.

286
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:17,538
- Did he offer you a deal?
- He did.

287
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,042
I've told he could go...

288
00:39:22,077 --> 00:39:25,446
And can all his kin.

289
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:27,548
Well, that's that then.

290
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,452
The deal was our only hope.

291
00:39:35,355 --> 00:39:36,557
Not our only hope.

292
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:46,466
I know you're there.

293
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:50,370
Why do you linger in the shadows?

294
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:54,439
I was coming to report to you.

295
00:39:54,474 --> 00:39:57,677
I thought I ordered that nest to be destroyed
not two months past.

296
00:39:58,378 --> 00:40:03,082
We cleared the forrest as ordered my lord,
but more spiders keep coming up from the south.

297
00:40:03,383 --> 00:40:06,486
They are swarming from the ruins in Dol Guldur.
If we could kill them at their source...

298
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:11,591
That fortress lies beyond our borders,
keep our lands clear of those foul creatures. That is your task.

299
00:40:12,391 --> 00:40:13,558
And when we drive them of?

300
00:40:13,593 --> 00:40:16,595
What then? Will they not spread to other lands?

301
00:40:16,696 --> 00:40:18,697
Other lands are not my concern.

302
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:27,406
The fortunes of the world will rise and fall.
But here in this kingdom we will endure.

303
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:33,412
Legolas said you fought well today.

304
00:40:37,516 --> 00:40:39,618
He's grown very fond of you.

305
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:47,425
I assure you my lord, Legolas thinks of me as
no more than a captain of the guard.

306
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:49,427
Perhaps he did once.

307
00:40:50,528 --> 00:40:52,630
Now I'm not so sure.

308
00:40:56,534 --> 00:41:01,539
I do not think you would allow your son to
pledge himself to a lonely Sindrin elf.

309
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:04,442
No, you're right. I would not.

310
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:07,545
Still, he cares about you.

311
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:10,548
Do not give him hope where there is none.

312
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:23,560
The gates are guarded.
Not all of them... Follow me!

313
00:41:49,486 --> 00:41:52,488
The stone in your hand,
What is it?

314
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:56,492
It is a talisman.

315
00:41:59,595 --> 00:42:03,599
A powerfull spell lies upon it,
if any but a dwarf reads the runes on the stone...

316
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,702
...it would be forever cursed.

317
00:42:12,508 --> 00:42:14,610
Or not...

318
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:17,713
Depending whether or not you believe in that kind of thing.
It's just a token.

319
00:42:20,716 --> 00:42:22,618
A ruin stone.

320
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,822
My mother gave it to me so I'd remember
my promise.

321
00:42:28,724 --> 00:42:29,725
What promise?

322
00:42:30,726 --> 00:42:33,628
That I will came back to her.

323
00:42:34,629 --> 00:42:36,531
She worries.

324
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:39,534
She thinks I'm wreckless.

325
00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:40,735
Are you?

326
00:42:54,749 --> 00:42:58,553
Sounds like quite a party they're having up there.

327
00:42:58,753 --> 00:43:00,755
It is Mereth Aderthad

328
00:43:01,556 --> 00:43:03,658
The feast of starlight.

329
00:43:04,659 --> 00:43:06,761
All light is sacred to the Elda.

330
00:43:07,661 --> 00:43:10,664
But woodelves love best, the light of the stars.

331
00:43:11,765 --> 00:43:14,568
I always thought it is a cold light.

332
00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:17,771
Remote, and far away.

333
00:43:18,772 --> 00:43:20,774
It is a memory.

334
00:43:21,775 --> 00:43:23,777
Precious and pure.

335
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:29,783
Like your promise.

336
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:40,794
I have walked there sometimes...

337
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:44,597
...beyond the forest and up into the night.

338
00:43:45,899 --> 00:43:48,801
I've seen the world fall away.

339
00:43:49,802 --> 00:43:53,606
And the white light forever fill the air.

340
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:58,711
I saw a fire moon once...

341
00:44:00,613 --> 00:44:05,718
It rose over the path near Dunland, it was huge.
Red and gold it was and it filled the sky.

342
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:14,626
We run an escort with some merchants from Ered Luin,
they were trading in silver work. We took the green way south.

343
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:18,730
Keep the mountains to our left.
And then it appeared.

344
00:44:18,831 --> 00:44:22,834
This huge firemoon. Lighting above.

345
00:44:29,941 --> 00:44:32,844
These empty barrels should have
been sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.

346
00:44:33,645 --> 00:44:37,849
The bargeman has been waiting for them.

347
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,851
Excelent tasty wine...

348
00:44:40,852 --> 00:44:45,657
Come, Elros, try it.
- No, I have the dwarves in my charge.

349
00:44:45,757 --> 00:44:47,859
They're locked up, where can they go?

350
00:44:51,863 --> 00:44:56,667
I think that the sun is on the rise,
must be nearly dawn.

351
00:44:56,767 --> 00:44:58,869
We're never gonna reach the mountain, are we?

352
00:45:01,872 --> 00:45:04,875
Not stuck in here, you're not.

353
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,783
Bilbo.

354
00:45:14,785 --> 00:45:16,887
There are guards nearby.

355
00:45:36,005 --> 00:45:40,910
- Come this way, Ori.
- Not that way, down here.

356
00:45:42,812 --> 00:45:43,913
Easy thou.

357
00:45:58,928 --> 00:45:59,829
This way...

358
00:46:03,832 --> 00:46:05,934
Come on.
- I dont believe it we're in their cellars!

359
00:46:06,735 --> 00:46:10,438
You're supposed to lead out not, not further in.
- I know what I'm doing.

360
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:12,741
Come on, this way.

361
00:46:15,944 --> 00:46:19,948
Everyone, into the barrels,
quickly!

362
00:46:20,048 --> 00:46:26,755
- Are you mad? They'll find us.
- No, no, they won't! I promise you. Please, you must trust me.

363
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,762
Do as he says.

364
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:51,979
What do we do now?

365
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,747
Hold your breath.

366
00:46:54,782 --> 00:46:56,784
Hold my breath? What do you mean?

367
00:47:22,008 --> 00:47:23,910
Where is the keeper of the keys?

368
00:47:50,136 --> 00:47:53,038
Welcome, master Baggins.

369
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:55,941
Come on, Let's go.

370
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,051
Hold on!

371
00:48:28,973 --> 00:48:30,975
No! Help me.

372
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,980
Shut the gate!

373
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:44,088
Quick shut the gate!

374
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:47,892
Do not let them escape.

375
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,103
No!

376
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:13,016
Watch out!

377
00:49:28,597 --> 00:49:31,134
Slay them all!

378
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,036
Get onto the bridge!

379
00:49:46,048 --> 00:49:46,949
Kili!

380
00:50:11,673 --> 00:50:12,573
Kili!

381
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,081
Kili.

382
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,099
Kill her! Kill the She-Elf!

383
00:51:03,223 --> 00:51:07,327
Stop fighting!
After them!

384
00:51:08,528 --> 00:51:13,233
Follow them!

385
00:51:13,734 --> 00:51:16,036
Killi?

386
00:52:39,217 --> 00:52:40,119
Dori!

387
00:52:52,329 --> 00:52:54,331
Come along!

388
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:02,339
Catch!

389
00:54:37,431 --> 00:54:41,435
Tauriel,
wait!

390
00:54:42,236 --> 00:54:46,440
Tis one we keep alive.

391
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:51,344
After them! Cut the off!

392
00:56:37,548 --> 00:56:40,641
Oh it's you!
- Why am I here Gandalf?

393
00:56:40,642 --> 00:56:44,942
Trust me, Radagast.
I would not have called you here without good reason.

394
00:56:49,459 --> 00:56:51,661
This is not a nice place to meet.

395
00:56:52,362 --> 00:56:55,465
Not...
It is not.

396
00:56:56,867 --> 00:56:58,635
These are dark spells, Gandalf.

397
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:03,673
Old, and full of hate.
Who's buried here?

398
00:57:04,474 --> 00:57:07,577
If he had a name,
it's long since been lost.

399
00:57:08,377 --> 00:57:12,682
He would have been known only,
as a servant of evil.

400
00:57:14,684 --> 00:57:18,387
One of a number.

401
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,492
One of nine.

402
00:57:26,495 --> 00:57:28,497
Why now Gandalf?
I don't understand.

403
00:57:28,597 --> 00:57:33,502
- The Ringwraiths have been summend to Dol Guldur.
- But it can not be the Necromancer.

404
00:57:33,602 --> 00:57:37,506
A human sorcerer could not sommun such evil.

405
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,609
Who said it wat human?

406
00:57:40,709 --> 00:57:47,363
The Nine only answer to one master.
We've been blind, Radagast.

407
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:52,364
And in our blindness the enemy has returned.

408
00:57:54,622 --> 00:57:57,425
He's summoning his servants.

409
00:57:57,525 --> 00:57:59,527
Azog the Defiler...

410
00:57:59,627 --> 00:58:01,529
...is no ordinary hunter.

411
00:58:01,629 --> 00:58:09,537
He's a commander. A commander of legions.
The enemy is preparing for war.

412
00:58:10,738 --> 00:58:15,643
It will begin in the east.
His mind it set upon that mountain.

413
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:16,544
We're you going?

414
00:58:16,644 --> 00:58:19,112
- To rejoin the others
- Gandalf?

415
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:21,328
I started this...

416
00:58:21,549 --> 00:58:26,453
...we cannot forsake them, they all live in great danger.
- If what you say it true...

417
00:58:26,553 --> 00:58:29,456
...the world is in grave danger.

418
00:58:29,556 --> 00:58:35,462
The power, in that fortress,
will only grow stronger.

419
00:58:35,562 --> 00:58:38,465
You want me to cast my friends aside?

420
00:58:41,568 --> 00:58:44,671
- Anything behind us?
- Not that I can see!

421
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:52,579
- I think we've rode down the orc!
- Not for long. We've lost the current.

422
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:54,681
Bombur is half drowned!

423
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:58,685
Make for the shores!
Come on, let's go!

424
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:05,691
Come on.

425
00:59:06,692 --> 00:59:08,694
Move.

426
00:59:18,604 --> 00:59:19,705
I'm fine.
It's nothing.

427
00:59:20,606 --> 00:59:23,709
Get on your feet.
- Kili's wounded. His leg needs binding.

428
00:59:23,809 --> 00:59:26,612
There's an orc-pack on our tail.
We keep moving.

429
00:59:26,712 --> 00:59:29,615
- To where?
- To the mountain, we're so close.

430
00:59:29,815 --> 00:59:32,718
A lake lies between us and that mountain.

431
00:59:33,518 --> 00:59:34,584
We have no way to cross it.

432
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:38,723
- So the we go around.
- The orcs will run us down. As sure as daylight.

433
00:59:38,824 --> 00:59:41,526
We have no wapons to defent ourselves.

434
00:59:41,626 --> 00:59:45,530
Bind his leg, quickly.
We have two minutes.

435
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:08,552
Do it again,
and you're dead!

436
01:00:10,755 --> 01:00:16,560
Excuse me, but uhm...
You're from Laketown, if I'm not mistaking.

437
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:22,666
That barge over there,
could it be available fore hire, by any chance?

438
01:00:24,568 --> 01:00:26,570
What makes you think that would help you?

439
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:31,575
Those boots have seen better days.
As has that coat.

440
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:33,777
No doubts you have some
hungry mouths to feed.

441
01:00:33,812 --> 01:00:35,779
How many?

442
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:41,885
A boy and two girls.
- And your wife, I imagine, she's a beauty.

443
01:00:43,686 --> 01:00:46,589
Ay, she was.

444
01:00:49,592 --> 01:00:53,796
- Oh sorry, I didn't mean to...
- Come on, enought of the niceties.

445
01:00:54,597 --> 01:00:55,698
What's your hurry?

446
01:00:55,798 --> 01:00:57,600
What's it to you?

447
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,702
I would like to know who you are.

448
01:00:59,802 --> 01:01:02,605
What you are doing in these land.

449
01:01:02,705 --> 01:01:04,807
We are simple merchants
from the blue mountains.

450
01:01:04,907 --> 01:01:08,611
Journeying to see our kin
in the Iron hills.

451
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:11,779
Simple merchants, you say.

452
01:01:11,814 --> 01:01:14,817
We need food, supplies, weapons.

453
01:01:15,617 --> 01:01:16,819
Can you help us?

454
01:01:20,823 --> 01:01:23,725
I know where these barrels came from.

455
01:01:28,224 --> 01:01:29,224
...but I don't think it ended well.

456
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:35,240
No one enters Laketown but by lead of the master

457
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:38,741
All his welth comes from trade
with the Woodland Realm.

458
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,744
He wouldn't see an alliance before
risking the wrath of king Thranduil.

459
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:50,752
I wage there ways to
enter that town unseen.

460
01:01:50,852 --> 01:01:52,754
Ay...

461
01:01:52,954 --> 01:01:57,658
But for that,
you would need a smuggler.

462
01:01:57,758 --> 01:01:59,860
For which we would pay double.

463
01:02:05,766 --> 01:02:07,868
Keep moving!

464
01:02:07,968 --> 01:02:10,676
Such is the nature of evil.

465
01:02:11,077 --> 01:02:16,877
Out there in the vast, ignorance of the world,
it fastens and spreads.

466
01:02:16,912 --> 01:02:18,779
A shadow that grows in the dark.

467
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:24,685
A sleepless malice as black
as the oncoming wall of night.

468
01:02:25,886 --> 01:02:30,891
So it ever was.
So will it always be.

469
01:02:31,691 --> 01:02:35,760
In time all foul thing come forth.

470
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:38,798
You were tracking a company of thirteen dwarves.

471
01:02:38,898 --> 01:02:42,902
- Why?
- Not thirteen, not anymore.

472
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:47,707
The young one,
the black head archer.

473
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,710
We stuck him with a morgul shaft.

474
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:56,716
The poison is in his blood.
He'll be choking on it soon.

475
01:02:56,816 --> 01:03:01,720
- Answer the question, filth.
- I do not answer to dogs, She-Elf!

476
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:06,274
I would not antagonise her.

477
01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:08,727
You like killing things, Orc?

478
01:03:08,927 --> 01:03:10,729
You like death?

479
01:03:12,329 --> 01:03:14,733
- Then let me give it to you!
- Enough!

480
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,835
Tauriel, leave!

481
01:03:16,935 --> 01:03:18,737
Go now!

482
01:03:28,947 --> 01:03:32,951
I do not care about one dead dwarf.
Answer the questions.

483
01:03:33,051 --> 01:03:39,757
You have nothing to fear.
Tell us what you know, and I will set you free.

484
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:44,962
You had all this to kill them.
Why? What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

485
01:03:45,763 --> 01:03:49,000
The dwarf never rant never be king.

486
01:03:49,001 --> 01:03:52,201
King? There is no king under the mountain, nor will there ever be.

487
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,972
None would dare enter Erebor...

488
01:03:55,773 --> 01:03:57,975
...whilts the dragon lives.
- You know nothing.

489
01:03:58,776 --> 01:04:03,781
Your world will burn...
- What are you talking about?

490
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:04,947
Speak!

491
01:04:04,982 --> 01:04:07,885
Our time, has come again.

492
01:04:07,985 --> 01:04:12,789
My master serves the one.

493
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:18,194
Do you understand now, elfling?
Death is upon you.

494
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:22,999
The flames of war are upon you!

495
01:04:25,401 --> 01:04:26,868
Why did you do that?

496
01:04:26,903 --> 01:04:28,805
You promised to set him free.

497
01:04:28,905 --> 01:04:30,907
And I did.

498
01:04:31,007 --> 01:04:34,911
I freed his dreadful head from
his miserable shoulders.

499
01:04:36,012 --> 01:04:38,815
There was more the or could tell us.

500
01:04:39,115 --> 01:04:41,217
There was nothing more he could tell me.

501
01:04:42,118 --> 01:04:44,821
What did he mean by "the flames of war"?

502
01:04:44,921 --> 01:04:50,826
It means they intend to unleash a weapon
so great it wil destroy all before it.

503
01:04:50,926 --> 01:04:54,029
I want the watch doubled to our borders, all roads, all rivers.

504
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:56,132
Nothing moves, but I hear of it.

505
01:04:56,832 --> 01:05:00,936
No one enters this kingdom,
and no one leaves it.

506
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:08,944
Close the gate!
Keep it sealed by order of the King.

507
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:11,346
What about Tauriel?

508
01:05:14,049 --> 01:05:16,952
- What about hier?
- She went into the forest...

509
01:05:17,352 --> 01:05:19,855
...armed with her bow and blade.

510
01:05:20,355 --> 01:05:21,456
She has not returned.

511
01:05:44,979 --> 01:05:47,081
Dwarf blood!

512
01:05:47,181 --> 01:05:51,986
They were here!
- There is another scent...

513
01:05:56,189 --> 01:05:57,891
Man flesh!

514
01:06:01,895 --> 01:06:05,098
They have found a way to cross the lake.

515
01:06:26,019 --> 01:06:27,020
Watch out!

516
01:06:35,928 --> 01:06:38,131
What are you trying to do?
Drown us?

517
01:06:38,231 --> 01:06:41,584
I was born and bred on these waters, master dwarf.

518
01:06:41,619 --> 01:06:44,937
If I wanted to drown you,
I would not do it here.

519
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,141
Oh I had enough of this lake-man.

520
01:06:49,942 --> 01:06:52,144
Let's say we throw him over the
side and be done with him.

521
01:06:52,244 --> 01:06:54,947
No, Bard...
His name is Bard.

522
01:06:54,948 --> 01:06:57,452
How do you know?
- I asked him!

523
01:06:57,453 --> 01:07:00,151
I don't care what he calls himself.
I don't like him.

524
01:07:00,152 --> 01:07:03,155
We do not have to like him,
we simply have to pay him.

525
01:07:03,255 --> 01:07:06,958
Come on now lads,
turn out your pockets.

526
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,961
How do we know he won't betray us?

527
01:07:10,062 --> 01:07:12,129
We don't.

528
01:07:12,164 --> 01:07:14,966
There is uhm... A problem.

529
01:07:15,267 --> 01:07:17,168
We're ten coins short.

530
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:22,173
Gloin, come on.
Give us all you have.

531
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:25,041
Don't look to me...

532
01:07:25,076 --> 01:07:28,579
I have been led dry by this venture.

533
01:07:28,614 --> 01:07:32,083
And what have I seen for my investment?

534
01:07:32,984 --> 01:07:35,987
None but misery and grief.

535
01:07:43,994 --> 01:07:46,096
Blessed my beard...

536
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:50,200
Take it...
Take all of it!

537
01:07:54,204 --> 01:07:58,208
- The money, quick, give it to me.
- We wil pay you when we get out but not before.

538
01:07:58,243 --> 01:08:00,310
If you value you freedom
you do as I say.

539
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:03,213
There are guards ahead.

540
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,131
What's he doing?

541
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:24,233
He's talking to someone.

542
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,237
He's pointing right at us.

543
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:34,143
- Now they're shaking hands.
- What?

544
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:36,245
He's selling us out!

545
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:00,068
Quiet!

546
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:05,273
We're approaching the tollgate.

547
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:21,189
Hold! Goods inspection!
Papers please.

548
01:09:21,289 --> 01:09:24,293
- Oh, it's you Bard.
- Morning Percy.

549
01:09:24,294 --> 01:09:26,093
Anything to declare?

550
01:09:26,094 --> 01:09:31,399
Nothing! But I am cold and tired.
Ready for home.

551
01:09:35,202 --> 01:09:41,108
There we are, all in order.
- Not so fast.

552
01:09:41,208 --> 01:09:46,213
Consignment of empty barrels
from the Woodland realm.

553
01:09:46,313 --> 01:09:53,525
Only... They're not empty. Are they, Bard?

554
01:09:53,526 --> 01:09:58,026
If I recall correctly, you're licensed as a bargeman.

555
01:09:58,225 --> 01:10:02,129
Not a fishermen.

556
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:04,231
That's none of your business!

557
01:10:04,331 --> 01:10:08,435
No, it's the masters' business.
Which makes it my business.

558
01:10:09,135 --> 01:10:12,138
Come on Alfrid, have a heart.
People need to eat.

559
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:14,340
These fish are illegal.

560
01:10:15,341 --> 01:10:19,145
Empty the barrels over the side.
- You've heared them, in the canal.

561
01:10:20,246 --> 01:10:22,348
Come on.

562
01:10:22,448 --> 01:10:24,350
Folk in this town are struggling.

563
01:10:25,151 --> 01:10:29,155
Times are hard. Food is scarce.
- That's not my problem.

564
01:10:29,255 --> 01:10:32,258
But when the people hear the master
is dumping fish back in the lake,

565
01:10:32,358 --> 01:10:35,361
when the rioting starts,

566
01:10:37,761 --> 01:10:39,265
will it be your problem then?

567
01:10:43,369 --> 01:10:45,170
Stop..

568
01:10:48,373 --> 01:10:53,381
Ever the people's champion, ay, Bard?
Protector of the common folk.

569
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:56,582
You might have their favor now,
bargeman, but it won't last.

570
01:11:00,285 --> 01:11:02,187
Rise the gate!

571
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:09,394
The master has his eyes on you.
You do well to remember. We know where you live.

572
01:11:10,195 --> 01:11:14,299
It's a small town, Alfrid,
everyone knows where everyone lives.

573
01:11:30,314 --> 01:11:36,220
All these talk of civil unrest.
Someone has been stirring the pot, sire.

574
01:11:38,322 --> 01:11:39,323
Cold playing up, sire?

575
01:11:39,423 --> 01:11:44,228
It's the damp. It's the only possible explanation.
Get me a Brandy.

576
01:11:44,428 --> 01:11:47,331
The mood of the people, sire,
it's turning ugly.

577
01:11:47,431 --> 01:11:51,199
They're commoners, Alfrid,
they've always been ugly.

578
01:11:51,234 --> 01:11:55,438
It's not my fault that they live in a
place that stinks of fish oil and tar.

579
01:11:55,539 --> 01:11:58,241
Jobs, shelter...

580
01:11:58,341 --> 01:12:01,244
...food, it's all they ever pleat about.

581
01:12:01,344 --> 01:12:05,348
It's my blieve, sire,
they're being led on by troublemakers.

582
01:12:05,448 --> 01:12:09,452
Then we must find these troublemakers
and arest them.

583
01:12:10,253 --> 01:12:15,457
- My thought excactly, sire.
- And all this talk af change must be surpressed.

584
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:20,063
Can't afford te let them rebel band together
and start making noises.

585
01:12:20,098 --> 01:12:22,288
The next thing they do, they start...

586
01:12:22,323 --> 01:12:24,479
...asking questions, falling committees,

587
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:27,399
launching queries!

588
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,000
Out with the old, in with the new.

589
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,200
What?

590
01:12:31,473 --> 01:12:33,475
That's what they've been saying, sire.

591
01:12:33,576 --> 01:12:41,400
- There is even talk, of an election.
- An election? That's absurd. I won't stand for it.

592
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:44,286
I don't think they'd ask you to stand, sire.

593
01:12:49,288 --> 01:12:53,495
Rabble-rouser. Who would have
the nerve to question my authority.

594
01:12:54,296 --> 01:12:57,499
Who would dare? Who...

595
01:13:01,403 --> 01:13:02,504
Bard.

596
01:13:03,404 --> 01:13:08,509
You mark my words, that trouble making
bargeman is behind all this.

597
01:13:16,417 --> 01:13:17,918
Get your hands off me.

598
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,527
You didn't see them.
They were never here.

599
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:30,431
The fish you can have for nothing.

600
01:13:32,433 --> 01:13:33,434
Follow me.

601
01:13:43,343 --> 01:13:47,347
Dad, our house, it's being watched.

602
01:14:22,581 --> 01:14:25,484
You can tell the master I'm done for the day.

603
01:14:26,485 --> 01:14:27,486
Dad.

604
01:14:27,686 --> 01:14:29,388
Where have you been?

605
01:14:29,488 --> 01:14:31,590
Father, there you are. I was worried!

606
01:14:32,491 --> 01:14:35,594
Yes, here.
Bain, get them in.

607
01:14:43,402 --> 01:14:47,606
If you speak of this to anyone,
I'll rip your arms off.

608
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:52,000
Get off.

609
01:14:53,445 --> 01:14:54,500
Up there!

610
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:05,523
Dad? Why are there dwarves climbing out of our toilet?

611
01:15:05,623 --> 01:15:08,526
Will they bring us luck?

612
01:15:10,728 --> 01:15:13,631
They may not be the best fit,
but it'll keep you warm.

613
01:15:13,731 --> 01:15:16,534
Thank you.

614
01:15:26,543 --> 01:15:28,645
A dwarvish wind lance...

615
01:15:29,446 --> 01:15:30,647
You look like you've seen a ghost.

616
01:15:31,748 --> 01:15:36,453
He has, the last time we say such a weapon...

617
01:15:37,554 --> 01:15:39,656
...a city was on fire.

618
01:15:39,756 --> 01:15:42,559
It was the day the dragon came.

619
01:15:45,662 --> 01:15:49,566
The day that Smaug destroyed Dale.

620
01:15:51,468 --> 01:15:53,570
Girion, the lord of the city...

621
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:56,538
...rallied his bowman to fire upon the beast.

622
01:15:56,573 --> 01:16:01,477
But a dragon hide is tough.
Tougher than the strongest armour.

623
01:16:01,678 --> 01:16:05,381
Only a black arrow,
fired from a wind lance...

624
01:16:05,382 --> 01:16:06,382
...could have pierced the dragons hide.

625
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:10,586
And few of those arrows were ever made.

626
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:19,995
His stock was running low
when Girion made his last stand.

627
01:16:27,603 --> 01:16:30,606
If the aim of the man,
would have been true that day...

628
01:16:31,607 --> 01:16:33,508
...uch would have been different.

629
01:16:37,612 --> 01:16:39,514
You speak as if you were there.

630
01:16:40,715 --> 01:16:42,617
All dwarves know the tale.

631
01:16:43,518 --> 01:16:45,520
Then you would know that
Girion hit the dragon.

632
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:49,624
He loosen a scale under the left wing.
One more shot and he would have killed the beast.

633
01:16:51,526 --> 01:16:54,529
That's a fairy story lad, nothing more.

634
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:56,831
You took our money.

635
01:16:57,832 --> 01:17:00,535
Where are the weapons?

636
01:17:01,736 --> 01:17:04,639
Wait here.

637
01:17:17,651 --> 01:17:21,655
Tomorrow begins the last day of autumn.
- Durin's day falls morning after next.

638
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:24,357
We must reach the mountain before then.

639
01:17:24,658 --> 01:17:25,659
And if we do not?

640
01:17:25,759 --> 01:17:28,662
If we fail to find the hidden door
before that time?

641
01:17:28,697 --> 01:17:30,564
Then this quest has been for nothing.

642
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,876
What is this?

643
01:17:43,877 --> 01:17:47,645
A pike hook.
Made from an old harpoon.

644
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,884
And this?
- A crowbill, we call it fashion from a smithy's hammer

645
01:17:51,684 --> 01:17:56,589
It's heavy in hand, but in defense of your life,
these will serve you better than none.

646
01:17:56,689 --> 01:17:58,791
We payed you for weapons.

647
01:17:59,692 --> 01:18:02,595
Iron forged swordes and axes!

648
01:18:02,695 --> 01:18:03,596
It's a joke.

649
01:18:05,698 --> 01:18:07,800
You won't find better outside the city armoury.

650
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:10,703
All iron forged weapons are held
there witch lock and key.

651
01:18:10,803 --> 01:18:11,704
Thorin,

652
01:18:12,805 --> 01:18:14,707
Why don't we take this offer and go?

653
01:18:14,907 --> 01:18:15,808
I have done with less,

654
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:17,710
so have you.

655
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:22,513
I say we leave now.
- You're not going anywhere.

656
01:18:22,714 --> 01:18:23,615
What did you say?

657
01:18:23,715 --> 01:18:26,818
There's spies wathing this house
and probably every dog and wolf in the town.

658
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,722
You must wait till nightfall.

659
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:49,741
Thorin?

660
01:19:00,751 --> 01:19:02,753
Dad?

661
01:19:04,855 --> 01:19:05,856
Don't let them leave.

662
01:19:31,781 --> 01:19:33,683
I thought you were an Orc.

663
01:19:33,783 --> 01:19:37,400
If I were an orc you would be dead.

664
01:19:38,788 --> 01:19:39,789
Tauriel,

665
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:43,693
You can not hunt thirty orcs on your own.

666
01:19:43,893 --> 01:19:45,695
But I'm not on my own.

667
01:19:46,796 --> 01:19:47,897
You knew I would come.

668
01:19:49,899 --> 01:19:54,704
The king is angry Tauriel.
For six hundred years my father has protected you.

669
01:19:54,904 --> 01:19:57,807
Favorited you.
You deviate his orders.

670
01:19:57,842 --> 01:20:00,710
You betrayed his trust.

671
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:02,812
Come back with me...

672
01:20:02,912 --> 01:20:04,614
...he will forgive you.

673
01:20:04,615 --> 01:20:05,914
But I will not.

674
01:20:05,915 --> 01:20:08,917
If I go back, I will not forgive myself.

675
01:20:09,818 --> 01:20:12,555
The king has never let orc filth from our lands...

676
01:20:12,556 --> 01:20:15,923
That he would let this orc pack cross
our borders and kill our prisoners.

677
01:20:15,924 --> 01:20:18,727
It is not our fight.
- It is our fight.

678
01:20:19,828 --> 01:20:24,332
It will not end here.
With every victory this evil will grow.

679
01:20:24,733 --> 01:20:27,500
If your father has his way,
we will do nothing.

680
01:20:27,501 --> 01:20:32,400
We will hide within our walls,
live our lives awayfrom the light.

681
01:20:32,841 --> 01:20:33,942
And let the darkness descend.

682
01:20:35,944 --> 01:20:38,847
Are we not part of this world?

683
01:20:38,947 --> 01:20:42,951
Tell me, friend,
when did we let evil become stronger than us?

684
01:20:48,856 --> 01:20:50,958
Hello Bard,
where are you after?

685
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:57,965
There was a tapestry, an old one. Where is it gone?
- What tapestry are you talking about?

686
01:20:58,866 --> 01:20:59,967
This one.

687
01:21:00,468 --> 01:21:03,468
There were dwarves I tell you,
apeared out of nowhere.

688
01:21:03,469 --> 01:21:07,269
Full beards, their size.
I've never seen them like.

689
01:21:07,775 --> 01:21:09,777
What are dwarves doing in these parts?

690
01:21:09,977 --> 01:21:12,181
It's the prophecy.
- Prophecy?

691
01:21:12,182 --> 01:21:14,682
The prophecy of Durin's folk.

692
01:21:22,889 --> 01:21:25,792
Prophecy?

693
01:21:27,894 --> 01:21:28,895
Prophecy.

694
01:21:28,995 --> 01:21:30,797
The old tales will come true...
- Vast halls of treasure!

695
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:34,901
Can it really be true?

696
01:21:35,001 --> 01:21:37,403
Has the lord of silver fountains returned?

697
01:21:38,004 --> 01:21:42,809
The lord of silver fountains, the king of carven stone.

698
01:21:45,011 --> 01:21:46,112
The king beneath the mauntain,

699
01:21:48,014 --> 01:21:49,815
shall come into his own.

700
01:21:51,117 --> 01:21:55,821
And the bells shall ring in gladness
at the mountain kings return.

701
01:21:56,822 --> 01:22:02,027
But all shall fail in sadness
and the lake will shine and burn.

702
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:07,032
Dad, I tried to stop them.
- How long have they been gone?

703
01:22:13,038 --> 01:22:14,141
Keep it down...

704
01:22:14,142 --> 01:22:16,542
As soon as we have the weapons,
we make straight for the mountain.

705
01:22:16,942 --> 01:22:17,943
Go, go, go.

706
01:22:36,963 --> 01:22:40,064
You're right?
- I can manage.

707
01:22:40,965 --> 01:22:42,867
Let's just get out of here.

708
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,882
Run!

709
01:23:26,209 --> 01:23:28,912
What is the meaning of this?

710
01:23:29,012 --> 01:23:30,914
We caught the stealing weapons, sire.

711
01:23:32,015 --> 01:23:34,219
Enemies of the state.

712
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:35,220
I gues they're a bunch of mercenaries,
if ever there was, sire.

713
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,122
Hold your tongue.

714
01:23:41,224 --> 01:23:43,926
You do not know
to whom you speak.

715
01:23:44,126 --> 01:23:46,129
This is no common criminal...

716
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:51,430
...this is Thorin,
son of Thrain, son of Thror.

717
01:23:54,036 --> 01:23:57,139
We are the dwarves of Erebor.

718
01:23:58,941 --> 01:24:01,944
We have come, to reclaim our homeland.

719
01:24:07,049 --> 01:24:09,151
I remember this town
in the great days of old.

720
01:24:11,053 --> 01:24:15,156
Fleets of boats lay at harbour,
filled with silks and fine jems.

721
01:24:15,957 --> 01:24:20,161
This way no forsaken town on a lake,
this was the center...

722
01:24:20,962 --> 01:24:22,964
...of all trade in the north.

723
01:24:24,165 --> 01:24:28,572
I would see those days return.
Do we, like the great forgers of the dwarves,...

724
01:24:28,573 --> 01:24:33,373
send welths and riches flowing
once more from the halls of Erebor.

725
01:24:35,977 --> 01:24:39,480
Death!
That is what you'll bring upon us.

726
01:24:40,982 --> 01:24:43,084
Drago fire, and ruin.

727
01:24:45,086 --> 01:24:48,989
If you awaken that beast, it will destroy us all.

728
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:52,192
You can listen to this naysayer, but I promise you this.

729
01:24:55,295 --> 01:24:57,197
If we succeed...

730
01:24:58,198 --> 01:25:01,101
...all will share in the welth of the mountain.

731
01:25:05,205 --> 01:25:09,609
You will have enough gold te rebuilt Esgaroth ten times over!

732
01:25:11,713 --> 01:25:15,710
All of you, listen to me! You must listen.

733
01:25:15,711 --> 01:25:17,611
Have you forgotten what hapenned to Dale?

734
01:25:19,219 --> 01:25:22,121
Have you forgotten those who died in the firestorm?

735
01:25:24,324 --> 01:25:26,125
And for what purpose?

736
01:25:27,226 --> 01:25:29,857
The blind ambition of a mountain king.

737
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:34,258
So riven by grief,
he can not see beyond his own desire!

738
01:25:36,035 --> 01:25:41,840
We must not, any of us,
be to quick to lay blame.

739
01:25:43,042 --> 01:25:49,148
Let us not forget that it was Girion, lord of Dale,
your ancestor...

740
01:25:49,248 --> 01:25:52,051
...who failed to kill the beast!

741
01:25:54,353 --> 01:25:58,156
It's true, sire, we all know the story.

742
01:25:59,057 --> 01:26:04,062
Arrow after arrow he shot. Each one, missin it's mark.

743
01:26:10,368 --> 01:26:13,071
You have no right...

744
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:16,074
...no right to enter that mountain.

745
01:26:17,275 --> 01:26:19,277
I have the only right.

746
01:26:25,383 --> 01:26:28,286
I speak to the master of
the men of the lake.

747
01:26:29,187 --> 01:26:32,089
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?

748
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:33,291
Will you...

749
01:26:34,091 --> 01:26:37,294
...share the great welth of our people?

750
01:26:42,299 --> 01:26:46,103
What say you?

751
01:26:48,105 --> 01:26:52,210
I say onto you...

752
01:26:52,211 --> 01:26:53,211
...welcome!

753
01:26:54,111 --> 01:26:59,216
Welcome, embrace,
welcome, king under the mountain!

754
01:27:11,127 --> 01:27:12,529
You do know we're one short?

755
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:13,530
Where's Bofur?

756
01:27:13,531 --> 01:27:14,531
If he's not here, we leave him behind.

757
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:18,134
We'll have to. If we want to find the door before nightfall.

758
01:27:18,334 --> 01:27:21,137
We can risk no more delays.

759
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:25,341
Not you.

760
01:27:26,342 --> 01:27:28,344
We must travel at speed,
you will slow us down.

761
01:27:30,246 --> 01:27:31,647
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.

762
01:27:31,648 --> 01:27:32,448
Not now.

763
01:27:38,154 --> 01:27:39,355
I'm going to be there when that door is opened.

764
01:27:40,256 --> 01:27:43,258
When we first loop upon the halls of our fathers...
- Kili...

765
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,260
Stay here.

766
01:27:45,361 --> 01:27:49,463
Rest. Join us when you're healed.

767
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:58,173
I'm staying with the lad,
my duty lies with the woonded.

768
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,374
Uncle?

769
01:28:00,175 --> 01:28:01,276
We grew up with tales of the mountain.

770
01:28:02,177 --> 01:28:03,178
Tales you told us.

771
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,679
You can not take that away from him.

772
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:07,182
Fili
- I will carry him if i must!

773
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:09,284
One day you will be king and you will understand.

774
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,388
I can not rist the third of this quest
for the sake of one dwarf.

775
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:17,191
Not even my own kin.

776
01:28:20,294 --> 01:28:23,297
Fili, don't be a fool. You belong with the company.

777
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:25,399
I belong with my brother.

778
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:39,413
By my beard...
Is that the Time?

779
01:29:05,438 --> 01:29:06,439
No!

780
01:29:13,446 --> 01:29:15,248
Did you missed the boat as well?

781
01:29:15,348 --> 01:29:17,250
Kili? Kili!

782
01:29:21,354 --> 01:29:23,356
I'm done with dwarves.
Go away.

783
01:29:25,356 --> 01:29:27,259
No one will help us. Kili is sick.

784
01:29:30,362 --> 01:29:31,464
He's very sick.

785
01:30:11,502 --> 01:30:13,304
What is this place?

786
01:30:13,504 --> 01:30:18,808
It was once the city of Dale.
Now it is a ruin.

787
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:21,812
The Desolation of Smaug.

788
01:30:21,813 --> 01:30:26,317
The sun will soon reach midday.
We mus find the hidden door in the mountain before it sets.

789
01:30:26,417 --> 01:30:27,318
This way.

790
01:30:27,518 --> 01:30:32,423
Wait, is this the over-look?
Gandalf said to meet him here...

791
01:30:32,424 --> 01:30:33,424
Did you see him?

792
01:30:33,524 --> 01:30:35,325
We have no time to wait upon the wizard.

793
01:30:36,427 --> 01:30:37,327
We're on our own.

794
01:30:37,428 --> 01:30:39,329
Come.

795
01:30:55,147 --> 01:30:59,349
Dol Guldur... The hill of sorcery.

796
01:30:59,449 --> 01:31:01,451
It look completely abandoned.

797
01:31:02,352 --> 01:31:07,457
As is it ment to.
A spell of concealment lies upon this place.

798
01:31:08,558 --> 01:31:12,462
Which means our enemy is not yet ready to reveal himself.

799
01:31:14,564 --> 01:31:18,367
He has not regained his full strength.

800
01:31:18,567 --> 01:31:22,173
Radagast, I need you to carry a message to the lady Galadriel.

801
01:31:22,174 --> 01:31:23,174
Tell her we must force his hand.

802
01:31:24,473 --> 01:31:25,374
What do you mean?

803
01:31:25,474 --> 01:31:29,678
I'm going in alone.
On no account come after me.

804
01:31:36,485 --> 01:31:39,488
Do I have your word?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

805
01:31:51,499 --> 01:31:52,500
Wait Gandalf!

806
01:31:53,702 --> 01:32:00,608
What if it's a trap?
- Turn around and do not come back.

807
01:32:05,613 --> 01:32:08,516
It's undoubtedly a trap.

808
01:32:42,549 --> 01:32:46,553
The evil that is hidden here...

809
01:32:47,454 --> 01:32:50,160
I command it come forth!

810
01:32:50,761 --> 01:32:53,800
I command it reveal itself!

811
01:33:08,474 --> 01:33:11,577
And now come here.

812
01:33:15,481 --> 01:33:17,583
The Wizard has come.

813
01:33:17,783 --> 01:33:20,387
He is lifting the spell...

814
01:33:20,388 --> 01:33:21,388
He will find us!

815
01:33:22,488 --> 01:33:25,491
Yes... he will.

816
01:33:31,496 --> 01:33:33,599
Anything?
- Nothing!

817
01:33:37,703 --> 01:33:41,706
If the map is true,
the hidden door lies directly above us.

818
01:33:46,711 --> 01:33:48,613
Up here!

819
01:33:56,821 --> 01:33:59,824
You have keen eyes, master Baggins.

820
01:34:30,754 --> 01:34:32,756
This must be it.

821
01:34:34,658 --> 01:34:38,762
The hidden door.

822
01:34:40,564 --> 01:34:44,668
For all those who doubted us... Rule this day!

823
01:34:49,772 --> 01:34:52,675
Right! Whe have a key...

824
01:34:54,777 --> 01:34:58,581
Which mean that somewhere, there is a keyhole.

825
01:34:59,682 --> 01:35:02,484
The last light of Durin's day

826
01:35:03,886 --> 01:35:06,689
Will shine upon the keyhole.

827
01:35:23,705 --> 01:35:24,806
We're losing the light, come on!

828
01:35:31,813 --> 01:35:33,815
Be quiet. Can't hear when you're stomping!

829
01:35:36,818 --> 01:35:39,721
It's not here!

830
01:35:40,822 --> 01:35:42,824
Break it down.

831
01:35:44,726 --> 01:35:45,827
Come on.

832
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:53,634
It has to break.
- It's no good. The door is sealed...

833
01:35:53,669 --> 01:35:55,736
...can't be opened by force.

834
01:35:56,637 --> 01:35:57,738
There is powerful magic on it.

835
01:36:06,847 --> 01:36:08,649
No.

836
01:36:13,754 --> 01:36:16,155
The list light of Durin's day...

837
01:36:17,758 --> 01:36:20,661
...will shine upon the keyhole.

838
01:36:23,664 --> 01:36:25,866
That's what is says.

839
01:36:29,770 --> 01:36:31,771
What did we miss?

840
01:36:34,874 --> 01:36:38,775
What did we miss, Balin?

841
01:36:38,878 --> 01:36:41,981
We've lost the light.

842
01:36:42,982 --> 01:36:45,785
There is no more to be done.

843
01:36:46,786 --> 01:36:48,788
We had but one chance.

844
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:53,793
Come in, it's all fine.

845
01:36:55,795 --> 01:36:57,797
Wait a minute...

846
01:36:59,999 --> 01:37:02,701
Where are they going?

847
01:37:03,702 --> 01:37:04,904
You can't give uo now!

848
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:21,820
Thorin?

849
01:37:23,722 --> 01:37:24,923
You can't give op now.

850
01:37:36,735 --> 01:37:39,737
Stand by the grey stone...

851
01:37:40,839 --> 01:37:43,741
...when the thrush knocks.

852
01:37:43,841 --> 01:37:45,843
The setting sun...

853
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:48,846
...and the last light of Durin's day will shine.

854
01:37:50,047 --> 01:37:53,050
The last light?

855
01:37:54,852 --> 01:37:56,854
The last light.

856
01:38:32,789 --> 01:38:33,990
The last light!

857
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,703
The keyhole!

858
01:38:45,704 --> 01:38:48,404
Come back! Come back!

859
01:38:48,405 --> 01:38:52,808
It's the light of the moon!
The last moon of autumn!

860
01:38:56,112 --> 01:38:58,814
Where's the key? Where's the...

861
01:39:00,015 --> 01:39:00,916
It was here?

862
01:39:03,018 --> 01:39:04,920
It was just...

863
01:40:02,076 --> 01:40:03,977
Erebor...

864
01:40:04,078 --> 01:40:07,181
Thorin...

865
01:40:18,892 --> 01:40:20,994
I know these walls...

866
01:40:24,898 --> 01:40:28,101
These halls.

867
01:40:29,002 --> 01:40:32,005
The stone.

868
01:40:34,207 --> 01:40:37,010
Do you remeber it, Balin?

869
01:40:40,012 --> 01:40:42,915
Chmbers filled with golden light.

870
01:40:44,116 --> 01:40:47,019
I have a memory.

871
01:40:59,031 --> 01:41:03,135
Here in lies the seventh kingdom
of Durin's folk.

872
01:41:06,038 --> 01:41:12,244
May the hart of the mountain unite
all dwarves in defense of this home.

873
01:41:14,246 --> 01:41:17,048
THe throne of the king...

874
01:41:20,051 --> 01:41:22,954
And what's that above it?

875
01:41:27,058 --> 01:41:28,960
The Arkenstone.

876
01:41:30,061 --> 01:41:32,163
Arkenstone?

877
01:41:35,166 --> 01:41:36,769
And what's that?

878
01:41:37,170 --> 01:41:40,769
That, master burglar...

879
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:42,173
...is why you're here.

880
01:42:01,992 --> 01:42:04,094
Can you not do something?
- I need herbs.

881
01:42:04,194 --> 01:42:06,096
Something to bring down his fever.

882
01:42:06,196 --> 01:42:08,998
We have nightshade, some feverfew.

883
01:42:08,999 --> 01:42:11,201
They are no use to me,
do you have any kingsfoil?

884
01:42:11,301 --> 01:42:15,705
No, it's a weed, we feed it to the piggs.
- Piggs?

885
01:42:16,106 --> 01:42:18,808
Weed... Right!

886
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:21,211
Don't move.

887
01:42:23,313 --> 01:42:28,017
You want me,
to find the jewel?

888
01:42:29,018 --> 01:42:32,021
A large white jewel, yes.

889
01:42:34,123 --> 01:42:37,025
That's it?
I imagine there's quite a few down there.

890
01:42:37,026 --> 01:42:39,228
There is only one Arkenstone.

891
01:42:40,229 --> 01:42:42,131
And you'll know it when you see is.

892
01:42:43,332 --> 01:42:45,134
Right.

893
01:42:48,237 --> 01:42:50,144
In thruth lad...

894
01:42:51,145 --> 01:42:55,745
...I do not know what you'll find down there.

895
01:42:57,246 --> 01:43:01,250
You don't need to go if you don't want to.
There's no dishonour in turning back.

896
01:43:03,151 --> 01:43:05,053
I promised I would do this.

897
01:43:06,154 --> 01:43:08,256
And I think I must try.

898
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:14,162
It never seizes to amaze me.

899
01:43:14,262 --> 01:43:17,065
- What's that?
- The courage of Hobbits.

900
01:43:19,167 --> 01:43:24,272
Go now.
Get as much luck as you can muster.

901
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:34,181
Oh and Bilbo...

902
01:43:36,183 --> 01:43:39,286
If there is in fact a...

903
01:43:40,087 --> 01:43:42,189
...life dragon down there,

904
01:43:44,890 --> 01:43:47,390
don't waken it.

905
01:44:54,359 --> 01:44:59,364
You have come too late, Wizard!

906
01:45:00,065 --> 01:45:02,267
It is done.

907
01:45:04,269 --> 01:45:06,271
Where is your master?

908
01:45:07,272 --> 01:45:08,273
Where is he?

909
01:45:08,473 --> 01:45:12,177
He is everywhere...

910
01:45:12,377 --> 01:45:15,180
We are legion!

911
01:45:29,193 --> 01:45:31,295
It is over.

912
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,403
Run him down.

913
01:45:56,319 --> 01:45:59,422
There is no light, Wizard...

914
01:46:00,323 --> 01:46:03,426
...that can defeat darkness.

915
01:49:18,516 --> 01:49:22,419
Arkenstone... Arkenstone...

916
01:49:23,521 --> 01:49:26,523
A large white jewel.

917
01:49:27,625 --> 01:49:29,626
Very helpfull.

918
01:51:54,767 --> 01:52:01,140
Well, thief...

919
01:52:01,175 --> 01:52:09,480
I smell you... I hear your breath.

920
01:52:09,682 --> 01:52:14,687
I feel your air.

921
01:52:16,589 --> 01:52:21,794
Where are you? Where are you?

922
01:52:41,613 --> 01:52:45,617
Come now, do not be shy.

923
01:52:45,817 --> 01:52:48,820
Step into the light.

924
01:52:54,826 --> 01:52:58,830
There is something about you...

925
01:53:01,732 --> 01:53:03,834
Something you carry.

926
01:53:03,935 --> 01:53:08,839
Something made of gold.

927
01:53:08,874 --> 01:53:13,744
But far more precious.

928
01:53:17,848 --> 01:53:22,853
There you are, a thief in the shadows.

929
01:53:24,855 --> 01:53:26,857
I did not come to steal from you.

930
01:53:27,858 --> 01:53:30,625
Oh Smaug, the inaccessibly...

931
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:35,264
...welthy. I nearly wanted to gaze upon your magnificence.

932
01:53:35,299 --> 01:53:39,868
To see if you really were as great as the old tales say.

933
01:53:39,903 --> 01:53:41,671
I did not believe them!

934
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:53,783
And do you now?

935
01:53:54,884 --> 01:53:57,752
Truly...

936
01:53:57,787 --> 01:53:59,789
The tales and songs...

937
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:06,695
...fall utterly short, of you enormity.
Oh Smaug, the stupendous.

938
01:54:06,730 --> 01:54:10,698
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

939
01:54:10,699 --> 01:54:11,765
No...

940
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,002
No, indeed.

941
01:54:14,903 --> 01:54:18,772
You seem familiar with my name.

942
01:54:18,807 --> 01:54:22,711
But I do not remember smelling your kind before.

943
01:54:22,811 --> 01:54:26,915
Who are you?
And where do you come from?

944
01:54:27,716 --> 01:54:29,918
May I ask?

945
01:54:35,824 --> 01:54:37,025
I...

946
01:54:39,727 --> 01:54:41,627
I come from under the hill...

947
01:54:41,628 --> 01:54:42,931
Under hill?

948
01:54:46,734 --> 01:54:49,937
And under hills and over hills my path has led.

949
01:54:51,321 --> 01:54:54,842
And through the air,
I'm he who walks unseen.

950
01:54:54,877 --> 01:54:59,747
Impressive, what else do you claim to be?

951
01:54:59,782 --> 01:55:00,848
I am...

952
01:55:03,951 --> 01:55:06,053
Luckwearer...

953
01:55:06,854 --> 01:55:09,957
Riddlemaker!
- Lovely titles...

954
01:55:10,758 --> 01:55:13,527
Go on.
- Barrelrider.

955
01:55:13,528 --> 01:55:16,964
Barrels? Now that is intresting.

956
01:55:17,965 --> 01:55:22,769
And what about your little dwarf friends?

957
01:55:22,869 --> 01:55:24,971
Where are they hiding?

958
01:55:25,972 --> 01:55:30,877
Dwarfes? No...

959
01:55:30,981 --> 01:55:33,980
No, no Dwarfes here.

960
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:36,794
You've got that all wrong.
- Oh I don't think so.

961
01:55:36,795 --> 01:55:44,891
Barrelrider. They send you in here to do their dirty work,
while they skulk around uitside.

962
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:52,798
Truly, you are mistaking, oh Smaug,
chiefest and greatest of all calamities.

963
01:55:52,899 --> 01:55:57,863
You have nice manners. For a thief...

964
01:55:57,864 --> 01:56:00,004
...and a liar!

965
01:56:00,005 --> 01:56:06,011
I know the smell and taste Dwarf.
No one better.

966
01:56:06,912 --> 01:56:13,819
It is the gold, they are drawn to treasure
like flies to dead flesh.

967
01:56:16,021 --> 01:56:20,826
Did you think I would not know this day would come?

968
01:56:21,126 --> 01:56:28,933
That a pack of dwarves would come crawling back to the mountain?

969
01:56:34,038 --> 01:56:37,041
Was that an earthquake?
- That, my lad...

970
01:56:39,944 --> 01:56:41,946
...was a dragon.

971
01:56:49,954 --> 01:56:52,957
- Dad?
- It's coming from the mountain.

972
01:56:56,861 --> 01:56:59,964
You should leave us, take your children,
Get out of here.

973
01:56:59,999 --> 01:57:05,069
And go where?
The is nowhere to go.

974
01:57:06,070 --> 01:57:10,974
Are we going to die dad?
- No, darling.

975
01:57:11,074 --> 01:57:13,877
The dragon, it's going to kill us.

976
01:57:24,087 --> 01:57:25,889
Not if I kill it first.

977
01:57:27,190 --> 01:57:32,996
The king under the mountain is dead.
I took his throne.

978
01:57:33,096 --> 01:57:37,900
I ate his people, like a wolf among sheep.

979
01:57:40,903 --> 01:57:45,908
I kill where I wish, when I wish.

980
01:57:46,008 --> 01:57:50,012
My armour is iron!

981
01:57:57,119 --> 01:58:01,924
No blade can pierce me.

982
01:58:05,827 --> 01:58:10,132
A black arrow, why did you never tell me?
- Cause you did not need to know.

983
01:58:17,139 --> 01:58:21,042
Listen to me carefully.
I need you to distract the guards.

984
01:58:22,043 --> 01:58:25,146
Once I'm at the top of the tower,
I'll set the arrow to the bow.

985
01:58:25,246 --> 01:58:27,148
There is her! Bard!
- After him!

986
01:58:27,248 --> 01:58:29,951
Quickly, donw there. Go!

987
01:58:30,051 --> 01:58:31,953
Stop him!

988
01:58:43,965 --> 01:58:45,966
Bain...

989
01:58:46,167 --> 01:58:49,070
Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find it.

990
01:58:49,970 --> 01:58:52,173
I'll deal with them.
- I won't leave you

991
01:58:56,176 --> 01:58:57,943
Braga...
- You're under arrest.

992
01:58:57,978 --> 01:59:00,981
On what charge?
- Any charge the master choses.

993
01:59:43,222 --> 01:59:46,125
What about Bilbo?
- Give him more time.

994
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:48,327
Time to do what?
To be killed?

995
01:59:51,030 --> 01:59:55,234
You're afraid.
- Yes, I'm afraid.

996
01:59:57,035 --> 02:00:02,240
I fear for you.
A sickness lies upon that treasure court.

997
02:00:02,241 --> 02:00:06,144
A sickness which drove your grandfather mad.
- I am not my grandfather.

998
02:00:06,244 --> 02:00:09,212
You're not yourself.

999
02:00:09,247 --> 02:00:12,049
The Thorin I know would not hesitate to go in there.

1000
02:00:12,150 --> 02:00:16,254
I will not risk this quest for the life of one burglar.

1001
02:00:18,256 --> 02:00:22,060
Billbo.
His name is Bilbo.

1002
02:00:25,063 --> 02:00:30,268
It's Oakenshield...
That filthy dwarfish unsurper.

1003
02:00:33,171 --> 02:00:38,376
He sent you in here for the arkenstone, didn't he?

1004
02:00:39,076 --> 02:00:42,144
No. I don't know what you're talking about.

1005
02:00:42,179 --> 02:00:47,184
Don't bother denying it.
I guessed his foul purpose some time ago.

1006
02:00:49,286 --> 02:00:54,091
But it matters not. Oakenshield's quest -

1007
02:00:54,126 --> 02:00:59,096
Will fail. A darkness is coming.

1008
02:00:59,196 --> 02:01:03,100
It will spread to every corner of the land.

1009
02:01:45,341 --> 02:01:53,248
You have been used, thief in the shadows.
You were only ever a means to an end.

1010
02:01:53,448 --> 02:01:59,154
The coward Oakenshield has weighted the
value of your life.

1011
02:01:59,189 --> 02:02:02,257
Found it worth nothing.

1012
02:02:03,358 --> 02:02:05,260
No.

1013
02:02:06,161 --> 02:02:07,227
No, you're lying.

1014
02:02:07,262 --> 02:02:11,331
What did he promise you?
A share of the treasure?

1015
02:02:11,366 --> 02:02:18,273
As if it was his to give.
I will not part with a single coin.

1016
02:02:18,308 --> 02:02:22,176
Not one piece of it.

1017
02:02:25,279 --> 02:02:31,285
My teeth are swords, my claws are spear.

1018
02:02:33,387 --> 02:02:38,292
My wings, are a hurricane.

1019
02:02:43,497 --> 02:02:45,399
So it is true.

1020
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:49,303
- The black arrow found it's mark.
- What did you say?

1021
02:02:49,403 --> 02:02:55,409
I was just saying, your reputation proceeds you.
Oh Smaug the Tyrannical.

1022
02:02:56,209 --> 02:03:00,313
Truly. You have no equal on this earth.

1023
02:03:03,516 --> 02:03:08,423
I am almost tempted to let you take it.

1024
02:03:09,423 --> 02:03:15,428
If only to see Oakenshield suffer.
Watch it destroy him.

1025
02:03:16,229 --> 02:03:22,235
Watch it corrupt his arms and drive him mad.

1026
02:03:25,238 --> 02:03:30,242
But I think not,
I think our little game ends here.

1027
02:03:30,343 --> 02:03:36,248
So tell me thief... How do you choose to die?

1028
02:04:48,418 --> 02:04:50,520
Da'? Is that you da'?

1029
02:05:14,644 --> 02:05:16,646
No!

1030
02:06:32,619 --> 02:06:34,521
Guard!

1031
02:06:38,525 --> 02:06:41,428
Okaneshield has gone!

1032
02:06:41,728 --> 02:06:44,631
Fall back!
Regroup on the bridge!

1033
02:07:02,649 --> 02:07:04,515
You killed them all.

1034
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:07,553
There are others. Tauriel -

1035
02:07:07,588 --> 02:07:09,455
Come.

1036
02:07:12,558 --> 02:07:14,560
We are losing him.

1037
02:07:17,663 --> 02:07:19,565
Dahlia.

1038
02:07:42,587 --> 02:07:44,589
Atheros.

1039
02:07:46,691 --> 02:07:48,593
Atheros.

1040
02:07:48,793 --> 02:07:50,495
What are you doing?

1041
02:07:52,797 --> 02:07:54,699
I'm going to save him.

1042
02:08:15,619 --> 02:08:17,486
- You're alive.
- Not for much longer.

1043
02:08:17,521 --> 02:08:19,723
- Did you find the Arkenstone?
- The dragon's coming!

1044
02:08:22,826 --> 02:08:24,528
Did you find it?

1045
02:08:29,833 --> 02:08:31,735
Yeah, we should get out.

1046
02:08:34,638 --> 02:08:35,739
Thorin.

1047
02:08:39,543 --> 02:08:40,744
Thorin!

1048
02:09:10,673 --> 02:09:14,577
You will burn!

1049
02:09:21,583 --> 02:09:23,786
- Come on!
- Come on, Bilfur!

1050
02:09:35,897 --> 02:09:37,699
Come on.

1051
02:09:54,716 --> 02:09:55,717
Hold him down.

1052
02:11:15,894 --> 02:11:20,799
- We've given him to the slip.
- No, he's still coming for that.

1053
02:11:22,901 --> 02:11:25,904
- So where to now?
- The western guard room.

1054
02:11:26,805 --> 02:11:29,708
- There may be a way out.
- It's too high

1055
02:11:29,908 --> 02:11:32,711
- There's no chance that way
- It's our only chance.

1056
02:11:33,912 --> 02:11:36,815
We'll have to try.

1057
02:12:40,977 --> 02:12:44,881
I care to tell of the wonders of elvish medicine.

1058
02:12:44,916 --> 02:12:48,985
That was a priviledge to witness.

1059
02:12:49,886 --> 02:12:52,788
Tauriel.

1060
02:12:55,791 --> 02:12:58,094
Lie still.

1061
02:13:03,999 --> 02:13:06,802
You cannot be her.

1062
02:13:09,004 --> 02:13:12,908
She is far away.

1063
02:13:15,811 --> 02:13:20,015
She is far, far away from me.

1064
02:13:20,816 --> 02:13:26,021
She walks in starlight in another world.

1065
02:13:30,925 --> 02:13:33,128
And it was just a dream.

1066
02:13:45,039 --> 02:13:47,842
Do you think she could've love me?

1067
02:14:05,959 --> 02:14:09,062
- That's it then.
- There's no way out.

1068
02:14:15,969 --> 02:14:18,071
The last of our kin.

1069
02:14:22,075 --> 02:14:26,980
They must've come here, hoping to beyond hope.

1070
02:14:36,990 --> 02:14:39,192
We could try to reach the mines.

1071
02:14:40,093 --> 02:14:43,096
Might last a few days.

1072
02:14:44,096 --> 02:14:46,899
No.

1073
02:14:48,100 --> 02:14:50,903
I will not like this.

1074
02:14:52,104 --> 02:14:56,008
Cowering. Clawing for breath

1075
02:15:01,013 --> 02:15:03,215
- We make for the forges.
- You're serious?

1076
02:15:03,916 --> 02:15:05,918
- We're as sure as dead.
- Not if we split up.

1077
02:15:05,953 --> 02:15:08,986
Thorin, we'll never make it.

1078
02:15:09,021 --> 02:15:13,025
Some of us might. Lead him to the fortress.

1079
02:15:14,026 --> 02:15:15,927
We kill the dragon.

1080
02:15:17,929 --> 02:15:23,034
If this is to end with fire,
then we will burn together.

1081
02:15:24,035 --> 02:15:26,037
This way!

1082
02:15:29,140 --> 02:15:35,146
Flee! Flee! Run for your lives!

1083
02:15:35,181 --> 02:15:39,951
There is nowhere to hide.

1084
02:15:40,051 --> 02:15:42,954
Behind you!

1085
02:15:43,054 --> 02:15:45,156
Come on!

1086
02:15:46,157 --> 02:15:48,959
Run!

1087
02:15:49,160 --> 02:15:52,062
Hey you! Here!

1088
02:16:23,293 --> 02:16:26,996
Send word to Dol Guldur...

1089
02:16:27,096 --> 02:16:29,199
Oakenshield has reached the mountain!

1090
02:16:40,109 --> 02:16:41,210
Go!

1091
02:16:41,310 --> 02:16:44,213
You! Come with me.

1092
02:18:49,234 --> 02:18:53,238
This way! Come on!

1093
02:18:53,338 --> 02:18:55,240
Thorin!

1094
02:18:59,344 --> 02:19:00,345
Follow Balin!

1095
02:19:02,147 --> 02:19:03,348
Come on!

1096
02:19:19,163 --> 02:19:20,265
Thorin!

1097
02:19:29,273 --> 02:19:32,276
Hold on!

1098
02:20:04,307 --> 02:20:06,209
Come on!

1099
02:20:08,311 --> 02:20:10,313
Go!

1100
02:20:13,416 --> 02:20:17,420
The plan's not gonna work.
These furnaces are stone gold.

1101
02:20:17,455 --> 02:20:21,424
He's right. We've no fire hot enough
to set in a blaze.

1102
02:20:24,327 --> 02:20:26,429
Have we not?

1103
02:20:27,230 --> 02:20:30,433
I do not look to see you so easily outwitted!

1104
02:20:33,536 --> 02:20:37,339
You have grown slow and fat.

1105
02:20:37,540 --> 02:20:42,344
In your dotage. Slug!

1106
02:20:43,445 --> 02:20:45,447
Take cover!

1107
02:21:12,900 --> 02:21:15,276
Bombur! Get those pillows working!

1108
02:21:15,376 --> 02:21:16,477
Go!

1109
02:21:31,292 --> 02:21:34,395
Bilbo! Up there. On my mark, pull that lever.

1110
02:21:44,505 --> 02:21:49,509
- Balin, can you still mix a blast flame?
- Alright. Come on!

1111
02:21:51,411 --> 02:21:53,313
We don't have much time.

1112
02:22:04,524 --> 02:22:07,527
Pass the spell power!
Make sure you know what you're doing!

1113
02:22:19,639 --> 02:22:21,440
Come on!

1114
02:22:42,561 --> 02:22:44,463
Now!

1115
02:24:40,475 --> 02:24:42,577
We head for the Gallery of the Kings.

1116
02:25:29,823 --> 02:25:32,726
Keep going, Billbo!

1117
02:26:18,571 --> 02:26:21,573
You think can decieve me -

1118
02:26:21,608 --> 02:26:23,776
Barrel rider?

1119
02:26:24,777 --> 02:26:27,780
You have come from lake town.

1120
02:26:29,681 --> 02:26:37,789
This is some sort of scheme between these
filty dwarves and those miserable lakemen.

1121
02:26:38,790 --> 02:26:44,796
Those sniveling cowards with their
long bows and black arrows.

1122
02:26:46,598 --> 02:26:51,803
- Perhaps the time I paid them a visit.
- Oh no!

1123
02:26:53,805 --> 02:26:58,609
This isn't their fault! Wait!
You cannot go to Laketown!

1124
02:26:59,911 --> 02:27:04,615
You care about them? Do you?

1125
02:27:04,715 --> 02:27:06,617
Good.

1126
02:27:06,618 --> 02:27:08,819
Then you can watch them die!

1127
02:27:13,824 --> 02:27:18,629
Here! You witless worm!

1128
02:27:23,834 --> 02:27:28,639
- You.
- I am taking back what you stole.

1129
02:27:32,642 --> 02:27:38,648
You will take nothing from me, dwarf.

1130
02:27:38,748 --> 02:27:43,653
I laid low your warriors of old.

1131
02:27:43,654 --> 02:27:48,758
I am still terror in the hearts of men.

1132
02:27:49,759 --> 02:27:54,864
I am King Under the Mountain!

1133
02:27:55,665 --> 02:27:59,769
This is not your kingdom. These are dwarf lands.

1134
02:28:00,770 --> 02:28:03,773
This is dwarf gold.

1135
02:28:03,873 --> 02:28:07,676
And we will have our revenge.

1136
02:28:07,977 --> 02:28:09,879
Preparing for your death!

1137
02:29:27,954 --> 02:29:38,765
I'm going to die? Amazing!
I will show you revenge!

1138
02:30:14,900 --> 02:30:18,904
Listen to me! Do you not know what is coming?

1139
02:30:21,006 --> 02:30:25,811
I am fire.

1140
02:30:26,111 --> 02:30:29,517
I am...

1141
02:30:31,518 --> 02:30:33,518
...death!

1142
02:30:41,025 --> 02:30:43,027
What have we done?

1143
02:30:50,028 --> 02:30:52,728
