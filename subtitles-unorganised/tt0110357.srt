Life's not fair, is it?

00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:03,011
You see, I... Well, I shall never be king.

34
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,475
And you shall never see
the light of another day.

35
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:10,727
Adieu.

36
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,523
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to play with your food?

37
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,441
What do you want?

38
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,903
I'm here to announce that
King Mufasa's on his way,

39
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,574
so you'd better have a good excuse
for missing this morning's ceremony.

40
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,284
Oh, look, Zazu.

41
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,618
You've made me lose my lunch.

42
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:29,621
You'll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you.

43
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,374
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

44
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,919
I quiver with fear!

45
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,547
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.

46
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:39,923
Help!

47
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,217
Scar?

48
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,468
Drop him.

49
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,805
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.

50
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:54,021
Why, if it isn't my big brother
descending from on high

51
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,148
to mingle with the commoners.

52
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,359
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

53
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,570
That was today?

54
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,989
I feel simply awful!

55
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,951
Must've slipped my mind.

56
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,246
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is,

57
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,249
as the king's brother,
you should've been first in line!

58
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:19,296
Well, I was first in line,
until the little hairball was born.

59
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,384
That hairball is my son
and your future king.

60
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,137
I shall practise my curtsy!

61
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:29,806
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

62
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,225
Oh, no, Mufasa.

63
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,144
Perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

64
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,147
Is that a challenge?

65
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,732
Temper, temper.

66
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,985
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

67
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,987
Pity. Why not?

68
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,407
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

69
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,827
But when it comes to brute strength,

70
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:55,082
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end
of the gene pool.

71
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,462
There's one in every family, sire.

72
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,089
Two in mine, actually,

73
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,300
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions.

74
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,344
What am I going to do with him?

75
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,179
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.

76
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,347
Zazu!

77
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,850
And just think, whenever he gets dirty,

78
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,018
you could take him out and beat him.

79
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,232
Simba.

80
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,080
Dad! Dad!

81
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,583
Come on, dad, we gotta go! Wake up!

82
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,919
Sorry.

83
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,380
Dad! Dad!

84
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:28,342
Your son is awake.

85
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,470
Before sunrise, he's your son.

86
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,680
Dad! Come on, Dad.

87
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,103
You promised.

88
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,814
Okay, Okay. I'm up, I'm up.

89
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,982
Yeah!

90
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,333
Look, Simba.

91
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,546
Everything the light
touches is our kingdom.

92
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:12,344
A king's time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun.

93
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:16,390
One day, Simba,
the sun will set on my time here

94
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,893
and will rise with you as the new king.

95
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,688
- And this'll all be mine?
- Everything.

96
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,649
Everything the light touches.

97
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,901
What about that shadowy place?

98
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,112
That's beyond our borders.

99
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,572
You must never go there, Simba.

100
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,740
But I thought a king
can do whatever he wants.

101
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:37,160
Oh, there's more to being king
than getting your way all the time.

102
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,580
- There's more?
- Simba...

103
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,754
Everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance.

104
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,757
As king, you need to
understand that balance

105
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,593
and respect all the creatures,

106
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,512
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

107
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,431
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

108
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,100
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.

109
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,145
When we die, our bodies
become the grass,

110
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,898
and the antelope eat the grass.

111
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:11,236
And so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

112
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,572
- Good morning, sire!
- Good morning, Zazu.

113
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,490
Checking in with the morning report.

114
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,658
Fire away.

115
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,410
Well! The buzz from the bees

116
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,412
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

117
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,580
Really?

118
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,999
What are you doing, son?

119
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,584
Pouncing.

120
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,003
Let an old pro show you how it's done.

121
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,089
I told the elephants to forget it,
but they can't...

122
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,925
- Zazu, would you turn around?
- Yes, sire.

123
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,092
The cheetahs are hard up, but...

124
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,844
Stay low to the ground.

125
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,262
Cheetahs never prosper...

126
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,431
Yeah, okay.
Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.

127
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:40,682
- What going on?
- A pouncing lesson.

128
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,018
Very good. Pouncing.

129
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,522
Pouncing?
No, sire, you can't be serious...

130
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,274
This is so humiliating.

131
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,943
Try not to make a sound.

132
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,320
What are you telling him, Mufasa?

133
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,657
Mufasa? Simba?

134
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:01,703
That's very good.

135
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,622
- Zazu!
- Yes!

136
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,375
- News from the underground.
- Now, this time...

137
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,711
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands!

138
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,296
Zazu, take Simba home.

139
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,548
Aw, dad, can't I come?

140
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,715
No, son.

141
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,969
Pah! I never get to go anywhere.

142
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:21,139
Oh, young master,
one day, <i>you will be king</i>.

143
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:25,143
Then you can chase those
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers

144
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,229
from dawn until dusk.

145
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,655
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?

146
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,825
I despise guessing games.

147
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,994
I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.

148
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,329
Oh, goody!

149
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,164
My dad just showed me
the whole kingdom,

150
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:49,251
and I'm gonna rule it all!

151
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,838
Yes. Well, forgive me
for not leaping forjoy.

152
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,257
Bad back, you know.

153
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:57,426
Hey, Uncle Scar.

154
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,845
When I'm king, what'll that make you?

155
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,181
A monkey's uncle.

156
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:06,101
- You're so weird.
- You have no idea.

157
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:09,354
So, your father showed you
the whole kingdom, did he?

158
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:10,522
Everything.

159
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:14,193
He didn't show you what's beyond
that rise at the northern border?

160
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,696
Well, no. He said I can't go there.

161
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,781
And he's absolutely right.

162
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,200
It's far too dangerous.

163
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,702
Only the bravest lions go there.

164
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,455
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?

165
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,957
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.

166
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,125
Why not?

167
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:34,630
I'm only looking out for the
well-being of my favourite nephew.

168
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,549
Yeah, right! I'm your <i>only nephew</i>.

169
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,135
All the more reason
for me to be protective.

170
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:44,473
An elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince. Oops!

171
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,142
An elephant what?

172
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:50,395
Oh, dear, I've said too much.

173
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:53,315
Well, I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later,

174
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,401
you being so clever and all.

175
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,153
Just do me one favour.

176
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,824
Promise me you'll never visit
that dreadful place.

177
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,326
No problem.

178
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,078
There's a good lad.

179
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,914
You run along now and have fun.

180
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,499
And remember,

181
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,085
it's our little secret.

182
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,177
- Hey, Nala.
- Hi, Simba.

183
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,429
Come on. I just heard
about this great place.

184
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:27,015
Simba! I'm kind of
in the middle of a bath.

185
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,184
And it's time for yours.

186
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,271
Mom!

187
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,274
Mom, you're messing up my mane!

188
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,111
Okay, okay, I'm clean.
Can we go now?

189
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,529
So, where are we going?

190
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,114
It better not be anyplace dumb.

191
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,032
No, it's really cool.

192
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,618
So, where is this really cool place?

193
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,120
Oh.

194
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,873
- Around the water hole.
- The water hole?

195
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,791
What's so great about the water hole?

196
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,043
I'll show you when we get there.

197
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,295
Oh.

198
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,213
Mom, can I go with Simba?

199
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,549
What do you think, Sarabi?

200
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:01,675
Well...

201
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,135
Please?

202
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,386
It's all right with me.

203
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,554
- Yeah!
- All right!

204
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,556
As long as Zazu goes with you.

205
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,224
No, not Zazu.

206
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:10,809
Step lively.

207
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:14,897
The sooner we get to the water hole,
the sooner we can leave.

208
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,857
So, where are we really going?

209
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,317
An elephant graveyard.

210
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,986
Zazu.

211
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,822
Right. So, how are we
gonna ditch the dodo?

212
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,742
Oh, just look at you two.

213
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,912
Little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna.

214
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,247
Your parents will be thrilled,

215
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,666
what with your being betrothed and all.

216
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,834
Be-what?

217
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,586
Betrothed. Intended.

218
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,588
Affianced.

219
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:40,756
Meaning...

220
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:43,842
One day, you two are
going to be married.

221
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:44,927
- Yuck!
- Eww!

222
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,221
I can't marry her. She's my friend.

223
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,515
Yeah, it'd be so weird.

224
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,558
Sorry to bust your bubble,

225
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:54,228
but you two turtle doves
have no choice.

226
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,772
It's a tradition going back generations.

227
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,399
When I'm king,
that'll be the first thing to go.

228
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,319
- Not so long as I'm around.
- Well, in that case, you're fired.

229
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,821
Nice try, but only the king can do that.

230
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,490
Well, he's the future king.

231
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,951
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.

232
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,494
Not yet, I don't.

233
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,037
And with an attitude like that,

234
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,916
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king, indeed.

235
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,626

get off!

00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,609
Simba?

278
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,945
Nala!

279
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:53,699
All right! It worked!

280
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,285
- We lost him.
- I am a genius.

281
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,412
Hey, genius, it was my idea.

282
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,664
Yeah, but I pulled it off.

283
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,749
- With me!
- Oh, yeah?

284
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,006
- Pinned ya.
- Hey, let me up!

285
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,929
Pinned ya again.

286
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,652
This is it. We made it.

287
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,829
It's really creepy.

288
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:41,997
Yeah.

289
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,332
Isn't it great?

290
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,543
- We could get in big trouble.
- I know!

291
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,755
I wonder if its brains are still in there.

292
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,715
There's only one way to know.

293
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,634
Come on, let's go check it out.

294
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:57,346
Wrong! The only checking out you
will do will be to check out of here.

295
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:58,680
Oh, man!

296
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,225
We're way beyond the boundary
of the Pride Lands.

297
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,935
Look, banana beak is scared.

298
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,812
It's <i>Mr banana beak to you, fuzzy</i>,

299
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:09,316
and right now we are all
in very real danger.

300
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,817
Danger?

301
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,986
I walk on the wild side.

302
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,322
I laugh in the face of danger.

303
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:27,417
Well, well, well, Banzai,
what have we got here?

304
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,419
I don't know, Shenzi.

305
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,839
What do you think, Ed?

306
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,884
Just what I was thinking.

307
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,970
A trio of trespassers!

308
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,264
And quite by accident,
let me assure you.

309
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,182
A simple navigational error.

310
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,226
Wait, wait, wait.

311
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:48,313
I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.

312
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,691
I, madam, am the king's major-domo.

313
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,359
And that would make you...

314
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,735
The future king.

315
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,447
Do you know what we do to kings
who step out of their kingdom?

316
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,242
You can't do anything to me.

317
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,578
Technically, they can.
We are on their land.

318
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:06,874
But you told me they're nothing but
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.

319
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,500
Ix-nay on the upid-stay.

320
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,712
- Who are you callin' upid-stay?
- My, my, my. Oh, look at the sun!

321
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,964
- It's time to go!
- What's the hurry?

322
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,883
We'd love you to
stick around for dinner.

323
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:19,386
Yeah, we could have
whatever's <i>lion around</i>!

324
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,388
Wait, wait, wait, I got one, I got one!

325
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:24,600
Make mine a cub sandwich!

326
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,770
What, Ed? What is it?

327
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,689
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?

328
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:31,857
No, why?

329
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:34,109
'Cause there it goes!

330
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:43,035
- Did we lose 'em?
- I think so.

331
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,536
Where's Zazu?

332
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,747
The little major-domo bird
hippety-hopped

333
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,874
all the way to the birdie-boiler.

334
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,002
Oh, no! Not the birdie-boiler!

335
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,046
Aaaah!

336
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:58,634
Hey, why don't you pick
on somebody your own size?

337
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,136
- Like you?
- Oops.

338
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,307
Boo!

339
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,321
Simba!

340
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:40,843
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

341
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:46,682
That was it?

342
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,059
Do it again. Come on.

343
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,532
- Oh, please, please! Uncle, uncle!
- Silence!

344
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:06,827
- We're gonna shut up right now!
- Calm down. We're really sorry.

345
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,038
If you ever come near my son again...

346
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,790
Oh, this is... This is <i>your son</i>?

347
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:14,376
- Oh, <i>your son</i>.
- Did you know that?

348
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,879
No. Me? I didn't know... No, did you?

349
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,881
- No, of course not.
- No.

350
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,048
Ed?

351
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,720
Toodles.

352
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,730
- Dad, I...
- You deliberately disobeyed me.

353
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,984
- Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.
- Let's go home.

354
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,615
I thought you were very brave.

355
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,841
Zazu.

356
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:06,094
Yes, sire?

357
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:10,474
Take Nala home.
I've got to teach my son a lesson.

358
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,605
Come, Nala.

359
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:20,108
Simba, good luck.

360
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:27,783
Simba!

361
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,312
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.

362
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,815
- I know.
- You could've been killed.

363
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:01,859
You deliberately disobeyed me,

364
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:05,696
and what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

365
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,365
I was just trying to be brave, like you.

366
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:11,827
I'm only brave when I have to be.

367
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,539
Simba, being brave

368
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,958
doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.

369
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,085
But you're not scared of anything.

370
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,379
I was today.

371
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,631
- You were?
- Yes.

372
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,842
I thought I might lose you.

373
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:30,929
I guess even kings get scared?

374
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:34,516
- But you know what?
- What?

375
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,144
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

376
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,899
'Cause nobody messes with your dad.

377
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,443
- Come here, you.
- Oh, no! No!

378
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,156
Come here!

379
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:51,700
Gotcha!

380
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,498
Dad?

381
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,335
- We're pals, right?
- Right.

382
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,171
And we'll always be together, right?

383
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:11,178
Simba, let me tell you something
that my father told me.

384
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:13,180
Look at the stars.

385
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:18,352
The great kings of the past
look down on us from those stars.

386
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,729
- Really?
- Yes.

387
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:23,106
So whenever you feel alone,

388
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,945
just remember that those kings
will always be there to guide you.

389
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,281
And so will I.

390
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:41,667
Man, that lousy Mufasa.
I won't be able to sit for a week.

391
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,505
It's not funny, Ed.

392
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,511
Hey, shut up!

393
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:56,974
Will you knock it off?

394
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:01,186
- Well, he started it.
- Look at you guys.

395
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:03,856
No wonder we're dangling
at the bottom of the food chain.

396
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:05,440
Man, I hate dangling.

397
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:09,361
Yeah? If it weren't for those lions,
we'd be runnin' the joint.

398
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,863
Man, I hate lions.

399
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:12,614
- So pushy.
- And hairy.

400
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:14,783
- And stinky.
- And, man, are they...

401
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:16,869
Ugly!

402
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:22,040
Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad.

403
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,960
- Oh.
- Oh, Scar. It's just you.

404
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:27,129
We were afraid it was
somebody important.

405
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:28,630
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.

406
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,257
- Yeah.
- I see.

407
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,634
- Now that's power!
- Tell me about it.

408
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,469
I just hear that name and I shudder.

409
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:37,139
- Mufasa!
- Do it again.

410
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,557
- Mufasa!
- Ooooh!

411
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:41,226
Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa!

412
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,103
It tingles me.

413
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:46,064
I'm surrounded by idiots.

414
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:49,234
Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're
one of us. I mean, you're our pal.

415
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,485
Charmed.

416
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:54,698
Oh, I like that. He's not king,
but he's still so proper.

417
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,658
Yeah. Hey, did you
bring us anything to eat,

and you couldn't even dispose of them.

422
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:14,676
Well, you know, it wasn't exactly
like they was alone, Scar.

423
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,929
Yeah. What were we supposed to do?

No. Just stay on this rock.

486
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:07,910
You wouldn't want to end up
in another mess

487
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,703
like you did with the hyenas.

488
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,707
- You know about that?
- Simba, everybody knows about that.

489
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,376
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

490
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,172
Lucky daddy was there
to save you, eh?

491
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:22,966
Oh, and just between us,

492
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,428
you might want to work on
that little roar of yours?

493
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:28,430
Oh. Okay.

494
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:34,728
Hey, Uncle Scar,
will I like this surprise?

495
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:39,107
Simba, it's to die for.

496
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:01,797
Shut up.

497
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:05,300
I can't help it. I'm so hungry.
I got to have a wildebeest.

498
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:06,802
Stay put.

499
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:09,137
Can't I just pick off
one of the little sick ones?

500
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:13,141
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.

501
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:18,772
There he is. Let's go.

502
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:22,150
"Little roar." Puh!

503
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:25,612
Rarr!

504
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:28,824
Rrrarr!

505
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,997
Rarr!

506
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:25,464
Oh, look, sire, the herd is on the move.

507
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:27,883
- Odd.
- Mufasa, quick.

508
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:29,885
Stampede in the gorge.

509
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:32,638
- Simba's down there!
- Simba?

510
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:56,161
Zazu, help me!

511
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:58,247
Your father is on the way! Hold on!

512
00:33:58,372 --> 00:33:59,540
Hurry!

513
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,671
There! There on that tree!

514
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:07,089
Hold on, Simba!

515
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:10,008
Dad!

516
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:16,098
Oh, Scar, this is awful!

517
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:18,350
What'll we do? What'll we do?

518
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:21,103
I'll go back for help, that's what I'll do.

519
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:58,140
Dad!

520
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:22,664
Scar!

521
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:26,335
- Brother.
- Brother, help me!

522
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:37,846
Long live the king.

523
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:46,021
No!

524
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:00,202
Dad!

525
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:14,148
Dad?

526
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:56,300
Dad, come on.

527
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:59,261
You got to get up.

528
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:01,346
Dad?

529
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,390
We got to go home.

530
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,069
Help!

531
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:21,074
Somebody!

532
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:22,951
Anybody.

533
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:25,829
Help.

534
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,531
Simba. What have you done?

535
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:04,785
There were wildebeests,
and he tried to save me.

536
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:08,038
It was an accident.
I didn't mean for it to happen.

537
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:12,334
Of course. Of course you didn't.

538
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:17,881
No one ever means for
these things to happen.

539
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:20,050
But the king is dead.

540
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:24,680
And if it weren't for you,
he'd still be alive.

541
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,020
Oh, what will your mother think?

542
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:34,565
What am I going to do?

543
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,024
Run away, Simba.

544
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,406
Run. Run away and never return.

545
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:50,539
Kill him.

546
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:45,594
Hey, there he goes. There he goes.

547
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:47,304
So go get him.

548
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:49,223
There ain't no way I'm going in there.

549
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:53,227
What, you want me to come out
looking like you, cactus butt?

550
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:55,604
But we got to finish the job.

551
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:58,732
Well, he's as good as
dead out there anyway.

552
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:01,109
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.

553
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,278
Yeah! You hear that?

554
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:07,282
If you ever come back, we'll kill you!

555
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:19,795
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.

556
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:24,258
But to lose Simba,
who had barely begun to live...

557
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:30,055
For me, it is a deep, personal loss.

558
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:34,101
So it is with a heavy heart
that I assume the throne.

559
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:38,438
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy
we shall rise

560
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:41,483
to greet the dawning of a new era

561
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:45,362
in which lion and hyena come together

562
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:49,783
in a great and glorious future.

563
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:34,369
Yaaaah!

564
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:39,208
Get out! Get out! Get out of here!

565
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,668
I love this! Bowling for buzzards.

566
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:45,339
Hee hee hee! Gets 'em every time.

567
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:49,426
Hey, Timon, you better come look.

568
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:51,553
I think it's still alive.

569
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,930
Eeeuw.

570
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:56,391
All righty, what have we got here?

571
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:05,609
Jeez, it's a lion! Run, Pumbaa, move it!

572
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:09,029
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.

573
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:13,742
Look at him. He's so cute and all alone.

574
00:42:14,076 --> 00:42:16,245
- Can we keep him?
- Pumbaa, are you nuts?

575
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:19,581
You're talking about a lion.
Lions eat guys like us.

576
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:22,084
- But he's so little.
- He's going to get bigger.

577
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:24,336
Maybe he'll be on our side.

578
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:27,506
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard. Maybe he'll...

579
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:30,843
Hey, I've got it.
What if he's on our side?

580
00:42:30,926 --> 00:42:34,263
You know, having a lion around
might not be such a bad idea.

581
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:35,430
So we're keeping him?

582
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:37,766
Of course.
Who's the brains of this outfit?

583
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,434
My point exactly.

584
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:42,855
Jeez, I'm fried. Let's get out
of here and find some shade.

585
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:53,615
- You okay, kid?
- I guess so.

586
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:54,950
You nearly died.

587
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:56,702
I saved you.

588
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:58,954
Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.

589
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:00,873
Thanks for your help.

590
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,292
Hey, where you going?

591
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,627
Nowhere.

592
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:07,045
Gee, he looks blue.

593
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:11,425
- I'd say brownish gold.
- No, no, no. I mean he's depressed.

594
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:14,136
Kid, what's eating you?

595
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:17,306
Nothing.
He's at the top of the food chain.

596
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:21,143
The food chain!

597
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:26,732
So, where you from?

598
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:28,817
Who cares? I can't go back.

599
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:32,321
You're an outcast.
That's great. So are we.

600
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:34,823
- What'd you do, kid?
- Something terrible.

601
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:37,910
- But I don't want to talk about it.
- We don't want to hear about it.

602
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:40,162
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?

603
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:42,915
Not unless you can change the past.

604
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:46,251
You know, kid, in times like this,
my buddy Timon here says,

605
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:48,837
"You got to put your
behind in your past."

606
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:50,506
No, no, no.

607
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:51,924
- I mean...
- Amateur.

608
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:54,176
Lie down before you hurt yourself.

609
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:57,429
It's,
"You got to put your past behind you."

610
00:43:57,513 --> 00:44:01,517
Look, kid, bad things happen, and you
can't do anything about it, right?

611
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,601
- Right.
- Wrong!

612
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:05,354
When the world turns its back on you,

613
00:44:05,437 --> 00:44:08,106
you turn your back on the world.

614
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,108
Well, that's not what I was taught.

615
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:12,361
Then maybe you need a new lesson.

616
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:14,780
Repeat after me.

617
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:16,698
- <i>Hakuna matata.</i>
- What?

618
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:19,701
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

619
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:21,036
It means "no worries".

620
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:24,039
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

621
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:27,292
What a wonderful phrase.

622
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:29,711
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

623
00:44:29,837 --> 00:44:33,048

624
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:35,467

00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:51,817
- Yeah. It's our motto.
- What's a motto?

630
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,236
Nothin'. What's-a-motto with you?

631
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:59,157
You know, kid, these two words
will solve all your problems.

632
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:02,578
That's right.
Take Pumbaa, for example. Why...

Maybe I was gonna be,

805
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:59,253
but that was a long time ago.

806
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:03,090
Let me get this straight.
You're the king? And never told us?

807
00:57:03,173 --> 00:57:05,926
- Look, I'm still the same guy.
- But with power.

808
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:08,887
Could you guys excuse us
for a few minutes?

809
00:57:09,137 --> 00:57:10,848
Hey, whatever she has to say,

810
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:13,100
she can say in front of us, right, Simba?

811
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:16,895
Maybe you'd better go.

812
00:57:18,021 --> 00:57:21,149
It starts. You think you know a guy.

813
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:28,073
Timon and Pumbaa,
you learn to love 'em.

814
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:31,827
What?

815
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:34,621
What is it?

816
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:38,083
It's like you're back from the dead.

817
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:42,129
You don't know how much
this will mean to everyone.

818
00:57:42,504 --> 00:57:44,089
What it means to me.

819
00:57:44,173 --> 00:57:47,968
- Hey, it's okay.
- I've really missed you.

820
00:57:48,051 --> 00:57:50,554
I've missed you, too.

821
00:57:52,347 --> 00:57:55,934
I tell you, Pumbaa.
This stinks.

822
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:57,769
Oh, sorry.

823
00:57:57,853 --> 00:58:00,022
Not you! Them!

824
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:03,817
Him, her, alone.

825
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:05,235

It is beautiful.

865
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:05,290
But I don't understand something.

866
01:01:05,374 --> 01:01:07,751
You've been alive all this time.

867
01:01:08,085 --> 01:01:10,170
Why didn't you
come back to Pride Rock?

868
01:01:10,254 --> 01:01:15,092
Well, I just needed to get out
on my own, live my own life.

869
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:17,052
And I did, and it's great.

870
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:19,221
We've really needed you at home.

871
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,517
- No one needs me.
- Yes, we do. You're the king.

872
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,645
Nala, we've been through this.
I'm not the king. Scar is.

873
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:30,566
Simba, he let the hyenas
take over the Pride Lands.

874
01:01:30,649 --> 01:01:32,651
- What?
- Everything's destroyed.

875
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:34,403
There's no food, no water.

876
01:01:34,486 --> 01:01:37,155
Simba, if you don't do something
soon, everyone will starve.

877
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:38,532
- I can't go back.
- Why?

878
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:40,826
- You wouldn't understand.
- What?

879
01:01:40,951 --> 01:01:43,495
No, no, no. It doesn't matter.
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

880
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:45,289
- What?
- <i>Hakuna matata.</i>

881
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:49,042
It's something I learned out here.
Sometimes bad things happen...

882
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:50,210
Simba...

883
01:01:50,294 --> 01:01:53,547
and there's nothing you can do
about it. So why worry?

884
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:58,135
- Because it's your responsibility.
- Well, what about you? You left.

885
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:01,096
I left to find help, and I found you.

886
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:05,601
Don't you understand?
You're our only hope.

887
01:02:05,684 --> 01:02:08,520
- Sorry.
- What's happened to you?

888
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:12,566
- You're not the Simba I remember.
- You're right. I'm not.

889
01:02:12,649 --> 01:02:16,236
- Now are you satisfied?
- No. Just disappointed.

890
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,114
You know, you're starting
to sound like my father.

891
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:21,158
Good. At least one of us does.

892
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:25,579
You think you can just show
up and tell me how to live my life?

893
01:02:25,662 --> 01:02:27,664
You don't even know
what I've been through.

894
01:02:27,748 --> 01:02:29,082
I would if you'd just tell me.

895
01:02:29,166 --> 01:02:31,001
- Forget it!
- Fine!

896
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:37,674
She's wrong. I can't go back.

897
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:41,845
What would it prove, anyway?
It won't change anything.

898
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:43,931
You can't change the past.

899
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,145
You said you'd always be there for me!

900
01:02:50,729 --> 01:02:52,564
But you're not.

901
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:56,944
And it's because of me.

902
01:02:57,486 --> 01:03:02,533
It's my fault.

903
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,787
Come on, will you cut it out?

904
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:51,790
Can't cut it out.
It'll grow right back!

905
01:03:51,915 --> 01:03:54,960
Creepy little monkey.
Will you stop following me?

906
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:58,922
- Who are you?
- The question is, who are you?

907
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:05,137
I thought I knew. Now I'm not so sure.

908
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:09,016
Well, I know who you are.
Come here. It's a secret.

909
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:12,519
♪ <i>Asante sana, squash banana</i>

910
01:04:12,603 --> 01:04:15,022
Grrr! Enough!
What is that supposed to mean?

911
01:04:15,105 --> 01:04:18,442
It means you are a baboon, and I'm not.

912
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:22,362
I think you're a little confused.

913
01:04:22,446 --> 01:04:25,324
Wrong! I'm not the one who's confused.

914
01:04:25,449 --> 01:04:28,869
- You don't even know who you are.
- Oh, and I suppose <i>you know</i>.

915
01:04:28,952 --> 01:04:31,955
Sure do. You're Mufasa's boy.

916
01:04:33,457 --> 01:04:36,168
- Bye.
- Hey, wait!

917
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:46,178
You knew my father?

918
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:49,473
Correction, I <i>know your father</i>.

919
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:53,560
I hate to tell you this,

920
01:04:53,644 --> 01:04:56,730
but he died a long time ago.

921
01:04:56,813 --> 01:04:58,941
Nope. Wrong again!

922
01:05:00,484 --> 01:05:03,237
He's alive, and I'll show him to you.

923
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,323
You follow old Rafiki.
He knows the way. Come on!

924
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,418
Don't dawdle. Hurry up!

925
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:21,964
- Hey, whoa, wait, wait.
- Come on. Come on!

926
01:05:23,674 --> 01:05:25,843
Would you slow down?

927
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,189
Stop!

928
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:45,529
Look down there.

929
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:13,682
That's not my father.
That's just my reflection.

930
01:06:13,765 --> 01:06:15,434
No.

931
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,396
Look harder.

932
01:06:25,611 --> 01:06:26,945
You see?

933
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:30,741
He lives in you.

934
01:06:34,912 --> 01:06:37,581
Simba.

935
01:06:37,664 --> 01:06:39,291
Father?

936
01:06:47,216 --> 01:06:49,968
Simba, you have forgotten me.

937
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:52,179
No. How could I?

938
01:06:52,262 --> 01:06:57,017
You have forgotten who you are,
and so have forgotten me.

939
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:59,353
Look inside yourself, Simba.

940
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:03,524
You are more than
what you have become.

941
01:07:03,607 --> 01:07:06,944
You must take your place
in the circle of life.

942
01:07:07,027 --> 01:07:10,948
How can I go back?
I'm not who I used to be.

943
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:14,952
Remember who you are.

944
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:18,956
You are my son and the one true king.

945
01:07:20,832 --> 01:07:24,461
Remember who you are.

946
01:07:24,545 --> 01:07:27,381
No! Please, don't leave me!

947
01:07:27,464 --> 01:07:28,632
Remember.

948
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:30,300
- Father!
- Remember!

949
01:07:30,384 --> 01:07:32,344
Don't leave me.

950
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:34,346
Remember.

951
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:44,982
What was that?

952
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:46,775
The weather.

953
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:50,529
- Very peculiar, don't you think?
- Yeah.

954
01:07:51,113 --> 01:07:52,614
Looks like the winds are changing.

955
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:55,242
Change is good.

956
01:07:55,659 --> 01:07:57,494
Yeah, but it's not easy.

957
01:07:57,578 --> 01:08:02,583
I know what I have to do, but going
back means I'll have to face my past.

958
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:05,752
I've been running from it
for so long.

959
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,006
Jeez! What was that for?

960
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:11,967
It doesn't matter. It's in the past.

961
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:14,052
Yeah, but it still hurts.

962
01:08:14,136 --> 01:08:16,430
Oh, yes, the past can hurt.

963
01:08:16,513 --> 01:08:20,100
But the way I see it
you can either run from it

964
01:08:20,184 --> 01:08:23,020
or learn from it.

965
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:25,898
You see?
So what are you going to do?

966
01:08:26,106 --> 01:08:28,567
First, I'm gonna take your stick.

967
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,903
No, no, no, no! Not the stick!

968
01:08:30,986 --> 01:08:34,573
- Hey! Where are you going?
- I'm going back!

969
01:08:34,656 --> 01:08:37,576
Good! Go on! Get out of here!

970
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:46,627
Whoooo! Whoooo!

971
01:08:54,468 --> 01:08:55,636
Grubs! Grubs!

972
01:09:01,183 --> 01:09:03,143
Hey. Hey, wake up.

973
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:10,567
It's okay! It's okay! It's me!

974
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:14,112
Don't ever do that again.

975
01:09:14,404 --> 01:09:16,114
Carnivores! Oy!

976
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:18,825
- Have you guys seen Simba?
- I thought he was with you.

977
01:09:18,909 --> 01:09:21,578
He was, but now I can't find him.
Where is he?

978
01:09:21,662 --> 01:09:23,622
Ho ho! You won't find him here!

979
01:09:23,914 --> 01:09:27,042
The king has returned.

980
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:30,337
I can't believe it. He's gone back!

981
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,256
Gone back? What do you mean?

982
01:09:32,422 --> 01:09:35,342
Hey, what's goin' on here?

983
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:37,761
- Who's the monkey?
- Simba went back to challenge Scar.

984
01:09:37,845 --> 01:09:38,929
- Who?
- Scar.

985
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:40,848
- Who's got a scar?
- No, it's his uncle.

986
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:42,683
- The monkey's his uncle?
- No!

987
01:09:42,766 --> 01:09:46,353
Simba's gone back to challenge
his uncle to take his place as king.

988
01:09:46,436 --> 01:09:47,729
Oh.

989
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:46,997
Simba, wait up!

990
01:10:50,584 --> 01:10:54,880
- It's awful, isn't it?
- I didn't want to believe you.

991
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:56,882
What made you come back?

992
01:10:57,341 --> 01:10:59,843
I finally got some sense
knocked into me,

993
01:11:00,177 --> 01:11:02,221
and I've got the bump to prove it.

994
01:11:02,596 --> 01:11:05,015
Besides, this is my kingdom.

995
01:11:05,349 --> 01:11:08,143
If I don't fight for it, who will?

996
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:11,230
- I will.
- It's gonna be dangerous.

997
01:11:11,313 --> 01:11:15,776
Danger?
I laugh in the face of danger.

998
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:17,611
I see nothing funny about this.

999
01:11:17,694 --> 01:11:20,697
Timon! Pumbaa!
What are you doing here?

1000
01:11:20,822 --> 01:11:22,950
At your service, my liege.

1001
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:26,703
Aww! We're gonna fight your uncle
for this?

1002
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:30,457
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

1003
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:32,876
Oh. Talk about your fixer-upper!

1004
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:37,464
Well, Simba, if it's important to
you, we're with you to the end.

1005
01:11:56,233 --> 01:12:00,112
Hyenas. I hate hyenas.

1006
01:12:00,195 --> 01:12:02,656
So what's your plan
for getting past those guys?

1007
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:06,118
- Live bait.
- Good idea. Hey!

1008
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:08,996
Come on, Timon. You guys
have to create a diversion.

1009
01:12:09,246 --> 01:12:11,707
What do you want me to do,
dress in drag and do the hula?

1010
01:12:11,915 --> 01:12:13,876
Luau!

1019
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:37,691

1020
01:12:37,774 --> 01:12:40,694
I'll look for Scar.

1021
01:12:43,113 --> 01:12:44,823
Sarabi!

1022
01:12:59,505 --> 01:13:00,714
Yes, Scar?

1023
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:04,259
Where is your hunting party?
They're not doing theirjob.

1024
01:13:04,343 --> 01:13:07,221
Scar, there is no food.
The herds have moved on.

1025
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:09,973
No, you're just not
looking hard enough.

1026
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:14,061
It's over. There is nothing left.

1027
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:18,023
We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.

1028
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:21,568
- We're not going anywhere.
- You have sentenced us to death.

1029
01:13:21,652 --> 01:13:23,820
- Then so be it.
- You can't do that.

1030
01:13:23,904 --> 01:13:26,198
I am the king. I can do whatever I want.

1031
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:28,700
If you were half the king Mufasa was...

1032
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:31,370
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!

1033
01:13:34,373 --> 01:13:36,792
Mufasa? No, you're dead.

1034
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:45,717
Mufasa?

1035
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:49,137
No. It's me.

1036
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:54,893
Simba! You're alive? How can that be?

1037
01:13:54,977 --> 01:13:58,772
It doesn't matter. I'm home.

1038
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:00,190
Simba?

1039
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:04,862
Simba! Oh, I'm a little surprised
to see you

1040
01:14:04,945 --> 01:14:06,405
alive.

1041
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:11,577
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1042
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:13,620
Oh, Simba, you must understand.

1043
01:14:13,704 --> 01:14:16,081
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...

1044
01:14:16,164 --> 01:14:19,418
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.

1045
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:21,920
Oh, well, I would, naturally.

1046
01:14:22,045 --> 01:14:24,965
However, there is one little problem.

1047
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:26,842
You see them?

1048
01:14:28,552 --> 01:14:30,846
They think <i>I'm king</i>.

1049
01:14:30,929 --> 01:14:34,683
Well, we don't.
Simba's the rightful king.

1050
01:14:34,766 --> 01:14:36,685
The choice is yours, Scar.

1051
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,271
Either step down or fight.

1052
01:14:39,354 --> 01:14:41,773
Oh, must this all end in violence?

1053
01:14:42,274 --> 01:14:46,069
I'd hate to be responsible
for the death of a family member.

1054
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:49,406
- Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
- That's not gonna work, Scar.

1055
01:14:49,907 --> 01:14:51,033
I've put it behind me.

1056
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:52,951
But what about your faithful subjects?

1057
01:14:53,035 --> 01:14:54,995
Have they put it behind them?

1058
01:14:55,078 --> 01:14:57,164
Simba, what is he talking about?

1059
01:14:57,247 --> 01:15:01,502
So you haven't told them
your little secret.

1060
01:15:01,585 --> 01:15:04,963
Well, Simba,
now's your chance to tell them.

1061
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:09,218
Tell them who is responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1062
01:15:12,262 --> 01:15:13,430
I am.

1063
01:15:17,809 --> 01:15:20,354
It's not true.

1064
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:23,106
Tell me it's not true.

1065
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:27,819
- It's true.
- You see? He admits it!

1066
01:15:27,903 --> 01:15:30,906
- Murderer!
- No! It was an accident.

1067
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:34,701
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would
be alive. It's your fault he's dead!

1068
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:36,370
- Do you deny it?
- No.

1069
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:40,582
- Then you're guilty.
- No, I'm not a murderer!

1070
01:15:40,707 --> 01:15:43,001
Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again,

1071
01:15:43,126 --> 01:15:46,088
but this time
daddy isn't here to save you,

1072
01:15:46,171 --> 01:15:49,466
and now everyone knows why!

1073
01:15:50,551 --> 01:15:51,635
Simba!

1074
01:15:57,224 --> 01:16:00,060
Now, this looks familiar.

1075
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:05,858
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think.

1076
01:16:05,941 --> 01:16:08,569
Oh, yes. I remember.

1077
01:16:09,152 --> 01:16:12,823
This is just the way
your father looked before he died.

1078
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:18,412
And here's <i>my little secret</i>.

1079
01:16:18,871 --> 01:16:21,999
I killed Mufasa.

1080
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:26,712
No! Murderer!

1081
01:16:27,504 --> 01:16:29,965
- No, Simba, please.
- Tell them the truth.

1082
01:16:30,048 --> 01:16:33,760
Truth? But truth is in
the eye of the behold...

1083
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:35,262
All right.

1084
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,556
All right.

1085
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:40,100
I did it.

1086
01:16:40,184 --> 01:16:42,102
So they can hear you.

1087
01:16:43,145 --> 01:16:46,315
I killed Mufasa!

1088
01:16:56,366 --> 01:16:58,410
Hee-yah!

1089
01:16:58,493 --> 01:17:01,705
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Comin' through. Hot stuff.

1090
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:29,525
Aagghh!

1091
01:17:31,026 --> 01:17:33,529
- Let me out! Let me out!
- Let me in! Let me in!

1092
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:37,241
Please, don't eat me.

1093
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:38,909
Drop 'em!

1094
01:17:38,992 --> 01:17:41,328
- Hey, who's the pig?
- Are you talkin' to me?

1095
01:17:41,411 --> 01:17:43,372
- He called him a pig.
- To me?

1096
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:45,290
- Shouldn't have done that.
- To me?

1097
01:17:45,374 --> 01:17:51,088
- Now they're in for it.
- They call me <i>Mr Pig</i>!

1098
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:54,216
Aaaaggghhh!

1099
01:17:54,341 --> 01:17:57,010
Take that, you stupid...

1100
01:17:57,094 --> 01:17:59,096
Take that and that!

1101
01:18:02,683 --> 01:18:04,726
Run, you yellow-belly!

1102
01:18:24,788 --> 01:18:27,624
- Murderer.
- Simba. Simba, please.

1103
01:18:27,749 --> 01:18:31,628
- Please, have mercy. I beg you.
- You don't deserve to live.

1104
01:18:31,712 --> 01:18:37,134
But Simba, I am family.

1105
01:18:37,467 --> 01:18:40,679
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.

1106
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,390
It was their fault. It was their idea.

1107
01:18:43,473 --> 01:18:45,517
Why should I believe you?

1108
01:18:46,018 --> 01:18:48,687
Everything you ever told me was a lie.

1109
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:50,731
What are you going to do?

1110
01:18:50,814 --> 01:18:54,401
You wouldn't kill your own uncle.

1111
01:18:54,818 --> 01:18:56,945
No, Scar.

1112
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,822
I'm not like you.

1113
01:18:58,906 --> 01:19:02,159
Oh, Simba, thank you.
You are truly noble.

1114
01:19:02,242 --> 01:19:06,038
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
And how can I prove myself to you?

1115
01:19:06,121 --> 01:19:07,748
Tell me. I mean, anything.

1116
01:19:08,207 --> 01:19:09,333
Run.

1117
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,960
