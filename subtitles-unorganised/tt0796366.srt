1
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,929
- USS Kelvin, go for Starfleet base.
- Starfleet Base.

2
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,890
We sent you a transmission.
Did you receive it?

3
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:25,288
Kelvin, can you double-check
those readings?

4
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:28,083
Our gravitational sensors are going
crazy here. You should see this.

5
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:29,580
It looks like a lightning storm.

6
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:31,277
What you've sent us
doesn't seem possible.

7
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:33,875
Yes mam, I understand.
That's why we sent it.

8
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:36,668
- Report.
- Still outta visual range. 20 seconds.

9
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:40,961
Alert captain Robau that Starfleet
advised to proceed with caution...

10
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:42,358
Polarize the view screen.

11
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:45,053
- Whatever this is... Klingon origin?
- Captain, we have visual.

12
00:01:45,054 --> 00:01:48,348
- Repeat. Could this be Klingon?
- Negative, lieutenant.

13
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:50,180
You're 75000 kilometers
from the Klingon border.

14
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,942
Captain, are you seeing this?

15
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:56,935
My God.

16
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:18,930
I have a reading.
They've locked weapons on us!

17
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,093
Red alert!

18
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:23,189
Torpedo locked on us
at 320'- 2! Arm weapons!

19
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:27,581
Evasive pattern delta 5!

20
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:31,075
We're being cut like grass.

21
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,259
Fire all phasers!
Damage report.

22
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,555
Warp drive's been knocked out.
Never seen anything like this.

23
00:02:43,353 --> 00:02:45,648
Weapons offline.
Main power at 38%.

24
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:48,345
- They're firing another!
- All power to forward shields!

25
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,027
Help me...

26
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,815
maneuver has been lost.

27
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:05,813
Are shields even on?

28
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:07,845
decks 17 and 13, we have
confirmed casualties.

29
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:10,505
11% and dropping. 10%.
Shields at 9%.

30
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:12,701
All remaining power
to forward shields.

31
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:14,899
Prepare shuttles
for evacuation.

32
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:19,090
Hello.

33
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:21,785
My commander requests
the presence of your captain...

34
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:24,481
in order to negotiate
a ceasefire.

35
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:27,377
You will come aboard our ship
via shuttlecraft.

36
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:30,372
Your refusal would be unwise.

37
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,746
Walk with me.

38
00:03:50,237 --> 00:03:53,630
If I don't report in 15 minutes
evacuate the crew.

39
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:56,525
- Sir, we could...
- There is no outpost out here.

40
00:03:56,526 --> 00:04:00,219
Use autopilot and get off this ship.

41
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,716
Aye captain.

42
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:04,513
You're captain now, Mr. Kirk.

43
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:20,182
His heart rate is elevated.

44
00:05:41,344 --> 00:05:43,741
Look at the ship.

45
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:48,832
- Are you familiar with this craft?
- Who is your commander?

46
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,524
- Is that him?
- I will speak for captain Nero.

47
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:58,815
Then ask captain Nero: What gives him
the right to attack a Federation vessel.

48
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:15,086
Do you know the location of
ambassador Spock?

49
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:20,277
I'm unfamiliar with
ambassador Spock.

50
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:24,869
- What is the current star date?
- Star date?

51
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:29,262
2233.04.

52
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,955
Where are you from?

53
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:40,141
Terminated.

54
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:41,973
- Sir, they have a lock on our signal.
- They're launching again.

55
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:44,136
Bravo 6 maneuver fire, full spread!

56
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:57,845
I'm initiating general order 13,
we're evacuating!

57
00:06:57,846 --> 00:06:59,310
Sir.

58
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:06,695
All decks, this is the captain speaking,
evacuate the ship immediately.

59
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:08,891
Get your... to the shuttlecraft.
Begin evacuating...

60
00:07:08,892 --> 00:07:12,986
- That's George's voice. What's happening?
- We'll deliver it in the shuttle. Go!

61
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:27,059
- George.
- You're OK, thank God.

62
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,289
I have medical shuttle 37 standing by.
Get to it now. Can you do that?

63
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,951
- Yes.
- Everything's gonna be OK.

64
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:37,343
- Do exactly as I say, shuttle 37.
- George, it's coming.

65
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:40,538
- Our baby. It's coming now.
- I'm on my way.

66
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:50,620
Autopilot function has been destroyed.
Manual operation only.

67
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:54,514
Clear those decks now! Get to
the shuttles! Move! Move! Move!

68
00:07:58,406 --> 00:08:01,300
- That was a big one!
- Just keep breathing. You'll be fine.

69
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:04,796
- And the baby too, right?
- And the baby too.

70
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:12,283
Right here.

71
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:18,570
Captain to shuttle 37.
Is my wife on board?

72
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:21,265
- Yes sir, she is.
- I need you to go now. Do you hear me?

73
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:24,560
- We're waiting on you sir.
- No, just go, take off immediately.

74
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:26,491
- That's an order.
- Yes sir.

75
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:28,854
Wait. We're not going yet.

76
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,845
Please stop.

77
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:38,535
George, the shuttle's leaving.
Where are you?

78
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:42,630
Sweetheart, listen to me.
I'm not gonna be there.

79
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:44,924
- No.
- This is the only way you'll survive.

80
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,819
Please don't stay on the ship.
Come to me here.

81
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,050
The shuttles will never make it if I don't
fight them off.

82
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:53,010
George, I can't do this without you.

83
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:55,907
OK, I need you to push now!

84
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:37,335
SYSTEMS FAILING

85
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:44,023
COLLISION COURSE
ENGAGED

86
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:15,003
- What is it?
- It's a boy.

87
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:16,467
A boy?

88
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:22,557
- Tell me about him.
- He's beautiful.

89
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:26,749
George, you should be here.

90
00:10:26,848 --> 00:10:29,644
Impact alert.

91
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:34,234
- What are we gonna call him?
- We can name him after your father.

92
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:38,030
Tiberius, you kiddin' me?
No, that's the worst.

93
00:10:39,526 --> 00:10:42,722
Let's name him after your dad.
Let's call him Jim.

94
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:48,512
Jim. OK. Jim it is.

95
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:54,899
- Sweetheart can you hear me?
- I can hear...

96
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,997
I love you so much.

97
00:10:58,094 --> 00:10:59,692
I love you!

98
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:19,617
Hey, are you out of your mind?
That car is an antique.

99
00:12:19,618 --> 00:12:21,918
You think you can get away with this
just because your mother's off planet.

100
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,514
You get your ass back home now!
You live in my house buddy.

101
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:28,220
You live in my house
and that's my car.

102
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:32,123
You get one scratch on that car
and I'm gonna whip your ass...

103
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,332
Hey Johnny!

104
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,940
Citizen, pull over.

105
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:47,549
Noooo...!

106
00:14:13,257 --> 00:14:15,658
Is there a problem officer?

107
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:18,659
Citizen, what is your name?

108
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,061
My name is James Tiberius Kirk.

109
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,968
What is the formula
for the volume of a sphere?

110
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:44,668
4/3 PI times the radius cubed...

111
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:47,070
1.26...

112
00:14:56,573 --> 00:14:57,875
What is the dimensionality...

113
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:00,874
Dimensionality equals the
logarithm of n divided by...

114
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,809
non-excludability
and non-rivalry...

115
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,875
...4/3 PI times the radius...

116
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:08,177
...is morally praiseworthy
but not morally obligatory.

117
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,379
Spock.

118
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:17,880
I presume you've prepared
new insults for today?

119
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:20,682
Affirmative.

120
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:31,385
This is your 35th attempt to illicit
an emotional response from me.

121
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:34,185
You're neither Human nor Vulcan and
therefore have no place in this universe.

122
00:15:34,186 --> 00:15:37,487
Look, his Human eyes.
They look sad. Don't they.

123
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:41,089
Perhaps an emotional response
requires physical stimulae.

124
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,789
He's a traitor you know? Your father.

125
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,991
For marrying her. That Human whore.

126
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:19,403
They called you a traitor.

127
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:26,104
Emotions run deep within our race.

128
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:28,605
In many ways more deeply than in humans.

129
00:16:28,606 --> 00:16:32,908
Logic offers a serenity humans
seldom experience.

130
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:38,510
The control of feelings...
so that they do not control you.

131
00:16:41,011 --> 00:16:44,711
You suggest that I should be
completely Vulcan?

132
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,012
And yet you married a Human.

133
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:49,148
As ambassador to Earth it is my duty to
observe

134
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:52,515
and understand Human behavior.

135
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:57,416
Marrying your mother was... logical.

136
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:01,016
Spock.

137
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:05,418
You are fully capable
of deciding your own destiny.

138
00:17:05,918 --> 00:17:11,921
The question you face is:
Which path will you choose?

139
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:15,522
This is something only you can decide.

140
00:17:20,424 --> 00:17:23,824
Spock. Come here, let me see you.

141
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:28,326
- No.
- Spock.

142
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:39,930
There's no need to be anxious.
You'll do fine.

143
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:42,331
I am hardly anxious, mother.

144
00:17:42,332 --> 00:17:45,493
And fine has variable definitions,
fine is unacceptable.

145
00:17:47,004 --> 00:17:49,133
Okay.

146
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:59,838
- May I ask a personal query?
- Anything.

147
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,439
Should I choose to complete the Vulcan
discipline of Kolinahr.

148
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,841
and purge all emotion?

149
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:14,242
I trust you will not feel it reflects
judgment upon you.

150
00:18:16,244 --> 00:18:19,245
Oh Spock.

151
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:27,047
As always, whatever you choose to be,
you will have a proud mother.

152
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,449
You have surpassed the expectations
of your instructors.

153
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,551
Your final record is flawless.
With one exception.

154
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:43,354
I see that you have applied to
Starfleet as well.

155
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:46,153
It was logical to cultivate more options.

156
00:18:46,154 --> 00:18:51,156
Logical, but unnecessary. You are hereby
accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.

157
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:54,491
It is truly remarkable Spock
that you have achieved so much...

158
00:18:54,492 --> 00:18:56,857
despite your disadvantage.

159
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:59,959
All rise.

160
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:07,561
If you would clarify, minister?
To what disadvantage are you referring?

161
00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:10,263
Your Human mother.

162
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:17,064
Council, ministers, I must decline.

163
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:19,766
No Vulcan has ever declined
admission to this Academy.

164
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:23,052
But as I am half-human, your
record remains untarnished.

165
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:26,368
Spock, you have made a commitment
to honor the Vulcan way.

166
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:28,569
Why did you come before this
council today?

167
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,470
Was it to satisfy your emotional need
to rebel?

168
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,671
The only emotion I wish to convey
is gratitude.

169
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:40,074
Thank you, ministers,
for your consideration.

170
00:19:41,074 --> 00:19:43,775
Live long and prosper.

171
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:07,884
- Hi.
- Hey there.

172
00:20:11,985 --> 00:20:16,685
Hi. I'd like a Clabmin fire tea...
3 Budweiser Classics,

173
00:20:16,686 --> 00:20:20,186
2 Cardassian sunrises and...

174
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:23,088
- Try the Slusho, it's good.
- A Slusho mix, thank you.

175
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,989
That's a lot of drinks for a woman.

176
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,890
- And a shot of Jack, straight up.
- Make that two. Her shot's on me.

177
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:32,391
Her shot's on her.
Thanks, but no thanks.

178
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:35,526
Don't you at least wanna know my name
before you completely reject me?

179
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,092
I'm fine without it.

180
00:20:37,093 --> 00:20:40,795
You are fine without it.
It's Jim, Jim Kirk.

181
00:20:42,796 --> 00:20:46,296
If you don't tell me your name,
I'm gonna have to make one up.

182
00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:49,097
- It's Uhura.
- Uhura? No way.

183
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:51,333
That's the name I was gonna make
up for you.

184
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:54,098
- Uhura what?
- Just Uhura.

185
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:55,712
They don't have last names
in your world?

186
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,199
Uhura is my last name.

187
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,502
Well then you have...
your first name's Human?

188
00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:03,104
Excuse me buddy.

189
00:21:03,105 --> 00:21:06,354
So, you're a cadet, your studying.
What's your focus?

190
00:21:06,355 --> 00:21:09,004
Xenolinguistics. You have
no idea what that means.

191
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:13,907
The study of alien languages.
Morphology, phonology, syntax.

192
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,807
Means you've got a talented tongue.

193
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:19,207
I'm impressed.

194
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,308
For a moment there, I thought you
were just a dumb-hair colonial

195
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:23,344
who has sex with farm animals.

196
00:21:23,345 --> 00:21:26,711
Well, not only.

197
00:21:27,511 --> 00:21:29,411
This townie isn't bothering you, right?

198
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:32,347
Oh, beyond belief.
But it's nothing I can't handle.

199
00:21:32,348 --> 00:21:34,913
You could've handled me.
That's an invitation.

200
00:21:35,314 --> 00:21:39,014
- Hey. You better mind your manners.
- Oh relax cupcake, it was a joke.

201
00:21:39,015 --> 00:21:41,816
Hey farm boy, maybe you can't count.

202
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:43,717
There are 4 of us and 1 of you.

203
00:21:43,718 --> 00:21:47,518
So get some more guys and then it'll
be an even fight.

204
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,921
Guys. Stop it.

205
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:56,721
Stop it!

206
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,330
Enough!

207
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:28,633
Guys, he's had enough.

208
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,935
Outside. All of you.

209
00:22:36,036 --> 00:22:37,935
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

210
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:40,537
- What...
- I just bought a drink.

211
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:44,440
You all right, son?

212
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:47,440
You can whistle really loud,
you know that?

213
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,040
You know I couldn't believe it when
the bartender told me who you are.

214
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,443
- Who the hell am I, captain Pike?
- Your father's son.

215
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,243
Can I get another one?

216
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,744
For my dissertation
I was assigned USS Kelvin.

217
00:23:01,745 --> 00:23:05,946
Something I admired about your dad,
he didn't believe in no-win scenarios.

218
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:07,748
Sure learned his lesson.

219
00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:09,482
Well that depends
on how you define winning.

220
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:11,749
- You're here, aren't you?
- Thanks.

221
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,948
You know that instinct to leap without
looking, that was his nature too...

222
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:17,183
and in my opinion
something Starfleet's lost.

223
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:19,249
Why are you talking to me man?

224
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,652
Because I looked up your file while
you were drooling on the floor.

225
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,352
Your aptitude tests are off the charts, so
what is it?

226
00:23:26,953 --> 00:23:29,888
You like being the only genius level
repeat-offender in the mid-west?

227
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:31,454
Maybe I love it.

228
00:23:31,455 --> 00:23:35,056
So your dad dies, you can saddle for
less than an ordinary life.

229
00:23:35,256 --> 00:23:40,558
Or do you feel that you were meant for
something better? Something special?

230
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:45,759
- Enlist in Starfleet.
- Enlist?

231
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,495
You guys must be way down on your
recruiting quarter for the month.

232
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:51,461
If you're half the man your father was
Jim,

233
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:53,863
Starfleet could use you.

234
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:57,764
You can be an officer in 4 years,
you can have your own ship in 8.

235
00:23:59,365 --> 00:24:02,500
You understand what the Federation is,
don't you? It's important,

236
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:04,466
It's a peacekeeping and humanitarian
armada.

237
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:06,701
We done?

238
00:24:06,702 --> 00:24:09,368
I'm done.

239
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,670
Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new
recruits leaves tomorrow - 08:00.

240
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:24,174
Your father was captain of a starship
for 12 minutes.

241
00:24:24,774 --> 00:24:29,976
He saved 800 lives, including your
mother's and yours.

242
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:33,777
I dare you to do better.

243
00:25:57,907 --> 00:25:59,908
Nice ride man.

244
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:05,009
It's yours.

245
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,611
4 years? I'll do it in 3.

246
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:26,516
At ease gentlemen.

247
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:46,622
Never did get that first name.

248
00:26:46,623 --> 00:26:47,893
- You need a doctor.
- I told you people,

249
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:49,625
I don't need a doctor,
damn it. I am a doctor.

250
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:50,726
You need to get back
to your seat.

251
00:26:50,727 --> 00:26:52,560
I had one, in the bathroom
with no windows.

252
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:55,926
I suffer from aviofobia. That means
fear of dying in something that flies.

253
00:26:55,927 --> 00:26:59,228
Sir, for your own safety, sit down
or else I'll make you sit down!

254
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:04,930
- Fine.
- Thank you.

255
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:07,431
This is captain Pike, we've been cleared
for takeoff.

256
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:10,631
I may throw up on you.

257
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:14,033
- I think these things are pretty safe.
- Don't pander with me kid.

258
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:17,534
One tiny crack in the hull
and our blood boils in 13 seconds.

259
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:20,535
A solar flare might crop up,
cook us in our seats.

260
00:27:20,536 --> 00:27:23,436
And while youre sitting pretty
with a case of Andorian shingles,

261
00:27:23,437 --> 00:27:26,837
see if you're still so relaxed
when your eyeballs are bleeding.

262
00:27:26,838 --> 00:27:30,739
Space is disease and danger,
wrapped in darkness and silence.

263
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,641
Well I hate to break this to you,
but Starfleet operates in space.

264
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:36,643
Yeah, well...
I've got nowhere else to go,

265
00:27:36,644 --> 00:27:39,843
the ex wife took the whole
damn planet in the divorce.

266
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:42,844
All I've got left is my bones.

267
00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:52,347
- Jim Kirk.
- McCoy. Leonard McCoy.

268
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:15,256
Three years later.

269
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:42,199
Captain Nero. You've been
requested on the bridge, sir.

270
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,267
Ayel says it's time.

271
00:28:49,468 --> 00:28:53,069
Sir, we've arrived at the
coordinates we calculated.

272
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:56,169
There's nothing here. What
are your orders?

273
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,770
We wait.

274
00:28:57,771 --> 00:29:01,472
We wait for the one who allowed
our home to be destroyed.

275
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:04,773
As we've been doing for 25 years.

276
00:29:05,374 --> 00:29:08,373
- And once we've killed him?
- Kill him?

277
00:29:08,374 --> 00:29:12,676
I'm not gonna kill him.
I gonna make him watch.

278
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:28,681
Capture that ship.

279
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:32,083
Welcome back, Spock.

280
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:37,818
- Why are you so happy?
- I do not know what you're talking about.

281
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,685
- No, I don't suppose you do.
- Hello ladies.

282
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:42,920
- I'm taking the test again.
- You've got to be kidding.

283
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:44,886
Yeah, tomorrow morning.
And I want you there.

284
00:29:44,887 --> 00:29:46,088
You know I've got
better things to do...

285
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:48,187
than watch you embarrass
yourself for the 3rd time.

286
00:29:48,188 --> 00:29:49,587
I am a doctor, Jim. I'm busy.

287
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,988
Bones, it doesn't bother you
that no ones ever passed the test.

288
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:54,675
Jim, it's Kobayashi Maru.
No one passes the test.

289
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:57,791
And no one goes back
for seconds, let alone thirds.

290
00:29:57,991 --> 00:30:00,192
I've gotta study.

291
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:02,493
Study, my ass.

292
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,095
Jim, I think I love you.

293
00:30:08,695 --> 00:30:11,496
- That is so weird.
- Lights.

294
00:30:12,697 --> 00:30:15,132
- Did you just say that is so weird.
- Yeah, I did, but I...

295
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:16,997
You don't love me too?

296
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:17,998
Oh, no, my roommate.

297
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,269
I thought you said
she was gone for the night.

298
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,230
Obviously she's not, quick, you
gotta... just get under the bed.

299
00:30:21,231 --> 00:30:23,501
- Under...?
- Look, just get under the bed.

300
00:30:23,502 --> 00:30:25,302
- She can't see you here.
- Why not?

301
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:27,636
Because I promised her I'd stop
bringing guys back to the dorm.

302
00:30:27,637 --> 00:30:30,203
- Well how... how many guys have y...?
- Just d... just down.

303
00:30:32,404 --> 00:30:34,539
- Hey.
- Hey. How are you?

304
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,704
- Good.
- Strangest thing...

305
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:38,440
I was in the long range
sensor lab.

306
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:40,305
Yeah, I...
I thought all night...

307
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:44,908
I was tracking solar systems and I
picked up an emergency transmission.

308
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,707
- Really?
- Yeah.

309
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,808
From a Klingon prison planet.

310
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:50,009
- No.
- Yeah.

311
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,810
A Klingon armada
was destroyed, 47 ships.

312
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:56,012
So, you're not going back
to the lab tonight?

313
00:30:59,613 --> 00:31:01,513
- Gaila, who is he?
- Who's who?

314
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:03,914
The mouth-breather
hiding under your bed.

315
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:06,215
- You could hear me breathing?
- You.

316
00:31:06,216 --> 00:31:08,415
- Big day tomorrow.
- You're gonna fail.

317
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:10,016
- Gail, see you around.
- Get out.

318
00:31:10,017 --> 00:31:11,512
If I pass will you tell me
your first name?

319
00:31:11,513 --> 00:31:12,517
No. Good night.

320
00:31:12,518 --> 00:31:16,820
I think the fact that you picked up
a transmission is very impress...

321
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,120
We're receiving a distress signal
from the USS Kobayashi Maru.

322
00:31:21,121 --> 00:31:23,321
The ship has lost power
and is stranded.

323
00:31:23,322 --> 00:31:25,422
Starfleet command has
ordered us to rescue them.

324
00:31:25,423 --> 00:31:31,124
Starfleet command has ordered
us to rescue them... captain.

325
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:33,501
Two Klingon vessels have
entered the neutral zone...

326
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:35,526
and are locking weapons on us.

327
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,926
- That's okay.
- That's okay?

328
00:31:37,927 --> 00:31:39,627
Yeah, don't worry about it.

329
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:41,730
Did he say
don't worry about it?

330
00:31:41,731 --> 00:31:44,029
Is he not taking
the simulation seriously?

331
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,929
Three more Klingon war birds
decloaking and targeting our ship.

332
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,871
I don't suppose this
is a problem either?

333
00:31:48,872 --> 00:31:50,130
They're firing, captain.

334
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:51,966
Alert medical bay
to prepare to receive...

335
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:54,232
all crew members
from the damaged ship.

336
00:31:54,233 --> 00:31:56,234
And how do you expect us
to rescue them...

337
00:31:56,235 --> 00:31:58,735
when we're surrounded
by Klingons... captain?

338
00:31:58,736 --> 00:32:01,535
Alert medical.

339
00:32:02,636 --> 00:32:04,938
Our ship is being hit.
Shields at 60%.

340
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:06,137
I understand.

341
00:32:06,138 --> 00:32:09,037
Should we,
I don't know, fight back?

342
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:11,939
- No.
- Of course not.

343
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:20,742
What is this?
What's going on?

344
00:32:24,344 --> 00:32:26,544
Hm. Arm photons. Prepare to fire
on the Klingon war birds.

345
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,779
- Yes, sir.
- Jim, their shields are still up.

346
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,546
Are they?

347
00:32:31,947 --> 00:32:35,747
- No, they're not.
- Fire on all enemy ships.

348
00:32:35,748 --> 00:32:38,348
One photon each should do
let's not waste ammunition.

349
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:40,748
Target locked an acquired
on all war birds.

350
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:42,649
Firing.

351
00:32:46,451 --> 00:32:47,750
All ships destroyed, captain.

352
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:49,050
Begin rescue
of the stranded crew.

353
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:52,352
So, we've managed to eliminate
all enemy ships,

354
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:54,353
no one on board was injured,

355
00:32:54,354 --> 00:33:00,355
and the successful rescue of the
Kobayashi Maru crew is under way.

356
00:33:04,157 --> 00:33:07,359
How the hell did that kid
beat your test?

357
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,459
I do not know.

358
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,862
This session has been called
to resolve a troubling matter.

359
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:18,562
James T. Kirk, step forward.

360
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:22,763
Cadet Kirk, evidence has been submitted
to this council,

361
00:33:22,764 --> 00:33:25,699
suggesting that you violated the
ethical code of conduct

362
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,566
pursuing to regulation 17.43
of the Starfleet code.

363
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,967
Is there anything you care to say
before we begin, sir?

364
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:38,569
Yes. I believe I have the right
to face my accuser directly?

365
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:44,071
Step forward please.

366
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:48,772
This is commander Spock. He is one
of our most distinguished graduates.

367
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:52,774
He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru
exam for the last 4 years.

368
00:33:54,475 --> 00:33:56,076
Commander.

369
00:33:56,276 --> 00:33:59,276
Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed to
install and activate a subroutine...

370
00:33:59,277 --> 00:34:02,578
in the programming code, thereby
changing the conditions of the test.

371
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,280
- Your point being?
- In academic vernacular. You cheated.

372
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,182
Let me ask you something I think
we all know the answer to.

373
00:34:13,482 --> 00:34:17,882
The test itself is a cheat, isn't it?
You programmed it to be unwinnable.

374
00:34:17,883 --> 00:34:20,583
Your argument precludes
the ability of a no-win scenario?

375
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:22,784
I don't believe
in no-win scenarios.

376
00:34:22,785 --> 00:34:23,987
Then not only did you
violate the rules,

377
00:34:23,988 --> 00:34:26,386
you also failed to understand
the principle lesson.

378
00:34:26,387 --> 00:34:27,886
Please, enlighten me.

379
00:34:27,887 --> 00:34:30,093
You of all people
should know, cadet Kirk,

380
00:34:30,094 --> 00:34:32,689
a captain cannot cheat death.

381
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,089
- I of all people?
- Your father,

382
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,292
Lt. George Kirk assumed command
of his vessel...

383
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:41,891
before being killed in action,
did he not?

384
00:34:41,892 --> 00:34:43,894
I don't think you like the fact
that I beat your test.

385
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:46,293
Further more you have failed to
define the purpose of the test.

386
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:49,695
- Enlighten me again.
- The purpose to experience fear.

387
00:34:50,495 --> 00:34:53,996
Fear in the face of certain death.
To accept that fear

388
00:34:53,997 --> 00:34:56,997
and maintain control of oneself
and one's crew.

389
00:34:56,998 --> 00:35:00,398
This is a quality expected in
every Starfleet captain.

390
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,900
Excuse me, sir.

391
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:13,603
We've received a distress
call from Vulcan.

392
00:35:13,604 --> 00:35:16,604
With our primary fleet engaged
in the Laurentian system,

393
00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:20,205
I hereby order all cadets to report
to hangar 1 immediately.

394
00:35:20,206 --> 00:35:21,706
Dismissed.

395
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,508
- Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
- I do not know.

396
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:32,910
But I like him.

397
00:35:37,812 --> 00:35:39,412
Bracer, USS Farragut.

398
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:42,813
McCoy, USS Enterprise.
McGrath, USS Walcott.

399
00:35:42,814 --> 00:35:44,314
Spader, USS Hood.

400
00:35:44,315 --> 00:35:46,516
Welcome to Starfleet.
Godspeed.

401
00:35:48,516 --> 00:35:51,016
He didn't call my name.

402
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:56,017
Commander, sir, you didn't call
my name, Kirk, James T.

403
00:35:56,018 --> 00:35:59,418
Kirk, you're on academic suspension,
that means you're grounded

404
00:35:59,419 --> 00:36:01,619
until the academy board rules.

405
00:36:04,221 --> 00:36:07,121
Jim, the board will rule in your favor.

406
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:09,222
Most likely.

407
00:36:10,323 --> 00:36:13,224
Look Jim, I've gotta go.

408
00:36:13,324 --> 00:36:16,325
Yeah. Yeah, go. Be safe.

409
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:26,329
- Excuse me.
- Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

410
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,531
Damn it.

411
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:36,031
Come with me.

412
00:36:36,032 --> 00:36:39,632
Uhura, USS Farragut.
Petrovsky, USS Antares.

413
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:42,134
Go to your stations and good luck.

414
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,836
- Bones, where are we going?
- You'll see.

415
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:51,737
- Commander, a word?
- Yes, lieutenant?

416
00:36:51,738 --> 00:36:54,138
- Was I not one of your top students?
- Indeed you were.

417
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:56,940
And did I not on multiple
occasions demonstrate...

418
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:59,148
an exceptional oral
sensitivity, and I quote...

419
00:36:59,149 --> 00:37:02,040
"an unparalleled ability
to identify sonic anomalies...

420
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,876
in subspace transmission tests"?

421
00:37:03,877 --> 00:37:05,343
Consistently, yes.

422
00:37:05,344 --> 00:37:07,144
And while you were well aware
that I'm qualified...

423
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:08,878
and desire to serve
on the USS Enterprise,

424
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:10,943
I'm assigned to the Farragut?

425
00:37:10,944 --> 00:37:14,145
It was an attempt to avoid
the appearance of favoritism.

426
00:37:14,146 --> 00:37:16,747
No. I'm assigned
to the Enterprise.

427
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:22,949
- Yes, I believe you are.
- Thank you.

428
00:37:23,749 --> 00:37:26,049
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing you a favor.

429
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,050
I couldnt just leave you there
looking all pathetic. Take a seat.

430
00:37:29,051 --> 00:37:30,882
Let me give you a vaccine
against viral infection...

431
00:37:30,883 --> 00:37:33,052
from the Ovaran mud flies.

432
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:36,453
- What for?
- To give you the symptoms.

433
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:37,554
What're you talking about?

434
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,454
You're gonna start to lose
vision in your left eye.

435
00:37:39,455 --> 00:37:40,854
Yeah, I already have.

436
00:37:40,855 --> 00:37:43,856
Oh, and you're gonna get a really
bad headache and flop sweat.

437
00:37:43,857 --> 00:37:46,958
- You call this a favor?
- Yeah, you owe me one.

438
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:53,059
Kirk, James T. He is not cleared
for duty aboard the Enterprise.

439
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,931
Medical code states the treatment
and transport of a patient is...

440
00:37:55,932 --> 00:37:58,860
to be determined at the discretion
of his attending physician.

441
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:01,662
Which is me.
So I'm taking Mr. Kirk aboard.

442
00:38:01,663 --> 00:38:04,263
Or you would you like
to explain to captain Pike...

443
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:05,998
why Enterprise warped
into a crisis...

444
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:08,865
without one of its
senior medical officers?

445
00:38:09,465 --> 00:38:12,366
- As you were.
- As you were. Come on.

446
00:38:30,473 --> 00:38:32,173
I might throw up on you.

447
00:38:32,374 --> 00:38:34,974
Jim, you've gotta look at this.

448
00:38:34,975 --> 00:38:37,576
- Jim, look.
- What?

449
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:36,295
We need to get you changed.

450
00:39:36,296 --> 00:39:38,231
I don't feel right.
I feel like I'm leaking.

451
00:39:38,232 --> 00:39:40,797
Damn, it's that
pointy-eared bastard.

452
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,903
- Mr. Spock.
- Captain.

453
00:40:00,904 --> 00:40:03,905
- Engineering reports ready for launch.
- Thank you.

454
00:40:03,906 --> 00:40:06,541
Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden
voyage of our newest flagship

455
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:09,607
deserves more pompon circumstance
that we can afford today.

456
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,009
The christening will just have to
be our reward for a safe return.

457
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:14,709
Carry on.

458
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,110
All decks, this is Captain Pike.
Prepare for immediate departure.

459
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:18,410
Helm, thrusters.

460
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:21,011
? retracted, captain, dock
control reports ready.

461
00:40:21,012 --> 00:40:24,013
Thrusters fired.
Separating from space dock.

462
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:36,317
The fleet's cleared space dock, captain.
All ships ready for warp.

463
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:38,919
- Set course for Vulcan.
- Aye-aye, captain.

464
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:41,519
Course laid in.

465
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:44,420
Maximum warp. Punch it.

466
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:04,161
- Lieutenant, where's helmsmen McKenna?
- He has lung worms sir.

467
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:06,127
He couldn't report to his post.

468
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:09,729
- I'm Hikaru Sulu.
- And you are a pilot, right?

469
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:14,330
Very much so, sir. I'm...
I'm not sure what's wrong here.

470
00:41:14,331 --> 00:41:16,631
Is the parking brake on?

471
00:41:16,632 --> 00:41:17,732
No.

472
00:41:17,733 --> 00:41:18,732
I figured it out, I'm just...

473
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:21,433
Have you disengaged the external
inertial dampener?

474
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:28,836
- Ready for warp, sir.
- Let's punch it.

475
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:37,439
- Where are we?
- Medical bay.

476
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,474
- This isn't worth it.
- A little suffering's good for the soul.

477
00:41:39,475 --> 00:41:40,940
Hi, how are you?

478
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,841
- My mouth is itchy. Is that normal?
- Well, those symptoms won't last long.

479
00:41:44,842 --> 00:41:47,977
- I'm going to give you a mild sedative.
- Oh, I wish I didn't know you.

480
00:41:47,978 --> 00:41:49,643
Don't be such an infant.

481
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:53,344
How long is it supposed to...

482
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,446
Unbelievable.

483
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:57,546
Engines at maximum warp captain.

484
00:41:57,547 --> 00:41:59,946
Russian whiz kid, what's your name?
Cheikov? Chirpov?

485
00:41:59,947 --> 00:42:03,147
- Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andrejevic, sir.
- Fine.

486
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:06,148
Chekov, Pavel Andrejevic,
begin ship wide mission broadcast.

487
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,350
Yes, sir. Happy to.

488
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:12,450
Ensign authorization code
95 Wictor Wictor 2.

489
00:42:12,451 --> 00:42:14,651
Authorization not recognized.

490
00:42:14,652 --> 00:42:21,454
Ensign authorization code
95 Victor Victor 2.

491
00:42:21,554 --> 00:42:23,554
Access granted.

492
00:42:23,555 --> 00:42:26,556
May I have your attention please.

493
00:42:26,656 --> 00:42:32,157
At 22:00, telemetry detected an anomaly
in the neutral zone.

494
00:42:32,158 --> 00:42:35,858
What appeared to be a lightning
storm in space.

495
00:42:35,859 --> 00:42:40,760
Soon after, Starfleet received a distress
signal from the Vulcan high command

496
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:44,661
that their planet was experiencing
seismic activity.

497
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:48,563
Our mission is to assess the
condition of Vulcan

498
00:42:48,564 --> 00:42:52,564
and assist in evacuations
if necessary.

499
00:42:52,565 --> 00:42:57,767
We should be arriving at Vulcan within
3 minutes. Thank you for your time.

500
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,767
Lightning storm.

501
00:43:00,768 --> 00:43:03,969
Aah Jim, you're awake. How do you feel?

502
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:07,571
- Good God, man!
- What? Aah!

503
00:43:09,272 --> 00:43:12,571
- What the hell's this?
- A reaction to the vaccine. Damn it.

504
00:43:12,572 --> 00:43:15,172
Nurse Chapel, I need 50cc
of cortisone.

505
00:43:15,173 --> 00:43:16,674
Yes, sir.

506
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:22,475
May I... Appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.

507
00:43:23,276 --> 00:43:24,576
We've gotta stop the ship.

508
00:43:24,577 --> 00:43:27,578
Jim. I'm not kidding. You need
to keep your heart rate down.

509
00:43:28,378 --> 00:43:30,177
Computer, locate crew member Uhura.

510
00:43:30,178 --> 00:43:32,763
I haven't seen a reaction this
severe since medical school.

511
00:43:32,764 --> 00:43:35,781
- We're flying into a trap!
- Damn it, Jim! Stand still.

512
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:38,982
Stop it!

513
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:49,298
- Uhura, Uhura...
- Kirk. What're you doing here?

514
00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:51,136
Transmission from the Klingon prison
planet, what exactly did it say?

515
00:43:51,137 --> 00:43:53,488
Oh my God, what's wrong
with your hands?

516
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:55,787
Who is responsible
for the Klingon attack?

517
00:43:55,788 --> 00:43:58,288
- And was the ship Romu...?
- Was the ship what?

518
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:00,323
- What's happening to my mouth?
- You got numb tongue?

519
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:02,589
- Numb tongue?!
- I can fix that.

520
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,626
- Was the ship what?
- Romulan.

521
00:44:04,627 --> 00:44:06,192
- What?
- Romulan.

522
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:07,293
- Romulan?
- Yeah.

523
00:44:07,294 --> 00:44:09,393
- Yes.
- Yeah!

524
00:44:43,805 --> 00:44:47,707
Prod Nero seven Federation
ships are on their way.

525
00:44:49,408 --> 00:44:50,891
- Jim!
- What's going on?

526
00:44:50,892 --> 00:44:52,707
- Jim, come back.
- Captain!

527
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:54,308
Captain Pike, sir,
we have to stop the ship.

528
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:56,809
Kirk, how the hell did you get
on board the Enterprise?

529
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,610
Captain, this man is under
the influence of a...

530
00:44:58,611 --> 00:45:00,209
- severe reaction to a vaccine.
- Bones, plea...

531
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,310
He's completely delusional...

532
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,513
Vulcan is not a experiencing
a natural disaster,

533
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:04,912
it's being attacked
by Romulans.

534
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:08,313
Romulans? Cadet Kirk, I think you've
had enough attention for one day...

535
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:10,848
McCoy, take him back to medical.
We'll have words later.

536
00:45:10,849 --> 00:45:12,714
- Aye captain.
- Sir, that same anomaly...

537
00:45:12,715 --> 00:45:14,814
Mr. Kirk is not cleared to be
aboard this vessel, captain...

538
00:45:14,815 --> 00:45:16,215
Look, I get it, you're a great...

539
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:17,816
I'd love to do it again
with you soon...

540
00:45:17,817 --> 00:45:19,401
- I can remove the cadet...
- Try it!

541
00:45:19,402 --> 00:45:21,016
This cadet is trying
to save the bridge!

542
00:45:21,017 --> 00:45:24,017
By recommending a full stop
mid-warp doing a rescue mission?

543
00:45:24,018 --> 00:45:25,753
It's not a rescue mission.
Listen to me. It's an attack.

544
00:45:25,754 --> 00:45:28,420
Based on what facts?

545
00:45:29,421 --> 00:45:32,520
That same anomaly,
a lightning storm in space

546
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,521
that we saw today, also occurred
on the day of my birth.

547
00:45:34,522 --> 00:45:37,523
Before a Romulan ship attacked
the USS Kelvin.

548
00:45:37,524 --> 00:45:39,624
You know that, sir.
I've read your dissertation.

549
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:42,224
That ship, which had formidable
and advanced weaponry...

550
00:45:42,225 --> 00:45:44,125
was never seen
or heard from again.

551
00:45:44,126 --> 00:45:46,161
The Kelvin attacked a place on
the edge of Klingon space.

552
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:48,827
And at 23:00 last night
there was an attack.

553
00:45:48,828 --> 00:45:52,728
47 Klingon war birds destroyed
by Romulans, sir.

554
00:45:52,729 --> 00:45:55,864
And it was reported that the Romulans
were in one ship, one massive ship.

555
00:45:55,865 --> 00:45:58,831
And you know
of this Klingon attack how?

556
00:46:00,731 --> 00:46:04,533
Sir, I intercepted and translated
the message myself.

557
00:46:04,733 --> 00:46:07,468
- Kirk's report is accurate.
- We're warping into a trap, sir.

558
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:10,435
The Romulans are waiting for us.
I promise you that.

559
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,736
The cadet's logic is sound.

560
00:46:13,936 --> 00:46:16,178
And Lt. Uhura's is unmatched
in xenolinguistics.

561
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:17,837
We would be wise
to accept her conclusion.

562
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:20,937
Scan Vulcan space. Check for
any transmissions in Romulan.

563
00:46:20,938 --> 00:46:24,539
Sir, I'm not sure I can distinguish
the Romulan language from Vulcan.

564
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,475
What about you?
Do you speak Romulan, cadet?

565
00:46:26,476 --> 00:46:28,141
Uhura. All 3 dialects, sir.

566
00:46:28,142 --> 00:46:31,441
- Uhura, relieve the lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

567
00:46:31,442 --> 00:46:32,942
Hannity, hail the USS Truman.

568
00:46:32,943 --> 00:46:35,578
All the other ships are out of warp
sir and have arrived at Vulcan,

569
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:37,844
but we seem to have lost all contact.

570
00:46:37,845 --> 00:46:42,445
Sir, I pick up no Romulan transmission
or transmission of any kind in the area.

571
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:45,347
It's because they're being attacked.

572
00:46:49,149 --> 00:46:51,249
Shields up. Red alert.

573
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:55,750
Arrival at Vulcan
in 5 seconds.

574
00:46:55,751 --> 00:46:59,353
4... 3... 2...

575
00:47:00,353 --> 00:47:02,953
- Emergency evasives.
- Running, sir.

576
00:47:10,456 --> 00:47:12,091
- Damage report.
- Deflector shields are holding.

577
00:47:12,092 --> 00:47:14,758
All stations.
Engineering, Olson, report.

578
00:47:24,161 --> 00:47:26,061
Full reverse. Come about starboard, 90.

579
00:47:26,062 --> 00:47:28,163
Drop us down underneath them, Sulu.

580
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:50,170
- Sir, there's another Federation ship.
- Destroy it too.

581
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:51,170
Fire torpedoes.

582
00:47:51,171 --> 00:47:52,370
Captain, they're locking torpedoes.

583
00:47:52,371 --> 00:47:55,573
Divert auxiliary power from port
nossel to forward shields.

584
00:48:02,675 --> 00:48:05,275
- Sulu, status report.
- Shields at 32%.

585
00:48:05,276 --> 00:48:07,676
Their weapons are powerful, sir.
We can't take another hit like that.

586
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:09,377
- Get me Starfleet command.
- Captain.

587
00:48:09,378 --> 00:48:12,277
The Romulan ship has lowered some
kind of high energy pulse device

588
00:48:12,278 --> 00:48:13,478
into the Vulcan atmosphere.

589
00:48:13,479 --> 00:48:16,379
It's signal appears to be blocking our
communications and transporter abilities.

590
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,081
All power to forward shields.
Prepare to fire all weapons.

591
00:48:23,382 --> 00:48:24,881
Weapons ready.

592
00:48:24,882 --> 00:48:26,383
Wait!

593
00:48:26,483 --> 00:48:29,784
- Gohol, magnify!
- Yes, sir.

594
00:48:33,885 --> 00:48:36,186
Captain, we're being hailed.

595
00:48:37,087 --> 00:48:39,788
Hello.

596
00:48:40,188 --> 00:48:42,888
I am the captain Christopher Pike.
To whom am I speaking?

597
00:48:43,189 --> 00:48:45,189
Hi Christopher. I am Nero.

598
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,990
You've declared war against
the Federation. Withdraw...

599
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,591
and I'll agree
to arrange a conference...

600
00:48:49,592 --> 00:48:51,290
with Romulan leadership
at a neutral location.

601
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:55,893
I do not speak for the Empire.
We stand apart.

602
00:48:56,894 --> 00:49:00,896
As does your Vulcan crew member.
Isn't that right, Spock?

603
00:49:03,296 --> 00:49:06,296
Pardon me, I do not believe that
you and I are acquainted.

604
00:49:06,297 --> 00:49:07,897
No, we're not.

605
00:49:07,898 --> 00:49:09,798
Not yet.

606
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:13,299
Spock, there's something
I would like you to see.

607
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,801
Captain Pike, your transporter
has been disabled.

608
00:49:18,802 --> 00:49:22,803
As you can see, by the rest of
the armada, you have no choice.

609
00:49:23,203 --> 00:49:27,605
You will man a shuttle. Come aboard
the Narada for negotiations.

610
00:49:27,905 --> 00:49:30,206
That is all.

611
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:40,509
- Theyll kill you, you know that.
- Your survival is unlikely.

612
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,994
Captain, we gain nothing
by diplomacy.

613
00:49:41,995 --> 00:49:43,609
Going over to that ship
is a mistake.

614
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:45,312
I too agree. You should
rethink your strategy.

615
00:49:45,313 --> 00:49:47,012
I understand that.

616
00:49:47,712 --> 00:49:51,114
I need officers who've been trained
in advanced hand to hand combat.

617
00:49:51,213 --> 00:49:53,514
I have training, sir.

618
00:49:53,614 --> 00:49:55,514
Come with me.

619
00:49:55,515 --> 00:49:57,915
Kirk, you too. You're not
supposed to be here anyway.

620
00:49:57,916 --> 00:50:00,917
- Chekov, you have the con.
- Aye, Captain.

621
00:50:21,624 --> 00:50:23,724
Prepare the red matter.

622
00:50:25,225 --> 00:50:27,726
Yes, sir.

623
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,925
Without transporters
we can't beam off the ship.

624
00:51:06,926 --> 00:51:09,341
We can't assist Vulcan.
We can't do our job.

625
00:51:09,342 --> 00:51:14,442
Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and engineer Olson
will space-jump from the shuttle.

626
00:51:14,443 --> 00:51:17,243
You will land on that machine they've
lowered into the atmosphere...

627
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:20,445
that's scrambling our gear, you'll
get inside, you'll disable it...

628
00:51:20,446 --> 00:51:22,044
then you'll beam back
to the ship.

629
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:25,447
Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in
command of the Enterprise.

630
00:51:25,547 --> 00:51:28,147
Once we have transport capability
and communication back up

631
00:51:28,148 --> 00:51:31,148
you'll contact Starfleet and report
what the hell's going on here.

632
00:51:31,149 --> 00:51:33,248
And if all else fails, fall back...

633
00:51:33,249 --> 00:51:35,283
and rendezvous with the fleet
in the Laurentian system.

634
00:51:35,284 --> 00:51:36,849
Kirk, I'm promoting you
to first officer.

635
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,050
- What?
- Captain?

636
00:51:38,051 --> 00:51:41,351
Please, I apologize. The complexities
of Human pranks escape me.

637
00:51:41,352 --> 00:51:43,451
It's not a prank, Spock.

638
00:51:43,452 --> 00:51:46,653
And I am not the captain, you are.

639
00:51:47,154 --> 00:51:49,055
Let's go.

640
00:51:51,056 --> 00:51:53,855
Sir, after we knock out that drill,
what happens to you?

641
00:51:53,856 --> 00:51:55,657
I guess you have to come
and get me.

642
00:51:56,057 --> 00:51:59,158
Careful with the ship, Spock.
She's brand new.

643
00:52:09,962 --> 00:52:12,547
- Dr. Puri, report.
- It's McCoy.

644
00:52:12,548 --> 00:52:15,564
Doctor Puri was on deck 6.
He's dead.

645
00:52:16,364 --> 00:52:19,265
Then you have just inherited his
responsibility as chief medical officer.

646
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:21,967
Yeah, tell me something
I don't know.

647
00:52:25,367 --> 00:52:29,569
Shuttle 89, USS Enterprise,
you are clear...

648
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:33,469
- You've got the charges, right?
- Oh yeah.

649
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:36,370
Can't wait to kick
some Romulan ass.

650
00:52:36,371 --> 00:52:39,173
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.

651
00:52:57,979 --> 00:52:59,979
So what kinda combat training
do you have?

652
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,480
Fencing.

653
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,382
Pre-jump.

654
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:13,984
Shuttle commander, you are clear
from USS Enterprise...

655
00:53:20,288 --> 00:53:22,387
Gentlemen, we're approaching
the drop zone.

656
00:53:22,388 --> 00:53:25,288
You have one shot
to land on that platform.

657
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:28,590
They may have defenses, so pull
your chute as late as possible.

658
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:32,391
3... 2... 1.

659
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:35,583
Remember, the Enterprise won't
be able to beam you back...

660
00:53:35,584 --> 00:53:37,693
until you've turned off
that drill.

661
00:53:39,394 --> 00:53:41,095
Good luck.

662
00:54:01,903 --> 00:54:04,802
Away team is entering
the atmosphere, sir.

663
00:54:04,803 --> 00:54:06,904
20000 m.

664
00:54:30,913 --> 00:54:33,212
Approaching the platform
at 5800 m.

665
00:54:33,213 --> 00:54:37,415
Kirk to Enterprise.
Distance to target 5000 m.

666
00:54:39,915 --> 00:54:41,915
4600 m from the platform.

667
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:43,616
4100 m to target.

668
00:54:45,317 --> 00:54:46,916
4000 m.

669
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:49,317
3000 m.

670
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:52,119
2000 m.
Pull the chute.

671
00:54:57,021 --> 00:55:00,622
- 2000 m.
- Pull your chute, Olson.

672
00:55:00,623 --> 00:55:02,521
No, not yet. Not yet.

673
00:55:02,522 --> 00:55:05,824
- 1500 m.
- Open the chute!

674
00:55:06,024 --> 00:55:09,025
- Olson, pull your chute!
- 1000 m.

675
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:23,229
Olson!

676
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:25,931
Olson is gone, sir.

677
00:55:45,538 --> 00:55:47,339
Kirk has landed, sir.

678
00:57:50,983 --> 00:57:52,883
Gimme your hand.

679
00:57:59,786 --> 00:58:02,187
Olson had the charges.

680
00:58:02,587 --> 00:58:04,987
I know.

681
00:58:05,887 --> 00:58:08,989
- What do we do?
- This.

682
00:58:20,893 --> 00:58:24,393
The jamming signal's gone. Transport
abilities are reestablished.

683
00:58:24,394 --> 00:58:26,394
Transporter control
is reengaged sir.

684
00:58:26,395 --> 00:58:29,430
Check all gravitational sensors. I wanna
know what they were doing to the planet.

685
00:58:29,431 --> 00:58:32,397
Aye, Commander.
Captain. Sorry, captain.

686
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:40,299
The drill's been sabotaged sir but
we have reached the planet's core.

687
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,801
Launch red matter.

688
00:58:56,306 --> 00:58:59,758
Kirk to Enterprise. They just
launched something at the planet...

689
00:58:59,759 --> 00:59:01,507
through the hole
they just drilled.

690
00:59:01,508 --> 00:59:04,508
- Do you copy Enterprise?
- Yes, sir.

691
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:08,209
Captain, gravitational sensors
are off the scale.

692
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:13,011
If my calculations are correct,
they're creating a singularity...

693
00:59:13,012 --> 00:59:16,513
that will consume the planet.

694
00:59:17,913 --> 00:59:21,514
They're creating a black hole
at the center of Vulcan?

695
00:59:21,515 --> 00:59:23,015
Yes.

696
00:59:23,016 --> 00:59:25,116
How long does the planet have?

697
00:59:26,216 --> 00:59:28,717
Minutes, sir. Minutes.

698
00:59:29,518 --> 00:59:31,919
Alert Vulcan command center to
signal a planet wide evacuation...

699
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,009
all channels, all frequencies.

700
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,253
- Spock, wait.
- Maintain standard orbit.

701
00:59:34,254 --> 00:59:36,119
- Yes, sir.
- Where are you going?

702
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,921
To evacuate
the Vulcan High Council.

703
00:59:37,922 --> 00:59:39,420
Their task is to protect
our cultural history,

704
00:59:39,421 --> 00:59:41,556
- My parents will be among them.
- Can't you beam them out?

705
00:59:41,557 --> 00:59:44,022
That is impossible. They will
be in the Katric ark.

706
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,722
I must get them myself.

707
00:59:45,723 --> 00:59:49,024
- Chekov, you have the con.
- Aye.

708
00:59:51,626 --> 00:59:54,260
Kirk to Enterprise.
Beam us out of here.

709
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:56,227
Stand by, locking on your signal.

710
00:59:56,527 --> 00:59:59,027
- Retract the drill. Let's move out
- Yes, sir.

711
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,929
Fold up.

712
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:06,230
I can't lock on to them.
Don't move. Don't move!

713
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:08,531
Hey, Sulu!

714
01:00:15,434 --> 01:00:17,535
Sulu!

715
01:00:19,636 --> 01:00:21,937
Hold on.

716
01:00:23,437 --> 01:00:25,937
I've gotcha.
Now pull my chute.

717
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:36,340
Kirk to Enterprise!
We're falling without a chute!

718
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,403
Beam us up!

719
01:00:37,404 --> 01:00:39,377
I'm sorry I can't lock on
to your signal.

720
01:00:39,378 --> 01:00:41,243
- Beam us up!
- You're moving too fast.

721
01:00:41,244 --> 01:00:44,045
I can do that. I can do that!

722
01:00:44,244 --> 01:00:46,044
- Take the con.
- Aye, sir.

723
01:00:46,045 --> 01:00:47,647
The black hole's expanding.

724
01:00:47,648 --> 01:00:50,497
We won't reach minimum safe distance
if we don't leave immediately.

725
01:00:51,747 --> 01:00:54,548
Move. Move... I can do that.
I can do that. Move. Move...

726
01:00:56,648 --> 01:00:59,949
Give me manual control,
I can lock on. Beam us up!

727
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:04,150
- Enterprise, where are you?
- Hold on. Hold on! Hold on!

728
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:09,151
Now! Now! Now! Do it now!
Now! Now! Now!

729
01:01:09,152 --> 01:01:15,054
Hold on. Hold on. Compensating
gravitational pull. Aaand...

730
01:01:18,456 --> 01:01:19,956
Gotcha.

731
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,061
- Thanks.
- No problem.

732
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:36,862
Clear the pad. I'm beaming to
the surface.

733
01:01:37,963 --> 01:01:39,963
The surface of what?

734
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:43,064
What, you're going down there?
Are you nuts?

735
01:01:43,065 --> 01:01:45,865
- Spock, you can't do that.
- Energize.

736
01:02:24,709 --> 01:02:25,910
Spock?

737
01:02:25,911 --> 01:02:28,280
The planet has only
seconds left, we must evacuate.

738
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:31,282
Mother, now.

739
01:02:51,975 --> 01:02:54,074
Spock to Enterprise.
Get us out now.

740
01:02:54,075 --> 01:02:56,876
Locking on to you. Don't move.
Stay right where you are.

741
01:03:02,877 --> 01:03:07,978
Transport in 5... 4... 3... 2...

742
01:03:09,779 --> 01:03:13,780
- Mother!
- I'm losing her! I'm losing her!...

743
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,780
I've lost her! I've lost her.

744
01:04:12,892 --> 01:04:17,093
Acting captain's log,
star date 2258.42.

745
01:04:18,293 --> 01:04:21,294
We have had no word
from captain Pike.

746
01:04:22,194 --> 01:04:23,859
I have therefore
classified him a hostage...

747
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,395
of the war criminal
known as Nero...

748
01:04:26,795 --> 01:04:32,096
Nero, who has destroyed my home planet
and most of its 6 billion inhabitants.

749
01:04:33,196 --> 01:04:35,407
While the essence
of our culture has been saved...

750
01:04:35,408 --> 01:04:38,198
in the elders who now reside
upon this ship...

751
01:04:40,198 --> 01:04:43,898
I estimate no more than
10000 have survived.

752
01:04:46,399 --> 01:04:50,700
I am now a member of
an endangered species.

753
01:05:17,305 --> 01:05:20,306
I'm sorry.

754
01:05:21,006 --> 01:05:26,308
I'm so sorry.

755
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:44,412
What do you need.
Tell me. Tell me.

756
01:05:52,313 --> 01:05:55,114
I need everyone...

757
01:05:55,514 --> 01:05:59,115
to continue
performing admirably.

758
01:06:04,747 --> 01:06:07,095
Okay.

759
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,221
You must have
a lotta questions for me.

760
01:06:28,521 --> 01:06:31,321
I only have one for you.

761
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:36,721
I need the subspace frequencies of
Starfleet's border protection grids.

762
01:06:36,722 --> 01:06:40,123
Specifically those
surrounding Earth.

763
01:06:41,124 --> 01:06:44,423
Christopher, answer my question.

764
01:06:44,424 --> 01:06:47,658
No, you answer for the genocide you just
committed against a peaceful planet.

765
01:06:47,659 --> 01:06:51,026
No, I prevented genocide.

766
01:06:53,326 --> 01:06:58,227
In my time, where I come from,
this is a simple mining vessel.

767
01:06:58,327 --> 01:07:01,627
I chose a life of honest labor.

768
01:07:01,628 --> 01:07:05,528
to provide for myself and the wife
who was expecting my child.

769
01:07:05,529 --> 01:07:07,928
I was off planet doing my job...

770
01:07:07,929 --> 01:07:10,428
while your Federation
did nothing.

771
01:07:10,429 --> 01:07:14,030
And allowed my people to burn
while their planet broke in half.

772
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:17,230
And Spock, he didn't help us.
He betrayed us.

773
01:07:17,231 --> 01:07:19,430
No, no... you're confused.
You're misinformed.

774
01:07:19,431 --> 01:07:20,930
Romulus hasn't been destroyed.

775
01:07:20,931 --> 01:07:22,291
It's out there right now.

776
01:07:22,292 --> 01:07:24,532
You're blaming the Federation for
something that hasn't happened...

777
01:07:24,533 --> 01:07:27,832
It has happened! I watched it happen!
I saw it happen!

778
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:30,133
Don't tell me it didn't happen!

779
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:39,035
And when I lost her.
I promised myself retribution.

780
01:07:39,036 --> 01:07:43,235
And for 25 years I planned my
revenge against the Federation.

781
01:07:43,236 --> 01:07:46,836
And forgot what it was like
to live a normal life.

782
01:07:46,837 --> 01:07:49,538
I did not forget the pain.

783
01:07:50,638 --> 01:07:54,838
It's a pain that every surviving
Vulcan now shares.

784
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:57,939
My purpose, Christopher,

785
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,241
is to not simply...

786
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:02,440
avoid the destruction
of the home that I love...

787
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:08,942
but to create a Romulus that
exists free of the Federation.

788
01:08:11,142 --> 01:08:15,043
You see only then
will she be truly saved.

789
01:08:15,143 --> 01:08:19,743
That is why I will destroy all
the remaining Federation planets.

790
01:08:19,744 --> 01:08:22,245
Starting with yours.

791
01:08:22,445 --> 01:08:25,645
Then we have nothing
left to discuss.

792
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:32,747
You will give me the frequencies
to disable Earth's defenses.

793
01:08:35,347 --> 01:08:40,248
Centaurian slugs. They latch
on to your brain stem...

794
01:08:41,449 --> 01:08:44,549
and release a toxin that will
force you to answer.

795
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:48,150
Frequencies please, sir.

796
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,484
Christopher Pike, captain of
the USS Enterprise...

797
01:08:50,485 --> 01:08:52,251
As you wish.

798
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,251
Have you confirmed that Nero
is heading for Earth?

799
01:09:01,252 --> 01:09:04,553
Their trajectory suggests no
other destination, captain.

800
01:09:04,554 --> 01:09:06,053
Thank you, It.

801
01:09:06,054 --> 01:09:08,453
Earth may be his next stop,
but we have to assume...

802
01:09:08,454 --> 01:09:10,389
every Federation planet's a target.

803
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:11,954
Out of the chair.

804
01:09:11,955 --> 01:09:16,155
Well, if the Federation is the target,
why didn't they destroy us?

805
01:09:16,156 --> 01:09:19,156
Why would they? Why waste a weapon?
We obviously weren't a threat.

806
01:09:19,157 --> 01:09:22,056
That is not it. He said
he wanted me to see something.

807
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:23,856
The destruction
of my home planet.

808
01:09:23,857 --> 01:09:25,757
How the hell
did they do that, by the way?

809
01:09:25,758 --> 01:09:28,058
And where did the Romulans get
that kind of weaponry?

810
01:09:28,059 --> 01:09:31,758
The engineering comprehension necessary
to artificially create a black hole...

811
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,358
may suggest an answer.

812
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,859
Such technology could
theoretically be manipulated...

813
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:38,060
to create a tunnel
through space-time.

814
01:09:38,061 --> 01:09:39,960
Damn it man, I am a doctor,
not physicist.

815
01:09:39,961 --> 01:09:42,160
Are you actually suggesting
they're from the future?

816
01:09:42,161 --> 01:09:45,261
If you eliminate the impossible,
what ever remains, however improbable...

817
01:09:45,262 --> 01:09:46,561
must be the truth.

818
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:47,562
How poetic.

819
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:51,197
Then what would an angry future
Romulan want with captain Pike?

820
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:53,863
As captain he does know details
of Starfleet's defenses.

821
01:09:53,864 --> 01:09:55,563
What we need to do is catch
up to that ship,

822
01:09:55,564 --> 01:09:57,663
disable it, take it over
and get Pike back.

823
01:09:57,664 --> 01:10:00,165
We are technologically
outmatched in every way.

824
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:02,165
A rescue attempt
would be illogical.

825
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:05,065
Nero's ship would have to drop
out of warp for us to overtake it.

826
01:10:05,066 --> 01:10:08,366
Then what about assigning engineering
crews to try and boost our warp yield?

827
01:10:08,367 --> 01:10:10,467
Remaining power and crew are being
used to repair radiation leaks...

828
01:10:10,468 --> 01:10:12,367
- on the lower decks.
- Okay. Alright. Alright.

829
01:10:12,368 --> 01:10:13,387
The damage communications.
Without it...

830
01:10:13,388 --> 01:10:14,867
- There's got to be some way.
- we cannot contact Starfleet.

831
01:10:14,868 --> 01:10:17,953
We must gather
with the rest of Starfleet.

832
01:10:17,954 --> 01:10:19,668
To balance the terms
of the next engagement,

833
01:10:19,669 --> 01:10:21,169
There won't be
a next engagement.

834
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:24,569
By the time we gather
it'll be too late.

835
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:26,705
Look, you say he's from the future
and knows what's gonna happen...

836
01:10:26,706 --> 01:10:29,170
then the logical thing is
to be unpredictable.

837
01:10:29,171 --> 01:10:32,571
You're assuming that Nero knows
how event's are predicted to unfold.

838
01:10:32,572 --> 01:10:35,122
The contrary. Nero's very presence
has altered the flow of history...

839
01:10:35,123 --> 01:10:36,972
beginning with the attack
on the USS Kelvin,

840
01:10:36,973 --> 01:10:38,322
culminating with the events
of today,

841
01:10:38,323 --> 01:10:40,472
thereby creating an entire
new chain of incidents...

842
01:10:40,473 --> 01:10:43,474
that cannot be anticipated
by either party.

843
01:10:43,475 --> 01:10:45,575
An alternate reality.

844
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,974
Precisely.

845
01:10:47,975 --> 01:10:49,660
Whatever our lives might have been

846
01:10:49,661 --> 01:10:51,976
if the time continuum was disrupted

847
01:10:52,376 --> 01:10:54,676
our destinies have changed.

848
01:10:54,677 --> 01:10:57,276
Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the
Laurentian system. Warp factor 3.

849
01:10:57,277 --> 01:10:58,677
Spock, don't do that.

850
01:10:58,678 --> 01:11:03,177
Running back to the rest of the fleet for
a con fab is a massive waste of time...

851
01:11:03,178 --> 01:11:04,913
These orders were issued by
captain Pike when he left.

852
01:11:04,914 --> 01:11:06,579
He also ordered us to go back and get him.

853
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:10,079
- Spock, you are captain now. You have...
- I am aware of my responsibilities...

854
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,479
Every second we waste Nero's
getting closer to his next target.

855
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,580
That is correct and why I'm instructing
you to accept the fact that I'm...

856
01:11:15,581 --> 01:11:19,581
I will not allow us to go backwards...
... instead of hunting Nero down.

857
01:11:19,582 --> 01:11:22,582
Security, escort him out.

858
01:11:30,984 --> 01:11:33,085
- No.
- Jim!

859
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:40,287
Get him off this ship.

860
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:00,990
Computer, where am I?

861
01:12:00,991 --> 01:12:04,491
Location: Delta Vega.
Class M planet. Unsafe.

862
01:12:04,492 --> 01:12:08,391
There is a Starfleet outpost 14km
to the northwest.

863
01:12:08,392 --> 01:12:12,493
- Remain in your pod...
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

864
01:12:54,502 --> 01:12:58,703
Star date 2258.42.

865
01:12:58,803 --> 01:13:02,603
...for... for... Whatever.

866
01:13:02,604 --> 01:13:06,303
Acting captain Spock has
marooned me on Delta Vega.

867
01:13:06,304 --> 01:13:11,005
What I believe to be a violation
of security protocol 49.09

868
01:13:11,006 --> 01:13:14,206
governing the treatment of prisoners
aboard a starship.

869
01:15:24,034 --> 01:15:27,334
James T. Kirk.

870
01:15:28,034 --> 01:15:30,834
- Excuse me?
- How did you find me?

871
01:15:32,536 --> 01:15:35,236
How do you know my name?

872
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:40,236
I have been and always
shall be your friend.

873
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:45,772
Look, I don't know you.

874
01:15:45,773 --> 01:15:49,139
I am Spock.

875
01:15:52,639 --> 01:15:54,139
Bullshit.

876
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:57,341
It is remarkably pleasing to see
you again old friend.

877
01:15:57,441 --> 01:16:00,641
Especially after the events today.

878
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:04,041
Sir, I appreciate
what you did for me today

879
01:16:04,042 --> 01:16:07,842
but if you were Spock, you'd know
we're not friends at all.

880
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:10,342
You hate me. You marooned
me here for mutiny.

881
01:16:10,343 --> 01:16:12,342
- Mutiny?
- Yes.

882
01:16:12,343 --> 01:16:15,044
You are not the captain?

883
01:16:17,445 --> 01:16:21,644
No, no... You're the captain.

884
01:16:21,645 --> 01:16:24,345
Pike was taken hostage.

885
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:27,047
By Nero?

886
01:16:31,448 --> 01:16:34,347
What do you know about him?

887
01:16:34,348 --> 01:16:37,849
He is a particularly
troubled Romulan.

888
01:16:38,349 --> 01:16:41,150
Please. Allow me.

889
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,850
It will be easier.

890
01:16:42,851 --> 01:16:47,152
- Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
- Our minds, one and together.

891
01:16:48,953 --> 01:16:55,554
129 years from now, a star will explode
and threaten to destroy the galaxy.

892
01:16:56,554 --> 01:16:59,454
That is where I'm from Jim.

893
01:16:59,455 --> 01:17:01,555
The future.

894
01:17:04,856 --> 01:17:07,956
A star went supernova.

895
01:17:08,956 --> 01:17:11,556
Consuming everything in its path.

896
01:17:11,557 --> 01:17:15,558
I promised the Romulans that I
will save their planet.

897
01:17:20,359 --> 01:17:23,360
We outfitted our fastest ship.

898
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,459
Using red matter
I would create a black hole

899
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:29,861
which would absorb the exploding star.

900
01:17:30,461 --> 01:17:34,162
I was on root
when the unthinkable happened.

901
01:17:34,862 --> 01:17:39,163
The supernova destroyed Romulus.

902
01:17:43,764 --> 01:17:46,365
I had little time.

903
01:17:47,965 --> 01:17:52,565
I had to extract the red matter
and shoot it into the supernova.

904
01:18:08,469 --> 01:18:11,269
As I began my return trip
I was intercepted.

905
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:15,469
- He called himself Nero,
- ... collapse of Romulan Empire.

906
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:19,972
In my attempt to escape, both of
us were pulled into the black hole.

907
01:18:27,974 --> 01:18:32,174
Nero went through first.
He was the first to arrive.

908
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:42,075
Nero spent the next 25 years
awaiting my arrival.

909
01:18:42,076 --> 01:18:44,877
But what was years for Nero

910
01:18:45,777 --> 01:18:48,577
was only seconds for me.

911
01:18:48,777 --> 01:18:51,779
I went through the black hole.

912
01:18:53,079 --> 01:18:56,879
Nero was waiting for me.

913
01:19:01,281 --> 01:19:05,081
He held me responsible for the
loss of his world.

914
01:19:06,281 --> 01:19:09,582
He captured my vessel and spared my life.

915
01:19:09,982 --> 01:19:15,683
For one reason. So that
I would know his pain.

916
01:19:17,084 --> 01:19:21,784
He beamed me here so that
I can observe his vengeance.

917
01:19:22,984 --> 01:19:26,085
As he was helpless to save his planet

918
01:19:26,086 --> 01:19:30,486
I would be helpless to save mine.

919
01:19:32,086 --> 01:19:36,487
Billions of lives lost because of me, Jim.

920
01:19:36,488 --> 01:19:40,088
Because I failed.

921
01:19:41,689 --> 01:19:46,490
Forgive me. Emotional transference
is an effect of the mind meld.

922
01:19:52,991 --> 01:19:56,190
- So you do feel.
- Yes.

923
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:59,693
Going back in time
you changed all our lives.

924
01:19:59,993 --> 01:20:03,392
Jim! We must go.

925
01:20:03,393 --> 01:20:06,393
There is a Starfleet outpost
not far from here.

926
01:20:07,294 --> 01:20:09,594
Wait.

927
01:20:09,595 --> 01:20:12,495
Where you came from...

928
01:20:13,895 --> 01:20:16,496
did I know my father?

929
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,696
Yes.

930
01:20:18,697 --> 01:20:22,697
You often spoke of him as being your
inspiration for joining Starfleet.

931
01:20:23,098 --> 01:20:27,097
He proudly lived to see you
become captain of the Enterprise.

932
01:20:27,098 --> 01:20:28,397
Captain?

933
01:20:28,398 --> 01:20:32,000
A ship we must return you to
as soon as possible.

934
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:42,601
- Warp 3, sir.
- Course 151-3.

935
01:20:42,602 --> 01:20:45,301
- Laurentian system, sir.
- Thank you gentlemen.

936
01:20:45,302 --> 01:20:49,503
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Doctor.

937
01:20:50,103 --> 01:20:52,403
I am aware that James Kirk
is a friend of yours.

938
01:20:52,404 --> 01:20:55,338
I recognize that supporting me as
you did must have been difficult.

939
01:20:55,339 --> 01:20:57,304
Is that thank you?

940
01:20:57,305 --> 01:21:00,305
I am simply acknowledging
your difficulties.

941
01:21:00,306 --> 01:21:02,505
Permission to speak freely, sir.

942
01:21:03,206 --> 01:21:05,707
- I welcome it.
- Do you?

943
01:21:05,907 --> 01:21:09,506
Okay then. Are you out of
your Vulcan mind?

944
01:21:09,507 --> 01:21:13,907
Are you making a logical choice sending
Kirk away? Probably. But the right one?

945
01:21:13,908 --> 01:21:16,958
Back home we've got a saying. If you're
gonna ride in the Kentucky derby...

946
01:21:16,959 --> 01:21:19,208
you don't leave your
prize stallion in the stable...

947
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:23,009
A curious metaphor, Doctor,
as a stallion must first be broken...

948
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:25,510
before it can reach its potential.

949
01:21:25,511 --> 01:21:28,016
My God man. You could at least
act like it was a hard decision.

950
01:21:28,017 --> 01:21:29,551
I intend to insist
in the effort...

951
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:31,611
to reestablish
communication with Starfleet.

952
01:21:31,612 --> 01:21:33,711
However, if crew moral
is better served...

953
01:21:33,712 --> 01:21:35,511
by my roaming
the halls weeping...

954
01:21:35,512 --> 01:21:39,314
I would gladly defer
to your medical expertise.

955
01:21:40,014 --> 01:21:42,214
Excuse me.

956
01:21:45,714 --> 01:21:48,416
Green blooded little goblin.

957
01:23:08,432 --> 01:23:10,633
What?

958
01:23:13,633 --> 01:23:15,832
You realize how
unacceptable this is?

959
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:17,534
- Fascinating.
- What?

960
01:23:17,535 --> 01:23:18,934
I am sure
you're just doing your job,

961
01:23:18,935 --> 01:23:20,334
but could you not come
a wee bit sooner?

962
01:23:20,335 --> 01:23:22,134
Six months I've been here.

963
01:23:22,135 --> 01:23:25,234
Living off Starfleet botty nips
and a promise of a good meal.

964
01:23:25,235 --> 01:23:27,736
And I know exactly
what's going on here.

965
01:23:27,737 --> 01:23:31,936
Ok? Punishment, isn't it? Ongoing. For
something that was clearly an accident.

966
01:23:31,937 --> 01:23:34,937
- You are Montgomery Scott.
- You know him?

967
01:23:34,938 --> 01:23:36,937
Yeah, it's me. You're in the right place.

968
01:23:36,938 --> 01:23:40,038
Unless theres another hard working
equally starved Starfleet officer around.

969
01:23:40,039 --> 01:23:42,940
- Me.
- Getup, shut up.

970
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:46,539
You aren't doing anything. You can
eat, like, a bean and you're done.

971
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:48,739
I'm talking about food, real food.

972
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:51,441
But you're here now.
So, thank you. Where is it?

973
01:23:51,442 --> 01:23:53,541
You are in fact a Mr. Scott...

974
01:23:53,542 --> 01:23:55,541
who postulated the theory
of transwarp beaming?

975
01:23:55,542 --> 01:23:59,042
That's what I'm talking about.
How'd ya think I wound up here?

976
01:23:59,043 --> 01:24:01,543
I had a little debate with my
instructor on the issue...

977
01:24:01,544 --> 01:24:03,243
of relativistic physics...

978
01:24:03,244 --> 01:24:04,543
and how it pertains
to subspace travel.

979
01:24:04,544 --> 01:24:07,244
He seemed to think that
the range of transporting...

980
01:24:07,245 --> 01:24:08,644
something like a grapefruit...

981
01:24:08,645 --> 01:24:10,544
was limited to about a 100 miles.

982
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:12,745
I told him that I could not
only beam a grapefruit...

983
01:24:12,746 --> 01:24:14,345
from one planet
to the adjacent planet...

984
01:24:14,346 --> 01:24:17,046
in the same system,
which is easy by the way...

985
01:24:17,047 --> 01:24:19,546
I could do it with a life form.

986
01:24:19,547 --> 01:24:21,981
So, I tested it on
admiral Archer's prize beagle.

987
01:24:21,982 --> 01:24:24,048
I know that dog.
What happened to it?

988
01:24:24,049 --> 01:24:25,848
I'll tell you when it reappears.

989
01:24:25,849 --> 01:24:27,448
I don't know.
I do feel guilty about that.

990
01:24:27,449 --> 01:24:30,448
What if I told you that your
transwarp theory was correct?

991
01:24:30,449 --> 01:24:33,750
That it is indeed possible to beam onto
a ship that is travelling at warp speed?

992
01:24:33,751 --> 01:24:36,350
I think that if that equation had been
discovered I'd have heard about it.

993
01:24:36,351 --> 01:24:38,385
The reason you haven't
heard of it, Mr. Scott,

994
01:24:38,386 --> 01:24:41,352
is because you haven't
discovered it yet.

995
01:24:46,153 --> 01:24:50,053
- Are you from the future?
- He is. I'm not.

996
01:24:50,054 --> 01:24:53,454
Well that's brilliant. Do they
still have sandwiches there?

997
01:24:53,754 --> 01:24:56,254
Well, she's a wee bit dodgy.
Shield emitters are...

998
01:24:56,255 --> 01:24:58,755
totally bum jacked as well
as a few other things.

999
01:24:58,756 --> 01:25:00,755
In you go.

1000
01:25:00,756 --> 01:25:03,190
So, the Enterprise has had
it's maiden voyage, has it?

1001
01:25:03,191 --> 01:25:04,955
She is one well endowed lady.

1002
01:25:04,956 --> 01:25:07,358
I'd like to get my hands
on her ample nossels,

1003
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:09,658
if you'd pardon
the engineering parlance.

1004
01:25:11,258 --> 01:25:13,398
Except, the thing is,
even if I believed you.

1005
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:15,398
Where you're from,
what I've done...

1006
01:25:15,399 --> 01:25:17,398
Which I don't, by the way.

1007
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:19,759
We're still talking about
beaming aboard the Enterprise...

1008
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,660
while she's travelling faster than
light without a proper receiving pad.

1009
01:25:22,661 --> 01:25:25,660
Get off there.
It's not a climbing frame.

1010
01:25:25,661 --> 01:25:26,960
The notion of transwarp beaming...

1011
01:25:26,961 --> 01:25:30,362
is like trying to hit a bullet
with a smaller bullet...

1012
01:25:30,363 --> 01:25:33,362
whilst wearing a blindfold,
riding a horse.

1013
01:25:33,363 --> 01:25:34,362
What's that?

1014
01:25:34,363 --> 01:25:38,263
Your equation for achieving
transwarp beaming.

1015
01:25:39,965 --> 01:25:42,465
You're out of it...

1016
01:25:45,165 --> 01:25:47,660
Imagine that.
It never occurred to me...

1017
01:25:47,661 --> 01:25:49,765
to think of space as the thing
that was moving...

1018
01:25:49,766 --> 01:25:52,467
You're coming with us, right?

1019
01:25:53,667 --> 01:25:56,568
No, Jim. That is not my destiny.

1020
01:25:56,668 --> 01:25:58,967
Your dest...

1021
01:25:58,968 --> 01:26:01,402
He. The other Spock is not gonna
believe me, only you can explain...

1022
01:26:01,403 --> 01:26:03,303
- what the hell has happened.
- Under no circumstances...

1023
01:26:03,304 --> 01:26:04,269
can he be made aware...

1024
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:06,269
of my existence.
You must promise me this.

1025
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:07,769
So you're telling me
I can't tell you...

1026
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:10,169
that I'm following you're own
orders, why not? What happens?

1027
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:12,570
Jim, this is one rule
you cannot break.

1028
01:26:12,571 --> 01:26:16,271
To stop Nero, you alone must
take command of your ship.

1029
01:26:16,272 --> 01:26:18,106
How? Over your dead body?

1030
01:26:18,107 --> 01:26:19,171
Preferably, not.

1031
01:26:19,172 --> 01:26:22,372
However, there is
Starfleet regulation 619.

1032
01:26:22,373 --> 01:26:25,774
619 states that
any command officer...

1033
01:26:25,775 --> 01:26:28,374
who is emotionally compromised
by the mission at hand...

1034
01:26:28,375 --> 01:26:31,675
must resign set command.

1035
01:26:33,275 --> 01:26:37,176
So, you're saying that I have to
emotionally compromise you... guys?

1036
01:26:37,177 --> 01:26:41,077
Jim, I just lost my planet.

1037
01:26:41,477 --> 01:26:45,477
I can tell you,
I am emotionally compromised.

1038
01:26:45,478 --> 01:26:48,278
What you must do
is get me to show it.

1039
01:26:48,279 --> 01:26:51,679
Aye then lady. Live or die.
Let's get this over with.

1040
01:26:57,781 --> 01:27:00,581
You cannot come with me. Go on.

1041
01:27:01,081 --> 01:27:06,182
Coming back in time,
changing history, that's cheating.

1042
01:27:07,982 --> 01:27:11,384
A trick I learned
from an old friend.

1043
01:27:19,085 --> 01:27:23,286
Live long and prosper.

1044
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:44,691
Mr. Scott?

1045
01:27:48,491 --> 01:27:51,291
Mr. Scott, can you hear me?

1046
01:27:58,293 --> 01:28:01,794
Hold on a second.

1047
01:28:18,298 --> 01:28:20,198
No. No!

1048
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,100
RELEASE VALVE.

1049
01:28:38,702 --> 01:28:42,203
Purifier release valve activated.

1050
01:28:48,003 --> 01:28:51,305
You all right? You all right?

1051
01:28:52,605 --> 01:28:55,304
My head's buzzing and I'm soaked,
but otherwise I'm fine.

1052
01:28:55,305 --> 01:29:01,106
Captain Spock, detecting unauthorized
access to water turbine control board.

1053
01:29:01,107 --> 01:29:03,507
Bring up the video.

1054
01:29:06,608 --> 01:29:10,809
Security, seal the engineering deck.
We have intruders in turbine section 3.

1055
01:29:11,309 --> 01:29:13,509
Set phasers to stun.

1056
01:29:24,512 --> 01:29:26,712
Halt!

1057
01:29:29,712 --> 01:29:31,513
Come with me...

1058
01:29:31,514 --> 01:29:34,214
cupcake!

1059
01:29:41,135 --> 01:29:42,214
Who are you?

1060
01:29:42,215 --> 01:29:43,424
- I'm with him.
- He's with me.

1061
01:29:43,425 --> 01:29:44,815
We're travelling
at warp speed.

1062
01:29:44,816 --> 01:29:46,715
How did you manage
to beam aboard this ship?

1063
01:29:46,716 --> 01:29:48,215
You're the genius,
you figure it out.

1064
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,651
As acting captain of this vessel
I order you to answer the question.

1065
01:29:50,652 --> 01:29:53,617
Well I'm not telling,
acting captain.

1066
01:29:54,417 --> 01:29:55,718
What?

1067
01:29:55,719 --> 01:29:57,918
What now? That doesn't
frustrate you, does it?

1068
01:29:57,919 --> 01:30:00,618
My lack of cooperation,
that doesn't make you angry?

1069
01:30:00,619 --> 01:30:04,018
- Are you a member of Starfleet?
- Um... yes. Can I get a towel?

1070
01:30:04,019 --> 01:30:06,620
Under penalty of court martial
I order you to explain to me...

1071
01:30:06,621 --> 01:30:08,700
how you were able to beam aboard
the ship while moving at warp?

1072
01:30:08,701 --> 01:30:09,715
Well.

1073
01:30:09,716 --> 01:30:12,921
- Don't answer him.
- You will answer me.

1074
01:30:14,322 --> 01:30:17,623
- I'd rather not take sides.
- What is it with you, Spock?

1075
01:30:17,624 --> 01:30:18,722
Hm?

1076
01:30:18,723 --> 01:30:21,023
Your planet was just destroyed,

1077
01:30:21,024 --> 01:30:23,923
your mother murdered,
and you're not even upset.

1078
01:30:23,924 --> 01:30:26,423
If you are presuming that these
experiences in any way...

1079
01:30:26,424 --> 01:30:28,824
impede my ability to command
this ship you are mistaking.

1080
01:30:28,825 --> 01:30:32,325
And yet you were the one who said
fear was necessary for command.

1081
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:35,926
I mean, did you his ship?
Did you see what he did?

1082
01:30:36,126 --> 01:30:38,626
- Yes, of course I did.
- So are you afraid or aren't you?

1083
01:30:38,627 --> 01:30:41,612
I will not allow you to lecture
me about the merits of emotion.

1084
01:30:41,613 --> 01:30:43,027
- Then why don't you stop me?
- Step away from me Mr. Kirk.

1085
01:30:43,028 --> 01:30:46,928
What is it like not to feel
anger or heartbreak?

1086
01:30:46,929 --> 01:30:48,328
Or the need to stop at nothing...

1087
01:30:48,329 --> 01:30:50,529
to avenge the death of the woman
who gave birth to you.

1088
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:52,464
- Back away from me.
- You feel nothing!

1089
01:30:52,465 --> 01:30:55,331
It must not even compute for you.

1090
01:30:55,332 --> 01:30:57,831
- You never loved her!
- No!

1091
01:31:21,436 --> 01:31:23,537
Spock.

1092
01:31:59,944 --> 01:32:02,744
Doctor, I am no longer
fit for duty.

1093
01:32:02,745 --> 01:32:08,446
I relinquish my command based on the fact
that I have been emotionally compromised.

1094
01:32:08,746 --> 01:32:11,647
Please note the time and
date in the ship's log.

1095
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:40,051
I like this ship.

1096
01:32:40,052 --> 01:32:42,353
You know it's exciting.

1097
01:32:44,154 --> 01:32:47,453
Well congratulations, Jim.
Now we've got no captain...

1098
01:32:47,454 --> 01:32:50,054
and no God damn first officer
to replace him.

1099
01:32:50,855 --> 01:32:52,555
Yeah we do.

1100
01:32:52,556 --> 01:32:55,455
- What?
- Pike made him first officer.

1101
01:32:55,456 --> 01:32:58,856
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Thanks for the support.

1102
01:33:01,357 --> 01:33:05,858
I sure hope you know
what you're doing, captain.

1103
01:33:06,558 --> 01:33:09,159
So do I.

1104
01:33:12,759 --> 01:33:16,061
Attention, crew of the Enterprise,
this is James Kirk.

1105
01:33:16,761 --> 01:33:21,061
Mr. Spock has resigned commission
and advanced me to acting captain.

1106
01:33:21,561 --> 01:33:24,961
I know you're all expecting
a regroup with the fleet,

1107
01:33:24,962 --> 01:33:27,681
but I'm ordering a pursuit course
of the enemy ship to Earth.

1108
01:33:27,682 --> 01:33:30,763
I want all departments at battle
stations and ready in 10 minutes.

1109
01:33:30,963 --> 01:33:35,864
Either we're going down
or they are.

1110
01:33:35,964 --> 01:33:37,965
Kirk out.

1111
01:33:44,966 --> 01:33:47,967
Speak your mind Spock.

1112
01:33:49,868 --> 01:33:51,867
That would be unwise.

1113
01:33:51,868 --> 01:33:56,368
What is necessary
is never unwise.

1114
01:33:57,169 --> 01:34:00,970
I am as conflicted
as I once was as a child.

1115
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:05,471
You will always be
a child of two worlds.

1116
01:34:06,671 --> 01:34:10,072
I am grateful for this.

1117
01:34:10,472 --> 01:34:13,172
And for you.

1118
01:34:13,973 --> 01:34:17,873
I feel anger for the one
who took mother's life.

1119
01:34:18,473 --> 01:34:22,074
An anger I cannot control.

1120
01:34:24,975 --> 01:34:30,976
I believe, as she would say...

1121
01:34:31,276 --> 01:34:34,476
do not try to.

1122
01:34:34,477 --> 01:34:39,678
You asked me once
why I married your mother.

1123
01:34:43,279 --> 01:34:46,779
I married her
because I loved her.

1124
01:34:53,881 --> 01:34:56,916
Whatever the case we need to
get aboard Nero's ship undetected.

1125
01:34:56,917 --> 01:34:58,881
Just can't just go in there
guns blazing, Jim.

1126
01:34:58,882 --> 01:35:00,681
I'm telling you to...

1127
01:35:00,682 --> 01:35:03,582
- Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk.
- Yes, Chekov. What is it?

1128
01:35:03,583 --> 01:35:06,181
Based on the Neradas course
from Vulcan...

1129
01:35:06,182 --> 01:35:09,069
I have projected that Nero
will travel pass Saturn.

1130
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:12,584
Like you said we need to stay
invisible to Nero or he'll destroy us.

1131
01:35:12,585 --> 01:35:15,184
If Mr. Scott
can get us to warp factor 4...

1132
01:35:15,185 --> 01:35:19,785
and if we drop out of warp behind
one of Saturn's moons, say Titan.

1133
01:35:19,786 --> 01:35:22,286
The magnetic distortion from
the planet's rings...

1134
01:35:22,287 --> 01:35:24,686
will make us invisible
to Nero's sensors.

1135
01:35:24,687 --> 01:35:27,187
From there, as long as
the drill is not activated...

1136
01:35:27,188 --> 01:35:28,623
we can beam
aboard the enemy ship.

1137
01:35:28,624 --> 01:35:30,988
Aye, that might work.

1138
01:35:30,989 --> 01:35:34,088
- Wait a minute kid, how old are you?
- 17, sir.

1139
01:35:34,089 --> 01:35:35,423
Oh good, he's 17.

1140
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:37,089
Doctor.

1141
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:40,990
Mr. Chekov is correct. I can
confirm his telemetry.

1142
01:35:40,991 --> 01:35:43,090
If Mr. Sulu is able to
maneuver us into position

1143
01:35:43,091 --> 01:35:45,891
I can beam aboard Nero's ship,
steal back the black hole device

1144
01:35:45,892 --> 01:35:48,691
and if possible bring back
captain Pike.

1145
01:35:48,692 --> 01:35:51,293
I won't allow you
to do that Mr. Spock.

1146
01:35:51,393 --> 01:35:54,593
Romulans and Vulcans
share a common ancestry.

1147
01:35:54,594 --> 01:35:57,093
Our cultural similarities
will make it easier...

1148
01:35:57,094 --> 01:35:58,693
for me to access
the ship's computer...

1149
01:35:58,694 --> 01:36:00,394
to locate the device.

1150
01:36:01,095 --> 01:36:03,176
Also my mother was human.

1151
01:36:03,177 --> 01:36:05,996
Which makes Earth
the only home I have left.

1152
01:36:12,598 --> 01:36:14,797
I'm coming with you.

1153
01:36:14,798 --> 01:36:18,699
I would cite regulation, but
I know you will simply ignore it.

1154
01:36:20,699 --> 01:36:24,500
See? We are getting to know
each other.

1155
01:36:39,103 --> 01:36:41,903
Prepare the drill.

1156
01:36:56,707 --> 01:37:03,408
All stop in 3... 2... 1.

1157
01:37:07,609 --> 01:37:10,859
Give me 1/4 impulse burst
for 5 seconds.

1158
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:12,774
I'll do the rest with thrusters.
On my mark.

1159
01:37:12,775 --> 01:37:14,209
Aye.

1160
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:15,910
Fire.

1161
01:37:42,017 --> 01:37:45,066
Transporter room. We are in
position above Titan.

1162
01:37:45,067 --> 01:37:48,167
Really?
Fine job Mr. Sulu, well done.

1163
01:37:48,168 --> 01:37:49,869
How are we Scotty?

1164
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:52,319
Unbelievably sir.
The ship is in position.

1165
01:37:55,419 --> 01:37:57,319
Whatever happens Mr. Sulu,

1166
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:59,719
if you think you have
the tactical advantage...

1167
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:03,321
you fire on that ship even if we're
still on board. That's an order.

1168
01:38:05,021 --> 01:38:06,020
Yes, sir.

1169
01:38:06,021 --> 01:38:09,522
Otherwise we'll contact the Enterprise
when we're ready to be beamed back.

1170
01:38:09,922 --> 01:38:12,722
Good luck.

1171
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:27,726
- I will be back.
- You better be.

1172
01:38:28,426 --> 01:38:33,027
- I'll be monitoring your frequency.
- Thank you, Nyota.

1173
01:38:48,731 --> 01:38:51,530
- So her first name's Nyota?
- I have no comment on the matter.

1174
01:38:51,531 --> 01:38:54,715
Oky doky then. If theres any common
sense in the design of the enemy's ship

1175
01:38:54,716 --> 01:38:58,232
I should be putting you somewhere in the
cargo bay, shouldn't be a soul in site.

1176
01:38:58,233 --> 01:39:00,033
Energize.

1177
01:39:42,742 --> 01:39:45,441
Captain, we have Starfleet officers
aboard the ship.

1178
01:39:45,442 --> 01:39:48,743
- One of them is Vulcan.
- No.

1179
01:39:52,543 --> 01:39:55,045
Ayel!

1180
01:40:08,247 --> 01:40:10,681
- I'll cover ya.
- Are you certain?

1181
01:40:10,682 --> 01:40:12,848
Yeah, I've gotcha.

1182
01:40:31,852 --> 01:40:35,953
Do you know where it is?
The black hole device?

1183
01:40:37,053 --> 01:40:39,854
And captain Pike.

1184
01:41:01,259 --> 01:41:03,059
Move.

1185
01:41:03,259 --> 01:41:05,959
They have activated the drill.

1186
01:41:06,259 --> 01:41:07,958
Communication and transportation
are inoperative.

1187
01:41:07,959 --> 01:41:09,559
Sulu, please tell me
you have them.

1188
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:11,195
Otherwise we won't be
able to beam them back.

1189
01:41:11,196 --> 01:41:13,761
Kirk and Spock
are on their own now.

1190
01:41:32,264 --> 01:41:34,965
I foresee a complication.
The design of this ship...

1191
01:41:34,966 --> 01:41:36,465
is far more advanced
than I have anticipated.

1192
01:41:36,466 --> 01:41:39,365
Voice print and face recognition
analysis enabled.

1193
01:41:39,366 --> 01:41:41,565
Welcome back ambassador Spock.

1194
01:41:41,566 --> 01:41:43,667
That's weird.

1195
01:41:44,368 --> 01:41:47,367
Computer, what is your
manufacturing origin?

1196
01:41:47,368 --> 01:41:52,569
Star date 2387. Commissioned
by the Vulcan Science Academy.

1197
01:41:54,870 --> 01:41:57,569
It appears that you have been keeping
important information from me.

1198
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:59,505
You'll be able
to fly this thing, right?

1199
01:41:59,506 --> 01:42:01,771
Something tells me
I already have.

1200
01:42:02,371 --> 01:42:05,270
- Good luck.
- Jim.

1201
01:42:05,271 --> 01:42:08,118
The statistical likelihood
that our plan will succeed...

1202
01:42:08,119 --> 01:42:09,872
- is less than 4,3%.
- It'll work.

1203
01:42:09,873 --> 01:42:11,772
In the event that I do not return
please tell Lt. Uhura...

1204
01:42:11,773 --> 01:42:14,373
Spock, it'll work.

1205
01:42:24,376 --> 01:42:26,476
Fascinating.

1206
01:42:34,278 --> 01:42:37,678
Startup sequence initiated.

1207
01:43:20,787 --> 01:43:24,089
Nero, order your men to disable
the drill or I will...

1208
01:43:33,490 --> 01:43:37,191
I know your face
from Earth's history.

1209
01:44:21,601 --> 01:44:25,001
James T. Kirk was considered
to be a great man.

1210
01:44:25,002 --> 01:44:27,903
He went on to captain
the USS Enterprise.

1211
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:29,803
But that was another life.

1212
01:44:29,804 --> 01:44:33,204
A life I will deprive you of
just like I did your father.

1213
01:45:05,511 --> 01:45:10,011
Captain Nero. The Vulcan ship's been
taken. The drill has been destroyed.

1214
01:45:10,112 --> 01:45:15,113
Spock! Spock!

1215
01:45:32,216 --> 01:45:34,716
- Open a channel.
- Yes, sir.

1216
01:45:35,317 --> 01:45:38,617
Spock, I knew I should have
killed you when I had the chance.

1217
01:45:38,618 --> 01:45:40,652
I hereby confiscate
this illegally obtained ship...

1218
01:45:40,653 --> 01:45:42,717
and order you to surrender
your vessel. No terms.

1219
01:45:42,718 --> 01:45:44,218
That ship... take it out.

1220
01:45:44,219 --> 01:45:48,020
- Sir, if you ignite the red matter..
- I want the Spock dead now!

1221
01:46:03,023 --> 01:46:04,857
- He went to warp.
- Go after him.

1222
01:46:04,858 --> 01:46:06,523
Yes, sir.

1223
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:39,430
Your species is even weaker
than I expected.

1224
01:46:42,732 --> 01:46:45,332
You can't even speak.

1225
01:46:46,832 --> 01:46:48,531
What?

1226
01:46:48,532 --> 01:46:51,533
I got your gun.

1227
01:47:16,839 --> 01:47:18,238
What's he doing?

1228
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:21,638
Ambassador Spock, you are
on a collision course.

1229
01:47:21,639 --> 01:47:24,040
Fire everything.

1230
01:47:30,041 --> 01:47:34,341
Incoming missiles. If the ship is hit,
the red matter will be ignited.

1231
01:47:34,342 --> 01:47:36,842
Understood.

1232
01:47:42,144 --> 01:47:44,344
Captain, I've picked up
another ship.

1233
01:48:05,249 --> 01:48:08,449
- What are you doing here?
- Following orders.

1234
01:48:28,453 --> 01:48:31,054
Enterprise now!

1235
01:48:52,958 --> 01:48:55,359
Nice timing Scotty.

1236
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:57,859
I've never beamed three people
from two targets

1237
01:48:57,860 --> 01:48:59,659
onto one pad before.

1238
01:48:59,660 --> 01:49:02,861
- Jim. - Bones.
- I've got him.

1239
01:49:05,361 --> 01:49:07,861
That was pretty good.

1240
01:49:07,862 --> 01:49:11,162
Captain, the enemy ship is loosing
power. They're shields are down.

1241
01:49:11,163 --> 01:49:13,763
- Hail them now.
- Aye.

1242
01:49:48,470 --> 01:49:51,770
This is captain James T. Kirk
of the USS Enterprise.

1243
01:49:51,771 --> 01:49:54,471
Your ship is compromised. You're
too close to the singularity

1244
01:49:54,472 --> 01:49:58,172
to survive without assistance
which we are willing to provide.

1245
01:50:00,673 --> 01:50:02,573
Captain, what are you doing?

1246
01:50:02,574 --> 01:50:04,208
Showing them compassion
may be the only way...

1247
01:50:04,209 --> 01:50:05,208
to make peace with Romulus, Spock.

1248
01:50:05,209 --> 01:50:08,573
It's logical, Spock.
Thought you'd like that.

1249
01:50:08,574 --> 01:50:11,274
No, not really. Not this time.

1250
01:50:11,275 --> 01:50:15,575
I would rather suffer the end
of Romulus a thousand times,

1251
01:50:15,576 --> 01:50:20,076
I would rather die in agony
than accept assistance from you.

1252
01:50:20,077 --> 01:50:21,976
You've got it.

1253
01:50:21,977 --> 01:50:24,312
Arm phasers.
Fire everything we've got.

1254
01:50:24,313 --> 01:50:25,979
Yes, sir.

1255
01:51:10,188 --> 01:51:12,988
- Sulu, let's go home.
- Yes, sir.

1256
01:51:23,490 --> 01:51:25,990
- Why aren't we at warp?
- We are, sir.

1257
01:51:25,991 --> 01:51:28,225
Kirk to engineering.
Get us out of here, Scotty.

1258
01:51:28,226 --> 01:51:30,892
You bet your ass captain.

1259
01:51:33,293 --> 01:51:35,427
Captain, we're caught in
the gravity well. It's got us.

1260
01:51:35,428 --> 01:51:36,992
Go to maximum warp. Push it!

1261
01:51:36,993 --> 01:51:39,693
I'm giving it
all she's got captain.

1262
01:51:48,295 --> 01:51:50,830
All she's got isn't good enough.
What else you got?

1263
01:51:50,831 --> 01:51:53,556
Ok, if we eject the core
and detonate the blast...

1264
01:51:53,557 --> 01:51:56,697
could be enough to push us away.
I can't promise anything though.

1265
01:51:59,298 --> 01:52:01,897
Do it! Do it! Do it!

1266
01:52:01,898 --> 01:52:04,399
- Clear the area. Go!
- Yes, sir.

1267
01:53:31,317 --> 01:53:33,418
Father?

1268
01:53:41,319 --> 01:53:44,620
I am not our father.

1269
01:53:50,821 --> 01:53:56,123
There are so few Vulcans left we
cannot afford to ignore each other.

1270
01:53:58,523 --> 01:54:01,523
Then why did you send Kirk aboard when
you alone could have explained the truth?

1271
01:54:01,524 --> 01:54:03,523
Because you needed each other.

1272
01:54:03,524 --> 01:54:07,924
I could not deprive you of the revelation
of all that you can accomplish together.

1273
01:54:07,925 --> 01:54:11,325
Of a friendship
that will define you both.

1274
01:54:11,326 --> 01:54:14,226
In ways you cannot yet realize.

1275
01:54:14,926 --> 01:54:17,526
How'd you persuade him to
keep your secret?

1276
01:54:17,527 --> 01:54:20,827
He inferred that universe
ending paradoxes would ensue

1277
01:54:20,828 --> 01:54:22,462
should he break his promise.

1278
01:54:22,463 --> 01:54:24,828
You lied?

1279
01:54:25,128 --> 01:54:28,329
- Oh. I implied.
- A gamble?

1280
01:54:28,330 --> 01:54:30,129
An act of faith.

1281
01:54:30,130 --> 01:54:33,829
One I hope you will repeat in
the future in Starfleet.

1282
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:37,230
In the face of extinction it is only
logical I resign my Starfleet commission

1283
01:54:37,231 --> 01:54:38,330
and help rebuild our race.

1284
01:54:38,331 --> 01:54:41,632
And yet you can be
in two places at once.

1285
01:54:41,932 --> 01:54:44,833
I urge you to remain in Starfleet.

1286
01:54:45,033 --> 01:54:49,332
I've already located a suitable planet
on which to establish a Vulcan colony.

1287
01:54:49,333 --> 01:54:53,935
Spock, in this case
do yourself a favor...

1288
01:54:54,635 --> 01:54:58,735
put aside logic,
do what feels right.

1289
01:55:04,137 --> 01:55:07,636
Since my customary farewell would
appear awfully self serving...

1290
01:55:07,637 --> 01:55:11,338
I shall simply say good luck.

1291
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:26,442
This assembly calls captain
James Tiberius Kirk.

1292
01:55:26,642 --> 01:55:29,941
Your inspirational valor and
supreme dedication to your comrades...

1293
01:55:29,942 --> 01:55:32,942
is in keeping with the highest
traditions of service.

1294
01:55:33,043 --> 01:55:38,244
And reflect at most credit to yourself,
your crew and the Federation.

1295
01:55:38,744 --> 01:55:42,545
It is my honor to award you
with this commendation.

1296
01:55:46,146 --> 01:55:51,146
By Starfleet order 28455, you are hereby
directed to report to admiral Pike...

1297
01:55:51,147 --> 01:55:55,447
USS Enterprise,
for duty as his relief.

1298
01:56:03,049 --> 01:56:05,249
I relieve you, sir.

1299
01:56:05,349 --> 01:56:08,051
I am relieved.

1300
01:56:09,051 --> 01:56:12,351
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations, captain.

1301
01:56:13,451 --> 01:56:16,352
Your father would be proud of you.

1302
01:56:45,058 --> 01:56:47,157
Thrusters on full.

1303
01:56:47,158 --> 01:56:49,958
Firing thrusters and impulse
engines at your command, sir.

1304
01:56:49,959 --> 01:56:52,859
Weapon systems
and shields on standby.

1305
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:56,261
Dock control
reports ready, captain.

1306
01:56:59,761 --> 01:57:01,561
Bones.

1307
01:57:01,861 --> 01:57:04,262
Buckle up.

1308
01:57:07,063 --> 01:57:08,862
Scotty, how we doin'?

1309
01:57:08,863 --> 01:57:11,963
Dilithium chambers
at maximum captain.

1310
01:57:12,563 --> 01:57:15,065
Get down!

1311
01:57:16,165 --> 01:57:19,765
Mr. Sulu,
prepare to engage thrusters.

1312
01:57:21,966 --> 01:57:24,466
Permission to come aboard, captain.

1313
01:57:24,766 --> 01:57:27,167
Permission granted.

1314
01:57:27,267 --> 01:57:29,467
As you have yet to select
a first officer,

1315
01:57:29,468 --> 01:57:32,568
respectfully I would like
to submit my candidacy.

1316
01:57:32,968 --> 01:57:36,369
Should you desire I can provide
character references.

1317
01:57:36,969 --> 01:57:39,670
It would be my honor commander.

1318
01:57:42,870 --> 01:57:45,670
Maneuvering thrusters Mr. Sulu.

1319
01:57:47,372 --> 01:57:50,471
- Thrusters on standby.
- Take us out.

1320
01:57:50,472 --> 01:57:52,472
Aye aye, captain.

1321
01:57:56,473 --> 01:58:00,374
SPACE, THE FINAL FRONTIER

1322
01:58:01,374 --> 01:58:05,575
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES OF
THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE

1323
01:58:05,975 --> 01:58:10,476
HER ONGOING MISSION: TO
EXPLORE STRANGE NEW WORLDS,

1324
01:58:10,576 --> 01:58:14,876
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE FORMS
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS

1325
01:58:14,877 --> 01:58:20,078
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO ONE
HAS GONE BEFORE.

1326
