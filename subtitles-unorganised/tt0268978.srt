1
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:30,294
Mathematicians won the war.

2
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:34,031
Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes...

3
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:36,509
and built the A-bomb.

4
00:01:36,578 --> 00:01:39,979
Mathematicians... like you.

5
00:01:40,716 --> 00:01:44,743
The stated goal of the
Soviets is global communism.

6
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,015
In medicine or economics,

7
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:49,353
in technology or space,

8
00:01:49,424 --> 00:01:51,255
battle lines are being drawn.

9
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:55,019
To triumph, we need results.

10
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:57,964
Publishable, applicable results.

11
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:03,900
Now who among you will be the
next Morse? The next Einstein?

12
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:07,005
Who among you will be the vanguard

13
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:10,567
of democracy, freedom, and discovery?

14
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:13,341
Today, we bequeath America's future

15
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:16,077
into your able hands.

16
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:19,018
Welcome to Princeton, gentlemen.

17
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:38,504
Man: It's not enough Hansen
won the Carnegie Scholarship.

18
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,600
Man #2: No, he has to
have it all for himself.

19
00:02:41,676 --> 00:02:43,200
It's the first time the Carnegie prize

20
00:02:43,278 --> 00:02:44,870
has been split. Hansen's all bent.

21
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:47,414
Man #2. Rumor is he's got
his sights set on Wheeler Lab,

22
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:49,177
the new military think tank at M.I.T.

23
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:51,947
They're only taking one this year.

24
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,181
Hansen's used to being picked first.

25
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:55,814
Oh, yeah, he's wasted on math.

26
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:57,756
He should be running for president.

27
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:09,666
There could be a
mathematical explanation

28
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:11,365
for how bad your tie is.

29
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:18,670
Thank you.

30
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:21,981
Neilson, symbol cryptography.

31
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,278
Neils here broke a Jap code.

32
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:25,582
Helped rid the world of fascism.

33
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:28,282
At least that's what he
tells the girls, eh, Neils?

34
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:30,221
The name's Bender. Atomic physics.

35
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:32,351
- And you are?
- Am I late?

36
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:33,689
- Yes.
- Yes, Mr. Sol.

37
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:35,992
Oh, good. Uh, hi.

38
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,192
- Sol. Richard Sol.
- Neilson. The burden of genius.

39
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:41,735
- Bender: There he is.
- So many supplicants, and so little time.

40
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:43,498
- Mr. Sol.
- How are you, sir?

41
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:45,039
- Ah, Bender.
- Nice to see you.

42
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:47,472
- Congratulations, Mr. Hansen.
- Ah, thank you.

43
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,976
I'll take another.

44
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:52,013
Excuse me?

45
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,605
A thousand pardons. I simply
assumed you were the waiter.

46
00:03:54,683 --> 00:03:57,117
- Play nice, Hansen.
- Nice is not Hansen's strong suit.

47
00:03:57,185 --> 00:03:58,413
Hansen. Honest mistake.

48
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:00,954
Well, Martin Hansen.

49
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:02,990
It is Martin, isn't it?

50
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:05,423
Why, yes, John, it is.

51
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:09,020
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

52
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:13,661
I've read your pre-prints...

53
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:16,431
Both of them.

54
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:18,404
The one on Nazi ciphers,

55
00:04:18,473 --> 00:04:21,408
and the other one on
non-linear equations,

56
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:23,137
and I am supremely confident

57
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:24,803
that there is not a single seminal

58
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,780
or innovative idea
in either one of them.

59
00:04:30,085 --> 00:04:32,144
Enjoy your punch.

60
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:37,888
Gentlemen, meet John Nash,

61
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:41,152
the mysterious West Virginia genius.

62
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:43,891
The other winner of the
distinguished Carnegie Scholarship.

63
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:45,933
- Bender. Oh, okay.
- Sol. Oh, yeah?

64
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:47,298
Bender. Of course.

65
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:19,066
Oh, Christ.

66
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:24,732
The prodigal roommate arrives.

67
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:26,569
Roommate?

68
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:28,404
Oh, God, no.

69
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:30,476
- Ugh.

70
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:34,343
Did you know that
having a hangover is...

71
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,543
Is not having enough water in your body

72
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:38,643
to run your Krebs cycles?

73
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,655
Which is exactly what happens to you

74
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:43,281
when you're dying of thirst.

75
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:46,327
So, dying of thirst...

76
00:05:46,895 --> 00:05:49,625
would probably feel

77
00:05:49,698 --> 00:05:52,292
pretty much like the hangover

78
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:54,631
that finally bloody kills you.

79
00:05:54,703 --> 00:05:56,000
(Chuckles)

80
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:57,470
John Nash?

81
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,439
Hello.

82
00:05:59,507 --> 00:06:00,997
Charles Herman.

83
00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:03,101
Pleased to meet you.

84
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,447
Player: All right, well done.

85
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:21,455
Charles. Well, it's official.

86
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:23,622
I'm almost human again.

87
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:25,427
Officer, I saw the driver who hit me.

88
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,229
His name was Johnny Walker.

89
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:28,997
(Mimics Rim shot)

90
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:32,403
Whew.

91
00:06:32,974 --> 00:06:34,908
Well, I got in last night

92
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,068
in time for...

93
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:38,271
English department cocktails.

94
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:39,677
Cock was mine,

95
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:42,080
the tail belonged to a
particularly lovely young thing

96
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,744
with a passion for...

97
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:48,346
D.H. Lawrence. You're not
easily distracted, are you?

98
00:06:48,423 --> 00:06:51,256
- I'm here to work.
- Hmmm, are you? Right.

99
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:53,157
I see. Crikey!

100
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:04,802
Is my roommate a dick?

101
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,475
Hmm?

102
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,636
Listen.

103
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:12,077
If we can't break the ice...

104
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:15,416
How about we drown it?

105
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:27,190
So what's your story?

106
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:31,389
You the poor kid that never
got to go to Exeter or Andover?

107
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:33,958
Despite my privileged upbringing,

108
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:35,434
I'm actually quite well-balanced.

109
00:07:35,503 --> 00:07:36,902
I have a chip on both shoulders.

110
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,865
Maybe you're just better

111
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:42,876
with the old integers
than you are with people.

112
00:07:42,944 --> 00:07:44,809
My first grade teacher, she told me

113
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,870
that I was born with
two helpings of brain,

114
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:48,575
but only half a helping of heart.

115
00:07:50,118 --> 00:07:52,484
Wow! She sounds lovely!

116
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:55,086
The truth is that l...

117
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:57,522
I don't like people much.

118
00:07:57,592 --> 00:07:59,753
And they don't much like me.

119
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:01,056
But why,

120
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:02,824
with all your obvious wit and charm?

121
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,061
Seriously, John.

122
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:10,501
Mathematics...

123
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:14,372
Mathematics is never going
to lead you to a higher truth.

124
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,433
And you know why?

125
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:17,944
'Cause it's boring.

126
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:19,012
It's really boring.

127
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:23,010
You know half these schoolboys
are already published?

128
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:27,612
I cannot waste time
with these classes...

129
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:29,452
and these books.

130
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,451
Memorizing the weaker
assumptions of lesser mortals!

131
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:39,729
I need to look through...

132
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:41,894
to the governing dynamics.

133
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,208
Find a truly original idea.

134
00:08:48,276 --> 00:08:50,267
That's the only way I'll
ever distinguish myself.

135
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:51,937
It's the only way that I'll ever...

136
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:53,412
Matter.

137
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,911
Yes.

138
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:00,749
Hansen: All right, who's next?

139
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:02,949
No, I've played enough
"go" for one day, thank you.

140
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:04,616
- Come on.
- l... I hate this game.

141
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:06,455
Cowards, all of you!

142
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:08,393
None of you rise to meet my challenge?

143
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:10,021
Come on, Bender. Whoever wins,

144
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:12,123
Sol does his laundry all semester.

145
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,930
- Does that seem unfair to anyone else?
- Not at all.

146
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:19,368
- Bender. Look at him.
- Nash!

147
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,067
Taking a reverse constitutional?

148
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:22,939
I'm hoping to extract an algorithm

149
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:25,002
to define their movement.

150
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:30,517
- Oh.
- Psycho.

151
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:33,380
Sol: Hey, Nash, I
thought you dropped out.

152
00:09:33,454 --> 00:09:35,081
You ever going to go to class or...

153
00:09:35,156 --> 00:09:37,454
Classes will dull your mind.

154
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:41,017
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.

155
00:09:41,095 --> 00:09:43,029
Oh, oh, I didn't know that.

156
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:45,190
Nash is going to stun
us all with his genius.

157
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:46,858
Which is another way of saying

158
00:09:46,935 --> 00:09:48,926
he doesn't have the nerve to compete.

159
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:52,203
You scared?

160
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:53,706
Terrified.

161
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,140
Mortified. Petrified.

162
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,905
Stupefied... by you.

163
00:09:57,912 --> 00:09:59,539
No starch.

164
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:01,605
Pressed and folded.

165
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:06,520
Let me ask you something, John.

166
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:08,419
Be my guest, Martin.

167
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:10,252
Bender and Sol here correctly completed

168
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:12,384
Allen's proof of Peyrot's Conjecture.

169
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,519
Adequate work...

170
00:10:14,596 --> 00:10:16,291
without innovation.

171
00:10:16,364 --> 00:10:18,127
Oh. I'm flattered. You flattered?

172
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:19,325
Flattered.

173
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,595
And I've got two weapons briefs

174
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:24,069
under security review by the D.O.D.

175
00:10:24,138 --> 00:10:26,333
Derivative drivel.

176
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:29,207
But Nash achievements:

177
00:10:29,277 --> 00:10:30,676
zero.

178
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:33,475
I'm a patient man, Martin. Is
there an actual question coming?

179
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:37,985
What if you never come up
with your original idea?

180
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:40,020
Huh?

181
00:10:40,088 --> 00:10:42,556
How will it feel when
I'm chosen for Wheeler...

182
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,786
and you're not?

183
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:50,495
What if you lose?

184
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:56,401
Bender. Ah, there it is.

185
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:02,675
You should not have won.

186
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:04,177
Hmmm.

187
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:06,839
I had the first move,
my... my play was perfect.

188
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:08,404
The hubris of the defeated.

189
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:10,713
The game is flawed.

190
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:19,750
Gentlemen, the great John Nash.

191
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,427
Charles. You've been
in here for two days.

192
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:34,302
You know Hansen's just
published another paper?

193
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,570
I can't even find a
topic for my doctorate.

194
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,806
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

195
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:46,678
This is a group playing touch football.

196
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:50,155
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over bread crumbs.

197
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:55,785
And this here is a woman who is
chasing a man who stole her purse.

198
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:58,928
John, you watched a mugging.

199
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,467
That's weird.

200
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:03,231
In competitive behavior
someone always loses.

201
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:07,001
Well, my niece knows that,
John, and she's about this high.

202
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:10,408
See, if I could derive an equilibrium

203
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:13,038
where prevalence is
a non-singular event,

204
00:12:13,114 --> 00:12:15,446
where nobody loses,

205
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:17,541
can you imagine the
effect that would have

206
00:12:17,618 --> 00:12:21,554
- on conflict scenarios, and arms negotiations...
- When did you last eat?

207
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:24,090
- When did you last eat?
...Currency exchange?

208
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:25,921
You know, food.

209
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:29,956
You have no respect for
cognitive reverie, you know that?

210
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:32,591
Yes. But pizza...

211
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:37,103
Now, pizza I have enormous respect for.

212
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:40,265
And of course beer.

213
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,374
I have respect for beer.

214
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:52,209
I have respect for beer!

215
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,960
- Bender. Good evening, Neils.
- Hansen. Hey, Nash.

216
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:03,963
Who's winning? You or you?

217
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:06,727
- Bender. Evening, Nash.
- Sol. Hey, guys.

218
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:08,666
Hey, Nash.

219
00:13:08,736 --> 00:13:11,534
Woman: He's looking at you for sure.

220
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:17,836
Hey, Nash.

221
00:13:17,912 --> 00:13:19,539
Neils is trying to get your attention.

222
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:21,946
- Bender. You're joking.
- Sol. Oh, no.

223
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,681
- Go with God.
- Come back a man.

224
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:33,823
- Fortune favors the brave.
- Bombs away.

225
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:39,931
Gentlemen, might I remind
you that my odds of success

226
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:41,969
dramatically improve with each attempt?

227
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:53,637
This is going to be classic.

228
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:26,278
Maybe you want to buy me a drink.

229
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:33,112
I don't exactly know
what I'm required to say

230
00:14:33,187 --> 00:14:35,246
in order for you to
have intercourse with me,

231
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,984
but could we assume
that I said all that?

232
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,927
Essentially we're talking
about fluid exchange, right?

233
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:43,930
So, could we just go
straight to the sex?

234
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:46,931
Oh, that was sweet.

235
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,963
Have a nice night, asshole!

236
00:14:51,038 --> 00:14:53,038
- Neilson. Ladies, wait!

237
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:55,900
Charles. l...

238
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:58,411
I especially liked the
bit about fluid exchange.

239
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:01,039
It was really charming.

240
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:06,782
Professor. Walk with me, John.

241
00:15:06,854 --> 00:15:08,617
I've been meaning to talk with you.

242
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:13,353
The faculty is completing
mid-year reviews.

243
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:16,590
We're deciding which placement
applications to support.

244
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:18,393
Wheeler, sir. That
would be my first choice.

245
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:20,730
And actually, I don't really
have a second choice, sir.

246
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:23,429
John, your fellows
have attended classes.

247
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:25,131
They've written papers.
They've published.

248
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:27,333
I'm still searching, sir, for my...

249
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:29,933
- Your original idea, I know.
- Governing dynamics, sir.

250
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:31,672
It's very clever, John, but I'm afraid

251
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:34,010
it's just not nearly good enough.

252
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:41,952
- May I?
- Thank you.

253
00:15:43,057 --> 00:15:44,684
I've been working on manifold embedding.

254
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,159
My bargaining stratagems are
starting to show some promise.

255
00:15:47,228 --> 00:15:48,889
If you could just
arrange another meeting,

256
00:15:48,963 --> 00:15:50,362
if you'd be kind enough,
with Professor Einstein...

257
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:52,423
- I've repeatedly asked you for that.
- Now, John.

258
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:54,934
I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his...

259
00:15:55,002 --> 00:15:56,469
John.

260
00:15:57,872 --> 00:15:59,965
Do you see what they're doing in there?

261
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,702
- Professor. Congratulations.
- Max. Thank you so much.

262
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:05,644
Congratulations, Professor Max.

263
00:16:05,713 --> 00:16:08,113
- Max. Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

264
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:10,583
It's the pens.

265
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:12,915
Reserved for a member of the department

266
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:14,887
that makes the
achievement of a lifetime.

267
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:17,618
Now, what do you see, John?

268
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:20,422
Recognition.

269
00:16:20,494 --> 00:16:23,258
Well done, Professor, well done.

270
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,765
Well, try seeing accomplishment.

271
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,630
Is there a difference?

272
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:28,999
John,

273
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,561
you haven't focused.

274
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:36,101
I'm sorry, but up to this point,

275
00:16:36,177 --> 00:16:38,873
your record doesn't warrant
any placement at all.

276
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:43,944
Good day.

277
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:56,290
And my compliments to you, sir.

278
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:58,457
Thank you so much.

279
00:17:15,082 --> 00:17:17,050
I can't see it.

280
00:17:23,524 --> 00:17:26,391
- Aah!
- Jesus Christ, John.

281
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,860
I can't fail.

282
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,830
- This is all I am.
- Come on, let's go out.

283
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:33,890
- I got to get something done.
- John!

284
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:36,801
- I can't keep staring into space.
- John, enough!

285
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:39,396
Got to face the wall, follow
their rules, read their books...

286
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:40,963
you want to do some damage? Fine...

287
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,101
- But don't mess around.
...Do their classes.

288
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:45,270
Come on! Go on, bust your head!

289
00:17:45,346 --> 00:17:47,041
Kill yourself.

290
00:17:47,114 --> 00:17:49,480
John, do it. Don't mess around.

291
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,279
Bust your head! Go on,

292
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:53,320
bust that worthless head wide open.

293
00:17:53,387 --> 00:17:55,514
Goddamn it, Charles! What
the hell is your problem?!

294
00:17:59,393 --> 00:18:01,520
It's not my problem.

295
00:18:01,595 --> 00:18:04,860
And it's not your problem.

296
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:10,134
It's their problem.

297
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:13,298
Your answer isn't face the wall.

298
00:18:13,374 --> 00:18:15,740
It's out there...

299
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,437
where you've been working.

300
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,157
That was heavy.

301
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:46,901
That Isaac Newton fellow was right.

302
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:48,771
- He was onto something.
- Clever boy.

303
00:18:50,144 --> 00:18:51,839
John. Don't worry, that's mine.

304
00:18:51,912 --> 00:18:54,107
I'll come and get it in a minute.

305
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:56,181
- Oh, God.

306
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:09,529
Nash, you might want to stop

307
00:19:10,297 --> 00:19:13,528
shuffling your papers for five seconds.

308
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:18,830
I will not buy you gentlemen beer.

309
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:21,466
Bender. Oh, we're not
here for beer, my friend.

310
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,876
Does anyone else feel she
should be moving in slow motion?

311
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:31,611
Will she want a large wedding, ya think?

312
00:19:31,685 --> 00:19:33,152
Shall we say swords, gentlemen?

313
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,189
- Pistols at dawn?
- Have you remembered nothing?

314
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:38,589
Recall the lessons of Adam Smith,

315
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:40,593
the father of modern economics.

316
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,492
"In competition...

317
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:44,563
individual ambition serves the common good."

318
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,631
- Exactly.
- Every man for himself, gentlemen.

319
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:50,693
Bender: And those who strike
out are stuck with her friends.

320
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:52,363
Hansen. I'm not gonna strike out.

321
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:55,169
Sol. You can lead a blonde to
water, but you can't make her drink.

322
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:57,233
- I don't think he said that.
- Sol: Nobody move...

323
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,370
She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.

324
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:02,142
Hansen. Oh, God. He may
have the upper hand now,

325
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:04,275
but wait until he opens his mouth.

326
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:05,351
- Remember the last time?

327
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:08,812
Bender. Oh, yes, that was
one for the history books.

328
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:16,592
Adam Smith needs revision.

329
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:18,632
What are you talking about?

330
00:20:18,699 --> 00:20:21,361
If we all go for the blonde...

331
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,498
we block each other.

332
00:20:28,742 --> 00:20:31,836
Not a single one of us is gonna get her.

333
00:20:31,912 --> 00:20:34,574
So then we go for her friends,

334
00:20:35,783 --> 00:20:37,410
but they will all give
us the cold shoulder

335
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:40,044
because nobody likes
to be second choice.

336
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,055
Well, what if no one
goes for the blonde?

337
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:46,888
We don't get in each other's way,

338
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:49,896
and we don't insult the other girls.

339
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:53,262
That's the only way we win.

340
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:56,834
That's the only way we all get laid.

341
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,641
Adam Smith said

342
00:21:04,712 --> 00:21:06,737
the best result comes

343
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:08,406
from everyone in the group doing

344
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:09,972
what's best for himself, right?

345
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,210
That's what he said, right?

346
00:21:11,285 --> 00:21:12,445
- Right.
- Incomplete.

347
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,111
Incomplete, okay?

348
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:16,748
Because the best result will come...

349
00:21:17,825 --> 00:21:19,486
from everyone in the group

350
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,256
doing what's best for himself...

351
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:23,887
and the group.

352
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:26,831
Nash, if this is some way for
you to get the blonde on your own,

353
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:29,165
- you can go to hell.
- Governing dynamics.

354
00:21:29,236 --> 00:21:32,262
Governing dynamics. Adam Smith...

355
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:34,034
was wrong.

356
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:36,906
- Sol: Oh, here we go.
- Neilson: Careful, careful.

357
00:21:39,113 --> 00:21:41,172
Thank you.

358
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:55,794
"C" of "S" equals "C" of "T."

359
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:00,151
You do realize this flies in the face

360
00:23:00,227 --> 00:23:02,991
- of a 150 years of economic theory?
- Yes, I do, sir.

361
00:23:03,063 --> 00:23:04,928
That's rather presumptuous,
don't you think?

362
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:05,999
It is, sir.

363
00:23:13,507 --> 00:23:15,236
Well, Mr. Nash,

364
00:23:16,443 --> 00:23:18,673
with a breakthrough of this magnitude,

365
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:22,512
I'm confident you will
get any placement you like.

366
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:30,819
Wheeler Labs,

367
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:34,520
they'll ask you to
recommend two team members.

368
00:23:34,595 --> 00:23:35,595
Yes!

369
00:23:37,765 --> 00:23:40,529
Stills and Frank are excellent choices.

370
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:42,262
Sol and Bender, sir.

371
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,965
Sol and Bender are
extraordinary mathematicians.

372
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,099
Has it occurred to
you that Sol and Bender

373
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:49,733
might have plans of their own?

374
00:23:54,982 --> 00:23:57,780
- Baby!
- Wheeler, we made it!

375
00:23:57,851 --> 00:24:02,982
- Cheers, cheers, cheers!
- To... oh! Oh!

376
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:05,685
Okay, awkward moment, gentlemen.

377
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,248
Umm...

378
00:24:28,315 --> 00:24:30,010
hmm.

379
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:32,382
Governing dynamics.

380
00:24:34,755 --> 00:24:36,985
- Congratulations, John.
- Thanks.

381
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:38,820
- Toast!
- To Wheeler Labs!

382
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:40,655
Neilson. To Wheeler!

383
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:54,237
The Pentagon 1953 Five Years Later

384
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:07,178
Man. General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.

385
00:25:07,254 --> 00:25:09,154
Dr. Nash, your coat?

386
00:25:09,223 --> 00:25:11,123
Thank you, sir.

387
00:25:11,191 --> 00:25:15,127
Doctor. General, this is Wheeler
team leader Dr. John Nash.

388
00:25:15,195 --> 00:25:17,288
Glad you could come, Doctor.

389
00:25:17,364 --> 00:25:18,490
Hello.

390
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:20,396
Right this way.

391
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:24,301
We've been intercepting radio
transmissions from Moscow.

392
00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:26,805
The computer can't detect a pattern,

393
00:25:26,874 --> 00:25:28,569
but I'm sure it's code.

394
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:31,008
John: Why is that, General?

395
00:25:31,078 --> 00:25:33,569
Ever just know something, Dr. Nash?

396
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,811
Constantly.

397
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:42,214
General. We've developed
several ciphers.

398
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,320
If you'd like to review
our preliminary data...

399
00:25:48,462 --> 00:25:49,827
Doctor?

400
00:25:49,897 --> 00:25:50,897
6-7-3-7,

401
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:53,398

0-3-6...

402
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,071

8-4-9-4.

403
00:26:39,846 --> 00:26:41,871

9-1-4-0-3-4.

404
00:26:58,565 --> 00:27:00,157
I need a map.

405
00:27:02,936 --> 00:27:04,426
46-1
3-08,

406
00:27:04,504 --> 00:27:07,098

67-46-90.

407
00:27:09,076 --> 00:27:11,271
Starkey Corners, Maine.

408
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:13,906

48-03-01,

409
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:17,348
91
-26-3 5.

410
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:19,476
Prairie Portage, Minnesota.

411
00:27:19,553 --> 00:27:22,750
These are latitudes and longitudes.

412
00:27:22,823 --> 00:27:24,222
There are a least 10 others.

413
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:27,055
They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the U.S.

414
00:27:28,662 --> 00:27:31,495
Extraordinary.

415
00:27:31,565 --> 00:27:35,126
Gentlemen, we need to move on this.

416
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,160
Who's big brother?

417
00:27:38,238 --> 00:27:40,638
You've done your country
a great service, son.

418
00:27:41,642 --> 00:27:44,406
- Captain!
- Yes, sir.

419
00:27:44,478 --> 00:27:46,844
Accompany Dr. Nash.

420
00:27:46,913 --> 00:27:49,848
What are the Russians moving, general?

421
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:51,508
Captain Rogers will escort you

422
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:53,382
to the unrestricted area, Doctor.

423
00:27:53,453 --> 00:27:55,114
Thank you.

424
00:27:55,188 --> 00:27:57,588
Captain. Dr. Nash, follow me, please.

425
00:28:04,498 --> 00:28:06,329
Man On Radio. None of those who have

426
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,061
said they don't like the method

427
00:28:08,135 --> 00:28:10,501
have told us any other
method they could use

428
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,128
that would be effective.

429
00:28:12,205 --> 00:28:14,298
- And when you hear...
- Driver: It's Dr. Nash.

430
00:28:14,374 --> 00:28:16,342
All right.

431
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:24,915
Wheeler Defense Labs MIT Campus

432
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:31,653
- Thank you, sir.
- Home run at the Pentagon?

433
00:28:31,692 --> 00:28:34,092
Have they actually taken
the word "classified"

434
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:35,321
out of the dictionary?

435
00:28:35,896 --> 00:28:38,330
Oh, hi. The air
conditioning broke again.

436
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:40,457
How am I supposed to be
in here saving the world

437
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:43,367
- if I'm melting?
- Our hearts go out to you.

438
00:28:43,437 --> 00:28:46,429
You know, two trips to
the Pentagon in four years.

439
00:28:46,506 --> 00:28:48,030
That's two more than we've had.

440
00:28:48,108 --> 00:28:49,541
It gets better, John.

441
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:52,169
Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.

442
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:54,179
You know, the Russians have the H-bomb,

443
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:56,340
the Nazis are
repatriating South America,

444
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:59,715
the Chinese have a standing
army of 2.8 million,

445
00:28:59,786 --> 00:29:03,313
and I am doing stress tests on a dam.

446
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,120
You made the cover of Fortune... again.

447
00:29:06,193 --> 00:29:08,821
Please note the use of
the word "you," not "we."

448
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,823
That was supposed to be just me.

449
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:16,601
So not only do they rob
me of the Fields medal,

450
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,002
now they put me on the
cover of Fortune magazine

451
00:29:19,072 --> 00:29:22,132
with these hacks, these
scholars of trivia.

452
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:23,801
John, exactly what's the difference

453
00:29:23,877 --> 00:29:26,209
between genius and most genius?

454
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,042
Quite a lot.

455
00:29:28,115 --> 00:29:30,379
He's your son.

456
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,849
Anyway, you've got 10 minutes.

457
00:29:31,918 --> 00:29:33,909
I've always got 10 minutes.

458
00:29:33,987 --> 00:29:34,987
Before your new class?

459
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:43,521
Can I not get a note from
a doctor or something?

460
00:29:44,097 --> 00:29:46,793
You are a doctor, John, and no.

461
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,528
Now, come on, you know the drill,

462
00:29:48,602 --> 00:29:50,365
we get these beautiful facilities,

463
00:29:50,437 --> 00:29:52,496
M.I.T. gets America's
great minds of today

464
00:29:52,572 --> 00:29:54,281
teaching America's
great minds of tomorrow.

465
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,935
Now, have a nice day at school.

466
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:58,479
The bell's ringing.

467
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:20,502
The eager young minds of tomorrow.

468
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,407
Can we leave one open, Professor?

469
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:33,915
It's really hot, sir.

470
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:37,653
Your comfort comes second

471
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:39,848
to my ability to hear my own voice.

472
00:30:45,295 --> 00:30:47,593
Personally,

473
00:30:47,664 --> 00:30:49,632
I think this class will be a waste...

474
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:51,690
of your...

475
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,633
And what is infinitely worse...

476
00:30:54,804 --> 00:30:57,170
my time.

477
00:30:58,174 --> 00:31:01,075
However, here we are.

478
00:31:01,144 --> 00:31:04,944
So you may attend or not.

479
00:31:05,014 --> 00:31:07,209
You may complete your
assignments at your whim.

480
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:09,547
We have begun.

481
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:13,153
Miss.

482
00:31:16,326 --> 00:31:18,385
Excuse me!

483
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,929
- Excuse me!
- Hey, hey!

484
00:31:20,997 --> 00:31:22,760
Hi!

485
00:31:22,832 --> 00:31:25,767
Um, we have a little problem.

486
00:31:25,835 --> 00:31:29,498
It's extremely hot in here
with the windows closed

487
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,507
and extremely noisy with them open.

488
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:34,237
So, I was wondering if
there was any way you could,

489
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:37,940
I don't know, maybe work someplace
else for about 45 minutes?

490
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:41,007
- Worker: Not a problem.
- Thank you so much!

491
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:43,644
- At a break!
- Got it!

492
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,881
Worker. Let's go. Let's
clean it a little bit!

493
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,590
As you will find in multivariable
calculus, there is often...

494
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:54,129
a number of solutions
for any given problem.

495
00:31:57,901 --> 00:32:00,495
As I was saying, this problem here

496
00:32:01,037 --> 00:32:04,564
will take some of you
many months to solve.

497
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:07,303
For others among you,

498
00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:10,813
it will take you the term
of your natural lives.

499
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:28,086
Man. Professor Nash.

500
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:41,804
William Parcher.

501
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:44,938
Big brother,

502
00:32:45,014 --> 00:32:46,879
at your service.

503
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,578
What can I do for the
Department of Defense?

504
00:32:49,652 --> 00:32:51,517
Are you going to give me a raise?

505
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:53,579
Let's take a walk.

506
00:32:54,924 --> 00:32:57,916
- Impressive work at the Pentagon.
- Yes, it was.

507
00:32:57,994 --> 00:32:59,359
Oppenheimer used to say,

508
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:01,954
"Genius sees the answer
before the question."

509
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:03,965
You knew Oppenheimer?

510
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:06,695
His project was under my supervision.

511
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:08,760
Which project?

512
00:33:10,373 --> 00:33:12,136
That project.

513
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,869
It's not that simple, you know?

514
00:33:13,943 --> 00:33:15,570
Well, you ended the war.

515
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:19,274
We incinerated 150,000
people in a heartbeat.

516
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:22,216
Great deeds come at
great cost, Mr. Parcher.

517
00:33:22,952 --> 00:33:25,944
Well, conviction, it turns out,

518
00:33:26,022 --> 00:33:29,321
is a luxury of those on
the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

519
00:33:31,027 --> 00:33:33,086
I'll try and keep that in mind.

520
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:39,095
So, John, no family,

521
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:41,033
no close friends...

522
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:42,594
Why is that?

523
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:45,163
John: I like to think it's
because I'm a lone wolf.

524
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:48,972
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.

525
00:33:50,346 --> 00:33:51,904
Well, there are certain endeavors

526
00:33:51,981 --> 00:33:53,778
where your lack of personal connection

527
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,977
would be considered an advantage.

528
00:33:57,754 --> 00:34:01,190
- This is a secure area.
- They know me.

529
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,418
Have you ever been here?

530
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:07,292
We were told during our initial briefing

531
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:09,354
that these warehouses were abandoned.

532
00:34:09,432 --> 00:34:11,593
That's not precisely accurate.

533
00:34:45,904 --> 00:34:47,895
By telling you what
I'm about to tell you,

534
00:34:47,973 --> 00:34:49,702
I am increasing your security clearance

535
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:51,299
to top secret.

536
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:55,143
Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.

537
00:34:55,214 --> 00:34:56,545
Get it?

538
00:34:56,615 --> 00:34:58,640
What operation?

539
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:06,249
Those are a good idea.

540
00:35:09,995 --> 00:35:11,986
This factory is in Berlin.

541
00:35:12,064 --> 00:35:13,725
We seized it at the end of the war.

542
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:15,528
Nazi engineers were attempting

543
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:18,195
to build a portable atomic bomb.

544
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,831
The Soviets reached this facility before
we did, and we lost the damn thing.

545
00:35:24,943 --> 00:35:27,070
The routing orders at the Pentagon,

546
00:35:27,146 --> 00:35:29,341
they were about this, weren't they?

547
00:35:29,415 --> 00:35:33,215
The Soviets aren't as
unified as people believe.

548
00:35:33,285 --> 00:35:36,880
A faction of the Red Army
calling itself Novaya Svobga,

549
00:35:36,955 --> 00:35:39,321
"the New Freedom,"
has control of the bomb

550
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:42,019
and intends to detonate it on U.S. soil.

551
00:35:43,328 --> 00:35:46,991
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.

552
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:52,563
Parcher. Man is capable
of as much atrocity

553
00:35:52,604 --> 00:35:54,868
as he has imagination.

554
00:35:56,408 --> 00:35:59,741
New Freedom has sleeper
agents here in the U.S.

555
00:36:00,646 --> 00:36:02,739
McCarthy is an idiot,

556
00:36:02,815 --> 00:36:04,874
but unfortunately that
doesn't make him wrong.

557
00:36:05,784 --> 00:36:08,844
New Freedom communicates to its agents

558
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:11,754
through codes imbedded in
newspapers and magazines,

559
00:36:11,824 --> 00:36:13,416
and that's where you come in.

560
00:36:13,492 --> 00:36:14,925
You see, John,

561
00:36:14,993 --> 00:36:17,757
what distinguishes you

562
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,593
is that you are,

563
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:21,257
quite simply,

564
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:25,099
the best natural
code-breaker I have ever seen.

565
00:36:30,175 --> 00:36:33,667
What exactly is it that
you would like me to do?

566
00:36:38,684 --> 00:36:41,744
Commit this list of
periodicals to memory.

567
00:36:43,355 --> 00:36:46,882
Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes,

568
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,620
decipher them.

569
00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:52,823
Doctor: Place your
chin on the chin rest.

570
00:36:52,898 --> 00:36:56,698
- Stare into the light.
- Man. Pulse 88, regular.

571
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:01,662
Okay, this may be a
little uncomfortable.

572
00:37:04,443 --> 00:37:06,377
That's got a little
zap to it, doesn't it?

573
00:37:06,445 --> 00:37:09,676
He just implanted a radium diode.

574
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:11,807
Don't worry, it's safe.

575
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:14,683
The isotope decays predictably.

576
00:37:14,753 --> 00:37:17,950
As a result, these
numbers change over time.

577
00:37:18,023 --> 00:37:21,424
They're the access
codes to your drop spot.

578
00:37:22,995 --> 00:37:26,328
So what am I now, a spy?

579
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:41,009
- Come.

580
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:47,078
Boy, you must be really important.

581
00:37:54,793 --> 00:37:57,227
It's all right, Mike.

582
00:38:06,638 --> 00:38:07,900
What are you working on?

583
00:38:10,242 --> 00:38:11,903
Classified.

584
00:38:13,779 --> 00:38:15,576
Everyone waited half an hour.

585
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:17,342
For?

586
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:19,384
Class.

587
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:21,248
You missed class today.

588
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,754
Oh. I suspect that...

589
00:38:25,657 --> 00:38:27,386
nobody missed me.

590
00:38:28,994 --> 00:38:31,053
The problem that you
left on the board...

591
00:38:32,264 --> 00:38:34,698
I solved it.

592
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:36,461
Oh, no you didn't.

593
00:38:36,535 --> 00:38:38,935
You didn't even look.

594
00:38:39,004 --> 00:38:42,064
I never said that the Vector
Fields were rational functions.

595
00:38:46,345 --> 00:38:48,609
Your solution is elegant.

596
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:53,449
Though on this particular occasion,

597
00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:56,545
ultimately incorrect.

598
00:39:17,976 --> 00:39:19,409
You're still here.

599
00:39:19,478 --> 00:39:21,343
I'm still here.

600
00:39:22,247 --> 00:39:23,908
Why?

601
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:27,474
I'm wondering, Professor Nash,

602
00:39:29,087 --> 00:39:31,021
if I can ask you to dinner.

603
00:39:35,294 --> 00:39:37,194
You do eat, don't you?

604
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:39,262
Oh, on occasion, yeah

605
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:42,461
Table for one. Prometheus
alone chained to the rock

606
00:39:42,534 --> 00:39:44,832
with the bird circling
overhead, you know how it is.

607
00:39:48,006 --> 00:39:50,099
No, I expect that you wouldn't...

608
00:39:50,175 --> 00:39:51,870
You wouldn't know.

609
00:39:54,212 --> 00:39:56,874
If you leave your
address with my office,

610
00:39:56,948 --> 00:40:00,076
I'll pick you up Friday at 8:00

611
00:40:00,152 --> 00:40:02,677
and we'll eat.

612
00:40:09,961 --> 00:40:12,953
One more thing. Do you have a name,

613
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:15,022
or should I just keep
calling you "miss"?

614
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:19,860
Governor, may I present...

615
00:40:19,938 --> 00:40:21,906
- Miss Alicia Larde.
- Miss Alicia Larde.

616
00:40:21,973 --> 00:40:24,965
- How do you do?
- Professor, please. You and the governor.

617
00:40:28,046 --> 00:40:32,710
Wait, one second. I'm
sorry. I want a copy of this.

618
00:40:32,784 --> 00:40:34,911
First big date and all, you know.

619
00:40:34,986 --> 00:40:38,046
So, you boys need to look good.

620
00:40:39,624 --> 00:40:45,119
Which is not a state you find
yourselves in altogether naturally.

621
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:51,024
There. Better.

622
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:54,334
- I'm surprising him.
- You just keep on surprising him.

623
00:40:54,406 --> 00:40:56,271
Professor.

624
00:41:12,924 --> 00:41:15,051
God must be a painter.

625
00:41:15,127 --> 00:41:18,460
Why else would we have so many colors?

626
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:22,931
So you're a painter?

627
00:41:23,502 --> 00:41:26,903
That's not actually what I said,

628
00:41:26,972 --> 00:41:29,805
but, yes...

629
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:32,343
I am.

630
00:41:39,918 --> 00:41:42,079
Here.

631
00:41:42,154 --> 00:41:44,054
Me.

632
00:41:44,122 --> 00:41:45,680
Your date?

633
00:41:47,392 --> 00:41:50,384
Practice human interaction
and social comportment.

634
00:41:50,462 --> 00:41:52,589
That's a plan.

635
00:41:56,201 --> 00:41:58,829
Champagne would be lovely.

636
00:42:00,205 --> 00:42:02,173
I'll be outside.

637
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,333
I will get the champagne.

638
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:14,612
Oh, thank you.

639
00:42:15,854 --> 00:42:17,344
Thank you for that.

640
00:42:17,422 --> 00:42:19,754
No, keep it.

641
00:42:19,825 --> 00:42:22,885
I believe in deciding
things will be good luck.

642
00:42:22,961 --> 00:42:24,952
Do you?

643
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,964
No.

644
00:42:27,032 --> 00:42:29,023
I don't believe in luck.

645
00:42:33,371 --> 00:42:35,965
But I do believe in
assigning value to things.

646
00:42:36,975 --> 00:42:38,806
Oh.

647
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:48,742
I once tried to count them all.

648
00:42:49,754 --> 00:42:54,555
I actually made it to 4,348.

649
00:42:56,394 --> 00:42:59,022
You are exceptionally odd.

650
00:42:59,097 --> 00:43:01,964
I bet you're very
popular with the girls.

651
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:09,730
A pair of odd ducks, then.

652
00:43:09,808 --> 00:43:12,402
Mmm.

653
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,009
Pick a shape.

654
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:20,045
What?

655
00:43:20,118 --> 00:43:24,350
Pick a shape. An animal... anything.

656
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,386
Okay.

657
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,985
An umbrella.

658
00:44:07,566 --> 00:44:09,431
Do it again.

659
00:44:10,936 --> 00:44:12,528
- Do it again.
- All right.

660
00:44:12,604 --> 00:44:14,299
- What would you like?
- Do, uh...

661
00:44:14,372 --> 00:44:16,932
an octopus.

662
00:47:06,578 --> 00:47:08,978
Alicia: You don't talk much, do you?

663
00:47:09,047 --> 00:47:11,811
I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.

664
00:47:11,883 --> 00:47:13,714
I don't mean work.

665
00:47:18,857 --> 00:47:21,257
I find that polishing my interactions

666
00:47:21,326 --> 00:47:24,352
in order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort.

667
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,624
I have a tendency to
expedite information flow...

668
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:33,267
by being direct.

669
00:47:34,606 --> 00:47:36,733
I often don't get a pleasant result.

670
00:47:36,808 --> 00:47:38,105
Try me.

671
00:47:40,111 --> 00:47:41,840
All right.

672
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:47,281
I find you attractive.

673
00:47:48,286 --> 00:47:50,481
Your aggressive moves towards me

674
00:47:50,555 --> 00:47:52,352
indicate that you feel the same way.

675
00:47:52,423 --> 00:47:55,221
But still, ritual requires that we

676
00:47:55,293 --> 00:47:58,023
continue with a number
of platonic activities

677
00:47:58,096 --> 00:48:00,360
before we have sex.

678
00:48:00,431 --> 00:48:03,628
I am proceeding with those activities,

679
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:05,726
but in point of actual fact,

680
00:48:05,804 --> 00:48:09,900
all I really want to do is have
intercourse with you as soon as possible.

681
00:48:12,043 --> 00:48:14,204
Are you gonna slap me now?

682
00:48:38,803 --> 00:48:40,896
How was that result?

683
00:48:58,323 --> 00:48:59,847
Girl: What are you doing?

684
00:49:03,962 --> 00:49:06,954
I'm attempting to isolate
patterned re-occurrences

685
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:09,659
within periodicals over time... and you?

686
00:49:09,734 --> 00:49:11,964
You talk funny, Mr. Nash.

687
00:49:16,207 --> 00:49:18,141
Do I know you?

688
00:49:18,209 --> 00:49:22,305
My uncle says you're very
smart but not very nice,

689
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,473
so I shouldn't pay no
mind if you're mean to me.

690
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:26,574
And who might your uncle be?

691
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:29,085
The prodigal roommate...

692
00:49:29,153 --> 00:49:31,018
returns.

693
00:49:34,492 --> 00:49:37,256
- Come here.
- Charles, Charles, Charles.

694
00:49:42,467 --> 00:49:44,560
My sister...

695
00:49:44,636 --> 00:49:47,002
got herself killed in a car crash.

696
00:49:48,006 --> 00:49:49,667
Not too far now, Marcee!

697
00:49:50,775 --> 00:49:53,141
Her cowboy husband was too drunk

698
00:49:53,211 --> 00:49:55,338
to know that he was too drunk to drive.

699
00:49:55,413 --> 00:49:57,847
So, I took her in.

700
00:49:58,883 --> 00:50:02,512
- She's so small.
- She's young, John. That's how they come.

701
00:50:04,689 --> 00:50:06,680
I'm at Harvard...

702
00:50:06,758 --> 00:50:09,420
doing the great author's workshop.

703
00:50:09,494 --> 00:50:11,553
D.H. Bloody Lawrence.

704
00:50:11,629 --> 00:50:13,790
I really do think you should
buy yourself a new book.

705
00:50:15,967 --> 00:50:19,061
Well, I've been reading a lot about you.

706
00:50:20,071 --> 00:50:22,301
How are you, John?

707
00:50:22,373 --> 00:50:25,399
At first all my work here was trivial,

708
00:50:25,476 --> 00:50:28,172
but a new assignment came up and...

709
00:50:28,246 --> 00:50:31,238
I can't really tell you any details.

710
00:50:31,316 --> 00:50:33,648
Top secret? Black bag? Black ops?

711
00:50:33,718 --> 00:50:35,879
Something like that.

712
00:50:35,954 --> 00:50:39,651
- And, uh...
- yes?

713
00:50:39,724 --> 00:50:41,624
Well, l... I met a girl.

714
00:50:41,693 --> 00:50:44,628
- No! A human girl?
- Homo sapiens.

715
00:50:44,696 --> 00:50:46,891
- A biped?
- Yup. And contrary to all probabilities,

716
00:50:46,965 --> 00:50:49,399
she finds me attractive on
a number of different levels.

717
00:50:49,467 --> 00:50:49,467
Really?

718
00:50:50,401 --> 00:50:53,598
God, that's wonderful.

719
00:50:53,671 --> 00:50:56,538
There's no accounting
for taste, is there?

720
00:50:58,543 --> 00:51:00,670
Should I marry her?

721
00:51:00,745 --> 00:51:02,713
Oh, God. Right.

722
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,044
I mean, everything's going well.

723
00:51:05,116 --> 00:51:07,710
The job is fine. I have enough money.

724
00:51:07,785 --> 00:51:09,446
It all seems to add up.

725
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,455
But how do you know for sure?

726
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:17,795
Nothing's ever for sure, John.

727
00:51:17,862 --> 00:51:19,955
That's the only sure thing I do know.

728
00:51:26,971 --> 00:51:28,962
Waiter: Good evening.

729
00:51:35,213 --> 00:51:37,681
Alicia, please don't be angry.

730
00:51:37,749 --> 00:51:39,307
I just lost track of time at work...

731
00:51:40,385 --> 00:51:42,478
- again.
- Mm-hmm.

732
00:51:43,554 --> 00:51:45,044
I'm sorry.

733
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,055
I didn't have time to wrap it.

734
00:51:48,626 --> 00:51:50,617
Happy birthday.

735
00:51:54,899 --> 00:51:56,958
The refractive faces
of the glass, you see,

736
00:51:57,035 --> 00:51:58,832
they create a full wavelength dispersal,

737
00:51:58,903 --> 00:52:00,928
so if you look inside it, you can see...

738
00:52:01,005 --> 00:52:03,633
- Every possible color.
- Every possible color.

739
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:04,936
Yeah.

740
00:52:05,009 --> 00:52:07,569
Remember you said that
time God must be a painter,

741
00:52:07,645 --> 00:52:10,443
because of all the colors?
At the governor's house...

742
00:52:10,515 --> 00:52:12,312
you said that.

743
00:52:12,383 --> 00:52:14,544
I didn't think you were listening.

744
00:52:17,021 --> 00:52:19,114
I'm always listening.

745
00:52:25,396 --> 00:52:28,058
It's beautiful.

746
00:52:43,815 --> 00:52:47,012
Alicia, does our relationship
warrant long-term commitment?

747
00:52:47,085 --> 00:52:48,848
'Cause I need some kind of proof,

748
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,150
some kind of verifiable, empirical data.

749
00:52:56,828 --> 00:52:59,922
I'm sorry, just give me a moment...

750
00:53:01,132 --> 00:53:04,465
to redefine my girlish
notions of romance.

751
00:53:07,738 --> 00:53:09,899
A proof?

752
00:53:09,974 --> 00:53:11,566
Verifiable data.

753
00:53:11,642 --> 00:53:14,338
Um... okay.

754
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,011
Well, how big is the universe?

755
00:53:20,084 --> 00:53:21,676
Infinite.

756
00:53:21,752 --> 00:53:22,946
How do you know?

757
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,783
I know because all the data indicate it.

758
00:53:24,856 --> 00:53:26,585
- But it hasn't been proven yet?
- No.

759
00:53:26,657 --> 00:53:28,522
You haven't seen it.
How do you know for sure?

760
00:53:28,593 --> 00:53:31,528
I don't, I just believe it.

761
00:53:31,596 --> 00:53:33,188
Mmm.

762
00:53:34,765 --> 00:53:37,029
It's the same with love, I guess.

763
00:53:44,609 --> 00:53:46,236
Now,

764
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:48,437
the part that you don't know...

765
00:53:50,615 --> 00:53:53,448
is if I want to marry you.

766
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:16,602
Smile for the camera!

767
00:54:19,744 --> 00:54:21,268
Well done!

768
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:23,279
Oh, sweet pea.

769
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:25,008
- I love you.
- Congratulations.

770
00:54:25,082 --> 00:54:26,845
Hey, Sol.

771
00:54:26,918 --> 00:54:29,216
Woman. You look beautiful.

772
00:54:30,221 --> 00:54:31,483
Sol: Hi, how are you?

773
00:54:36,194 --> 00:54:38,424
Alicia: Hey, Sol.

774
00:54:38,496 --> 00:54:40,464
- Woman: Bye-bye.
- Man: Bye, now.

775
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:42,522
- Bye!
- Bye!

776
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,227
Be safe!

777
00:54:54,645 --> 00:54:57,671
Cambridge, MA October 1954

778
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:15,228
Get In. Hurry.

779
00:55:18,669 --> 00:55:21,604
They're following us.

780
00:55:25,176 --> 00:55:26,700
Who's... Who's following us?

781
00:55:26,777 --> 00:55:28,404
The drop's been compromised.

782
00:55:28,479 --> 00:55:30,413
Get down!

783
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:33,415
- Stay down.

784
00:56:00,711 --> 00:56:03,509
- Here, take this.
- I ain't shooting anybody.

785
00:56:03,581 --> 00:56:06,243
- Take the goddamn gun!
- No!

786
00:56:06,317 --> 00:56:07,909
Son of a...

787
00:56:24,568 --> 00:56:26,695
You stay back. Don't move.

788
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:15,917
Alicia. John?

789
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:23,583
Hi.

790
00:57:25,996 --> 00:57:27,725
Where were you?

791
00:57:30,835 --> 00:57:33,633
- S-Sol... - Yeah,
I talked to Sol.

792
00:57:33,704 --> 00:57:36,332
He said you left the office hours ago.

793
00:57:38,843 --> 00:57:41,403
Why didn't you call me?

794
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,445
Are you all right?

795
00:57:56,794 --> 00:57:58,421
Honey?

796
00:58:00,297 --> 00:58:01,423
John...

797
00:58:01,499 --> 00:58:04,764
Please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

798
00:58:05,836 --> 00:58:08,134
John, open the door.

799
00:58:09,807 --> 00:58:12,776
Come on, open the door! Let me in!

800
00:58:12,843 --> 00:58:14,811
Talk to me!

801
00:58:15,813 --> 00:58:17,371
John!

802
00:58:17,448 --> 00:58:20,542
Open the door!

803
00:58:37,168 --> 00:58:39,432
Woman: Watch for cars, kids.

804
00:59:21,412 --> 00:59:23,437
John.

805
00:59:23,514 --> 00:59:25,948
William.

806
00:59:26,016 --> 00:59:28,314
This is not what I signed on for.

807
00:59:28,385 --> 00:59:30,410
Every time a car backfires
or a door slams...

808
00:59:30,488 --> 00:59:34,288
I understand... better than
you could possibly imagine.

809
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:46,526
You need to calm down, John.

810
00:59:46,604 --> 00:59:49,232
Now listen to me. We're
closing in on the bomb,

811
00:59:49,306 --> 00:59:51,638
in large part due to your work.

812
00:59:51,709 --> 00:59:54,371
Now don't you think your
fear is a small price to pay?

813
00:59:54,445 --> 00:59:57,278
William, my circumstance has changed.

814
00:59:57,348 --> 00:59:59,680
Alicia's pregnant.

815
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:11,018
I told you attachments were dangerous.

816
01:00:11,095 --> 01:00:14,121
You chose to marry the girl.

817
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:16,758
I did nothing to prevent it.

818
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,961
The best way to ensure
everybody's safety

819
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:24,234
is for you to continue your work.

820
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:26,834
Well, I'll just quit.

821
01:00:26,911 --> 01:00:28,708
You won't.

822
01:00:28,779 --> 01:00:30,212
Why would I not?

823
01:00:30,281 --> 01:00:33,614
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.

824
01:00:34,618 --> 01:00:36,381
You quit working for me,

825
01:00:36,453 --> 01:00:39,183
I quit working for you.

826
01:00:51,802 --> 01:00:53,394
Parcher!

827
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:54,994
Parcher!

828
01:00:59,443 --> 01:01:01,604
John, you all right?

829
01:01:22,299 --> 01:01:23,732
John?

830
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:25,428
Turn it off! Turn off the light!

831
01:01:29,206 --> 01:01:30,867
Why would you do that?

832
01:01:30,941 --> 01:01:32,568
Why would you turn the light on?

833
01:01:32,643 --> 01:01:34,133
What is wrong with you?

834
01:01:34,211 --> 01:01:36,111
You have to go to your sister's.

835
01:01:37,448 --> 01:01:39,712
I left the car out the
back. You take Commonwealth.

836
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:43,014
- No side streets, you stay where it's crowded.
- John, I'm not going anywhere!

837
01:01:43,087 --> 01:01:45,453
When you get to your sister's,
you wait for me to call you.

838
01:01:45,522 --> 01:01:47,615
- No, I'm not going.
- Just get your things.

839
01:01:47,691 --> 01:01:50,251
- I'm not leaving...
- stop! Stop it!

840
01:01:50,327 --> 01:01:52,921
Please, Alicia.

841
01:01:52,997 --> 01:01:56,296
I'll explain when I can.

842
01:02:35,439 --> 01:02:39,307
Harvard University National
Mathematics Conference

843
01:02:42,713 --> 01:02:44,647
Marcee. Uncle John!

844
01:02:44,715 --> 01:02:46,808
Uncle John!

845
01:02:49,053 --> 01:02:52,511
- Hey, baby girl!
- (Marcee Laughing)

846
01:02:52,589 --> 01:02:55,353
Wow, someone needed a hug!

847
01:02:55,426 --> 01:02:58,054
I saw you on the slate
and I thought to myself,

848
01:02:58,128 --> 01:03:00,323
"How can I miss seeing a guest lecture

849
01:03:00,397 --> 01:03:02,592
by the inimitable John Nash"?

850
01:03:05,736 --> 01:03:07,533
What's wrong?

851
01:03:07,604 --> 01:03:12,735
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.

852
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:14,641
Well, now you tell me, what is it?

853
01:03:14,712 --> 01:03:16,907
Woman. Professor Nash!

854
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:19,244
Welcome!

855
01:03:20,951 --> 01:03:22,748
After?

856
01:03:28,358 --> 01:03:32,488
John: So, we see that the... the zeroes,

857
01:03:32,563 --> 01:03:35,157
of the Reimann zeta function,

858
01:03:35,232 --> 01:03:37,962
correspond to singularities

859
01:03:38,035 --> 01:03:41,232
in space-time,

860
01:03:41,305 --> 01:03:44,240
singularities in space-time...

861
01:03:47,111 --> 01:03:50,012
And conventional number theory...

862
01:03:51,949 --> 01:03:56,477
it breaks down in the face
of relativistic exploration.

863
01:04:11,835 --> 01:04:13,894
Sometimes our expectations

864
01:04:13,971 --> 01:04:16,405
are betrayed by the numbers.

865
01:04:16,473 --> 01:04:19,533
Variables are impossible
to assign any...

866
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:22,170
rational value.

867
01:04:42,032 --> 01:04:44,159
Professor Nash!

868
01:04:53,877 --> 01:04:56,539
- Hold it!
- Professor Nash?

869
01:04:58,482 --> 01:05:00,746
Professor Nash,

870
01:05:00,818 --> 01:05:04,254
let's avoid a scene, shall we?

871
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:06,312
What do you want?

872
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:08,984
My name is Rosen,

873
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:11,084
Dr. Rosen. I'm a psychiatrist.

874
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:14,255
Forgive me if I don't seem persuaded.

875
01:05:13,931 --> 01:05:16,593
I'd like you to come with me, John.

876
01:05:17,601 --> 01:05:19,535
Just for a chat.

877
01:05:20,604 --> 01:05:22,629
It appears I have no choice.

878
01:05:25,776 --> 01:05:27,243
Oh-hh!

879
01:05:34,185 --> 01:05:35,914
Help me! Somebody!

880
01:05:39,924 --> 01:05:40,924
Somebody!

881
01:05:41,559 --> 01:05:44,960
Help me! Get off me!

882
01:05:45,029 --> 01:05:47,395
I know who you are! I know who you are!

883
01:05:47,465 --> 01:05:49,092
No, no, no, no, don't.

884
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:51,066
Charles, they're Russians!
Charles, they're Russians!

885
01:05:51,135 --> 01:05:52,932
Call somebody! Call somebody, Charles!

886
01:05:53,003 --> 01:05:54,493
- They're Russians!
- Steady the leg.

887
01:05:54,572 --> 01:05:56,335
Get away from me.

888
01:05:56,407 --> 01:05:58,671
Stay away from me!

889
01:06:03,547 --> 01:06:06,072
Dr. Rosen. There, now.

890
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,981
All better.

891
01:06:11,589 --> 01:06:13,589
- Everything's all right here.

892
01:06:15,693 --> 01:06:17,786
Watch your head.

893
01:06:47,858 --> 01:06:50,224
(Dr. Rosen, Faintly) John?

894
01:06:51,228 --> 01:06:53,287
Can you hear me?

895
01:07:06,644 --> 01:07:09,044
Go easy now.

896
01:07:09,113 --> 01:07:12,082
Thorazine takes a
little while to wear off.

897
01:07:15,152 --> 01:07:17,416
Sorry about the restraints.

898
01:07:17,488 --> 01:07:20,013
You've got one hell of a right hook.

899
01:07:20,591 --> 01:07:22,591
Where am I?

900
01:07:23,327 --> 01:07:24,988
Ahem.

901
01:07:25,062 --> 01:07:27,428
Macarthur Psychiatric Hospital.

902
01:07:30,334 --> 01:07:33,201
I find that highly unlikely.

903
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:34,794
You made a mistake.

904
01:07:34,872 --> 01:07:38,774
My work is non-military in application.

905
01:07:38,842 --> 01:07:41,333
Which work is that, John?

906
01:07:43,447 --> 01:07:45,244
I don't know anything.

907
01:07:45,316 --> 01:07:47,316
There's no good in keeping secrets, you know.

908
01:08:04,134 --> 01:08:06,398
Charles?

909
01:08:07,805 --> 01:08:09,363
Charles?

910
01:08:11,108 --> 01:08:13,042
I didn't mean to get
you involved in this.

911
01:08:15,346 --> 01:08:17,246
I'm... I'm sorry.

912
01:08:21,585 --> 01:08:23,951
Charles...?

913
01:08:29,793 --> 01:08:32,557
The prodigal roommate revealed.

914
01:08:35,966 --> 01:08:38,594
"Saw my name on the lecture slate"?

915
01:08:38,669 --> 01:08:40,830
You lying son of a bitch!

916
01:08:40,904 --> 01:08:43,600
Who are you talking
to? Tell me who you see.

917
01:08:43,674 --> 01:08:46,268
How do you say, "Charles
Herman" in Russian?

918
01:08:46,343 --> 01:08:48,868
How do you say it in Russian?

919
01:08:48,946 --> 01:08:52,245
There's no one there,
John. There's no one there.

920
01:08:52,316 --> 01:08:54,876
He's right there. He's right there.

921
01:08:54,952 --> 01:08:58,046
Stop! I don't know anything!

922
01:08:58,122 --> 01:09:00,784
Stop! l... I don't know anything!

923
01:09:03,227 --> 01:09:04,990
My name is John Nash.

924
01:09:05,062 --> 01:09:06,723
I'm being held against my will.

925
01:09:06,797 --> 01:09:09,357
Somebody call the Department of Defense.

926
01:09:09,433 --> 01:09:11,162
My name is John Nash.

927
01:09:11,235 --> 01:09:13,760
I'm being held against my will!

928
01:09:18,809 --> 01:09:21,300
Alicia. What's wrong with him?

929
01:09:23,981 --> 01:09:26,245
John has schizophrenia.

930
01:09:26,316 --> 01:09:30,082
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

931
01:09:31,989 --> 01:09:35,516
But... But his work.

932
01:09:35,592 --> 01:09:37,856
He deals with conspiracies...

933
01:09:38,862 --> 01:09:41,126
Yes, yes, I know.

934
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:45,328
In John's world, these
behaviors are... accepted,

935
01:09:45,402 --> 01:09:47,029
encouraged.

936
01:09:47,104 --> 01:09:50,540
As such, his illness
may have gone untreated

937
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:52,438
far longer than is typical.

938
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:55,068
What do you mean? How long?

939
01:09:55,145 --> 01:09:57,204
Possibly since graduate school?

940
01:09:57,281 --> 01:10:00,546
At least that's when his
hallucinations seem to have begun.

941
01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:02,983
What are you talking
about? What hallucinations?

942
01:10:03,053 --> 01:10:05,283
One, so far, that I am aware of.

943
01:10:05,355 --> 01:10:08,722
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

944
01:10:08,792 --> 01:10:12,250
Charles isn't imaginary.

945
01:10:12,329 --> 01:10:14,923
He and John have been best
friends since Princeton.

946
01:10:14,998 --> 01:10:17,967
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

947
01:10:18,035 --> 01:10:20,902
He's always in town for
so little time, lecturing.

948
01:10:20,971 --> 01:10:23,804
- Was he at your wedding?
- He had to teach.

949
01:10:23,874 --> 01:10:25,432
Have you ever seen a picture of him,

950
01:10:25,509 --> 01:10:28,137
- talked to him on the telephone?
- This is ridiculous.

951
01:10:28,212 --> 01:10:30,373
I phoned Princeton.

952
01:10:30,447 --> 01:10:32,312
According to their housing records,

953
01:10:32,382 --> 01:10:34,282
John lived alone.

954
01:10:37,154 --> 01:10:40,590
Now, which is more
likely... that your husband,

955
01:10:40,657 --> 01:10:42,955
a mathematician with
no military training,

956
01:10:43,026 --> 01:10:45,460
is a government spy
fleeing the Russians...

957
01:10:45,529 --> 01:10:47,190
You're making him sound crazy.

958
01:10:47,264 --> 01:10:50,495
...Or, that he has lost
his grip on reality?

959
01:10:52,936 --> 01:10:54,597
Now the only way I can help him

960
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:56,036
is to show him the difference

961
01:10:56,106 --> 01:10:58,870
between what's real

962
01:10:58,942 --> 01:11:01,103
and what is in his mind.

963
01:11:03,747 --> 01:11:05,681
Come on.

964
01:11:07,351 --> 01:11:09,615
What's he been working on?

965
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:12,621
His work is classified.

966
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:14,953
He mentioned a supervisor

967
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:17,550
by the name of William Parcher.

968
01:11:17,628 --> 01:11:20,620
Maybe Mr. Parcher can
clarify things for us.

969
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:23,165
But I can't get to
him without clearances.

970
01:11:24,234 --> 01:11:25,724
You want me to help you get

971
01:11:25,803 --> 01:11:27,794
the details of my husband's work?

972
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:31,329
John thinks I'm a Russian spy.

973
01:11:31,408 --> 01:11:33,376
Is that what you think?

974
01:11:38,081 --> 01:11:40,515
- What did the doctor say?
- Is he sick?

975
01:11:40,584 --> 01:11:42,211
I don't know.

976
01:11:42,286 --> 01:11:44,015
I want to see what
Johns been working on.

977
01:11:44,087 --> 01:11:47,147
- You know you can't go in his office.
- It's classified, Alicia.

978
01:11:47,224 --> 01:11:48,714
Stop. Oh!

979
01:12:02,172 --> 01:12:04,470
Oh, my God.

980
01:12:08,545 --> 01:12:10,513
Oh, my God.

981
01:12:17,454 --> 01:12:20,423
Why didn't you say something?

982
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:23,516
Alicia, John's always been

983
01:12:23,594 --> 01:12:25,960
a little weird.

984
01:12:26,029 --> 01:12:28,190
He said he was doing code-breaking,

985
01:12:28,265 --> 01:12:30,460
that it was eyes-only.

986
01:12:30,534 --> 01:12:33,503
- Top secret, part of the military effort.
- Was he?

987
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:36,038
Well, it was possible, you know?

988
01:12:36,106 --> 01:12:37,539
Directives come down all the time

989
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:39,007
that some of us aren't cleared for.

990
01:12:39,076 --> 01:12:41,544
- It was possible.
- Possible, but...

991
01:12:41,612 --> 01:12:43,443
not likely.

992
01:12:45,148 --> 01:12:47,912
Lately, he'd become
so much more agitated

993
01:12:47,985 --> 01:12:50,146
and then when you called...

994
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:52,814
So, is this all he's
been doing every day?

995
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:55,222
Cutting out magazines?

996
01:12:56,827 --> 01:12:59,489
Well, not all.

997
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:24,169
- Alicia: I'm so sorry.
- John: It's okay.

998
01:14:27,451 --> 01:14:29,442
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

999
01:14:31,855 --> 01:14:33,789
I have to talk to you.

1000
01:14:33,857 --> 01:14:35,950
Okay.

1001
01:14:40,597 --> 01:14:43,225
Alicia, I've been thinking about it,

1002
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,895
and I do realize that my behavior

1003
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:50,064
and my inability to discuss
the situation with you

1004
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:52,574
must have appeared insane.

1005
01:14:52,642 --> 01:14:54,803
I left you with no other choice.

1006
01:14:54,878 --> 01:14:57,073
I do understand...

1007
01:14:57,147 --> 01:15:00,048
- and I'm truly sorry.
- That's okay.

1008
01:15:01,385 --> 01:15:03,649
Everything's gonna be all right.

1009
01:15:05,155 --> 01:15:07,316
Everything's gonna be all right.

1010
01:15:08,358 --> 01:15:10,326
We just have to talk quietly.

1011
01:15:11,561 --> 01:15:16,021
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

1012
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:18,693
I'm gonna tell you everything now.

1013
01:15:18,769 --> 01:15:21,203
It's breaking with protocol

1014
01:15:21,271 --> 01:15:23,205
but you need to know,

1015
01:15:23,273 --> 01:15:27,175
because you have to
help me get out of here.

1016
01:15:28,545 --> 01:15:31,878
I've been doing top-secret
work for the government.

1017
01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:33,677
There's a threat that exists

1018
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:36,446
of catastrophic proportions.

1019
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,353
I think the Russians feel
my profile is too high.

1020
01:15:39,423 --> 01:15:41,823
That's why they simply
just don't do away with me.

1021
01:15:41,892 --> 01:15:44,190
They're keeping me
here to try to stop me

1022
01:15:44,261 --> 01:15:46,593
from doing my work. You
have to get to Wheeler.

1023
01:15:46,663 --> 01:15:48,722
- You have to find William Parcher.
- Stop.

1024
01:15:48,799 --> 01:15:51,734
- He can help us.
- Stop. Stop. Stop!

1025
01:15:56,506 --> 01:15:58,269
I went to Wheeler.

1026
01:15:58,341 --> 01:16:00,002
Good, good.

1027
01:16:00,077 --> 01:16:02,136
There is no William Parcher.

1028
01:16:03,547 --> 01:16:04,571
Of course there is.

1029
01:16:04,614 --> 01:16:06,548
- I've been working for him.
- Doing what?

1030
01:16:06,616 --> 01:16:08,777
Breaking codes?

1031
01:16:08,852 --> 01:16:10,945
Dropping packages in a secret mailbox

1032
01:16:11,021 --> 01:16:12,955
for the government to pick up?

1033
01:16:14,558 --> 01:16:16,321
How could you know that?

1034
01:16:16,393 --> 01:16:18,520
Sol followed you.

1035
01:16:19,096 --> 01:16:22,065
- He thought it was harmless.
- Sol followed me?

1036
01:16:31,141 --> 01:16:33,769
They've never been opened.

1037
01:16:36,446 --> 01:16:39,142
It isn't real.

1038
01:16:39,216 --> 01:16:42,447
There is no conspiracy, John.

1039
01:16:44,788 --> 01:16:47,621
There is no William Parcher.

1040
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:51,126
It's in your mind.

1041
01:16:52,696 --> 01:16:56,291
Do you understand, baby?

1042
01:16:56,366 --> 01:16:59,062
You're sick.

1043
01:17:01,972 --> 01:17:04,270
You're sick, John.

1044
01:17:04,341 --> 01:17:06,002
John?!

1045
01:17:06,076 --> 01:17:08,010
John!

1046
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:17,843
Code red.

1047
01:17:17,921 --> 01:17:19,921
Dr. Rosen, code red. Observation room two.

1048
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:24,186
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation room two.

1049
01:17:35,272 --> 01:17:37,467
John?

1050
01:17:39,142 --> 01:17:41,007
John?

1051
01:17:42,946 --> 01:17:45,278
The implant's gone.

1052
01:17:45,849 --> 01:17:48,317
I can't find it.

1053
01:17:51,888 --> 01:17:54,152
It's gone.

1054
01:18:25,322 --> 01:18:28,416
Dr. Rosen. You see, the
nightmare of schizophrenia

1055
01:18:28,491 --> 01:18:30,823
is not knowing what's true.

1056
01:18:31,394 --> 01:18:33,362
Imagine...

1057
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:36,627
if you had suddenly learned
that the people and the places

1058
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:39,669
and the moments most important to you

1059
01:18:39,736 --> 01:18:42,204
were not gone, not dead,

1060
01:18:42,272 --> 01:18:44,797
but worse...

1061
01:18:44,874 --> 01:18:46,808
Had never been.

1062
01:18:49,379 --> 01:18:52,314
What kind of hell would that be?

1063
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:59,445
Administering insulin.

1064
01:19:00,457 --> 01:19:02,755
Man. 8.42 am.

1065
01:20:00,183 --> 01:20:02,344
How often?

1066
01:20:03,887 --> 01:20:05,887
Five times a week for 10 weeks.

1067
01:20:27,544 --> 01:20:29,944
Princeton University 1 Year Later

1068
01:20:30,013 --> 01:20:33,608
Alicia. John always spoke so
fondly of being here at Princeton.

1069
01:20:33,683 --> 01:20:36,379
And Hansen is running
the department now.

1070
01:20:36,453 --> 01:20:38,148
So he keeps reminding
us, and reminding us.

1071
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:41,555
Yeah.

1072
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:43,855
John won't come near the campus, though.

1073
01:20:43,927 --> 01:20:45,927
- I think he's ashamed.

1074
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:49,922
Hey. Hey.

1075
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,127
Want this?

1076
01:20:52,202 --> 01:20:55,831
So, Alicia, how...
how are you holding up?

1077
01:20:55,906 --> 01:20:58,670
Well, the delusions have passed.

1078
01:20:58,742 --> 01:21:01,006
They're saying with the medication

1079
01:21:01,078 --> 01:21:02,670
and low stress environment...

1080
01:21:02,746 --> 01:21:05,544
No, l... I mean, how are you?

1081
01:21:12,823 --> 01:21:15,053
I think often what I feel

1082
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:18,390
is obligation.

1083
01:21:20,464 --> 01:21:23,763
Or guilt over wanting to leave.

1084
01:21:24,801 --> 01:21:29,295
Rage against John, against God and...

1085
01:21:31,341 --> 01:21:32,672
But...

1086
01:21:35,712 --> 01:21:37,907
then I look at him

1087
01:21:39,182 --> 01:21:43,744
and I force myself to see
the man that I married.

1088
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:46,618
And he becomes that man.

1089
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:51,127
He's transformed into
someone that I love.

1090
01:21:53,096 --> 01:21:56,623
And I'm transformed into
someone who loves him.

1091
01:21:59,503 --> 01:22:01,494
It's not all the time,

1092
01:22:01,571 --> 01:22:04,404
but...

1093
01:22:04,474 --> 01:22:06,203
it's enough.

1094
01:22:06,276 --> 01:22:09,245
I think John is a very lucky man...

1095
01:22:09,312 --> 01:22:10,973
Alicia.

1096
01:22:15,552 --> 01:22:18,316
So unlucky.

1097
01:22:21,324 --> 01:22:23,417
- Alicia: This is us.
- Sol: This is it?

1098
01:22:23,493 --> 01:22:26,155
- It's nice.
- It's near where I work.

1099
01:22:26,229 --> 01:22:28,754
Alicia. John? You've a visitor.

1100
01:22:31,401 --> 01:22:33,369
Hi.

1101
01:22:33,436 --> 01:22:35,028
Hi.

1102
01:22:35,105 --> 01:22:36,970
I hope it's okay.

1103
01:22:44,414 --> 01:22:45,972
Hey ya, chief.

1104
01:22:47,717 --> 01:22:50,049
- Cigarette?
- Ah, no, thanks.

1105
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,213
I quit, actually.

1106
01:22:55,859 --> 01:22:58,191
- Hello.
- Hey, John.

1107
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:02,088
Have you met Harvey?

1108
01:23:02,165 --> 01:23:03,598
Umm, I...

1109
01:23:04,968 --> 01:23:06,833
- John, there's no...
- Relax, it's okay.

1110
01:23:06,903 --> 01:23:09,565
There's no point in being nuts
if you can't have a little fun.

1111
01:23:09,808 --> 01:23:11,435
I should have known.

1112
01:23:12,911 --> 01:23:14,776
Here you go.

1113
01:23:16,315 --> 01:23:18,249
I can take those later.

1114
01:23:18,317 --> 01:23:19,875
You're supposed to take them now.

1115
01:23:21,186 --> 01:23:24,587
- Can I bring you something?
- I'm okay.

1116
01:23:24,656 --> 01:23:26,180
Okay.

1117
01:23:29,027 --> 01:23:31,689
So, um... yeah. l... I was in town

1118
01:23:31,763 --> 01:23:33,924
giving a workshop.

1119
01:23:33,999 --> 01:23:35,967
I go back tonight.

1120
01:23:36,034 --> 01:23:38,298
You know, Bender, he really wanted

1121
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:42,932
to stop by and you know,
see you. You know, say hi.

1122
01:23:43,008 --> 01:23:44,635
Squeamish?

1123
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:47,144
Yeah.

1124
01:23:47,212 --> 01:23:49,703
I suppose I would be, too.

1125
01:23:49,781 --> 01:23:51,772
But alas, I'm stuck with me.

1126
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:58,451
- I'm trying to solve the
Reimann Hypothesis. - Uh-huh.

1127
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:01,926
Oh, yeah?

1128
01:24:01,993 --> 01:24:05,121
I figured if... if I dazzle them,

1129
01:24:05,197 --> 01:24:07,392
they will have to reinstate me.

1130
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:12,461
But it's difficult with the medication,

1131
01:24:12,537 --> 01:24:15,973
because it's hard to...

1132
01:24:16,041 --> 01:24:19,602
see the solution.

1133
01:24:28,086 --> 01:24:30,884
You know, John, you should go easy.

1134
01:24:30,956 --> 01:24:33,982
There are other things besides...

1135
01:24:34,059 --> 01:24:35,356
Besides work.

1136
01:24:37,763 --> 01:24:39,890
What are they?

1137
01:24:57,816 --> 01:24:59,841
Shh-hh.

1138
01:25:00,852 --> 01:25:02,820
Shh.

1139
01:25:15,901 --> 01:25:17,892
What are you thinking about?

1140
01:25:21,072 --> 01:25:23,006
What do people do?

1141
01:25:23,074 --> 01:25:25,508
It's life, John.

1142
01:25:25,577 --> 01:25:27,545
Activities available,

1143
01:25:27,612 --> 01:25:30,206
just add meaning.

1144
01:25:37,622 --> 01:25:39,749
You could try leaving the house.

1145
01:25:39,825 --> 01:25:43,261
You know, maybe...

1146
01:25:43,328 --> 01:25:45,489
talk to people.

1147
01:25:50,101 --> 01:25:52,433
You could try taking out the garbage.

1148
01:26:14,559 --> 01:26:17,221
John. And there's some
more... there's some more in...

1149
01:26:29,608 --> 01:26:32,008
Who... Who were you talking to?

1150
01:26:32,077 --> 01:26:34,204
Garbage man.

1151
01:26:43,488 --> 01:26:46,048
Garbage men don't come at night.

1152
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,819
I guess around here they do.

1153
01:27:17,088 --> 01:27:19,249
Sorry.

1154
01:28:25,223 --> 01:28:27,223
Is it the medication?

1155
01:29:08,366 --> 01:29:10,366
I don't know what to do.

1156
01:29:28,586 --> 01:29:31,521
My mother's going to keep the
baby a little longer tonight.

1157
01:29:32,724 --> 01:29:34,919
I can get three hours of overtime.

1158
01:30:00,919 --> 01:30:02,944
I'm going to bed.

1159
01:30:09,594 --> 01:30:12,586
- Good night.
- Good night.

1160
01:31:30,642 --> 01:31:32,642
It's good to see you, John.

1161
01:31:34,345 --> 01:31:36,370
It's been a while.

1162
01:31:37,115 --> 01:31:38,412
Parcher?

1163
01:31:38,983 --> 01:31:40,575
Yes, sir.

1164
01:31:44,055 --> 01:31:45,579
You're not real!

1165
01:31:45,657 --> 01:31:48,421
Of course I am. Don't be ridiculous.

1166
01:31:52,964 --> 01:31:55,455
I don't think that I
would go that way, John.

1167
01:31:56,968 --> 01:31:59,300
It's time for you to get back to work.

1168
01:31:59,370 --> 01:32:02,370
The bomb is in its final position

1169
01:32:02,473 --> 01:32:03,963
here in the U.S.

1170
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:06,504
Knowing your situation

1171
01:32:06,544 --> 01:32:09,911
requires you keep a
low profile, "Mohammed,"

1172
01:32:09,981 --> 01:32:13,109
we've brought the mountain to you.

1173
01:32:32,103 --> 01:32:36,767
We've narrowed the bomb's location
to somewhere on the eastern seaboard.

1174
01:32:36,841 --> 01:32:41,471
But we haven't been able to
pinpoint its exact position.

1175
01:32:43,781 --> 01:32:46,443
Their codes have grown
increasingly complex.

1176
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,350
Here, look at this, John.

1177
01:32:53,825 --> 01:32:55,554
What?

1178
01:32:55,627 --> 01:32:57,026
What?

1179
01:32:59,631 --> 01:33:03,226
- Dr. Rosen said...
- Rosen! That quack!

1180
01:33:03,301 --> 01:33:05,235
"Schizophrenic break
from reality," right?

1181
01:33:05,303 --> 01:33:07,271
Psychological bullshit!

1182
01:33:07,338 --> 01:33:09,329
Look at me, John.

1183
01:33:09,908 --> 01:33:11,808
John, look at me.

1184
01:33:13,278 --> 01:33:15,269
Do I look like I'm imagined?

1185
01:33:17,349 --> 01:33:19,408
Wheeler has no record of you.

1186
01:33:19,484 --> 01:33:21,952
Do you think we list our personnel?

1187
01:33:23,789 --> 01:33:26,952
John, I'm sorry you had
to go through all this.

1188
01:33:27,526 --> 01:33:30,461
I've gone to a great deal
of trouble to get you back.

1189
01:33:30,529 --> 01:33:33,259
I can restore your status at Wheeler.

1190
01:33:33,332 --> 01:33:35,994
I can let the world know what you did.

1191
01:33:36,068 --> 01:33:38,662
But I need you now, soldier.

1192
01:33:44,643 --> 01:33:47,043
I was so scared you weren't real.

1193
01:33:49,081 --> 01:33:52,676
Princeton, New Jersey April 1956

1194
01:33:55,387 --> 01:33:57,321
There's a storm coming.

1195
01:33:57,389 --> 01:33:59,653
I'm just going to
grab the laundry, okay?

1196
01:33:59,725 --> 01:34:01,750
I'll draw his bath.

1197
01:34:04,997 --> 01:34:06,794
It's okay.

1198
01:34:08,167 --> 01:34:09,998
Okay.

1199
01:35:48,433 --> 01:35:50,367
John!

1200
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:58,972
I've almost got it! Charles,
you just watch the baby.

1201
01:35:59,044 --> 01:36:01,044
- I've got one more to close!

1202
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:03,314
- No!
- John: I'll be right there.

1203
01:36:03,382 --> 01:36:04,382
- Oh, God.

1204
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:10,816
I need a towel.

1205
01:36:10,889 --> 01:36:12,948
Shhh.

1206
01:36:13,025 --> 01:36:14,720
Charles was watching him. He was okay.

1207
01:36:14,793 --> 01:36:16,590
There is no one here.

1208
01:36:16,662 --> 01:36:19,597
- Charles was watching him.
- There is no one here!

1209
01:36:19,665 --> 01:36:21,656
He's been injected
with a cloaking serum.

1210
01:36:21,733 --> 01:36:23,701
I can see him because of a chemical

1211
01:36:23,769 --> 01:36:25,930
that was released into my bloodstream

1212
01:36:26,004 --> 01:36:28,472
when my implant dissolved.

1213
01:36:29,775 --> 01:36:32,073
I couldn't tell you, it
was for your own protection!

1214
01:36:32,144 --> 01:36:33,907
Alicia!

1215
01:36:40,052 --> 01:36:43,544
- No!
- Hello, I need Dr. Rosen's office, please.

1216
01:36:43,622 --> 01:36:45,351
You've got to stop her, John.

1217
01:36:46,692 --> 01:36:48,956
You leave her out of this.

1218
01:36:50,696 --> 01:36:53,358
- Who are you talking to?
- It's not her fault.

1219
01:36:53,432 --> 01:36:55,730
- John.
- She'll compromise us again.

1220
01:36:55,801 --> 01:36:58,167
- No, she won't.
- You'll go back to the hospital.

1221
01:36:58,237 --> 01:37:00,330
- John, answer me!
- Countless people will die.

1222
01:37:00,405 --> 01:37:02,100
Alicia, please, put the phone down.

1223
01:37:02,174 --> 01:37:04,768
- I can't let that happen.
- Yes, hello?

1224
01:37:04,843 --> 01:37:07,107
Hi, I need Dr. Rosen. Is he in?

1225
01:37:07,179 --> 01:37:09,647
I'm sorry, John.

1226
01:37:10,649 --> 01:37:12,310
John: No-oo!

1227
01:37:15,721 --> 01:37:18,189
- Alicia?
- Parcher. You know what you have to do, Nash.

1228
01:37:18,257 --> 01:37:20,122
- Get away from me.
- She's too great a risk.

1229
01:37:20,192 --> 01:37:22,192
- Get away!

1230
01:37:22,427 --> 01:37:24,486
I didn't mean to hurt you!

1231
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:29,658
Finish her. She knows too much now.

1232
01:37:32,137 --> 01:37:34,071
Uncle John?

1233
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:36,164
Parcher. Take care of her,
you pathetic piece of shit,

1234
01:37:36,241 --> 01:37:37,538
or I'll take care of you.

1235
01:37:37,609 --> 01:37:39,076
John,

1236
01:37:39,144 --> 01:37:41,806
Christ, John, please do what he says.

1237
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:44,644
Move, soldier.

1238
01:37:44,716 --> 01:37:46,183
Now.

1239
01:37:46,251 --> 01:37:47,479
Marcee. Uncle John?

1240
01:37:47,552 --> 01:37:50,180
Charles. John, please!

1241
01:37:51,390 --> 01:37:52,948
Now!

1242
01:37:53,025 --> 01:37:55,025
Alicia and Charles never co-exist in the same

1243
01:37:55,327 --> 01:37:57,192
interactive field. Alicia and Parcher...

1244
01:38:03,936 --> 01:38:05,936
- Marcee: Let's play!

1245
01:38:06,205 --> 01:38:08,901
...Charles, and Marcee
cannot co-exist with Alicia.

1246
01:38:08,974 --> 01:38:10,703
I understand.

1247
01:38:26,992 --> 01:38:28,983
She never gets old.

1248
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:35,224
Marcee can't be real.
She never gets old.

1249
01:39:07,967 --> 01:39:09,525
You see them now?

1250
01:39:18,777 --> 01:39:20,506
Yes.

1251
01:39:22,815 --> 01:39:25,113
Why did you stop your meds?

1252
01:39:27,353 --> 01:39:29,685
Because I couldn't do my work.

1253
01:39:29,755 --> 01:39:31,689
I couldn't help with the baby.

1254
01:39:31,757 --> 01:39:33,520
I couldn't...

1255
01:39:35,027 --> 01:39:37,222
I couldn't respond to my wife.

1256
01:39:39,565 --> 01:39:41,931
You think that's
better than being crazy?

1257
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:45,095
We'll need to start you on a higher run

1258
01:39:45,170 --> 01:39:47,138
of insulin shocks and a new medication.

1259
01:39:47,206 --> 01:39:48,833
No.

1260
01:39:48,908 --> 01:39:50,773
There has to be another way.

1261
01:39:50,843 --> 01:39:53,141
Dr. Rosen. Schizophrenia
is degenerative.

1262
01:39:53,212 --> 01:39:55,180
Some days may be symptom-free,

1263
01:39:55,247 --> 01:39:56,942
but over time, you are getting worse.

1264
01:39:57,016 --> 01:40:00,042
It's a problem. That's all it is.

1265
01:40:00,119 --> 01:40:02,952
It's a problem with no solution.

1266
01:40:03,022 --> 01:40:04,751
And that's what I do, I solve problems.

1267
01:40:04,823 --> 01:40:06,484
- That's what I do best.
- This isn't math.

1268
01:40:06,558 --> 01:40:08,321
Dr. Rosen. You can't
come up with a formula

1269
01:40:08,394 --> 01:40:10,191
to change the way you
experience the world.

1270
01:40:10,262 --> 01:40:13,197
- All I have to do is apply my mind.
- There's no theorem, no proof.

1271
01:40:13,265 --> 01:40:15,995
- You can't reason your way out of this.
- Why not? Why can't I?

1272
01:40:16,068 --> 01:40:18,866
Because your mind is where the
problem is in the first place.

1273
01:40:20,839 --> 01:40:23,069
I can do this.

1274
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:26,771
I can work it out. All I need is time.

1275
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:32,306
Is that the baby?

1276
01:40:34,019 --> 01:40:36,579
The baby's at my mother's, John.

1277
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:46,362
(Marcee Humming)

1278
01:40:50,235 --> 01:40:53,671
Dr. Rosen. Without treatment, John,

1279
01:40:53,739 --> 01:40:55,138
the fantasies may take over...

1280
01:40:56,141 --> 01:40:57,699
entirely.

1281
01:41:15,194 --> 01:41:17,194
You almost ready?

1282
01:41:19,432 --> 01:41:21,798
Rosen's waiting outside.

1283
01:41:21,867 --> 01:41:24,597
I can't go back to that hospital.

1284
01:41:28,574 --> 01:41:30,667
I won't come home.

1285
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:36,410
He said that if you said that,

1286
01:41:36,482 --> 01:41:40,919
he has commitment papers for me to sign.

1287
01:41:43,255 --> 01:41:45,018
Well, maybe you won't sign them.

1288
01:41:46,859 --> 01:41:48,918
Maybe you'll just give me some time.

1289
01:41:51,797 --> 01:41:53,822
I will try to figure this out.

1290
01:41:56,202 --> 01:41:58,033
Whatever you do,

1291
01:41:58,104 --> 01:42:01,437
Rosen is right about one thing.

1292
01:42:01,507 --> 01:42:04,032
You shouldn't be here.

1293
01:42:06,412 --> 01:42:08,346
I'm not safe anymore.

1294
01:42:13,986 --> 01:42:16,011
Would you have hurt me, John?

1295
01:42:25,397 --> 01:42:27,058
I don't know.

1296
01:42:28,734 --> 01:42:31,828
Maybe you should let Dr. Rosen
drive you to your mother's.

1297
01:43:37,736 --> 01:43:41,263
Rosen said to call if you
try and kill me or anything.

1298
01:43:57,623 --> 01:43:59,921
You want to know what's real?

1299
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:07,332
This.

1300
01:44:14,607 --> 01:44:16,598
This.

1301
01:44:21,881 --> 01:44:23,815
This.

1302
01:44:25,217 --> 01:44:27,378
This is real.

1303
01:44:30,723 --> 01:44:33,123
Maybe the part...

1304
01:44:33,192 --> 01:44:35,592
that knows the waking from the dream,

1305
01:44:36,962 --> 01:44:38,930
maybe it isn't here.

1306
01:44:42,768 --> 01:44:45,236
Maybe it's here.

1307
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:52,241
I need to believe

1308
01:44:52,311 --> 01:44:55,747
that something
extraordinary is possible.

1309
01:45:43,395 --> 01:45:47,388
Princeton University Two Months Later

1310
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:00,273
Hansen. Come.

1311
01:46:08,253 --> 01:46:10,619
Hello, Martin.

1312
01:46:15,194 --> 01:46:17,458
Jesus Christ.

1313
01:46:19,131 --> 01:46:20,257
No. l...

1314
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:23,893
I don't have that one. My savior complex

1315
01:46:23,969 --> 01:46:25,402
takes on a completely different form.

1316
01:46:27,272 --> 01:46:30,366
I heard what happened and well,

1317
01:46:30,442 --> 01:46:32,842
l... I wanted to write and
I tried you at Macarthur's

1318
01:46:32,911 --> 01:46:35,038
but you'd left, and I just...

1319
01:46:47,092 --> 01:46:49,151
this is Helinger's old office.

1320
01:46:49,228 --> 01:46:50,820
Yeah.

1321
01:46:50,896 --> 01:46:53,421
Yeah, I stole it from him.

1322
01:46:55,768 --> 01:46:58,259
Seems that you won after all, Martin.

1323
01:46:59,638 --> 01:47:02,607
They were wrong, John. No one wins.

1324
01:47:02,674 --> 01:47:05,404
Please, please have a seat.

1325
01:47:05,477 --> 01:47:08,412
God, it's so good to see you.

1326
01:47:10,516 --> 01:47:12,882
What brings you back to Princeton?

1327
01:47:12,951 --> 01:47:14,316
Charles. John?

1328
01:47:14,386 --> 01:47:17,617
John, I'm sorry, but
you have to tell him.

1329
01:47:17,689 --> 01:47:19,782
Tell him you're a genius.
You're a genius, John!

1330
01:47:19,858 --> 01:47:21,450
Tell him your work is critical.

1331
01:47:21,527 --> 01:47:23,791
John, please!

1332
01:47:37,376 --> 01:47:40,903
Is there any chance that you
could ignore what I just did?

1333
01:47:42,581 --> 01:47:45,482
Of course, what are old friends for?

1334
01:47:45,551 --> 01:47:49,180
Is that what we are, Martin? Friends?

1335
01:47:49,254 --> 01:47:51,347
John, of course.

1336
01:47:51,423 --> 01:47:54,187
Of course. We always have been.

1337
01:47:59,398 --> 01:48:01,332
Alicia and I think that...

1338
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:03,197
That fitting in,

1339
01:48:03,268 --> 01:48:05,259
being part of a community,

1340
01:48:07,573 --> 01:48:09,336
might do me some good.

1341
01:48:09,408 --> 01:48:11,308
That a certain level of attachment,

1342
01:48:11,376 --> 01:48:13,367
familiar places, familiar people,

1343
01:48:14,847 --> 01:48:16,644
might help me...

1344
01:48:16,715 --> 01:48:19,206
elbow out these...

1345
01:48:22,521 --> 01:48:25,513
These certain delusions that I have.

1346
01:48:30,195 --> 01:48:32,857
It's a lot to ask,
and now that I'm here,

1347
01:48:35,267 --> 01:48:37,428
I'm quite certain that
you will just say no.

1348
01:48:40,739 --> 01:48:43,537
But I was wondering
if I could hang around.

1349
01:48:52,217 --> 01:48:53,707
Huh.

1350
01:48:57,756 --> 01:48:59,917
Will you be needing an office?

1351
01:49:04,229 --> 01:49:06,094
No.

1352
01:49:08,901 --> 01:49:11,802
No, I could just work
out of the library.

1353
01:49:11,870 --> 01:49:14,430
Well, this guy tries to
wander into the library,

1354
01:49:14,506 --> 01:49:17,703
- but he doesn't have I.D.
- Why can't people read their memos, huh?

1355
01:49:17,776 --> 01:49:19,471
Then he goes totally nuts.

1356
01:49:19,545 --> 01:49:21,775
John: Not real! You're not real.

1357
01:49:21,847 --> 01:49:23,747
There's no mission.

1358
01:49:23,815 --> 01:49:26,113
Oh, shit. Shit.

1359
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:29,917
Not real! You are not real!

1360
01:49:29,988 --> 01:49:31,853
Is this what you are, soldier?

1361
01:49:31,924 --> 01:49:33,221
Some useless ghoul?

1362
01:49:33,292 --> 01:49:35,283
The local madman?

1363
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,988
- I'm not a soldier.
- You're gonna end up in a cell!

1364
01:49:38,063 --> 01:49:40,327
Old, worthless, discarded.

1365
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:41,627
There's no mission.

1366
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,327
And while you rock and drool,

1367
01:49:43,402 --> 01:49:44,960
the world will burn to ashes!

1368
01:49:45,037 --> 01:49:47,471
You are not real! You are not real!

1369
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:49,234
You're still talking to me, soldier.

1370
01:49:49,308 --> 01:49:52,607
There's no mission! I'm not a soldier!

1371
01:49:52,678 --> 01:49:54,305
John? John?

1372
01:49:54,379 --> 01:49:56,244
John, John, John, John.

1373
01:49:56,315 --> 01:49:57,646
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

1374
01:49:57,716 --> 01:49:59,274
John, John! It's okay.

1375
01:49:59,351 --> 01:50:01,478
I just heard what
happened, I'm sorry. John...

1376
01:50:01,553 --> 01:50:03,214
- I'm not a soldier.
- John. Hey, Nash.

1377
01:50:03,789 --> 01:50:05,154
Nash, hey.

1378
01:50:05,224 --> 01:50:07,215
Hey, you're all right.

1379
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:10,887
Nash, Nash, hey, hey, hey.

1380
01:50:14,666 --> 01:50:17,533
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!

1381
01:50:17,603 --> 01:50:19,298
Hansen: John?

1382
01:50:20,906 --> 01:50:22,906
You should've seen their faces.

1383
01:50:23,609 --> 01:50:26,339
Everybody was just staring at me.

1384
01:50:26,411 --> 01:50:28,038
John...

1385
01:50:28,113 --> 01:50:31,310
you know that stress
triggers the delusions.

1386
01:50:31,383 --> 01:50:33,578
I know.

1387
01:50:35,854 --> 01:50:37,947
But then, on the way home,

1388
01:50:38,023 --> 01:50:40,856
Charles was there.

1389
01:50:44,696 --> 01:50:48,029
Sometimes, I really miss talking to him.

1390
01:50:50,936 --> 01:50:53,336
Maybe Rosen's right.

1391
01:50:53,405 --> 01:50:56,897
Maybe I have to think about going
back into the hospital again.

1392
01:50:56,975 --> 01:50:58,966
No.

1393
01:50:59,044 --> 01:51:01,274
Come here.

1394
01:51:04,616 --> 01:51:07,449
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1395
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:34,946
John, now, you can't ignore me forever.

1396
01:51:40,252 --> 01:51:42,447
Charles, you've been a
very good friend to me.

1397
01:51:42,521 --> 01:51:44,216
The best.

1398
01:51:45,390 --> 01:51:48,655
But I won't talk to you again.

1399
01:51:52,030 --> 01:51:54,225
I just can't.

1400
01:51:59,471 --> 01:52:01,962
Same goes for you, baby girl.

1401
01:52:09,815 --> 01:52:11,476
Good-bye.

1402
01:52:18,590 --> 01:52:20,455
Good-bye.

1403
01:52:34,373 --> 01:52:36,898
I was wondering if I
might audit your course.

1404
01:52:38,276 --> 01:52:41,302
It's... It's an honor, Professor Nash.

1405
01:52:44,516 --> 01:52:46,609
Is something wrong?

1406
01:52:47,886 --> 01:52:50,184
This will be my first class.

1407
01:52:53,592 --> 01:52:56,186
Good morning,

1408
01:52:56,261 --> 01:52:58,491
eager young minds.

1409
01:53:18,283 --> 01:53:20,615
It's never gonna work, John.

1410
01:53:20,685 --> 01:53:23,176
You're just humiliating yourself.

1411
01:53:25,757 --> 01:53:27,884
It's pathetic!

1412
01:53:27,959 --> 01:53:30,018
You are being pathetic.

1413
01:53:30,095 --> 01:53:32,086
I'm ashamed of you.

1414
01:53:59,324 --> 01:54:01,417
Oh, man!

1415
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:07,622
Are you coming? You're gonna be late.

1416
01:54:10,436 --> 01:54:12,267
- Dad, you've got my book.
- What?

1417
01:54:12,338 --> 01:54:13,999
You've got my book.

1418
01:54:14,073 --> 01:54:16,473
Oh, right.

1419
01:54:16,542 --> 01:54:18,009
Thanks.

1420
01:54:19,011 --> 01:54:20,740
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

1421
01:54:20,813 --> 01:54:22,610
Alicia. See you tonight.

1422
01:54:22,681 --> 01:54:24,649
Bye, honey.

1423
01:55:44,663 --> 01:55:47,663
Princeton University October 1978

1424
01:55:57,142 --> 01:55:58,734
Did you just solve Reimann?

1425
01:55:58,811 --> 01:56:01,006
Well, what do you think?

1426
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:02,547
Huh.

1427
01:56:02,614 --> 01:56:04,138
That's an analog to Frobenius

1428
01:56:04,216 --> 01:56:06,184
for non-commutative extensions.

1429
01:56:07,386 --> 01:56:09,650
Yes, it is.

1430
01:56:09,721 --> 01:56:12,690
But it only appears to
work sporadically, so, no.

1431
01:56:12,758 --> 01:56:14,885
But...

1432
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:17,292
I believe I'm making progress.

1433
01:56:18,297 --> 01:56:20,288
You're...

1434
01:56:20,365 --> 01:56:23,198
Youre John Nash, right?

1435
01:56:25,637 --> 01:56:27,730
- Toby Kelly.
- Hello.

1436
01:56:27,806 --> 01:56:29,603
I've been studying your equilibrium.

1437
01:56:29,675 --> 01:56:31,609
The one you wrote here, at Princeton.

1438
01:56:31,677 --> 01:56:34,305
To come up with something totally
original, the way you did...

1439
01:56:34,379 --> 01:56:35,379
You know, I was young.

1440
01:56:35,881 --> 01:56:37,405
umm...

1441
01:56:37,483 --> 01:56:39,883
I've been developing a theory.

1442
01:56:54,166 --> 01:56:56,361
I believe I can prove

1443
01:56:56,435 --> 01:56:59,199
that Galois extensions
are covering spaces.

1444
01:56:59,271 --> 01:57:01,671
That everything,
everything is connected.

1445
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:04,402
That it's all part of the same subject.

1446
01:57:05,477 --> 01:57:07,468
When was the last time you ate?

1447
01:57:07,546 --> 01:57:10,106
- Excuse me?
- You know, food.

1448
01:57:10,182 --> 01:57:12,150
Oh, uh...

1449
01:57:12,217 --> 01:57:14,208
My wife,

1450
01:57:14,286 --> 01:57:16,117
she loves mayonnaise.

1451
01:57:16,188 --> 01:57:19,419
Oh, thank you.

1452
01:57:19,491 --> 01:57:20,719
Thank you.

1453
01:57:21,727 --> 01:57:23,592
Go on.

1454
01:57:23,662 --> 01:57:25,755
The function...

1455
01:57:25,831 --> 01:57:27,799
- is in the two
categories. - Um-hmm.

1456
01:57:31,970 --> 01:57:33,597
Hansen. Alicia!

1457
01:57:33,672 --> 01:57:36,334
Alicia!

1458
01:57:36,008 --> 01:57:39,008
...coming together
at maximum speed of...

1459
01:57:39,278 --> 01:57:41,371
let us say 10 miles per hour.

1460
01:57:41,247 --> 01:57:44,546
So you have a fly on
the tire of bicycle B,

1461
01:57:44,617 --> 01:57:47,586
and the fly, who can
travel at 20 miles an hour,

1462
01:57:47,653 --> 01:57:49,314
leaves the tire of
bicycle B and it flies

1463
01:57:49,388 --> 01:57:51,515
to the tire of bicycle a
and backwards and forwards

1464
01:57:51,591 --> 01:57:53,923
and so on and so forth
until the two bikes collide

1465
01:57:53,993 --> 01:57:55,756
and the poor little fly is squashed.

1466
01:57:55,428 --> 01:57:57,428
- This is the important thing

1467
01:57:57,664 --> 01:57:59,639
about actually focusing
in and comprehending

1468
01:57:59,766 --> 01:58:01,641
the area that you're dealing with.

1469
01:58:01,568 --> 01:58:04,401
Mathematics is very specific,
and it is an art form,

1470
01:58:04,471 --> 01:58:06,803
no matter what these people
around here will tell you,

1471
01:58:06,873 --> 01:58:08,306
especially the people from biology.

1472
01:58:08,375 --> 01:58:09,899
Don't listen to any of those people.

1473
01:58:09,976 --> 01:58:12,308
Let me go back to what
you were doing before.

1474
01:58:12,379 --> 01:58:15,678
I might want to steal this,
write a book and get famous.

1475
01:58:16,216 --> 01:58:18,514
I was thinking that I might teach.

1476
01:58:19,887 --> 01:58:21,980
A classroom with 50 students

1477
01:58:22,056 --> 01:58:25,048
can be daunting for anyone.

1478
01:58:25,125 --> 01:58:27,958
John, besides, you're
a terrible teacher.

1479
01:58:28,962 --> 01:58:31,931
I'm an acquired taste, Martin.

1480
01:58:31,999 --> 01:58:34,968
I was hoping there still might
be something I could contribute.

1481
01:58:35,035 --> 01:58:37,026
What about the...

1482
01:58:37,104 --> 01:58:39,163
Well, you know.

1483
01:58:39,239 --> 01:58:41,605
Are they gone?

1484
01:58:47,581 --> 01:58:50,516
No, they're not gone.

1485
01:58:50,584 --> 01:58:52,211
And maybe they never will be.

1486
01:58:52,286 --> 01:58:54,015
But I've gotten used to ignoring them

1487
01:58:54,088 --> 01:58:57,489
and I think as a result
they've kind of given up on me.

1488
01:58:57,558 --> 01:58:59,492
You think that's what it's like

1489
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:03,257
with all our dreams and
our nightmares, Martin?

1490
01:59:03,330 --> 01:59:06,356
You've got to keep feeding
them for them to stay alive?

1491
01:59:06,433 --> 01:59:09,925
John, they... haunt you, though.

1492
01:59:10,003 --> 01:59:14,702
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody's haunted by their past.

1493
01:59:17,711 --> 01:59:19,645
Well, good-bye.

1494
01:59:19,713 --> 01:59:22,181
John, I'll talk to the department.

1495
01:59:24,118 --> 01:59:25,983
Maybe in the spring.

1496
01:59:31,558 --> 01:59:33,423
Hey, Nash?

1497
01:59:35,062 --> 01:59:37,360
You...

1498
01:59:37,431 --> 01:59:39,126
you scared?

1499
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:43,502
Terrified.

1500
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:45,970
Mortified. Petrified.

1501
01:59:46,039 --> 01:59:48,769
Stupefied by you.

1502
01:59:48,842 --> 01:59:50,173
Now you ought best ring Alicia,

1503
01:59:50,244 --> 01:59:52,337
- or you're gonna get me...
- I'll ring her.

1504
01:59:52,413 --> 01:59:53,778
...in an awful lot of trouble.

1505
01:59:57,651 --> 01:59:59,414
- Thanks, Professor.
- Good-bye.

1506
01:59:59,486 --> 02:00:01,454
- Have a nice
day. - Good-bye.

1507
02:00:01,522 --> 02:00:04,355
Papers in hand, Mr. Beyer.
"Princeton University March 1994"

1508
02:00:04,425 --> 02:00:06,416
Professor Nash?

1509
02:00:09,663 --> 02:00:12,291
- Can you see him?
- Yeah.

1510
02:00:12,366 --> 02:00:13,958
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

1511
02:00:14,034 --> 02:00:16,195
Positive? He's within your vision?

1512
02:00:16,270 --> 02:00:17,270
- Okay. Good.

1513
02:00:17,938 --> 02:00:20,930
Forgive me, I'm just always
suspicious of new people.

1514
02:00:21,008 --> 02:00:23,374
- See you next week, Professor.
- See you next week.

1515
02:00:24,411 --> 02:00:26,311
So now that I know that you're real,

1516
02:00:26,380 --> 02:00:28,848
who are you, and what can I do for you?

1517
02:00:28,916 --> 02:00:32,317
Professor, my name is Thomas King...

1518
02:00:32,386 --> 02:00:33,512
- Thomas
King? - Mmm-hm.

1519
02:00:33,587 --> 02:00:34,986
...and I'm here to tell you

1520
02:00:35,055 --> 02:00:38,183
that you're being considered
for the Nobel prize.

1521
02:00:45,699 --> 02:00:48,429
John: Forgive me, but
I'm just a little stunned.

1522
02:00:48,502 --> 02:00:50,993
King: Over the past few
years your equilibrium

1523
02:00:51,071 --> 02:00:53,665
has become a cornerstone
of modern economics.

1524
02:00:53,740 --> 02:00:56,004
Suddenly everybody likes that one.

1525
02:00:56,076 --> 02:01:00,376
What about my work on other some
such projects... manifold embedding?

1526
02:01:00,447 --> 02:01:03,644
The application of
your bargaining problem

1527
02:01:03,717 --> 02:01:08,051
to F.C.C. bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases...

1528
02:01:08,121 --> 02:01:09,850
- Antitrust cases?
- Yes.

1529
02:01:09,923 --> 02:01:12,221
I never would have considered that.

1530
02:01:12,292 --> 02:01:13,884
- Well...
- Have I just reached

1531
02:01:13,961 --> 02:01:16,691
some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

1532
02:01:16,763 --> 02:01:17,763
No, no, you haven't.

1533
02:01:18,699 --> 02:01:20,724
'Cause, I wouldn't have thought of that.

1534
02:01:25,839 --> 02:01:27,932
Shall we have tea?

1535
02:01:29,877 --> 02:01:32,243
Oh, I don't go in there. I usually just

1536
02:01:32,312 --> 02:01:34,177
take my sandwich in the library.

1537
02:01:34,248 --> 02:01:38,241
Come on, John. Let's have
some tea. It's a big day.

1538
02:01:38,318 --> 02:01:40,343
M-Most...

1539
02:01:40,420 --> 02:01:42,320
Most commercially
available brands of tea

1540
02:01:42,389 --> 02:01:44,016
are not suitable to my palate.

1541
02:01:44,091 --> 02:01:45,718
I'm not...

1542
02:01:45,792 --> 02:01:49,023
There are some northern Indian
teas which are dense enough...

1543
02:01:49,096 --> 02:01:51,690
I enjoy the flavor that they have...

1544
02:01:51,765 --> 02:01:53,494
I have not been in this room

1545
02:01:53,567 --> 02:01:56,593
for some many years. I
wonder what tea they serve.

1546
02:01:58,238 --> 02:01:59,865
John. Why, thank you, young lady.

1547
02:02:02,242 --> 02:02:04,608
Things have certainly
changed around here.

1548
02:02:04,678 --> 02:02:06,942
I have a son that age.

1549
02:02:07,014 --> 02:02:09,014
- Harvard.

1550
02:02:13,186 --> 02:02:15,279
Hmm.

1551
02:02:15,355 --> 02:02:17,915
I would have thought the nominations

1552
02:02:17,991 --> 02:02:20,459
for the Nobel prize
would have been secret.

1553
02:02:20,527 --> 02:02:23,963
I would have thought you'd only
find out if you won or lost.

1554
02:02:24,031 --> 02:02:26,192
That is generally the case, yes.

1555
02:02:26,266 --> 02:02:28,427
But these are special circumstances.

1556
02:02:29,703 --> 02:02:32,001
The awards are substantial.

1557
02:02:32,072 --> 02:02:36,634
They require private funding. As such,

1558
02:02:36,710 --> 02:02:39,702
the image of the Nobel is...

1559
02:02:40,981 --> 02:02:44,041
I see. You came here to
find out if I was crazy?

1560
02:02:45,285 --> 02:02:47,515
Find out if I would

1561
02:02:47,588 --> 02:02:49,579
screw everything up if I actually won?

1562
02:02:51,124 --> 02:02:54,287
Dance around the podium, strip
naked and squawk like a chicken,

1563
02:02:54,361 --> 02:02:55,726
things of this nature?

1564
02:02:55,796 --> 02:02:58,264
Something like that, yes.

1565
02:02:59,266 --> 02:03:01,257
Would I embarrass you?

1566
02:03:04,805 --> 02:03:06,966
Yes, it is possible.

1567
02:03:09,676 --> 02:03:11,769
You see, l...

1568
02:03:11,845 --> 02:03:14,837
I am crazy.

1569
02:03:16,850 --> 02:03:19,011
I take the newer medications,

1570
02:03:22,422 --> 02:03:25,414
but I still see things
that are not here.

1571
02:03:27,628 --> 02:03:29,858
I just choose not to acknowledge them.

1572
02:03:31,965 --> 02:03:33,796
Like a diet of the mind,

1573
02:03:33,867 --> 02:03:36,301
I choose not to indulge
certain appetites.

1574
02:03:38,705 --> 02:03:41,606
Like my appetite for patterns.

1575
02:03:43,210 --> 02:03:47,203
Perhaps my appetite to
imagine and to dream.

1576
02:03:48,215 --> 02:03:50,149
Man. Professor Nash.

1577
02:03:54,287 --> 02:03:57,723
It's good to have you here, John.

1578
02:03:57,791 --> 02:03:59,725
Thank you.

1579
02:04:03,897 --> 02:04:08,334
- It's an honor, sir.
- Thank you very much.

1580
02:04:08,402 --> 02:04:10,131
A privilege, Professor.

1581
02:04:14,408 --> 02:04:15,898
Professor.

1582
02:04:21,248 --> 02:04:24,274
- Nicely done, John.
- Thank you, Tom.

1583
02:04:25,419 --> 02:04:27,216
Thank you.

1584
02:04:27,287 --> 02:04:29,983
Thank you.

1585
02:04:38,065 --> 02:04:40,397
Thank you, Ed.

1586
02:04:47,941 --> 02:04:50,910
That was certainly most unexpected.

1587
02:05:02,222 --> 02:05:05,191
Nobel Prize Ceremony Stockholm, Sweden

1588
02:05:05,258 --> 02:05:06,953
December 1994

1589
02:05:11,898 --> 02:05:14,162
John. Thank you.

1590
02:05:18,238 --> 02:05:20,570
I've always believed in numbers.

1591
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:23,200
In the equations and logics

1592
02:05:23,276 --> 02:05:25,210
that lead to reason.

1593
02:05:25,278 --> 02:05:28,179
But after a lifetime of such pursuits,

1594
02:05:28,915 --> 02:05:30,746
I ask,

1595
02:05:30,817 --> 02:05:33,377
what truly is logic?

1596
02:05:33,453 --> 02:05:36,581
Who decides reason?

1597
02:05:38,024 --> 02:05:41,482
My quest has taken me
through the physical,

1598
02:05:41,561 --> 02:05:43,426
the metaphysical,

1599
02:05:44,898 --> 02:05:46,866
the delusional,

1600
02:05:47,968 --> 02:05:49,993
and back.

1601
02:05:51,671 --> 02:05:54,902
And I have made the most
important discovery of my career.

1602
02:05:56,843 --> 02:06:00,176
The most important discovery of my life.

1603
02:06:02,616 --> 02:06:06,211
It is only in the
mysterious equations of love

1604
02:06:06,286 --> 02:06:09,312
that any logical reasons can be found.

1605
02:06:12,726 --> 02:06:15,991
I'm only here tonight because of you.

1606
02:06:17,197 --> 02:06:20,223
You are the reason I am.

1607
02:06:23,904 --> 02:06:26,737
You are all my reasons.

1608
02:06:30,577 --> 02:06:32,670
Thank you.

1609
02:07:26,266 --> 02:07:28,757
John: So nice to have met you.

1610
02:07:31,471 --> 02:07:33,268
I'll call for the car, Dad.

1611
02:07:33,340 --> 02:07:34,807
Bye-bye.

1612
02:07:34,875 --> 02:07:36,536
Woman: Bye-bye.

1613
02:07:36,610 --> 02:07:39,545
- Are you ready to go now?
- Oh, yes, I am.

1614
02:07:39,613 --> 02:07:42,173
Yes, indeed, and yes, please.

1615
02:07:42,249 --> 02:07:45,047
Thank you so much.

1616
02:07:45,118 --> 02:07:46,483
Thank you.

1617
02:07:49,022 --> 02:07:51,252
What is it? What's wrong?

1618
02:07:55,528 --> 02:07:56,859
Nothing.

1619
02:07:57,864 --> 02:07:59,855
Nothing at all.

1620
02:08:01,801 --> 02:08:04,463
- Come with me,
young lady. - Oh-hh...

1621
02:08:04,537 --> 02:08:07,005
I have a car outside.

1622
02:08:07,073 --> 02:08:10,531
Are you interested in a ride? "Nash's theories
have influenced global trade negotiations..."

1623
02:08:10,610 --> 02:08:15,013
Where's it going to? "national labor relations,
and even breakthroughs in evolutionary biology."

1624
02:08:32,599 --> 02:08:36,296
I will

1625
02:08:36,369 --> 02:08:39,861
Watch you

1626
02:08:39,940 --> 02:08:46,743
In the darkness

1627
02:08:46,813 --> 02:08:50,681
Show you

1628
02:08:50,750 --> 02:08:54,208
Love will

1629
02:08:54,287 --> 02:09:00,385
See you through

1630
02:09:02,162 --> 02:09:09,534
When the bad dreams

1631
02:09:09,602 --> 02:09:16,667
Wake you crying

1632
02:09:16,743 --> 02:09:22,773
I show you

1633
02:09:22,849 --> 02:09:31,018
All love can do

1634
02:09:32,292 --> 02:09:39,323
What love can do

1635
02:09:39,399 --> 02:09:43,335
I will watch through the night

1636
02:09:43,403 --> 02:09:47,499
Hold you in my arms

1637
02:09:47,574 --> 02:09:49,269
Give you dreams

1638
02:09:49,342 --> 02:09:54,541
Where none will be

1639
02:09:54,614 --> 02:09:58,744
I will watch through the dark

1640
02:09:58,818 --> 02:10:02,515
Till the morning comes

1641
02:10:02,589 --> 02:10:05,524
All the light

1642
02:10:05,592 --> 02:10:07,924
I'll take you through the night

1643
02:10:07,994 --> 02:10:10,827
To see

1644
02:10:11,831 --> 02:10:14,891
The light

1645
02:10:14,968 --> 02:10:18,199
Showing us all love

1646
02:10:18,271 --> 02:10:23,038
Can be

1647
02:10:24,377 --> 02:10:27,471
I will

1648
02:10:27,547 --> 02:10:30,880
Guide you

1649
02:10:30,950 --> 02:10:38,857
With my bright wings

1650
02:10:38,925 --> 02:10:46,263
Stay till your heart

1651
02:10:46,332 --> 02:10:55,036
Learns to see

1652
02:10:55,108 --> 02:11:00,546
All love

1653
02:11:00,613 --> 02:11:05,107
Can...

1654
02:11:05,185 --> 02:11:13,217
Be.

1655
02:13:37,570 --> 02:13:41,939
