Where's my laptop?

51
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,864
If you want me to drive you,
we gotta go now.

52
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,399
No, Dad, I'll walk.

Yo, what's going on, bro?

00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:46,889
Hey, I'm just walking
by. How you doin'?

61
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,827
Yo, Miles! You feel
that earthquake last night?

62
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,897
What you talkin' about?
I slept like a baby last night.

63
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:55,798
- How's that new school?
- So easy.

Seriously, Dad.
Walking would've been fine.

69
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:18,622
You can walk plenty
on Saturday

70
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:19,889
when you peel
those stickers off.

71
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:21,957
You saw that?
I don't know if that was me.

72
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,959
And the two from yesterday
on Clinton.

73
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:26,495
Yeah, those were me.

74
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:29,699
Look at that.
Another new coffee shop.

75
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:31,401
- You see that?
- Totally. Yeah.

76
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:33,336
- What's that one called?
- Foam Party.

77
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:36,072
"Foam Party"? Come on.

78
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:38,442
And everyone is just linin' up.
You see that?

79
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,608
I see it.

80
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,110
Is that a coffee shop
or a disco?

81
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:42,812
Dad, you're old, man.

82

85
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:51,954
Spider-Man. I mean,
this guy swings in once a day,

86
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:54,390
zip-zap-zop in his little mask
and answers to no one. Right?

87
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:55,558
Yeah, Dad. Yeah.

88
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,060
Meanwhile,
my guys are out there,

89
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:59,495
- lives on the line, no masks.
- Uh-huh.

90
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:02,466
- We show our faces.
- Speed up. I know these kids.

91
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,468
With great ability
comes great accountability.

92

That's not even
how the saying goes.

I do like his cereal, though.
I'll give him that.

You've given it
two weeks.

101
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,892
We're not having
this conversation.

102
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:32,094
I just think that
this new school is elitist.

103
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:33,697
- "Elitist"?
- And I would prefer to be

104

"The people"?
These are your people.

I'm only here 'cause
I won that stupid lottery.

107
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,606
No way. You passed the entry
test just like everybody else.

108
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,175
You have an opportunity here.
You wanna blow that?

109
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:46,877
You wanna end up

110
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,945
What's wrong with Uncle Aaron?
He's a good guy.

111
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:51,514
We all make choices in life.

112
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:53,048
It doesn't feel
like I have a choice right now.

113
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,486
You don't!

114

00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,971
Yeah, I know, Dad.
See you Friday.

116
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:18,707
- You gotta say "I love you" back.
- Dad, are you serious?

117
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:19,843
I wanna hear it.
"I love you, Dad."

118
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:21,510
You wanna hear me
say it?

119
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:22,878
You're dropping me off
at a school.

120
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,079

128
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:46,536
Oh, my gosh!
This is embarrassing.

129
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:48,238

Sorry.
It was just so quiet.

147
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:46,096
Would you like
to keep standing there,

<i>Play dumb!</i>

314
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:48,671
Who's Morales?

315
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:50,540
<i>Not that dumb!</i>

316
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,141
Hey!

317
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:00,749
<i>Okay, okay. You're okay.</i>

318
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:02,350
<i>You're okay.</i>

319
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:04,219
<i>He'll never find you.</i>

320
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:05,555
<i>No.</i>

321
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:12,394
Ow!

322
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:14,729
What are you doing
in my office, Morales?!

323
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:17,533
Morales! Open up!

324
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:19,267
<i>♪ Oh, Spider-bells
Goblin smells ♪</i>

325
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:21,571
Why is this happening?

326
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,472
<i>♪ Spider-buggy blew a tire ♪</i>

327
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:25,307
He's got
a nice voice.

<i>♪ Spidey-bells, Spidey-bells ♪</i>

329
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,480
Open up!

330
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,383
Stop sticking!

331
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,585
Keep sticking, Miles! Oh!

332
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,133
Hofstadter
is suggesting...

333
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:50,668
...is that we...

334

...look on the...

335
00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:00,575
Okay.

336
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:06,185
My room!

337
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,755
<i>"Why is this happening?"</i>

338
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,195

00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:19,428
<i>"Please keep st..."</i>

340
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,662
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

341
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,364
How could there be
two Spider-Men?

342
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:24,269
There can't be two Spider-Men.

343
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:26,835
<i>Can there?</i>

344
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:32,307
<i>Come on, Uncle
Aaron, pick up. Pick up!</i>

345
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:34,276
<i>Yo, it's Aaron.</i>

346
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:35,678
<i>I'm outta town for a few days.</i>

347
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,812
<i>I'll hit you when I'm back.
Peace.</i>

348
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:38,247
<i>No. No-No-No-No-No.</i>

349
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,516
<i>It's not possible!</i>

350
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,384
<i>It's just puberty.</i>

351
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:45,254
<i>It's a normal spider
and I'm a normal kid!</i>

352
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:49,695
All right!

353
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,901
<i>I gotta tell someone.</i>

354
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,594
Okay, you're being crazy, Miles.
You're being crazy.

355
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,896
Find the spider.

356
00:19:27,898 --> 00:19:29,500
You'll see.

357
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:45,715
It's a normal spider.

358
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:50,920
It's, like, boring
how normal this spider is.

359
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:01,663
<i>I'm right here.</i>

360
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:03,935
<i>Why is this happening to me?</i>

361
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,644
<i>Slow down! What am I doing?</i>

362
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:19,782
<i>Way over there.</i>

363
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:20,949
<i>You're like me.</i>

364
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:22,785
<i>Miles. Look out.</i>

365
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:24,487
<i>I don't wanna be a hero.</i>

366
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,557
<i>Miles.</i>

367
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,559
Whoa!

368
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:34,729
Norman, listen to me.

369
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:36,465
<i>Spider-Man?</i>

370
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:39,401
I cannot let you open a portal
to another dimension.

371
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:41,506
Brooklyn is not zoned
for that.

372
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:44,640
It's not up to me.

373
00:20:44,642 --> 00:20:46,374
<i>Is that Green Goblin?!</i>

374
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:47,910
Why won't you quit?!

375
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:50,845
I guess I like Brooklyn not
being sucked into a black hole.

376
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:52,547
I think I'm gonna go.

377
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:54,485
Staten Island, maybe.
Not Brooklyn.

378
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:01,623
No! No!

379
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:24,950
Whoa!

380
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:28,351
What now?

381
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,788
What is this place?

382
00:21:56,513 --> 00:21:58,616
Did you know your shoes
are untied?

383
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:01,750
- Uh-huh.
- This is a onesie,

384
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:03,688
so I don't really
have to worry about it.

385
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,728
I thought I was the only one.
You're like me.

386
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,162
I don't wanna be.

387
00:22:14,164 --> 00:22:17,065
I don't think
you have a choice, kiddo.

388
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:19,634
Got a lot going through
your head, I'm sure.

389
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:20,936
Yeah.

390
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:23,471
You're gonna be fine.
I can help you.

391
00:22:23,473 --> 00:22:25,841
If you stick around,
I can show you the ropes.

392
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:28,177
Yeah.

393
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:31,514
I just need to destroy
this big machine real quick

394
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,582
before the space-time
continuum collapses.

395
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:34,553
Don't move.

396
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:39,154
See you in a bit.

397
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:51,536
<i>How does he do that?</i>

398
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:57,072
Is it here?
No, no, it's here.

399
00:22:57,074 --> 00:22:59,507
All right, folks.

400
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:00,644
I always get this wrong.

401
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:03,048
Oh, boy.

402
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,015
Prowler.

403
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:08,920
Man, I was in
the middle of something.

404
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,093
I am so tired.

405
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:20,966
Are you mad at me?
I feel like you're mad at me.

406
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,641
That all you got?

407
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,741
Aw, so gross.

408
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:36,879
<i>I should go
up there and help him.</i>

409
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:39,648
<i>Who am I kidding?
I should not do that.</i>

410
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:49,123
Watch out.
Here comes the Spider-Man.

411
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,125
You like my new toy?

412
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:55,564
Cost me a fortune, but, hey,
can't take it with you, right?

413
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:58,834
You came all this way.
Watch the test.

414
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:00,268
It's a hell of a freaking
light show.

415
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,205
You're gonna love this.

416
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:08,110
No! No,
don't do this! Stop!

417
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:11,580
You don't know what it can do!
You'll kill us all!

418
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:29,097
I see multiple
dimensions opening!

419
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:34,068
That was three, four
and five separate dimensions.

420
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,073
It's unstable! We should stop.

421
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:51,056
Norm, what's your take
on head trauma?

422
00:24:54,858 --> 00:24:56,894
I tried to warn you, pal.

423
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:12,744
Goblin, no!
Get him outta there!

424
00:25:19,016 --> 00:25:20,852
<i>Wilson! Where are we?</i>

425
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:24,620
<i>Really weird.</i>

426
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:25,990
<i>Wilson!</i>

427
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:01,990
Hey! Are you okay?

428
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:04,028
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm just resting.

429
00:26:05,762 --> 00:26:07,696
- Can't you get up?
- Yeah.

430
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:09,898
Yeah, I always get up.

431
00:26:11,368 --> 00:26:13,736
The coughing's
probably not a good sign.

432
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,770
Find him. Now.

433
00:26:15,772 --> 00:26:19,074
Listen, we gotta team up here.
We don't have that much time.

434
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:21,943
This override key is the only
way to stop the collider.

435
00:26:21,945 --> 00:26:25,648
Swing up there, use this key,
push the button and blow it up.

436
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,981
You need to hide your face.

437
00:26:26,983 --> 00:26:29,218
You don't tell anyone
who you are.

438
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,286
No one can know. He's got
everyone in his pocket.

439
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:34,155
If he turns
the machine on again,

440
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:36,091
everything you know
will disappear.

441
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:38,026
Your family, everyone.

442
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:40,429
Everyone.

443
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:42,834
Promise me you'll do this.

444
00:26:47,203 --> 00:26:48,703
I promise.

445
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:51,673
Go. Destroy the collider.

446
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:53,142
I'll come and find you.

447
00:26:54,878 --> 00:26:56,046
It's gonna be okay.

448
00:27:04,855 --> 00:27:05,853
Tombstone.

449
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:07,057
We're done with tests.

450
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:12,026
Get that thing ready
to go again. And soon.

451
00:27:12,028 --> 00:27:13,996
Run faster!

452
00:27:13,998 --> 00:27:15,730
These guys are weak.

453
00:27:15,732 --> 00:27:18,467
I'd say it's nice
to see you again, Spider-Man,

454
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:19,834
but it's not.

455
00:27:19,836 --> 00:27:21,335
Hey, Kingpin.
How's business?

456
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:22,938
Boomin'. Heh.

457
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:26,275
Nice. Aw, that's a no-no.

458
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,876
This might open a
black hole under Brooklyn.

459
00:27:28,878 --> 00:27:31,313
It can't be worth the risk.

460
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:34,152
It's not always
about the money, Spider-Man.

461
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,989
Don't you wanna know
what I saw in there?

462
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:43,060
Wait.

463
00:27:44,394 --> 00:27:47,296
I know
what you're trying to do,

464
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,097
and it won't work.

465
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:50,201
They're gone.

466
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:05,780
Get rid of the body.

467
00:28:05,782 --> 00:28:08,382
What was that?

468
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:12,323
Kill that guy.

469
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:49,458
Stop sticking!

470
00:29:07,577 --> 00:29:10,981
<i>Stand clear
of the closing doors, please.</i>

471
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:37,876
Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.

472
00:29:47,183 --> 00:29:49,151
Police! Put your hands up!

473
00:29:49,153 --> 00:29:50,889
Miles? Miles?

474
00:29:52,288 --> 00:29:53,622
Why aren't you
at school?

475
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:56,959
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's okay. It's okay.

476
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,228
Miles?
<i>¿Qué te pasa?</i>

477
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:03,300
Is it the earthquake?

478
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:06,602
Can I sleep here tonight?

479
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,269
Miles.
It's a weeknight.

480
00:30:08,271 --> 00:30:10,205
You made a commitment
to that school.

481
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:11,810
He's upset.

482
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:16,213
Of course you can stay.

483
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,982
- Dad?
- Yeah.

484
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:23,184
Do you really hate
Spider-Man?

485
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:27,989
Yeah. I mean, with
a vigilante, there is...

486
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:29,290
Jeff, <i>mi amor.</i>

487
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:31,259
What? He asked me.

488
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:33,897
Baby, you know how I feel
about Spider-Man. Come on.

489
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:38,033
<i>Tú sabes que
él te quiere mucho.</i>

490
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:40,969
That's why he's tough on you.
You know that, right?

491
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:45,340
Mom, do you ever think
about moving out of Brooklyn?

492
00:30:45,342 --> 00:30:49,044
Our family doesn't run
from things, Miles.

493
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:51,182
Yeah, I know.

494
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:55,517
What's that about?

495
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,286
He's having a hard time, Jeff.

496
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,620
When it gets hard,

497
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:00,421
that's when
he's gotta stick it out.

<i>My name is Peter B. Parker.</i>

549

<i>I was bitten by

<i>And for the last 22 years,</i>

551
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:56,586
<i>I thought I was
the one and only Spider-Man.</i>

552
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,420

553
00:35:59,422 --> 00:36:01,755
<i>I'm pretty sure

554
00:36:01,757 --> 00:36:04,659
<i>You see, I saved the city,
fell in love, I got married,</i>

<i>Don't invest

<i>Then like 15 years passed.
Blah, blah, blah. Super boring.</i>

559
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:17,472
<i>I broke my back,
a drone flew into my face,</i>

560
00:36:17,474 --> 00:36:18,539
<i>I buried Aunt May.</i>

<i>My wife and I split up.</i>

562

<i>I always get back up.</i>

566
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:36,657
<i>And I got a lot of time
to reflect and work on myself.</i>

567

<i>Did you know that seahorses,

<i>A seahorse seeing

571
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:50,771
<i>She wanted kids and...</i>

572
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:52,609
<i>And it scared me.</i>

573
00:36:53,976 --> 00:36:56,577
<i>I'm pretty sure

- I got some questions.

621
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:55,148
Why do you look like
Peter Parker?

622
00:40:57,586 --> 00:40:59,153
Because I am Peter Parker.

623
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:02,023
Then why aren't you dead?
And why is your hair different?

624
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:04,559
Why are you older?
And why is your body

625
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:06,026
a different shape?

626
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:07,829
Pretty sure
you just called me fat.

627
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:09,796
You don't look
so hot either, kid.

628
00:41:09,798 --> 00:41:11,932
Most superheroes don't wear

- No.

- Are you a zombie?
- Stop it.

631
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,204
- Am I a zombie?
- You're not even close.

632
00:41:16,206 --> 00:41:18,940
Are you from another dimension?
Like a parallel universe

633
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:20,275
where things are like
this universe but different?

634
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,142
And you're Spider-Man
in that universe?

635
00:41:22,144 --> 00:41:24,045
But somehow traveled
to this universe,

636
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:25,213
but you don't know how?

637
00:41:25,215 --> 00:41:26,847
Wow. That was really
just a guess?

638
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:28,715
We learned about it
in physics.

639
00:41:28,717 --> 00:41:30,751
- Quantum theory.
- This is amazing!

640
00:41:30,753 --> 00:41:32,820
You can teach me
like Peter said he would.

641
00:41:32,822 --> 00:41:33,921
Before he died.

642
00:41:33,923 --> 00:41:35,188
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Yeah, right.

643
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,958
Look, I made a promise
to him.

644
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,659
Here's lesson number one,
kid.

645
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:41,762
Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.

646
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:48,239
Peter, seriously...

647
00:41:50,106 --> 00:41:52,273
Trust me, kid.

648
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:54,608
This'll all make you
a better Spider-Man.

649
00:41:59,748 --> 00:42:01,316
Hey, are you okay?

650
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,717
No, I'm not.

651
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,117
What's going on
with your body?

652
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:06,019
I don't think my atoms
are real jazzed

653
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:07,789
about being
in the wrong dimension.

654
00:42:10,025 --> 00:42:11,959
Look, I'm not looking
for a side gig

655
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:13,360
as a Spider-Man coach.

656
00:42:13,362 --> 00:42:15,662
I got a lot going on
in my dimension.

657
00:42:15,664 --> 00:42:17,764
"With great power
comes great..."

658
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:19,367
Don't you dare
finish that sentence.

659
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:21,135
Don't do it!
I'm sick of it.

660
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:27,909
Want my advice?
Go back to being a regular kid.

661
00:42:27,911 --> 00:42:29,077
I don't have a choice!

662
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,644
Kingpin's got
a supercollider.

663
00:42:30,646 --> 00:42:32,079
He's tryin' to kill me.

664
00:42:32,081 --> 00:42:34,148
- What did you just say?
- Kingpin's tryin' to kill me.

665
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,249
Who cares about that.
Where's the collider?

666
00:42:36,251 --> 00:42:38,119
Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower.

667
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:39,287
- Goodbye.
- Where you going?

668
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:40,954
When it runs again,
I'll jump in

669
00:42:40,956 --> 00:42:42,389
- and get back to my life.
- You can't let them run it.

670
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:43,958
I'm supposed to destroy it

671
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,026
so it never runs again
or everyone's gonna die.

672
00:42:46,028 --> 00:42:49,697
"Or everyone's gonna die."
That is what they always say.

673
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:52,700
But there's always a little bit
of time before everybody dies

674
00:42:52,702 --> 00:42:54,068
and that's when I do
my best work.

675
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,769
Aren't you gonna need this?

676
00:42:55,771 --> 00:42:57,371
Aw, you have a goober.
Give it.

677
00:42:57,373 --> 00:43:00,842
Wait, no. Not so fast.
He called it an override key.

678
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:03,677
There's always a bypass key,
a virus key, a who-cares key.

679
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:04,912
I can never remember,

680
00:43:04,914 --> 00:43:06,146
so I always call it
a goober. Give it.

681
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:07,882
I need it
to destroy the collider.

682
00:43:07,884 --> 00:43:09,282
I need it to go home.

683
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:10,885
I'll swallow it.
Don't play with me.

684
00:43:10,887 --> 00:43:13,021
- What?
- I said...

685
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,423
The collider created a portal
that brought me here.

686
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:17,057
And I have to get...

687
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:21,195
- Did you break this?
- No, it broke.

688
00:43:21,197 --> 00:43:22,829
I don't remember
what happened.

689
00:43:22,831 --> 00:43:24,365
See, this is why
I never had kids.

690
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:25,932
Can't we make another one?

691
00:43:25,934 --> 00:43:27,969
<i>We</i> can't do anything.
Thanks to you,

692
00:43:27,971 --> 00:43:30,938
I have to re-steal what
your guy stole from Alchemax

693
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,807
and make another one of these.

694
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:35,842
If I don't turn off the collider
after you leave,

695
00:43:35,844 --> 00:43:37,345
everyone in this city,

696
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:40,213
my parents, my uncle and
millions of others, will die.

697
00:43:40,215 --> 00:43:41,883
And you're just gonna
go home

698
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:44,184
and leave me here
to figure this out for myself?

699
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:47,156
- You good with that, Spider-Man?
- Yeah.

700
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,398
What are you doing?

701
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,769
Making you feel guilty.
Is it working?

702
00:44:02,771 --> 00:44:05,039
How could it...? No.
Look at me.

703
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:06,807
Does it look like
it's working?

704
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:10,346
No. No, it's not...

705
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:16,987
No! No! No!
Do not let him win!

706
00:44:18,054 --> 00:44:19,420
All right, kid. You win.

707
00:44:19,422 --> 00:44:21,923
Come on, we don't have
a second to lose.

708
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,758
Mmm. I love this burger.
So delicious.

709
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,728
One of the best burgers
I've ever had.

710
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,396
In my universe, this place
closed six years ago.

711
00:44:29,398 --> 00:44:31,264
I don't know why.
I really don't.

712
00:44:31,266 --> 00:44:32,268
Mmm.

713
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:37,003
You have money, right?
I'm not very liquid right now.

714
00:44:37,005 --> 00:44:38,805
- Can we focus?
- Mm-hm. Sure.

715
00:44:38,807 --> 00:44:41,344
- The other Peter...
- You gonna eat that?

716
00:44:42,378 --> 00:44:43,778
I'm listening.

717
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,378
The other Peter said
he was gonna be

718
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,280
- showing me the ropes.
- Wow.

719
00:44:47,282 --> 00:44:50,016
You got any Spider-Man
tips you can tell me now?

720
00:44:50,018 --> 00:44:51,017
Yeah, I got plenty.

721
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:52,452
Disinfect the mask.

722
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:54,921
You're gonna wanna use
baby powder in the suit,

723
00:44:54,923 --> 00:44:56,124
heavy on the joints.

724
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,291
You don't want
any chafing, right?

725
00:44:58,293 --> 00:45:00,795
- Anything else?
- Nope, that was everything.

726
00:45:00,797 --> 00:45:02,496
I think you're gonna be
a bad teacher.

727
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:05,032
Uh-uh-uh?
Look up where Alchemax is.

728
00:45:05,034 --> 00:45:08,401
"A private technological campus
in Hudson Valley, New York."

729
00:45:08,403 --> 00:45:09,903
You can teach me

730
00:45:09,905 --> 00:45:11,171
to swing on the way there.

731
00:45:14,476 --> 00:45:16,844
I'm not swinging to
the Hudson Valley, Miles.

732
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:18,780
Not after a hearty
burger breakfast.

733
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:21,085
Keep your legs fresh.
You're gonna thank me later.

734
00:45:22,985 --> 00:45:25,253
<i>♪ I can see a new horizon ♪</i>

735
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,088
<i>♪ Underneath the blazing sky ♪</i>

736
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:30,258
<i>♪ I'll be where the eagle's
Flying higher... ♪</i>

737
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,425
- And it's a no on the cape.
- I think it's cool.

738
00:45:32,427 --> 00:45:34,162
Take that off.
It's disrespectful.

739
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,130
Spider-Man doesn't wear a cape.

740
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:39,233
So how do we
retrace Peter's steps?

741
00:45:39,235 --> 00:45:41,202
That's a good question.

742
00:45:41,204 --> 00:45:44,041
What would I do
if I were me?

743
00:45:44,873 --> 00:45:46,206
Got it.

744
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:48,208
<i>Step One:
I infiltrate the lab.</i>

745
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,177
<i>Two: Find the head scientist's
computer.</i>

746
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:52,380
<i>That lady with the
bike is the head scientist.</i>

747
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,447
<i>I saw her
in this documentary.</i>

748
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:56,883
<i>Cool! Step Three: I
reexamine my personal biases.</i>

749
00:45:56,885 --> 00:45:58,119
<i>Step Four:
I hack the computer.</i>

750
00:45:58,121 --> 00:45:59,452
It's not technically
hacking.

751
00:45:59,454 --> 00:46:01,488
Not now. I just lost
my train of thought.

752
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:03,423
<i>Step Five:
Download the important stuff.</i>

753
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:05,226
<i>I'll know it when I see it.</i>

754
00:46:05,228 --> 00:46:08,095
<i>Step Six: I grab a bagel
from the cafeteria and run.</i>

755
00:46:08,097 --> 00:46:09,863
So, what am I doing?

756
00:46:09,865 --> 00:46:12,999
Step Seven: You stay here.
You're lookout. Very important.

757
00:46:13,001 --> 00:46:15,603
Look, man. You gotta teach me
how to do Spider-Man stuff

758
00:46:15,605 --> 00:46:17,204
or I won't be able
to help.

759
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:21,309
Watch and learn, kid!
I'll quiz ya later!

760
00:46:24,012 --> 00:46:25,345
Why did I get stuck with

761
00:46:25,347 --> 00:46:27,581
the janky, old, broke
hobo Spider-Man?!

762
00:46:29,117 --> 00:46:30,985
That's new.

763
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,298
Kingpin.

764
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,001
<i>What am I doing?
What am I doing?</i>

765
00:46:47,003 --> 00:46:48,438
<i>What am I doing?
What am I doing?</i>

766
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,981
Whoa!

767
00:47:05,387 --> 00:47:07,054
Peter!

768
00:47:07,056 --> 00:47:08,889
Peter!

769
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:10,258
Peter!

770
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,360
- What are you doing here?
- Kingpin's here.

771
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:13,894
Just move over.

772
00:47:13,896 --> 00:47:16,597
You're steppin' on my foot.
Go back outside.

773
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:19,099
No! I can't sit there
and let Spider-Man die

774
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:20,568
without doing anything
about it.

775
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:23,070
I'm not doing that again.

776
00:47:23,072 --> 00:47:24,671
What?

777
00:47:24,673 --> 00:47:28,642
Most people I meet
in the workplace try to kill me,

778
00:47:28,644 --> 00:47:30,313
so you're
a nice change of pace.

779
00:47:31,581 --> 00:47:33,613
Mr. Fisk!
Look at this data.

780
00:47:33,615 --> 00:47:35,516
I know you can't
really understand it,

781
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:37,186
but these are
really good numbers.

782
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,021
And I got the password.

783
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,456
Mr. Fisk.
If we fire again this week

784
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:45,092
there could be a black hole
under Brooklyn.

785
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:46,626
You see this? And this?

786
00:47:46,628 --> 00:47:48,262
This is multiple dimensions

787
00:47:48,264 --> 00:47:50,498
beginning to crash
into each other.

788
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,666
This is pretty standard
Spider-Man stakes.

789
00:47:52,668 --> 00:47:54,434
You get used to it.
Watch this.

790
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:57,271
He's gonna say,
"You've got 24 hours."

791
00:47:57,273 --> 00:47:58,572
You've got 24 hours.

792
00:47:58,574 --> 00:48:00,675
What this means is there
could be a rupture

793
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,175
in the space-time
continuum.

794
00:48:02,177 --> 00:48:03,411
Ooh. That's bad.

795
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,012
Actually, everything
she said was bad.

796
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:06,012
I was lying before.

797
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:17,360
Hold on. Let
me get you some more data.

798
00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:22,028
- What are you doing, bud?
- I can't move.

799
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,530
Okay, relax your fingers.

800
00:48:23,532 --> 00:48:26,566
We don't have time.
Just let go. Be in the moment.

801
00:48:26,568 --> 00:48:28,668
I am in the moment.
It's a terrible moment.

802
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:31,338
- I'm not refusing.
- No more excuses.

803
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,007
I just need more time.

804
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:35,108
They're right there.
They're gonna see you.

805
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,043
Miles, you gotta unstick.

806
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:38,979
What do you do to relax?

807
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:42,083
Relax. Okay, okay, okay.

808
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,219
♪ Needless to say, I... ♪

809
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:47,253
Oh, for crying out loud.

810
00:48:47,255 --> 00:48:50,023
♪ Callin' it quits
Now, baby, I'm a wreck ♪

811
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:54,394
♪ You're a wreck, ooh... ♪

812
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:59,102
Teenagers: just the worst.

813
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,737
- Miles, where did you go?
- I'm right here.

814
00:49:03,739 --> 00:49:07,173
- Where? I can't see ya.
- I'm right in front of you.

815
00:49:07,175 --> 00:49:09,709
- Can Spider-Man turn invisible?
- Not in my universe.

816
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:11,612
Aah! You just poked me
in my eye!

817
00:49:11,614 --> 00:49:14,382
This is incredible. Some kind
of fight or flight thing.

818
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:15,318
What's that?

819
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,653
Remember this password.
D-G-F-A-M-P-E-S-A-N-D...

820
00:49:20,655 --> 00:49:21,655
Slow down!

821
00:49:21,657 --> 00:49:25,092
-4-$-3-5-8-7-6-5-3-4-5-4-5-3-5.

822
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:27,394
- I need to write it down!
- Download the schematic.

823
00:49:27,396 --> 00:49:29,967
- How do I do that?
- While I turn on the charm.

824
00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:33,200
Spider-Man?

825
00:49:33,202 --> 00:49:35,802
Oh, hey.
Didn't see you there.

826
00:49:35,804 --> 00:49:37,204
Wow.

827
00:49:37,206 --> 00:49:39,373
Okay, I'm kinda
freaking out right now.

828
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:41,208
You're supposed to be dead.

829
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:44,512
Surprise! Okay. That's a no-no.
We don't like that.

830
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:46,280
This is fascinating.

831
00:49:46,282 --> 00:49:48,048
Okay, that's my face.

832
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:50,284
An entirely different
Peter Parker.

833
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:53,119
Little bit of a gut, perhaps
from dimensional warping.

834
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:55,655
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah. I was way
flatter before I warped.

835
00:49:55,657 --> 00:49:57,525
Travel through the multiverse

836
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,526
appears to have
deteriorated the...

837
00:49:59,528 --> 00:50:01,597
What was the rest?!

838
00:50:03,132 --> 00:50:04,597
Hey, how old are you?

839
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:07,233
'Cause you don't look
a day over 35.

840
00:50:07,235 --> 00:50:09,804
They said I was crazy!
They said I was crazy!

841
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,704
You showed
'em you're not crazy.

842
00:50:11,706 --> 00:50:13,442
This might pinch a little.

843
00:50:16,411 --> 00:50:18,412
I know. I just need
to get these samples.

844
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:19,646
Okay.

845
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:21,449
Organize your desktop, lady.

846
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:24,420
Wow. Just complete
cellular decay.

847
00:50:25,621 --> 00:50:27,387
I've never seen
anything like this.

848
00:50:27,389 --> 00:50:28,621
What are you doing?

849
00:50:28,623 --> 00:50:30,557
I'm just taking the whole thing.

850
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,358
And obviously
you've been glitching.

851
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,496
"Glitchin'"? No.
Why would you even say that?

852
00:50:35,498 --> 00:50:37,430
If you stay in this dimension
too long,

853
00:50:37,432 --> 00:50:39,099
your body's gonna
disintegrate.

854
00:50:39,101 --> 00:50:41,101
Do you know how painful
that would be, Peter Parker?

855
00:50:41,103 --> 00:50:42,103
I don't know.

856
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,204
You can't imagine.

857
00:50:44,206 --> 00:50:46,240
And I, for one,

858
00:50:46,242 --> 00:50:48,045
can't wait to watch.

859
00:50:50,146 --> 00:50:51,545
What did you say
your name was?

860
00:50:51,547 --> 00:50:53,416
Dr. Olivia Octavius.

861
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:03,891
Can I assume that your friends
call you Doc Ock?

862
00:51:03,893 --> 00:51:06,327
My friends
actually call me Liv.

863
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,762
My enemies call me Doc Ock.

864
00:51:08,764 --> 00:51:10,331
I got this! Run!

865
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,398
Who are you talking to?

866
00:51:14,269 --> 00:51:17,271
- I got it!
- Oh, you "got it," Peter?

867
00:51:19,275 --> 00:51:20,710
I got it handled, buddy!

868
00:51:22,577 --> 00:51:24,213
Everything is fine!

869
00:51:26,815 --> 00:51:28,349
Okay, this is

870
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:30,351
- a little bit bad.
- You're chatty.

871
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:31,221
Gotta go.

872
00:51:33,922 --> 00:51:36,525
This is the moment
that I'm losin' the fight.

873
00:51:38,693 --> 00:51:41,729
Let me tell you the good news.
We don't need the monitor.

874
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:44,231
Peter!

875
00:51:44,233 --> 00:51:47,901
You didn't tell me
you had an invisible friend!

876
00:51:47,903 --> 00:51:49,836
Could you give me that back,
young man?

877
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:51,838
Peter!

878
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,277
It's proprietary.

879
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,648
Oh.

880
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,749
This'd be a good time

881
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:03,416
- to turn invisible.
- Yep.

882
00:52:03,418 --> 00:52:06,619
Okay, not gonna turn invisible.
Selecting a bagel.

883
00:52:06,621 --> 00:52:08,322
Act super normal.

884
00:52:08,324 --> 00:52:09,456
Spider-Man?

885
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:10,657
You know, that's funny,

886
00:52:10,659 --> 00:52:12,358
- I get that a lot.
- Hey.

887
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,595
- Spider-Man?
- Hey! Hands up!

888
00:52:14,597 --> 00:52:15,896
Now we do
a switchy-switchy.

889
00:52:15,898 --> 00:52:17,298
Get back here!

890
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,499
Where do you think
you're going?

891
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:20,534
- He took a bagel!
- Time to swing,

892
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:22,903
- just like I taught ya.
- When did you teach me that?

893
00:52:22,905 --> 00:52:25,505
I didn't. It's a little joke
for team-building.

894
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:27,273
Hey!

895
00:52:27,275 --> 00:52:29,476
- All right, you ready?
- Of course I'm not ready!

896
00:52:31,347 --> 00:52:32,713
I can't do this yet!

897
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:34,782
Everybody knows
that the best way to learn

898
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:36,820
is under intense
life-threatening pressure.

899
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:41,791
Come on, come on, come on.

900
00:52:45,728 --> 00:52:47,297
Uh-oh.

901
00:52:52,668 --> 00:52:54,668
What are you doing down there?

902
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,570
I run better than I swing.

903
00:52:56,572 --> 00:52:59,673
You gotta swing
or they'll catch you.

904
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:01,941
This is what you wanted.

905
00:53:07,516 --> 00:53:08,918
Uh-oh.

906
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:16,523
Come back, little boy.

907
00:53:16,525 --> 00:53:18,891
Aim with your hips!
Look where you want it to hit.

908
00:53:18,893 --> 00:53:21,362
Square your shoulders.
Don't forget to follow through!

909
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,829
Don't shoot off
your back foot.

910
00:53:22,831 --> 00:53:25,532
- That's too many things!
- Then stop listening to me!

911
00:53:25,534 --> 00:53:28,605
That's the best idea
you've had all day!

912
00:53:35,677 --> 00:53:38,214
Nice, Miles!

913
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:43,349
Good. You're doin' it.

914
00:53:43,351 --> 00:53:45,952
Double tap to release
and thwip it out again.

915
00:53:45,954 --> 00:53:47,820
Thwip and release.

916
00:53:47,822 --> 00:53:51,057
- And thwip. Release. Thwip.
- And release.

917
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:52,825
You're a natural.
Thwip. Release.

918
00:53:52,827 --> 00:53:55,561
- Feel the rhythm?
- Thwip. And release!

919
00:53:55,563 --> 00:53:56,764
Good, Miles.

920
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:58,865
I gotta say,
you're amazing, man.

921
00:53:58,867 --> 00:54:00,400
We're a little team!

922
00:54:00,402 --> 00:54:02,369
Me as the teacher
who could still do it.

923
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:05,405
You as the student who can
do it, just not as good.

924
00:54:05,407 --> 00:54:08,244
I'm proud of us. Is there
something you want to say to me?

925
00:54:10,378 --> 00:54:11,347
Peter!

926
00:54:23,826 --> 00:54:25,559
- What the...?
- Who did that?

927
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:53,454
Hey, guys.

928
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,588
Gwanda?

929
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:56,389
It's Gwen, actually.

930
00:54:56,391 --> 00:54:59,360
Oh, you know her.
Very cool.

931
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,128
I'm from another dimension.

932
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:04,365
I mean,
another-another dimension.

933
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:07,034
<i>All right, people. Let's start
at the beginning one last time.</i>

934
00:55:07,036 --> 00:55:08,769
<i>My name is Gwen Stacy.</i>

935
00:55:08,771 --> 00:55:11,604
<i>I was bitten by
a radioactive spider.</i>

936
00:55:11,606 --> 00:55:13,407
<i>And for the last two years,</i>

937
00:55:13,409 --> 00:55:16,677
<i>I've been the one
and only Spider-Woman.</i>

938
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:18,612
<i>You guys know the rest.</i>

939
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:20,083
<i>I joined a band.</i>

940
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:23,586
<i>Saved my dad.</i>

941
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,389
<i>I couldn't save my best friend,</i>

942
00:55:29,391 --> 00:55:30,859
<i>Peter Parker,</i>

943
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:34,762
<i>so now I save everyone else.</i>

944
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:37,697
<i>And I don't do friends
anymore,</i>

945
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:39,335
<i>just to avoid
any distractions.</i>

946
00:55:40,835 --> 00:55:45,037
<i>And one day
this weird thing happened.</i>

947
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:48,110
<i>And I mean, like,
really weird.</i>

948
00:55:53,715 --> 00:55:56,385
<i>I was blown into last week.</i>

949
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,921
<i>Literally.</i>

950
00:56:01,923 --> 00:56:05,559
<i>I landed in New York,
but not my New York.</i>

951
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:08,528
<i>Lucky for these folks,</i>

952
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,798
<i>Spider-Man was there
to save the day.</i>

953
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,967
<i>My Spider-sense told me
to head to Visions Academy.</i>

954
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:15,969
...you guys are early.

955
00:56:15,971 --> 00:56:19,005
<i>Wasn't sure why
until I met you.</i>

956
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:19,942
Oh!

957
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:22,175
I like your haircut.

958
00:56:22,177 --> 00:56:24,077
You don't get to like
my haircut.

959
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:25,579
Let's go.

960
00:56:25,581 --> 00:56:26,914
How many more Spider-People
are there?

961
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:28,081
Save it
for Comic-Con.

962
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:30,184
What's Comic-Con?
Whoa!

963
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:48,735
You're dead, Spider-Man.

964
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:50,938
Wilson!
What are you doing?

965
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,104
Vanessa.

966
00:56:52,106 --> 00:56:53,476
Richard, come on.

967
00:56:57,045 --> 00:56:58,912
Vanessa! Richard!

968
00:56:58,914 --> 00:57:00,546
<i>No!</i>

969
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:03,115
Don't look back, honey.
It's okay. It's okay.

970
00:57:21,936 --> 00:57:23,903
I killed Spider-Man.

971
00:57:23,905 --> 00:57:25,972
Why did I just see two more?

972
00:57:25,974 --> 00:57:28,242
There's three, actually.

973
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:31,278
No, this is good.
This is very, very good.

974
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,979
This means
you get what you want.

975
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:36,148
It means my collider works.

976
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:39,619
All we have to do is kill
a couple of Spiders.

977
00:57:39,621 --> 00:57:42,289
And the collider will bring
your family back.

978
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:44,894
As many families
as you want.

979
00:57:53,869 --> 00:57:56,836
Tomorrow, at my collider.

980
00:57:56,838 --> 00:57:58,907
Our collider.

981
00:58:02,143 --> 00:58:03,677
He broke this?

982
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:06,213
Yeah. He's actually
really embarrassed about it,

983
00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:08,315
so just keep
it between us, okay?

984
00:58:09,717 --> 00:58:11,552
I know where we
can make a new one.

985
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,753
And we won't let him
break it this time.

986
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,961
I'm sorry about your friend.

987
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:20,860
Thanks, Miles.

988
00:58:23,097 --> 00:58:24,898
I know
how hard this is.

989
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,601
To have to figure
this stuff out on your own.

990
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:30,771
It's kinda nice not being
the only Spider-person around.

991
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:32,171
Yeah.

992
00:58:33,608 --> 00:58:36,008
If you ever decide
to do friends again,

993
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:37,746
I could always open up a slot.

994
00:58:39,114 --> 00:58:41,914
I'll keep you posted.

995
00:58:41,916 --> 00:58:43,952
Cool.

996
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,590
We should probably go.

997
00:58:50,592 --> 00:58:52,925
Peter, we're
literally on the doorstep.

998
00:58:52,927 --> 00:58:54,827
Bad idea. This is a bad idea.

999
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:56,362
Just relax.

1000
00:58:56,364 --> 00:58:58,164
You guys are all very sweet,

1001
00:58:58,166 --> 00:59:00,633
but no more fans today, please.

1002
00:59:03,972 --> 00:59:05,639
I'm not ready for this.

1003
00:59:10,311 --> 00:59:11,880
Peter?

1004
00:59:13,748 --> 00:59:15,749
Hey, Aunt May.

1005
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:17,784
So this is gonna
sound crazy,

1006
00:59:17,786 --> 00:59:20,253
but I'm pretty sure
that I'm from an...

1007
00:59:20,255 --> 00:59:22,255
An alternate dimension.

1008
00:59:22,257 --> 00:59:23,559
Yeah.

1009
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,927
You look tired, Peter.

1010
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:29,128
Well, I am tired.

1011
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:32,298
- And older. And thicker.
- Yeah. I've heard that already.

1012
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,834
Oh, jeez.
Are those sweatpants?

1013
00:59:34,836 --> 00:59:37,070
Yup, that's what they are.

1014
00:59:37,072 --> 00:59:38,972
I was there,

1015
00:59:38,974 --> 00:59:41,340
when it all happened.

1016
00:59:41,342 --> 00:59:43,409
I am so sorry.

1017
00:59:43,411 --> 00:59:45,679
And what dimension
are you from?

1018
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:47,748
Brooklyn.

1019
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,017
Did Peter have a place where we
could make another one of these?

1020
00:59:51,019 --> 00:59:52,822
A goober.

1021
00:59:54,088 --> 00:59:55,287
Follow me.

1022
00:59:58,427 --> 01:00:00,693
Oh, yeah,
I got one of these, too.

1023
01:00:00,695 --> 01:00:02,963
A little, old shed
where I keep my Spider-gear.

1024
01:00:15,376 --> 01:00:17,346
I mean,
this place is pretentious.

1025
01:00:24,452 --> 01:00:26,221
Whoa.

1026
01:00:30,858 --> 01:00:32,758
Dude. Was yours
anything like this?

1027
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,061
Mine was like this,

1028
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:36,128
but take away the jeep,
the plane.

1029
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:39,932
Imagine it way smaller.
Imagine a futon.

1030
01:00:39,934 --> 01:00:42,304
I feel sad for this guy.

1031
01:00:56,284 --> 01:00:57,386
Hey, Peter.

1032
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,887
I think this is a cape.

1033
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:20,440
Peter knew
how dangerous the job was.

1034
01:01:20,442 --> 01:01:23,209
But he figured the only one
who could stop this guy

1035
01:01:23,211 --> 01:01:24,947
was Spider-Man.

1036
01:01:26,414 --> 01:01:28,380
Kingpin knows
we're coming.

1037
01:01:28,382 --> 01:01:30,349
We're going to be
outnumbered.

1038
01:01:30,351 --> 01:01:32,753
Don't be
so sure.

1039
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:34,791
You might need these.

1040
01:01:39,393 --> 01:01:42,297
You think you're the only people
who thought to come here?

1041
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:46,298
Hey, fellas.

1042
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,001
Is he
in black and white?

1043
01:01:48,003 --> 01:01:50,403
Where's that wind coming from?
We're in a basement.

1044
01:01:50,405 --> 01:01:52,204
Wherever I go,
the wind follows.

1045
01:01:52,206 --> 01:01:55,077
And the wind,
it smells like rain.

1046
01:01:56,177 --> 01:01:57,177
Hi, guys!

1047
01:02:02,317 --> 01:02:04,784
This could literally not
get any weirder.

1048
01:02:04,786 --> 01:02:07,554
It <i>can</i> get weirder.

1049
01:02:07,556 --> 01:02:10,860
I just washed my hands.
That's why they're wet.

1050
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:12,929
No other reason.

1051
01:02:20,434 --> 01:02:22,270
You're like me.

1052
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:26,472
<i>My name is Peter Parker.</i>

1053
01:02:26,474 --> 01:02:28,141
<i>My name is Peni Parker.</i>

1054
01:02:28,143 --> 01:02:30,142
<i>My name is Peter Porker.</i>

1055
01:02:30,144 --> 01:02:31,912
<i>I was
bitten by a radioactive spider.</i>

1056
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,313
<i>I was bitten
by a radioactive pig.</i>

1057
01:02:33,315 --> 01:02:35,481
<i>In my universe, it's 1933,</i>

1058
01:02:35,483 --> 01:02:37,083
<i>and I'm a private eye.</i>

1059
01:02:37,085 --> 01:02:38,418
<i>I like to drink egg creams,</i>

1060
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,854
<i>and I like to fight Nazis.
A lot.</i>

1061
01:02:40,856 --> 01:02:42,988
<i>I'm from New
York in the year 3145.</i>

1062
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:44,590
<i>I have a psychic link
with a spider</i>

1063
01:02:44,592 --> 01:02:46,392
<i>who lives inside
my father's robot.</i>

1064
01:02:46,394 --> 01:02:49,028
<i>And we're best friends.
Forever.</i>

1065
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:51,097
<i>Sometimes I let
matches burn down to my fingertips</i>

1066
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:52,465
<i>just to feel something,
anything.</i>

1067
01:02:53,835 --> 01:02:54,867
<i>I'm a photographer</i>

1068

<i>When I'm not pooching around,</i>

1070
01:02:57,072 --> 01:02:58,505
<i>I'm working like a dog,</i>

1071
01:02:58,507 --> 01:02:59,840
<i>trying to sniff out
the latest story.</i>

1072
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:00,974
♪ I frolic and I dance ♪

1073
01:03:00,976 --> 01:03:02,008
♪ And I do this
With my pants ♪

1074
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:03,610
Okay! Enough!

1075
01:03:03,612 --> 01:03:06,880
So how did you
get here?

1076
01:03:06,882 --> 01:03:09,050
Well, it's kind of
a long story.

1077
01:03:13,922 --> 01:03:15,354
Maybe not
that long.

1078
01:03:15,356 --> 01:03:18,458
And now we're just trying
to find a way home.

1079
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:23,028
The only way home is back
through that collider gizmo.

1080
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:24,363
The only trouble is...

1081
01:03:24,365 --> 01:03:27,601
One of us has to stay behind
and destroy it.

1082
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:29,034
- I'll do it. - I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

1083
01:03:29,036 --> 01:03:31,438
No, no, no.
You guys don't get it.

1084
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,242
Don't get what?

1085
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,280
None of you can stay here.
If you stay here, you'll die.

1086
01:03:41,282 --> 01:03:43,516
I'm the guy
who's gonna turn it off.

1087
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:47,354
And I'm gonna get you all home
before I do.

1088
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:51,394
Look, I made a promise.
So I have to keep it.

1089
01:03:56,297 --> 01:03:57,496
Who are you
again?

1090
01:03:57,498 --> 01:03:58,898
This is Miles.

1091
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,467
And he's gonna save
the multiverse.

1092
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,934
Yeah, man.

1093
01:04:01,936 --> 01:04:03,536
This kid can turn himself
invisible.

1094
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:05,070
Watch this.
He can do it now.

1095
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:10,644
- I can't do it on command.
- He can't do it on command.

1096
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:13,412
But it is cool. Show 'em
the zappy thing, Miles.

1097
01:04:15,217 --> 01:04:18,517
- Can't do it on command.
- He can't do it on command.

1098
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:21,054
But he can do so much more.
What else do you do?

1099
01:04:21,056 --> 01:04:23,956
- Just those two things.
- Just those two things.

1100
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:25,458
Aw, man.

1101
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:30,066
Look, I've seen him in action.
He's got potential.

1102
01:04:31,233 --> 01:04:33,436
I think he's gonna
get us home.

1103
01:04:35,269 --> 01:04:36,635
Okay, little fella,

1104
01:04:36,637 --> 01:04:38,972
Kingpin's gonna send
a lot of mugs after ya.

1105
01:04:38,974 --> 01:04:41,074
I'm talkin' hard boys,
real biscuit boxers.

1106
01:04:41,076 --> 01:04:42,976
Can you fight them
all off at once?

1107
01:04:42,978 --> 01:04:45,244
I haven't actually
fought anyone.

1108
01:04:45,246 --> 01:04:46,382
Surprise attack!

1109
01:04:48,115 --> 01:04:50,383
Can you rewire a mainframe
while being shot at?

1110
01:04:50,385 --> 01:04:51,450
- Can I what?
- Show me!

1111
01:04:51,452 --> 01:04:53,286
Surprise attack!

1112
01:04:53,288 --> 01:04:55,121
Can you swing and flip with
the grace of a trained dancer?

1113
01:04:55,123 --> 01:04:57,090
Can you close off your feelings
so you don't get crippled

1114
01:04:57,092 --> 01:04:58,992
by the moral ambiguity
of your violent actions?

1115
01:04:58,994 --> 01:05:01,126
Can you help your aunt create
an online dating profile

1116
01:05:01,128 --> 01:05:03,128
so she can get out of
the dang house once in a while?

1117
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:06,398
Can you float through the air
when you smell a delicious pie?

1118
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,733
- Can you be strong?
- Ruthless?

1119
01:05:07,735 --> 01:05:09,501
- Disciplined?
- I don't know. Maybe.

1120
01:05:09,503 --> 01:05:11,371
- Psychic?
- Show me some moxie, soldier!

1121
01:05:11,373 --> 01:05:14,273
Above all, no matter
how many times you get hit,

1122
01:05:14,275 --> 01:05:15,708
can you get back up?

1123
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:17,677
'Cause when a Spider-Man
is on the floor...

1124
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:19,579
When you think
you can't keep goin'...

1125
01:05:19,581 --> 01:05:21,613
- Come on, Miles.
- Come on. You can do it.

1126
01:05:21,615 --> 01:05:23,682
- You can do this.
- Guys, cool it.

1127
01:05:23,684 --> 01:05:26,619
- Come on. You can do it!
- Get up, Miles.

1128
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:28,657
Come on, Miles. Get up.

1129
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:37,463
You need to be more honest
with yourself about this.

1130
01:05:37,465 --> 01:05:38,697
He's not ready.
It's obvious.

1131
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:40,367
There's no way.
He's just a kid.

1132
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:41,568
If he can't do this,

1133
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,302
we have to stay
and do it for him.

1134
01:05:43,304 --> 01:05:46,139
He's looking right at us
while we talk about him.

1135
01:05:46,141 --> 01:05:47,574
Miles?

1136
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:48,608
Miles?

1137
01:05:51,545 --> 01:05:54,780
You see that? He can, um...

1138
01:05:54,782 --> 01:05:57,117
He can turn invisible.

Look, he's just clearing

He's got

- My uncle.
- Hey, where have you been?

1181
01:10:27,988 --> 01:10:30,455
My uncle Aaron,
he's the Prowler.

1182
01:10:30,457 --> 01:10:32,392
- Slow down, Miles.
- He works for Kingpin.

1183
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:33,992
He tried to kill me!

1184
01:10:33,994 --> 01:10:35,794
This is a pretty
hard-core origin story.

1185
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:37,863
It's okay.
We're gonna figure it out.

1186
01:10:37,865 --> 01:10:40,903
- Were you followed?
- No, I don't think so.

1187
01:10:49,711 --> 01:10:53,579
- Cute place. Real homey.
- Oh, great. It's Liv.

1188
01:10:53,581 --> 01:10:55,615
I guess
I was followed.

1189
01:10:55,617 --> 01:10:56,782
Oh, no.

Get out of here,
kid.

You messed up bigtime, kid.
Very sloppy.

1192
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:08,093
Let me guess. You're Scorpion.
Well, we're the Spider gang.

1193
01:11:08,095 --> 01:11:10,362
Would you mind
taking this outside?

1194
01:11:10,364 --> 01:11:13,398
We don't pick the ballroom,
we just dance.

Ooh, I think
I'll be taking that.

1200
01:11:59,546 --> 01:12:02,083

01:18:02,476 --> 01:18:03,778
Bye,
Miles.

1257
01:18:07,515 --> 01:18:09,882
Miles, I came
to say goodbye.

1258
01:18:09,884 --> 01:18:11,450
We can say goodbye
at the collider.

1259
01:18:11,452 --> 01:18:13,785
You're not getting it.
You're staying here.

1260
01:18:13,787 --> 01:18:15,888
I need to be there.
So you can all go home.

1261
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:19,090
They are going home, Miles.
I'm the only one stayin'.

1262
01:18:19,092 --> 01:18:22,762
You're taking my place?
If you stay here, you'll die.

1263
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:24,330
I'm doing
what needs to be done.

1264
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:26,134
I just wanted you
to hear it from me.

1265
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:28,302
What about MJ?

1266
01:18:29,537 --> 01:18:31,940
Not everything works out,
kid.

1267
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:35,508
I need the goober.

1268
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,343
Please don't make me
take it from you.

1269
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:38,510
That's not fair!

1270
01:18:38,512 --> 01:18:40,379
You gotta tell them
I can do this.

1271
01:18:40,381 --> 01:18:41,983
It wasn't their decision.

1272
01:18:45,485 --> 01:18:49,021
I gotta make Kingpin pay!
You have to let me make him pay!

1273
01:18:49,023 --> 01:18:50,555
Miles, you're gonna get
yourself killed.

1274
01:18:50,557 --> 01:18:52,223
But I'm ready.
I promise!

1275
01:18:55,262 --> 01:18:57,329
Then venom-strike me
right now.

1276
01:18:57,331 --> 01:19:02,101
Or turn invisible on command
so you can get past me.

1277
01:19:12,546 --> 01:19:16,080
Look, I know how
much you want this, kid.

1278
01:19:16,082 --> 01:19:17,952
Poor
little guy.

1279
01:19:21,521 --> 01:19:23,824
But you don't
have it yet.

1280
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:30,499
I'm sorry.

1281
01:19:31,998 --> 01:19:34,168
When will I know
I'm ready?

1282
01:19:35,869 --> 01:19:38,469
You won't.
It's a leap of faith.

1283
01:19:38,471 --> 01:19:40,572
That's all it is,
Miles.

1284
01:19:40,574 --> 01:19:43,077
A leap of faith.

1285
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:26,117
Miles.

1286
01:20:26,119 --> 01:20:27,956
Miles, it's your dad.

1287
01:20:28,956 --> 01:20:31,025
Please open the door.

1288
01:20:32,426 --> 01:20:35,263
Miles, I can see
your shadow movin' around.

1289
01:20:37,131 --> 01:20:41,267
Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it.
You're still ignoring me.

1290
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,538
Look, can we talk
for a minute?

1291
01:20:45,305 --> 01:20:47,174
Something...

1292
01:20:49,076 --> 01:20:51,078
Something happened to...

1293
01:20:53,914 --> 01:20:57,319
Look, sometimes
people drift apart, Miles.

1294
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:02,955
And I don't want that
to happen to us, okay?

1295
01:21:02,957 --> 01:21:05,257
I know I don't always do
what you need me to do

1296
01:21:05,259 --> 01:21:07,596
or say
what you need me to say.

1297
01:21:09,697 --> 01:21:15,500
I see this spark in you. It's
amazing. It's why I push you.

1298
01:21:15,502 --> 01:21:17,503
But it's yours.

1299
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:21,009
Whatever you choose to do
with it, you'll be great.

1300
01:21:28,315 --> 01:21:31,086
Look, call me
when you can. Okay?

1301
01:21:32,118 --> 01:21:33,487
I love you.

1302
01:21:35,055 --> 01:21:37,491
You don't have to
say it back, though.

Kingpin has a
private elevator entrance

1339
01:25:06,667 --> 01:25:08,666
from his penthouse
to the collider below.

1340
01:25:08,668 --> 01:25:10,635
Didn't count on
having an audience.

1341
01:25:20,881 --> 01:25:22,748
You gotta be kidding me.

1342
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,816
Thank you. It's nice
to be with you this evening

1343
01:25:24,818 --> 01:25:26,184
to celebrate Spider-Man.

1344
01:25:26,186 --> 01:25:28,519
He and I were very close.

1345
01:25:28,521 --> 01:25:31,822
- What a pig.
- I'm right here.

1346
01:25:31,824 --> 01:25:34,692
Hold on. Get a load of how
the waiters are dressed.

1347
01:25:34,694 --> 01:25:37,262
It's in poor taste, but...

1348
01:25:37,264 --> 01:25:38,733
It can't be
that easy.

1349
01:25:39,832 --> 01:25:41,735
It's that easy.

1350
01:25:46,273 --> 01:25:48,639
I just wanna
thank Mary Jane Parker

1351
01:25:48,641 --> 01:25:49,911
for being here this evening.

1352
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:52,477
MJ?

1353
01:25:53,881 --> 01:25:58,416
Pay attention.
It's not your MJ, Peter, okay?

1354
01:25:58,418 --> 01:26:00,384
I'm sorry,
I'll be right back.

1355
01:26:00,386 --> 01:26:02,420
Peter! Come here. Trust me.

1356
01:26:02,422 --> 01:26:04,822
I've been there.
You gotta move on, buddy.

1357
01:26:04,824 --> 01:26:07,226
It will take one second.
Let me just... Oh!

1358
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:10,262
- Hello.
- Oh, wow.

1359
01:26:10,264 --> 01:26:12,363
Um...
I just wondered

1360
01:26:12,365 --> 01:26:14,469
if we could have some more
bread at table 12.

1361
01:26:15,469 --> 01:26:16,570
Yeah.

1362
01:26:18,939 --> 01:26:21,339
I'm just...
I'm really sorry.

1363
01:26:21,341 --> 01:26:24,409
Oh! Don't be sorry.
It's just bread.

1364
01:26:24,411 --> 01:26:26,844
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

1365
01:26:26,846 --> 01:26:28,446
- Mm-hmm.
- I didn't even try.

1366
01:26:28,448 --> 01:26:30,982
That's fine. You know,
I should really get going.

1367
01:26:30,984 --> 01:26:33,317
I know I could do better

1368
01:26:33,319 --> 01:26:34,919
if I just had
another chance

1369
01:26:34,921 --> 01:26:40,459
to give you the bread
that you deserve.

1370
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:41,759
Are you okay?

1371
01:26:41,761 --> 01:26:43,728
We'll take care of
that bread right now.

1372
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:45,830
Well, it's been nice
talking to you.

1373
01:26:45,832 --> 01:26:48,799
For you, they should fill this
place up with fresh bread.

1374
01:26:48,801 --> 01:26:51,503
- You all right, man?
- Oh, yeah. Totally.

1375
01:26:51,505 --> 01:26:53,571
Good, 'cause we are not
getting any bread.

1376
01:26:55,509 --> 01:26:57,375
I'm just sorry
my family can't see

1377
01:26:57,377 --> 01:26:58,979
what we're doing here
tonight.

1378
01:27:07,287 --> 01:27:10,856
<i>Initializing
primary ignition sequence.</i>

1379
01:27:15,595 --> 01:27:16,964
Sleep.

1380
01:27:22,836 --> 01:27:24,602
Start the sequence.

1381
01:27:24,604 --> 01:27:27,371
Uploading Vanessa Fisk
and Richard Fisk DNA sequence.

1382
01:27:27,373 --> 01:27:29,974
Beginning scan
for dimensional matches.

1383
01:27:36,082 --> 01:27:40,751
<i>Secondary
ignition in five, four,</i>

1384
01:27:40,753 --> 01:27:45,324
<i>three, two, one.</i>

1385
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:04,942
Peter, you don't have to stay
behind. I can do it.

1386
01:28:04,944 --> 01:28:06,644
It's okay.

1387
01:28:06,646 --> 01:28:08,813
I've made up my mind.

1388
01:28:12,853 --> 01:28:15,419
I'll put the goober in
and take over the beam.

1389
01:28:15,421 --> 01:28:18,490
After you're gone,
I'll blow it up.

1390
01:28:18,492 --> 01:28:19,594
Good luck, guys.

1391
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:24,998
They know
we're here.

1392
01:28:32,706 --> 01:28:35,576
Nice to see you again,
Peter.

1393
01:28:41,614 --> 01:28:43,682
<i>I got you covered!</i>

1394
01:28:43,684 --> 01:28:45,619
These guys are the pits.

1395
01:28:52,926 --> 01:28:54,793
Why is this
always difficult?

1396
01:28:54,795 --> 01:28:57,428
Where you going, Peter?

1397
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:58,996
Any last words?

1398
01:28:58,998 --> 01:29:02,032
Can I get a minute to think
about it? You have a pen?

1399
01:29:02,034 --> 01:29:04,538
Goodbye, Peter Parker.

1400
01:29:14,782 --> 01:29:16,415
Who did that?!

1401
01:29:22,655 --> 01:29:24,923
- Miles?
- Spider-Man?

1402
01:29:24,925 --> 01:29:27,925
Wow, Miles. You're
doing it on command!

1403
01:29:27,927 --> 01:29:29,460
It's about time, right?

1404
01:29:29,462 --> 01:29:31,830
- Look who's here!
- You figured it out.

1405
01:29:31,832 --> 01:29:33,565
I love you!
I am so proud of you!

1406
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,535
Do I want kids?

1407
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,573
Oh, yeah, I forgot
about her.

1408
01:29:40,207 --> 01:29:42,007
Well, that doesn't look
promising.

1409
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:43,778
No, it doesn't.

1410
01:29:49,682 --> 01:29:52,183
<i>I've got genetic matches.
Hold on.</i>

1411
01:29:52,185 --> 01:29:53,585
It's too risky.

1412
01:29:53,587 --> 01:29:54,986
Shut up and turn it up.

1413
01:29:54,988 --> 01:29:56,854
- On your left!
- On your right!

1414
01:29:56,856 --> 01:29:59,223
I got five o'clock! Three o'clock!
Two o'clock!

1415
01:29:59,225 --> 01:30:01,695
Every direction!

1416
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:05,897
Get to a shelter.
I'll be right there.

1417
01:30:07,501 --> 01:30:09,670
I tried the school,
but I can't get through.

1418
01:30:23,115 --> 01:30:25,116
Guys, are you seeing this?

1419
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,853
Looks like our dimensions
are coming to us.

1420
01:30:28,855 --> 01:30:31,223
Does look cool though,
right?

1421
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:33,161
We gotta get back
up there.

1422
01:30:35,595 --> 01:30:36,894
Is that all you got?

1423
01:30:36,896 --> 01:30:38,897
You gonna fight
or you just bumping gums?

1424
01:30:38,899 --> 01:30:40,699
You hard-boiled
turtle slapper!

1425
01:31:02,154 --> 01:31:05,757
What are you,
some kind of silly cartoon?

1426
01:31:05,759 --> 01:31:07,925
You got a problem
with cartoons?

1427
01:31:13,699 --> 01:31:15,202
Blammo!

1428
01:31:20,274 --> 01:31:21,606
Aww...

1429
01:31:21,608 --> 01:31:24,142
Did that feel like
a cartoon?

1430
01:31:37,925 --> 01:31:38,860
Gwen!

1431
01:31:47,801 --> 01:31:49,000
I like your suit.

1432
01:31:49,002 --> 01:31:50,701
Thanks. I made it myself.

1433
01:31:50,703 --> 01:31:54,509
That was adorable, team!
Now, hold on tight!

1434
01:32:08,087 --> 01:32:10,655
Buckle up, guys.
This is gonna take a while.

1435
01:32:14,261 --> 01:32:16,027
All right.
Never mind.

1436
01:32:16,029 --> 01:32:17,195
Let's end
this thing.

1437
01:32:17,197 --> 01:32:18,629
Guys,
I got it.

1438
01:32:18,631 --> 01:32:20,233
I'll go. I'm the one
with the goo...

1439
01:32:21,734 --> 01:32:23,101
Oh, you gotta be
kidding me.

1440
01:32:23,103 --> 01:32:26,303
Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.

1441
01:32:30,944 --> 01:32:32,113
- Miles!
- Be careful!

1442
01:32:45,859 --> 01:32:47,125
That was crazy.

1443
01:32:47,127 --> 01:32:49,059
We taught him that,
right?

1444
01:32:49,061 --> 01:32:51,832
I didn't teach him that.
And you definitely didn't.

1445
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:11,118
You okay?

1446
01:33:12,752 --> 01:33:14,154
Come on.

1447
01:33:20,894 --> 01:33:23,762
Guys, I got control of the beam!
Get up here!

1448
01:33:25,731 --> 01:33:28,833
<i>Alert! Quantum
polarity has been reversed.</i>

1449
01:33:33,939 --> 01:33:35,706
Guess
this is it.

1450
01:33:35,708 --> 01:33:39,110
Well, nice to know
we're not alone.

1451
01:33:39,112 --> 01:33:42,880
- Right?
- Yeah.

1452
01:33:42,882 --> 01:33:45,316
I got the portal open.
You first, Peni.

1453
01:33:45,318 --> 01:33:47,419
Thank you,
Miles.

1454
01:33:47,421 --> 01:33:49,657
From both
of us.

1455
01:33:52,725 --> 01:33:55,994
I, uh, love you all.

1456
01:33:55,996 --> 01:33:58,929
I'm taking this cube thing
with me.

1457
01:33:58,931 --> 01:34:00,999
I don't understand it.

1458
01:34:01,001 --> 01:34:02,636
But I will.

1459
01:34:06,707 --> 01:34:08,106
I want you
to have this.

1460
01:34:08,108 --> 01:34:09,944
It'll fit
in your pocket.

1461
01:34:11,344 --> 01:34:13,311
That's all, folks.

1462
01:34:13,313 --> 01:34:16,182
Is he allowed
to say that, legally?

1463
01:34:19,819 --> 01:34:21,919
Do I get to like
the hairdo now?

1464
01:34:23,256 --> 01:34:25,123
You know I'm older than you.

1465
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:28,460
15 months, but it's pretty
significant if you ask me.

1466
01:34:28,462 --> 01:34:32,263
Well, Einstein said
time was relative, right?

1467
01:34:33,734 --> 01:34:35,036
Nice.

1468
01:34:37,436 --> 01:34:39,039
Friends?

1469
01:34:40,439 --> 01:34:41,973
Friends.

1470
01:34:41,975 --> 01:34:43,040
Cool.

1471
01:34:43,042 --> 01:34:45,076
See you around,
Spider-Man.

1472
01:34:56,021 --> 01:34:57,123
Your turn.

1473
01:34:58,225 --> 01:35:01,095
Yeah, yeah. Right.

1474
01:35:04,463 --> 01:35:06,897
You're not going anywhere!

1475
01:35:06,899 --> 01:35:09,366
I'll hold him off.
You shut this down.

1476
01:35:09,368 --> 01:35:11,068
Peter,
that wasn't the deal!

1477
01:35:11,070 --> 01:35:14,341
Push the green button!
Do not wait for me!

1478
01:35:18,011 --> 01:35:20,544
- What are you doing?
- You gotta go home!

1479
01:35:20,546 --> 01:35:23,514
This guy could kill you!
I can't let Spider-Man die.

1480
01:35:23,516 --> 01:35:25,251
Neither can I.

1481
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:28,889
It's okay.

1482
01:35:29,789 --> 01:35:31,257
Yeah, it is okay.

1483
01:35:35,462 --> 01:35:37,965
You gotta go home, man.

1484
01:35:39,431 --> 01:35:42,166
How do I know
I'm not gonna mess it up again?

1485
01:35:42,168 --> 01:35:43,369
You won't.

1486
01:35:44,871 --> 01:35:46,336
Right.

1487
01:35:46,338 --> 01:35:48,274
It's a leap of faith.

1488
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:59,386
Not bad, kid.

1489
01:36:08,561 --> 01:36:09,863
Kingpin!

1490
01:36:23,409 --> 01:36:24,608
Nope!

1491
01:36:24,610 --> 01:36:26,846
Sorry! That's cheating.

1492
01:36:28,981 --> 01:36:30,117
<i>Adiós.</i>

1493
01:36:38,457 --> 01:36:40,460
I gotta get to that button.

1494
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:46,964
Oh, no.

1495
01:36:46,966 --> 01:36:49,302
Not so easy doing it
on your own, is it?

1496
01:36:52,939 --> 01:36:55,572
I can't wait to kill
one more Spider-Man.

1497
01:36:58,944 --> 01:37:01,012
- Where am I?
- What?

1498
01:37:01,014 --> 01:37:02,613
Wilson?

1499
01:37:02,615 --> 01:37:05,650
- Is this what you want, man?
- What are you doing?

1500
01:37:05,652 --> 01:37:08,085
Vanessa. Vanessa.

1501
01:37:08,087 --> 01:37:10,588
- What are we doing here?
- I don't know, Richard.

1502
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:11,891
It's me. You know me.

1503
01:37:13,025 --> 01:37:14,592
We're leaving now.

1504
01:37:14,594 --> 01:37:16,928
Don't go.

1505
01:37:16,930 --> 01:37:18,396
Stay with me.

1506
01:37:18,398 --> 01:37:20,134
Please!

1507
01:37:25,372 --> 01:37:28,272
You're not stopping this.
Not today.

1508
01:37:28,274 --> 01:37:30,911
I am stopping this.
Right now!

1509
01:37:39,085 --> 01:37:41,322
I need backup.

1510
01:38:18,457 --> 01:38:20,226
Come on.

1511
01:38:28,435 --> 01:38:31,171
The real Spider-Man
couldn't even beat me.

1512
01:38:33,573 --> 01:38:35,276
You're nothing!

1513
01:38:41,314 --> 01:38:43,550
You took my family.

1514
01:38:47,386 --> 01:38:51,491
And now I'm gonna make sure
you never see yours again.

1515
01:39:11,011 --> 01:39:13,013
Get up, Spider-Man.

1516
01:39:15,347 --> 01:39:17,984
Get up! Come on!

1517
01:39:24,524 --> 01:39:28,061
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1518
01:39:39,204 --> 01:39:42,373
I'll always have my family.

1519
01:39:42,375 --> 01:39:44,110
You ever hear of
the shoulder touch?

1520
01:39:45,211 --> 01:39:46,313
What?

1521
01:39:50,483 --> 01:39:51,648
Hey.

1522
01:40:01,226 --> 01:40:05,431
Hey, Kingpin!
Push the green button for me!

1523
01:41:54,407 --> 01:41:57,407
Miles? Miles? Are you okay?

1524
01:41:57,409 --> 01:41:58,511
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

1525
01:41:59,479 --> 01:42:00,745
You're probably busy...

1526
01:42:00,747 --> 01:42:02,780
<i>No! I can talk,
I can talk.</i>

1527
01:42:02,782 --> 01:42:06,653
<i>Look, so I
came by earlier because...</i>

1528
01:42:07,886 --> 01:42:10,323
- Your uncle...
- I know, Dad.

1529
01:42:11,623 --> 01:42:13,191
I am so sorry.

1530
01:42:13,193 --> 01:42:15,259
Yeah.

1531
01:42:15,261 --> 01:42:16,727
Do you know
who did it?

1532
01:42:16,729 --> 01:42:18,562
I thought I did.

1533
01:42:18,564 --> 01:42:20,697
But I was wrong.

1534
01:42:20,699 --> 01:42:24,268
Look, Miles,
what I said at the door,

1535
01:42:24,270 --> 01:42:25,639
it wasn't just talk.

1536
01:42:27,539 --> 01:42:29,706
Look, you know,
I was thinking

1537
01:42:29,708 --> 01:42:32,410
maybe we could find
a nice wall,

1538
01:42:32,412 --> 01:42:35,545
privately owned,
like at the police station,

1539
01:42:35,547 --> 01:42:41,751
and you could "throw up"
some of your art.

1540
01:42:41,753 --> 01:42:44,287
Man, I'm bad at this.

1541
01:42:44,289 --> 01:42:47,424
Okay, Miles. Miles? You there?

1542
01:42:47,426 --> 01:42:50,361
Oh, come on, man. C-Mobile!

1543
01:42:50,363 --> 01:42:53,263
- Officer.
- Spider-Man!

1544
01:42:53,265 --> 01:42:55,566
Listen, down there,
that was...

1545
01:42:55,568 --> 01:42:57,300
I mean, I owe you...

1546
01:42:57,302 --> 01:42:59,506
Okay!

1547
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:09,379
I look
forward to workin' with you.

1548
01:43:09,381 --> 01:43:11,816
Yeah, me, too. I guess.

1549
01:43:11,818 --> 01:43:14,986
I don't approve of
your methods,

1550
01:43:14,988 --> 01:43:18,455
but we're just gonna have
to agree to disagree.

1551
01:43:18,457 --> 01:43:21,424
Thank you for
your bravery tonight.

1552
01:43:21,426 --> 01:43:22,660
I love you.

1553
01:43:22,662 --> 01:43:24,262
Wait, what?

1554
01:43:24,264 --> 01:43:25,396
And look behind you!

1555
01:43:37,277 --> 01:43:38,576
All right. Cool. Yeah.

1556
01:43:38,578 --> 01:43:39,977
Thanks,
Spider-Man.

1557
01:43:39,979 --> 01:43:41,812
Spider-Man,
<i>a su servicio.</i> Thank you.

1558
01:43:41,814 --> 01:43:43,446
Hey, man. What's up,
little man?

1559
01:43:43,448 --> 01:43:44,648
New Spider-Man.

1560
01:43:44,650 --> 01:43:45,915
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm the new Spider-Man.

1561
01:43:45,917 --> 01:43:47,485
Check it out.

1562
01:43:47,487 --> 01:43:48,818
Whoa!

1563
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:51,488
That was part of the move.

1564
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:54,558
<i>Okay, let's do
this one last time, yeah?</i>

1565
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,059
<i>For real this time. This is it.</i>

1566
01:43:56,061 --> 01:43:57,727
<i>My name is Miles Morales.</i>

We can't all be
everywhere at once.

1818
01:55:33,425 --> 01:55:35,258
Little text
might've been nice.

1819
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:37,027
I was gone for less than two hours.
What happened?

1820
01:55:37,029 --> 01:55:39,095
Okay.
I know what it looks like.

1821
01:55:39,097 --> 01:55:41,565
- But here's the good news.
- Oh, here we go.

1822
01:55:41,567 --> 01:55:43,500
The multiverse <i>didn't</i> collapse.

1823
01:55:43,502 --> 01:55:45,268
- Oh, cool!
- Little touch and go.

1824
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:46,769
But it worked out.

1825
01:55:46,771 --> 01:55:48,205
Great story. Did
you finish the goober?

1826
01:55:48,207 --> 01:55:49,638
It's not a goober.
It's a gizmo.

1827
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:51,174
Do you always
have to call me out?

1828
01:55:51,176 --> 01:55:52,375
It's just really frustrating
and bums me out.

1829
01:55:52,377 --> 01:55:53,710
Don't get excited, Miguel.

1830
01:55:53,712 --> 01:55:55,211
- It's just a prototype.
- Not excited.

1831
01:55:55,213 --> 01:55:56,479
But you could
be the first person

1832
01:55:56,481 --> 01:55:58,447
to make an autonomous
multiverse jump.

1833
01:55:58,449 --> 01:55:59,750
Or the last.

1834
01:55:59,752 --> 01:56:01,585
So we're just gonna roll
the dice on this?

1835
01:56:01,587 --> 01:56:04,454
So, what you do you say, pal?
Where you want to go first?

1836
01:56:04,456 --> 01:56:07,391
Let's start at the beginning
one last time.

1837
01:56:07,393 --> 01:56:09,625
Earth '67.

1838
01:56:12,131 --> 01:56:13,696
- Whoa!
- What the...?

1839
01:56:13,698 --> 01:56:15,331
I'm Spider-Man.

1840
01:56:15,333 --> 01:56:16,700
- I need you to come with me.
- Who the heck are you?

1841
01:56:16,702 --> 01:56:19,236
I just told you...
Listen. I'm from the future.

1842
01:56:19,238 --> 01:56:21,504
- How dare you point at me!
- You were pointing first.

1843
01:56:21,506 --> 01:56:24,040
- It's rude to point.
- <i>You're</i> being very rude.

1844
01:56:24,042 --> 01:56:26,076
Which one pointed first?

1845
01:56:26,078 --> 01:56:28,044
Spider-Man pointed first.
Obviously.

1846
01:56:28,046 --> 01:56:29,745
- You're pointing at me right now.
- I'm not pointing.

1847
01:56:29,747 --> 01:56:31,481
Look at your finger.

1848
01:56:31,483 --> 01:56:32,782
I'm pointing out your pointing,
which is different.

1849
01:56:32,784 --> 01:56:34,418
You haven't seen pointing.

1850
01:56:34,420 --> 01:56:36,620
You're accusing me
of pointing while you're...!

1851
01:56:37,624 --> 01:56:42,624
