1
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:11,843
When the boy was born...

2
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:14,814
...like all Spartans, he was inspected.

3
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:21,255
If he'd been small or puny
or sickly or misshapen...

4
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,762
...he would have been discarded.

5
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:36,573
From the time he could stand,
he was baptized in the fire of combat.

6
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:02,297
Taught never to retreat,
never to surrender.

7
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:07,340
Taught that death on the battlefield
in service to Sparta...

8
00:02:07,543 --> 00:02:10,842
...was the greatest glory
he could achieve in his life.

9
00:02:25,994 --> 00:02:30,522
At age 7, as is customary in Sparta...

10
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:35,864
...the boy was taken from his mother
and plunged into a world of violence.

11
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,200
Manufactured by 300 years
of Spartan warrior society...

12
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:46,544
...to create the finest soldiers
the world has ever known.

13
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:51,277
The agoge, as it's called,
forces the boy to fight.

14
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:55,082
Starves them, forces them to steal...

15
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:59,626
...and if necessary, to kill.

16
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:03,688
By rod and lash the boy was punished...

17
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:07,165
...taught to show no pain, no mercy.

18
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:12,363
Constantly tested, tossed into the wild.

19
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:17,843
Left to pit his wits and will
against nature's fury.

20
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:20,408
It was his initiation...

21
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:23,142
...his time in the wild...

22
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:27,812
...for he would return to his people
a Spartan...

23
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,117
...or not at all.

24
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:55,314
The wolf begins to circle the boy.

25
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:57,918
Claws of black steel...

26
00:03:58,086 --> 00:04:00,316
...fur as dark night.

27
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:02,153
Eyes glowing red...

28
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:06,260
...jewels from the pit of hell itself.

29
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:18,996
The giant wolf sniffing...

30
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:22,234
...savoring the scent of the meal to come.

31
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:47,925
It's not fear that grips him...

32
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:51,700
...only a heightened sense of things.

33
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,407
The cold air in his lungs.

34
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:59,311
Windswept pines
moving against the coming night.

35
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,722
His hands are steady.

36
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:12,155
His form...

37
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:14,420
...perfect.

38
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:42,952
And so the boy, given up for dead...

39
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:47,858
...returns to his people,
to sacred Sparta, a king!

40
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:52,027
Our king, Leonidas!

41
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:01,705
It's been more than 30 years
since the wolf and the winter cold.

42
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:07,411
And now, as then, a beast approaches.

43
00:06:07,582 --> 00:06:12,519
Patient and confident,
savoring the meal to come.

44
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:16,454
But this beast
is made of men and horses...

45
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,423
...swords and spears.

46
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:24,588
An army of slaves, vast beyond imagining,
ready to devour tiny Greece.

47
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:29,700
Ready to snuff out the world's
one hope for reason and justice.

48
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:35,205
A beast approaches...

49
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:43,508
...and it was King Leonidas himself
who provoked it.

50
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:55,987
That's it.

51
00:07:56,324 --> 00:08:01,193
Now, the more you sweat here,
the less you'll bleed in battle.

52
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:04,865
My father taught me...

53
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,501
...that fear is always a constant.

54
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:09,193
But accepting it...

55
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:10,697
...makes you stronger.

56
00:08:10,872 --> 00:08:12,237
My queen.

57
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:15,240
A Persian emissary awaits Leonidas.

58
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,178
In the end...

59
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:22,908
...a Spartars true strength
is the warrior next to him.

60
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:28,179
So give respect and honor to him,
and it will be returned to you.

61
00:08:28,723 --> 00:08:30,213
First...

62
00:08:30,992 --> 00:08:33,927
...you fight with your head.
- Then you fight with your heart.

63
00:08:36,264 --> 00:08:37,959
What is it?

64
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,065
A Persian messenger awaits you.

65
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,837
Do not forget today's lesson.

66
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:46,701
- Respect and honor.
- Respect and honor.

67
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:06,684
Councilman Theron.
You found yourself needed, for once.

68
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:10,697
My king and queen,
I was just entertaining your guests.

69
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:12,127
I'm sure.

70
00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:15,199
Before you speak, Persian...

71
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,635
...know that in Sparta everyone,
even a king's messenger...

72
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:21,401
...is held accountable
for the words of his voice.

73
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,140
Now, what message do you bring?

74
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:28,716
Earth and water.

75
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:34,615
You rode all the way from Persia
for earth and water?

76
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:40,093
Do not be coy or stupid, Persian.
You can afford neither in Sparta.

77
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:43,063
What makes this woman
think she can speak among men?

78
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:46,064
Because only Spartan women
give birth to real men.

79
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:51,164
Let us walk to cool our tongues.

80
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:56,938
If you value your lives
over your complete annihilation...

81
00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:58,773
...listen carefully, Leonidas.

82
00:09:58,947 --> 00:10:03,646
Xerxes conquers and controls
everything he rests his eyes upon.

83
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:06,912
He leads an army so massive,
it shakes the ground with its march.

84
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:09,784
So vast, it drinks the rivers dry.

85
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,950
All the God-King Xerxes requires is this:

86
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:16,526
A simple offering of earth and water...

87
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:20,862
...a token of Sparta's submission
to the will of Xerxes.

88
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:34,074
Submission.

89
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:38,185
Now, that's a bit of a problem.

90
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,848
See, rumor has it...

91
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:42,649
...the Athenians
have already turned you down.

92
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:48,791
And if those philosophers and boy-lovers
have found that kind of nerve, then...

93
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:53,195
- We must be diplomatic.
- And, of course, Spartans...

94
00:10:54,235 --> 00:10:56,294
...have their reputation to consider.

95
00:10:56,471 --> 00:11:00,498
Choose your next words carefully,
Leonidas.

96
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:03,370
They may be your last as king.

97
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:47,151
"Earth and water."

98
00:11:52,427 --> 00:11:54,520
Madman. You're a madman.

99
00:11:54,696 --> 00:11:56,357
Earth and water.

100
00:11:56,731 --> 00:11:58,892
You'll find plenty of both down there.

101
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:02,603
No man, Persian or Greek,
no man threatens a messenger.

102
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:08,031
You bring the crowns and heads
of conquered kings to my city steps.

103
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:10,268
You insult my queen.

104
00:12:10,445 --> 00:12:14,176
You threaten my people
with slavery and death.

105
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:17,284
Oh, I've chosen my words carefully,
Persian.

106
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:19,420
Perhaps you should have done the same.

107
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:23,250
This is blasphemy. This is madness!

108
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:42,701
Madness?

109
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:45,471
This is Sparta!

110
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,366
Welcome, Leonidas.

111
00:14:14,969 --> 00:14:18,132
We have been expecting you.

112
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:29,948
The ephors, priests to the old gods.

113
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,683
Inbred swine.

114
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:35,618
More creature than man.

115
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:41,495
Creatures whom even Leonidas
must bribe and beg.

116
00:14:42,363 --> 00:14:47,198
For no Spartan king has gone to war
without the ephors' blessing.

117
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,931
The Persians claim their forces
number in the millions.

118
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:56,840
I hope, for our sake, they exaggerate.

119
00:14:57,312 --> 00:15:01,544
But there's no question, we face
the most massive army ever assembled.

120
00:15:01,783 --> 00:15:05,116
Before your plan is heard...

121
00:15:05,286 --> 00:15:07,550
...what do you offer?

122
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:21,432
We will use our superior fighting skills...

123
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:25,664
...and the terrain of Greece herself
to destroy them.

124
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,673
We will march north to the coast,
where I will make sure...

125
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:33,746
It is August, Leonidas.
The full moon approaches.

126
00:15:34,115 --> 00:15:37,312
The sacred and ancient festival.

127
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:41,581
Sparta wages no war
at the time of the Carneia.

128
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:43,348
Sparta will burn!

129
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,315
Her men will die at arms...

130
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:49,156
...and her women and children
will be slaves or worse.

131
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:56,362
Now, we will block
the Persian coastal assault...

132
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,969
...by rebuilding the great Phocian Wall.

133
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,839
And from there, we will funnel them into
the mountain pass we call the Hot Gates.

134
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:08,381
Now, in that narrow corridor,
their numbers will count for nothing.

135
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:11,143
And wave after wave of Persian attack...

136
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:15,255
...will smash against Spartan shields.

137
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:20,123
Xerxes' losses will be so great,
his men so demoralized...

138
00:16:20,294 --> 00:16:24,697
...he will have no choice
but to abandon his campaign.

139
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:27,562
We must consult the oracle.

140
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:30,863
Trust the gods, Leonidas.

141
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,372
I'd prefer you trusted your reason.

142
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,567
Your blasphemies...

143
00:16:36,744 --> 00:16:41,113
...have cost us quite enough already.

144
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:44,875
Don't compound them.

145
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:51,755
We will consult the oracle.

146
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:56,386
Diseased old mystics.

147
00:16:57,398 --> 00:17:02,028
Worthless remnants of a time
before Sparta's ascent from darkness.

148
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,635
Remnants of a senseless tradition.

149
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:10,176
Tradition even Leonidas cannot defy...

150
00:17:10,344 --> 00:17:14,747
...for he must respect
the word of the ephors.

151
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,850
That is the law.

152
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:24,221
And no Spartan, subject or citizen,
man or woman...

153
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:28,419
...slave or king, is above the law.

154
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:07,563
The ephors choose only
the most beautiful Spartan girls...

155
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:10,226
...to live among them as oracles.

156
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:13,669
Their beauty is their curse...

157
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:17,641
...for the old wretches
have the needs of men...

158
00:18:18,646 --> 00:18:22,742
...and souls as black as hell.

159
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,917
"Pray to the winds...

160
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:33,620
...Sparta will fall.

161
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:40,261
All Greece will fall.

162
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:46,065
Trust not in men...

163
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:51,374
...honor the gods.

164
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:58,779
Honor the Carneia."

165
00:19:00,588 --> 00:19:04,183
The king's climb down is harder.

166
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:07,259
Pompous, inbred swine.

167
00:19:07,428 --> 00:19:10,659
Worthless, diseased, rotten...

168
00:19:10,832 --> 00:19:12,857
...corrupt.

169
00:19:16,237 --> 00:19:19,866
Truly, you're in the god-king's
favor now...

170
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:22,534
...O wise and holy men.

171
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:24,277
Yes.

172
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:29,405
And when Sparta burns,
you shall bathe in gold.

173
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:32,178
Fresh oracles shall be delivered to you...

174
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:34,052
...daily...

175
00:19:34,222 --> 00:19:38,022
...from every corner of the empire.

176
00:20:13,694 --> 00:20:17,255
Your lips can finish
what your fingers have started.

177
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:22,869
Or has the oracle robbed you
of your desire as well?

178
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:27,431
It would take more than the words
of a drunken adolescent girl...

179
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:29,303
...to rob me of my desire for you.

180
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:34,948
Then why so distant?

181
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:40,076
Because it seems...

182
00:20:40,254 --> 00:20:46,193
...though a slave and captive
of lecherous old men...

183
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:49,758
...the oracle's words
could set fire to all that I love.

184
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:53,594
So that is why my king loses sleep
and is forced from the warmth of his bed?

185
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,904
There's only one womars words that
should affect the mood of my husband.

186
00:21:01,742 --> 00:21:03,300
Those are mine.

187
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:09,881
Then what must a king do
to save his world...

188
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:14,488
...when the very laws he is sworn
to protect force him to do nothing?

189
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:20,758
It is not a question
of what a Spartan citizen should do...

190
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:23,795
...nor a husband, nor a king.

191
00:21:24,432 --> 00:21:27,128
Instead ask yourself, my dearest love...

192
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:30,760
...what should a free man do?

193
00:22:36,237 --> 00:22:40,401
- Is this all of them?
- As you ordered. Three hundred.

194
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:44,708
All with born sons to carry on their name.

195
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:56,787
We are with you, sire.

196
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:59,285
For Sparta. For freedom.

197
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,428
To the death.

198
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,900
He is your son.

199
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:17,609
He is too young
to have felt a womars warmth.

200
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:21,737
I have others to replace him.
Astinos is as brave and ready as any.

201
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:26,110
No younger than we were the first time
you stood next to me in battle.

202
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,017
You are a good friend...

203
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:35,685
...but a better captain, there is none.

204
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:43,136
My good king.

205
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:47,404
My good king, the oracle has spoken.

206
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:50,442
The ephors have spoken.
There must be no march.

207
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:52,408
It is the law, my lord.

208
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,573
- The Spartan army must not go to war.
- Nor shall it.

209
00:23:57,485 --> 00:23:59,077
I've issued no such orders.

210
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:02,980
I'm here just taking a stroll,
stretching my legs.

211
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:08,389
These 300 men
are my personal bodyguard.

212
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:10,823
Our army will stay in Sparta.

213
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:12,763
Where will you go?

214
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:17,966
I hadrt really thought about it...

215
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:20,933
...but now that you ask...

216
00:24:21,108 --> 00:24:23,838
...I suppose I'll head north.

217
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,371
The Hot Gates?

218
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:31,416
Move out!

219
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,678
Move out!

220
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:36,414
What shall we do?

221
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,289
What can we do?

222
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:41,723
What can you do?

223
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:48,599
Sparta will need sons.

224
00:25:36,383 --> 00:25:38,112
Spartan!

225
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:48,622
Yes, milady?

226
00:26:04,712 --> 00:26:07,010
Come back with your shield...

227
00:26:07,948 --> 00:26:09,381
...or on it.

228
00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:12,216
Yes, milady.

229
00:26:20,728 --> 00:26:23,026
"Goodbye, my love."

230
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:25,859
He doesn't say it.

231
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,597
There's no room for softness...

232
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:30,760
...not in Sparta.

233
00:26:30,938 --> 00:26:33,702
No place for weakness.

234
00:26:37,211 --> 00:26:41,409
Only the hard and strong
may call themselves Spartans.

235
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:46,743
Only the hard. Only the strong.

236
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:17,080
We march...

237
00:27:17,785 --> 00:27:23,280
...for our lands, for our families,
for our freedoms.

238
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:26,219
We march.

239
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:29,622
Daxos.

240
00:27:29,797 --> 00:27:33,198
- What a pleasant surprise.
- This morning's full of surprises, Leonidas.

241
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:35,767
- We've been tricked.
- Can't be more than a hundred.

242
00:27:35,936 --> 00:27:38,166
- This is a surprise.
- Silence.

243
00:27:38,605 --> 00:27:40,573
This isn't their army.

244
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:44,905
We heard Sparta was on the warpath
and we were eager to join forces.

245
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:49,675
If it is blood you seek,
you are welcome to join us.

246
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:53,248
But you bring only this handful
of soldiers against Xerxes?

247
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,015
I see I was wrong to expect Sparta's
commitment to at least match our own.

248
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:00,023
Doesrt it?

249
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:03,157
You, there.

250
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,824
What is your profession?

251
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:07,493
I'm a potter, sir.

252
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:12,435
And you, Arcadian.
What is your profession?

253
00:28:12,806 --> 00:28:16,242
- Sculptor, sir.
- Sculptor.

254
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,544
- And you?
- Blacksmith.

255
00:28:23,217 --> 00:28:26,516
Spartans! What is your profession?

256
00:28:33,694 --> 00:28:35,628
You see, old friend?

257
00:28:35,796 --> 00:28:38,697
I brought more soldiers than you did.

258
00:28:48,642 --> 00:28:50,439
No sleep tonight...

259
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:53,980
...not for the king.

260
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:56,378
All his 40 years
have been a straight road...

261
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,111
...to this one gleaming moment
in destiny...

262
00:29:00,287 --> 00:29:03,051
...this one radiant clash
of shield and spear...

263
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:06,818
...sword and bone, and flesh and blood.

264
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,326
His only regret...

265
00:29:10,497 --> 00:29:14,228
...is that he has so few to sacrifice.

266
00:29:35,522 --> 00:29:37,513
We're being followed.

267
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:44,758
It has followed us since Sparta.

268
00:29:49,703 --> 00:29:52,695
My king! Look!

269
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,127
What happened here?

270
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:17,027
Where are all the people?

271
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:19,826
Persians.

272
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,797
I put their number at around 20.

273
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:25,536
A scouting party.

274
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:30,399
But these footprints...

275
00:30:41,788 --> 00:30:43,255
Behind us!

276
00:30:57,304 --> 00:30:58,532
Child!

277
00:31:31,505 --> 00:31:34,235
It's quiet now.

278
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,505
They...

279
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:40,904
They came with beasts
from the blackness.

280
00:31:42,482 --> 00:31:44,746
With their claws and fangs...

281
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:47,148
...they grabbed them.

282
00:31:48,055 --> 00:31:50,216
Everyone...

283
00:31:51,224 --> 00:31:53,283
...but me.

284
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:07,097
The villagers.

285
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:09,575
I found them.

286
00:32:21,088 --> 00:32:23,886
Have the gods no mercy?

287
00:32:25,058 --> 00:32:27,083
We are doomed.

288
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,888
Quiet yourself.

289
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:38,533
The child speaks of the Persian ghosts,
known from the ancient times.

290
00:32:39,406 --> 00:32:42,102
They are the hunters of mers souls.

291
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:45,771
They cannot be killed or defeated.

292
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,544
Not this darkness. Not these lmmortals.

293
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:54,914
Immortals?

294
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:58,282
We'll put their name to the test.

295
00:33:20,347 --> 00:33:23,111
Into the Hot Gates we march.

296
00:33:23,283 --> 00:33:26,582
Into that narrow corridor we march...

297
00:33:26,753 --> 00:33:29,017
...where Xerxes' numbers
count for nothing.

298
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:34,126
Spartans, citizen-soldiers, freed slaves.

299
00:33:34,294 --> 00:33:36,194
Brave Greeks, all.

300
00:33:37,197 --> 00:33:40,291
Brothers, fathers, sons...

301
00:33:40,467 --> 00:33:42,458
...we march.

302
00:33:43,136 --> 00:33:47,334
For honor's sake, for duty's sake,
for glory's sake, we march.

303
00:33:47,507 --> 00:33:50,601
Look! Persians.

304
00:33:55,749 --> 00:33:59,480
Into hell's mouth we march.

305
00:34:08,528 --> 00:34:10,587
Let's watch these motherless dogs...

306
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:14,892
...as they're embraced by the loving arms
of Greece herself. Come.

307
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:19,399
True.

308
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,078
It does look like rain.

309
00:34:29,382 --> 00:34:32,613
Zeus stabs the sky with thunderbolts...

310
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:36,946
...and batters the Persian ships
with hurricane wind.

311
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:40,525
Glorious.

312
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:55,673
Only one among us
keeps his Spartan reserve.

313
00:35:01,615 --> 00:35:03,549
Only he.

314
00:35:03,717 --> 00:35:06,185
Only our king.

315
00:35:23,603 --> 00:35:25,537
My queen?

316
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,041
My queen...

317
00:35:32,212 --> 00:35:35,545
...the courtyard is a more fitting place
for a married woman.

318
00:35:35,715 --> 00:35:37,376
I'm afraid gossip and protocol...

319
00:35:37,551 --> 00:35:40,076
...are the least of my worries now,
councilman.

320
00:35:41,755 --> 00:35:43,586
Is such secrecy needed?

321
00:35:43,757 --> 00:35:46,419
How am I to trust beyond the walls
of my own home?

322
00:35:46,593 --> 00:35:50,324
Even here, Theron has eyes and ears
which fuel Sparta with doubt and fear.

323
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,131
You speak as if all Sparta
conspires against you.

324
00:35:54,768 --> 00:35:56,827
I wish it were only against me.

325
00:35:59,472 --> 00:36:02,964
Many on our council
would vote to give all we have...

326
00:36:03,143 --> 00:36:05,008
...and follow Leonidas...

327
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:07,313
...but you must show them favor.

328
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:12,084
And you can arrange for me
to speak to the council?

329
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:14,686
If it is reason they want,
I will let them know.

330
00:36:14,855 --> 00:36:16,982
Know what, my queen?

331
00:36:17,357 --> 00:36:19,348
Freedom isn't free at all.

332
00:36:19,526 --> 00:36:22,859
That it comes with the highest of costs,
the cost of blood.

333
00:36:25,131 --> 00:36:27,759
I will do my best to gather our council.

334
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:32,035
And its chamber
shall be filled with your voice.

335
00:36:32,372 --> 00:36:34,203
- I'm in your debt.
- No.

336
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:38,705
Leonidas is my king as well as yours.

337
00:37:03,503 --> 00:37:05,368
I saw those ships smash on the rocks.

338
00:37:06,473 --> 00:37:07,838
How can this be?

339
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:11,307
We saw but a fraction of the monster
that is Xerxes' army.

340
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:14,378
There can be no victory here.

341
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:20,013
Why do you smile?

342
00:37:21,721 --> 00:37:23,655
Arcadian...

343
00:37:23,823 --> 00:37:26,849
...I have fought countless times...

344
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:29,789
...yet I've never met an adversary
who could offer me...

345
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:32,124
...what we Spartans
call "a beautiful death."

346
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:34,594
I can only hope...

347
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:37,498
...with all the world's warriors
gathered against us...

348
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:41,334
...there might be one down there
who's up to the task.

349
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:55,118
Move!

350
00:37:56,423 --> 00:37:59,358
Keep going, you dogs!

351
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:09,058
Move!

352
00:38:10,503 --> 00:38:13,063
Forward, I say!

353
00:38:15,408 --> 00:38:17,000
Stop here!

354
00:38:17,844 --> 00:38:20,005
Who commands here?

355
00:38:22,215 --> 00:38:24,877
I am the emissary...

356
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:27,315
...to the ruler of all the world...

357
00:38:28,121 --> 00:38:32,023
...the god of gods, king of kings...

358
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,784
...and by that authority...

359
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,726
...I demand that someone
show me your commander.

360
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:47,406
Listen. Do you think the paltry dozen
you slew scares us?

361
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:51,066
These hills swarm with our scouts.

362
00:38:51,244 --> 00:38:55,943
And do you think your pathetic wall
will do anything...

363
00:38:56,116 --> 00:39:02,419
...except fall like a heap of dry leaves
in the face of...?

364
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:16,432
Our ancestors built this wall...

365
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:21,106
...using ancient stones
from the bosom of Greece herself.

366
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:23,907
And with a little Spartan help...

367
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,678
...your Persian scouts supplied the mortar.

368
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,239
You will pay for your barbarism!

369
00:39:50,403 --> 00:39:51,961
My arm!

370
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:56,406
It's not yours anymore.

371
00:39:56,676 --> 00:40:01,306
Go now. Run along and tell your Xerxes
he faces free men here...

372
00:40:01,681 --> 00:40:03,046
...not slaves.

373
00:40:03,216 --> 00:40:04,444
Do it quickly...

374
00:40:04,684 --> 00:40:07,619
...before we decide to make our wall
just a little bit bigger.

375
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:09,713
No.

376
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:12,323
Not slaves.

377
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:17,563
Your women will be slaves.

378
00:40:17,897 --> 00:40:20,730
Your sons, your daughters...

379
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,232
...your elders will be slaves!

380
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:26,167
But not you, no.

381
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:30,400
By noon this day you will be dead men.

382
00:40:31,578 --> 00:40:37,574
A thousand nations of the Persian Empire
descend upon you.

383
00:40:37,984 --> 00:40:41,476
Our arrows will blot out the sun.

384
00:40:43,256 --> 00:40:45,952
Then we will fight in the shade.

385
00:40:47,494 --> 00:40:49,257
The wall is solid.

386
00:40:49,429 --> 00:40:52,592
It'll do the job of funneling the Persians
into the Hot Gates.

387
00:40:52,932 --> 00:40:55,628
Have the men found any route
through the hills to our back?

388
00:40:56,136 --> 00:40:58,161
None, sire.

389
00:40:58,438 --> 00:40:59,996
There is such a route, good king.

390
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,269
Just pass that western ridge.

391
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:04,637
It's an old goat path.

392
00:41:04,811 --> 00:41:07,644
The Persians could use it to outflank us.

393
00:41:07,814 --> 00:41:11,545
Not one step closer, monster!

394
00:41:13,186 --> 00:41:16,781
Wise king, I humbly request an audience.

395
00:41:16,956 --> 00:41:20,323
- I'll skewer you where you stand.
- I gave no such order.

396
00:41:30,837 --> 00:41:32,065
Forgive the captain.

397
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:34,229
He is a good soldier...

398
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:37,435
...but a bit short on manners.

399
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:41,671
There is nothing to forgive, brave king.
I know what I look like.

400
00:41:42,115 --> 00:41:44,140
You wear the crimson of a Spartan.

401
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:50,383
I am Ephialtes, born of Sparta.

402
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,051
My mother's love
led my parents to flee Sparta...

403
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:56,695
...lest I be discarded.

404
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:00,028
Your shield and armor?

405
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:02,595
My father's, sir.

406
00:42:03,937 --> 00:42:07,998
I beg you, bold king,
to permit me...

407
00:42:08,174 --> 00:42:13,202
...to redeem my father's name
by serving you in combat.

408
00:42:13,513 --> 00:42:19,383
My father trained me to feel no fear,
to make spear and shield and sword...

409
00:42:19,552 --> 00:42:22,282
...as much a part of me
as my own beating heart.

410
00:42:22,722 --> 00:42:26,021
I will earn my father's armor, noble king...

411
00:42:26,192 --> 00:42:28,353
...by serving you in the battle.

412
00:42:33,533 --> 00:42:35,626
A fine thrust.

413
00:42:35,802 --> 00:42:37,394
I will kill many Persians.

414
00:42:43,276 --> 00:42:44,868
Raise your shield.

415
00:42:45,044 --> 00:42:47,706
- Sire?
- Raise your shield as high as you can.

416
00:42:55,955 --> 00:42:58,981
Your father should have taught you
how our phalanx works.

417
00:42:59,659 --> 00:43:00,956
We fight...

418
00:43:01,494 --> 00:43:04,395
...as a single, impenetrable unit.

419
00:43:04,564 --> 00:43:07,499
That is the source of our strength.

420
00:43:08,334 --> 00:43:11,963
Each Spartan protects the man
to his left...

421
00:43:12,138 --> 00:43:15,335
...from thigh to neck with his shield.

422
00:43:15,508 --> 00:43:20,172
A single weak spot
and the phalanx shatters.

423
00:43:21,581 --> 00:43:24,812
From thigh to neck, Ephialtes.

424
00:43:26,853 --> 00:43:29,253
I am sorry, my friend.

425
00:43:29,422 --> 00:43:32,016
- But not all of us were made to be soldiers.
- But l...

426
00:43:32,191 --> 00:43:34,625
- lf you want to help in a Spartan victory...
- Yes.

427
00:43:34,794 --> 00:43:39,959
...clear the battlefield of the dead,
tend the wounded, bring them water...

428
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:41,760
...but as for the fight itself...

429
00:43:43,136 --> 00:43:45,036
...I cannot use you.

430
00:43:46,873 --> 00:43:48,306
You...

431
00:43:56,182 --> 00:44:00,278
Mother! Father! You were wrong!

432
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:05,319
You are wrong!

433
00:44:05,491 --> 00:44:10,019
Leonidas! You are wrong!

434
00:44:10,496 --> 00:44:12,964
Dispatch the Phocians to the goat path...

435
00:44:13,132 --> 00:44:17,660
...and pray to the gods
nobody tells the Persians about it.

436
00:44:23,376 --> 00:44:24,934
Earthquake.

437
00:44:25,478 --> 00:44:26,706
No, captain.

438
00:44:28,314 --> 00:44:30,248
Battle formations.

439
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,337
This is where we hold them.

440
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,774
This is where we fight!

441
00:45:00,346 --> 00:45:02,576
This is where they die!

442
00:45:02,915 --> 00:45:04,780
Earn these shields, boys!

443
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,011
Remember this day, men...

444
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:13,920
...for it will be yours for all time.

445
00:45:25,037 --> 00:45:26,800
Spartans!

446
00:45:26,973 --> 00:45:29,100
Lay down your weapons!

447
00:45:45,992 --> 00:45:48,256
Persians!

448
00:45:48,828 --> 00:45:50,887
Come and get them!

449
00:46:12,385 --> 00:46:14,012
Hold!

450
00:46:16,856 --> 00:46:18,414
Give them nothing...

451
00:46:18,858 --> 00:46:22,453
...but take from them everything!

452
00:46:24,163 --> 00:46:25,892
Steady!

453
00:46:36,676 --> 00:46:38,200
Push!

454
00:46:42,048 --> 00:46:44,448
Is that the best you can do?

455
00:46:46,652 --> 00:46:48,643
Push! Push!

456
00:46:58,731 --> 00:47:00,255
Now!

457
00:47:12,078 --> 00:47:13,568
Push!

458
00:47:57,123 --> 00:47:59,717
No prisoners!

459
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:01,788
No mercy!

460
00:49:21,107 --> 00:49:23,234
They look thirsty.

461
00:49:24,343 --> 00:49:27,278
Well, let's give them something to drink.

462
00:49:30,182 --> 00:49:32,844
To the cliffs.

463
00:49:56,475 --> 00:49:58,636
Halt.

464
00:50:00,746 --> 00:50:02,839
Hell of a good start.

465
00:50:25,504 --> 00:50:27,972
Tuck tail!

466
00:50:33,446 --> 00:50:35,004
Persian cowards.

467
00:50:42,788 --> 00:50:45,723
- What the hell are you laughing at?
- Well, you had to say it.

468
00:50:46,525 --> 00:50:50,188
- What?
- "Fight in the shade."

469
00:51:03,709 --> 00:51:05,643
Recover.

470
00:51:28,934 --> 00:51:31,562
Today no Spartan dies.

471
00:51:56,695 --> 00:51:58,128
Easy, son.

472
00:52:24,356 --> 00:52:26,324
We do what we were trained to do...

473
00:52:26,492 --> 00:52:27,959
...what we were bred to do...

474
00:52:28,127 --> 00:52:31,119
...what we were born to do.

475
00:52:38,504 --> 00:52:41,496
No prisoners. No mercy.

476
00:52:41,674 --> 00:52:43,141
A good start.

477
00:53:52,611 --> 00:53:55,876
- I was afraid you might not come.
- I'm sorry, my son is...

478
00:53:56,048 --> 00:54:01,645
Is doing what children do best.
Please, don't apologize.

479
00:54:02,655 --> 00:54:04,782
Your son starts the agoge next year.

480
00:54:05,391 --> 00:54:09,384
That is always a difficult time
for a Spartan mother.

481
00:54:10,496 --> 00:54:15,058
Yes, it will be hard. But also necessary.

482
00:54:17,503 --> 00:54:21,735
You will speak before the council
in two days' time.

483
00:54:23,609 --> 00:54:25,634
My husband does not have two days.

484
00:54:26,045 --> 00:54:28,013
Think of the two days as a gift.

485
00:54:30,082 --> 00:54:32,107
It's no secret...

486
00:54:32,284 --> 00:54:35,151
...Theron wants what you control.

487
00:54:35,321 --> 00:54:38,154
It's his voice you must silence.

488
00:54:38,324 --> 00:54:40,417
Make him your ally...

489
00:54:40,726 --> 00:54:43,286
...and you will have your victory.

490
00:54:44,096 --> 00:54:45,859
Thank you.

491
00:54:46,198 --> 00:54:48,598
You are wise as you are kind.

492
00:55:15,661 --> 00:55:17,424
There's your mother.

493
00:55:23,902 --> 00:55:27,338
You should keep a better eye on him
if he's to be king one day.

494
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:30,007
Be unfortunate if anything
were to happen to him.

495
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:33,375
Or to his beautiful mother.

496
00:55:49,411 --> 00:55:50,901
No!

497
00:55:54,149 --> 00:55:59,587
Our Greek comrades are begging
for a crack at the Persians, sire.

498
00:55:59,888 --> 00:56:01,219
Good.

499
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:04,154
I've got something
I think they can handle.

500
00:56:04,659 --> 00:56:06,354
Tell Daxos that I want him...

501
00:56:06,528 --> 00:56:11,056
...and 20 of his best eager, sober
and ready for the next charge.

502
00:56:11,233 --> 00:56:13,064
King Leonidas.

503
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:19,370
- Stelios, catch your breath, boy.
- Yes, milord.

504
00:56:20,008 --> 00:56:22,135
The Persians are approaching.

505
00:56:23,512 --> 00:56:27,380
A small contingent.
Too small for an attack.

506
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,680
- Captain, I leave you in charge.
- But sire...

507
00:56:34,856 --> 00:56:36,084
Relax, old friend.

508
00:56:36,258 --> 00:56:40,820
If they assassinate me,
all of Sparta goes to war.

509
00:56:41,763 --> 00:56:44,357
Pray they're that stupid.

510
00:56:45,467 --> 00:56:47,162
Pray...

511
00:56:47,702 --> 00:56:49,897
...we're that lucky.

512
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:54,804
Besides...

513
00:56:58,179 --> 00:57:01,512
...there's no reason we can't be civil...

514
00:57:01,815 --> 00:57:03,407
...is there?

515
00:57:04,752 --> 00:57:05,741
None, sire.

516
00:57:25,136 --> 00:57:27,366
Let me guess.

517
00:57:28,105 --> 00:57:31,097
You must be Xerxes.

518
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,315
Come, Leonidas.

519
00:57:46,757 --> 00:57:48,520
Let us reason together.

520
00:57:48,793 --> 00:57:50,761
It would be a regrettable waste...

521
00:57:51,162 --> 00:57:54,359
...it would be nothing short of madness
were you, brave king...

522
00:57:54,532 --> 00:57:57,729
...and your valiant troops to perish...

523
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:00,428
...all because of a simple
misunderstanding.

524
00:58:01,038 --> 00:58:03,871
- There's much our cultures could share.
- Havert you noticed?

525
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:06,441
We've been sharing our culture
with you all morning.

526
00:58:07,044 --> 00:58:09,308
Yours is a fascinating tribe.

527
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,641
Even now you are defiant...

528
00:58:11,816 --> 00:58:15,946
...in the face of annihilation
and the presence of a god.

529
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,145
It isn't wise to stand against me,
Leonidas.

530
00:58:18,823 --> 00:58:21,053
Imagine what a horrible fate
awaits my enemies...

531
00:58:21,225 --> 00:58:24,126
...when I would gladly kill
any of my own men for victory.

532
00:58:24,295 --> 00:58:26,923
And I would die for any one of mine.

533
00:58:27,098 --> 00:58:31,330
You Greeks take pride in your logic.
I suggest you employ it.

534
00:58:31,502 --> 00:58:35,063
Consider the beautiful land
you so vigorously defend.

535
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:37,730
Picture it reduced to ash at my whim.

536
00:58:37,975 --> 00:58:39,442
Consider the fate of your women.

537
00:58:40,044 --> 00:58:42,569
Clearly you don't know our women.

538
00:58:42,747 --> 00:58:46,274
I might as well have marched them up here,
judging by what I've seen.

539
00:58:47,385 --> 00:58:49,910
You have many slaves, Xerxes...

540
00:58:50,855 --> 00:58:53,153
...but few warriors.

541
00:58:53,324 --> 00:58:57,260
It won't be long
before they fear my spears...

542
00:58:57,662 --> 00:59:00,096
...more than your whips.

543
00:59:03,934 --> 00:59:06,801
It's not the lash they fear...

544
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,201
...it is my divine power.

545
00:59:11,942 --> 00:59:16,436
But I am a generous god.
I can make you rich beyond all measure.

546
00:59:16,881 --> 00:59:19,281
I will make you warlord of all Greece.

547
00:59:19,917 --> 00:59:23,819
You will carry my battle standard
to the heart of Europa.

548
00:59:23,988 --> 00:59:26,582
Your Athenian rivals...

549
00:59:26,891 --> 00:59:29,052
...will kneel at your feet...

550
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,558
...if you will but kneel at mine.

551
00:59:33,397 --> 00:59:35,661
You are generous...

552
00:59:36,233 --> 00:59:38,633
...as you are divine...

553
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:40,997
...O king of kings.

554
00:59:41,172 --> 00:59:45,074
Such an offer
only a madman would refuse.

555
00:59:45,676 --> 00:59:47,667
But the...

556
00:59:48,579 --> 00:59:51,412
The idea of kneeling, it's...

557
00:59:51,582 --> 00:59:56,110
You see, slaughtering
all those men of yours has...

558
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:00,121
Well, it's left a nasty cramp in my leg...

559
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:02,384
...so kneeling will be hard for me.

560
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:06,027
There will be no glory in your sacrifice.

561
01:00:06,197 --> 01:00:09,792
I will erase even the memory of Sparta
from the histories.

562
01:00:09,967 --> 01:00:13,164
Every piece of Greek parchment
shall be burned.

563
01:00:13,337 --> 01:00:16,670
Every Greek historian and every scribe
shall have their eyes put out...

564
01:00:16,841 --> 01:00:19,105
...and their tongues
cut from their mouths.

565
01:00:19,276 --> 01:00:25,272
Why, uttering the very name of Sparta
or Leonidas will be punishable by death.

566
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:29,181
The world will never know
you existed at all.

567
01:00:31,322 --> 01:00:35,918
The world will know
that free men stood against a tyrant.

568
01:00:36,127 --> 01:00:39,619
That few stood against many.

569
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:43,158
And before this battle was over...

570
01:00:43,434 --> 01:00:46,403
...that even a god-king can bleed.

571
01:00:53,778 --> 01:00:55,973
You fought well today...

572
01:00:57,314 --> 01:00:59,214
...for a woman.

573
01:01:00,384 --> 01:01:02,045
As did you.

574
01:01:02,219 --> 01:01:05,313
Maybe if I'm injured,
you'll be able to keep up with me.

575
01:01:05,823 --> 01:01:10,783
Perhaps I was so far ahead
you couldn't see me.

576
01:01:11,395 --> 01:01:14,592
More likely offering your backside
to the Thespians.

577
01:01:15,533 --> 01:01:17,160
Jealousy...

578
01:01:17,334 --> 01:01:19,825
...does not become you, my friend.

579
01:01:22,573 --> 01:01:24,905
Move it, men!

580
01:01:27,011 --> 01:01:29,241
Pile those Persians high.

581
01:01:32,383 --> 01:01:35,181
For unless I miss my guess...

582
01:01:35,753 --> 01:01:38,745
...we're in for one wild night.

583
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:07,845
They have served the dark will
of Persian kings for 500 years.

584
01:02:08,018 --> 01:02:10,350
Eyes as dark as night.

585
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:12,512
Teeth filed to fangs.

586
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:16,889
Soulless.

587
01:02:24,301 --> 01:02:29,068
The personal guard to King Xerxes himself.
The Persian warrior elite.

588
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:33,969
The deadliest fighting force in all of Asia:

589
01:02:34,745 --> 01:02:36,804
The Immortals.

590
01:02:45,022 --> 01:02:48,423
The god-king has betrayed a fatal flaw:

591
01:02:48,926 --> 01:02:50,689
Hubris.

592
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:55,694
Easy to taunt, easy to trick.

593
01:02:56,367 --> 01:02:58,801
Before wounds and weariness
have taken their toll...

594
01:02:58,969 --> 01:03:02,496
...the mad king
throws the best he has at us.

595
01:03:03,007 --> 01:03:04,702
Xerxes has taken the bait.

596
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:06,672
Spartans, push!

597
01:03:17,354 --> 01:03:18,946
Immortals.

598
01:03:19,423 --> 01:03:22,392
We put their name to the test.

599
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:08,003
Father!

600
01:05:53,677 --> 01:05:54,939
My king!

601
01:07:07,718 --> 01:07:09,686
Arcadians, now!

602
01:07:11,989 --> 01:07:14,753
Go! Show the Spartans what we can do.

603
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:16,792
Go!

604
01:07:26,203 --> 01:07:28,103
They shout and curse...

605
01:07:28,272 --> 01:07:31,469
...stabbing wildly,
more brawlers than warriors.

606
01:07:32,609 --> 01:07:35,169
They make a wondrous mess of things.

607
01:07:36,213 --> 01:07:38,977
Brave amateurs, they do their part.

608
01:08:26,597 --> 01:08:28,462
Immortals.

609
01:08:28,632 --> 01:08:31,226
They fail our king's test.

610
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:34,336
And a man who fancies himself a god...

611
01:08:35,072 --> 01:08:40,009
...feels a very human chill
crawl up his spine.

612
01:08:47,117 --> 01:08:49,244
To our king!

613
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:51,611
And our honored dead.

614
01:08:51,788 --> 01:08:54,586
Whom will Xerxes dare to send next?
Whom?!

615
01:08:54,925 --> 01:08:57,621
There's nothing that can stop us now!

616
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:02,022
Even the king allows himself
to hope for more than glory.

617
01:09:02,199 --> 01:09:05,532
Such mad hope, but there it is:

618
01:09:05,969 --> 01:09:11,373
"Against Asia's endless hordes,
against all odds, we can do it.

619
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:14,271
We can hold the Hot Gates.

620
01:09:14,444 --> 01:09:16,571
We can win."

621
01:09:24,154 --> 01:09:25,917
Dawn.

622
01:09:26,523 --> 01:09:30,550
Whips crack. Barbarians howl.

623
01:09:30,727 --> 01:09:34,629
Those behind cry, "Forward!"

624
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,300
Those in front cry, "Back!"

625
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:48,935
Our eyes bear witness
to the grotesque spectacle...

626
01:09:49,112 --> 01:09:53,208
...coughed forth from the darkest corner
of Xerxes' empire.

627
01:10:43,433 --> 01:10:44,957
When muscle failed...

628
01:10:45,402 --> 01:10:48,064
...they turned to their magic.

629
01:10:49,106 --> 01:10:53,907
One hundred nations descend upon us,
the armies of all Asia.

630
01:10:54,077 --> 01:10:58,537
Funneled into this narrow corridor,
their numbers count for nothing.

631
01:11:32,916 --> 01:11:34,884
They fall by the hundreds.

632
01:11:35,051 --> 01:11:40,648
We send the severed bodies
and the fragile hearts back to Xerxes' feet.

633
01:11:57,274 --> 01:12:01,438
King Xerxes is displeased
with his generals.

634
01:12:01,611 --> 01:12:04,171
He disciplines them.

635
01:12:21,064 --> 01:12:25,467
Xerxes dispatches his monsters
from half the world away.

636
01:12:36,446 --> 01:12:38,539
They're clumsy beasts...

637
01:12:38,715 --> 01:12:41,081
...and the piled Persian dead are slippery.

638
01:13:17,521 --> 01:13:19,955
- You still here?
- Somebody's gotta watch your back.

639
01:13:20,123 --> 01:13:21,715
Not now, I'm a little busy.

640
01:14:01,998 --> 01:14:04,523
Regroup!

641
01:14:07,737 --> 01:14:09,364
Astinos!

642
01:14:09,573 --> 01:14:11,268
My son!

643
01:14:20,216 --> 01:14:21,843
Astinos!

644
01:14:22,018 --> 01:14:24,782
No!

645
01:14:48,044 --> 01:14:50,171
Day wears on.

646
01:14:50,513 --> 01:14:52,674
We lose few...

647
01:14:52,849 --> 01:14:56,080
...but each felled is a friend,
or dearest blood.

648
01:14:58,288 --> 01:15:02,190
And upon seeing the headless body
of his own young son...

649
01:15:02,359 --> 01:15:04,224
...the captain breaks rank.

650
01:15:04,394 --> 01:15:07,830
He goes wild, blood-drunk.

651
01:15:32,455 --> 01:15:34,946
The captairs cries of pain
at the loss of his son...

652
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:38,856
...are more frightening to the enemy
than the deepest battle drums.

653
01:15:39,029 --> 01:15:43,022
It takes three men to restrain him
and bring him back to our own.

654
01:15:43,366 --> 01:15:45,698
The day is ours.

655
01:15:46,102 --> 01:15:48,764
No songs are sung.

656
01:16:28,878 --> 01:16:33,474
Your gods were cruel to shape you so,
friend Ephialtes.

657
01:16:35,885 --> 01:16:37,182
The Spartans, too...

658
01:16:37,921 --> 01:16:40,822
...were cruel to reject you.

659
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:46,094
But I am kind.

660
01:16:52,602 --> 01:16:54,729
Everything you could ever desire...

661
01:16:55,972 --> 01:16:57,735
...every happiness you can imagine...

662
01:16:59,943 --> 01:17:04,539
...every pleasure your fellow Greeks
and your false gods have denied you...

663
01:17:05,348 --> 01:17:07,612
...I will grant you.

664
01:17:08,885 --> 01:17:11,285
For I am kind.

665
01:17:25,235 --> 01:17:28,534
Embrace me as your king
and as your god.

666
01:17:29,672 --> 01:17:31,367
Yes.

667
01:17:32,842 --> 01:17:37,643
Lead my soldiers to the hidden path
that enters behind the cursed Spartans...

668
01:17:37,814 --> 01:17:40,078
...and your joys will be endless.

669
01:17:48,525 --> 01:17:51,688
Yes! I want it all.

670
01:17:52,128 --> 01:17:55,689
Wealth. Women.

671
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,395
And one more thing...

672
01:18:02,572 --> 01:18:05,234
...I want a uniform.

673
01:18:09,746 --> 01:18:11,441
Done.

674
01:18:13,082 --> 01:18:14,777
You will find...

675
01:18:15,385 --> 01:18:17,319
...I am kind.

676
01:18:18,454 --> 01:18:22,686
Unlike the cruel Leonidas,
who demanded that you stand...

677
01:18:24,794 --> 01:18:26,489
...I require only...

678
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:28,663
...that you kneel.

679
01:18:56,326 --> 01:18:58,260
Beautiful night.

680
01:18:59,696 --> 01:19:03,689
Yes, but I did not ask you here
for small talk, Theron.

681
01:19:04,334 --> 01:19:06,427
You can be sure of that.

682
01:19:07,837 --> 01:19:10,499
You never spared words with me.

683
01:19:11,074 --> 01:19:14,339
Can I offer you something?
A drink, perhaps?

684
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:16,341
Is it poison?

685
01:19:16,746 --> 01:19:19,510
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
it's only water.

686
01:19:29,292 --> 01:19:32,455
I'm told it's been arranged for you
to go before the council.

687
01:19:33,129 --> 01:19:34,858
Yes.

688
01:19:35,064 --> 01:19:38,397
I need your help in winning votes
to send the army north to our king.

689
01:19:38,968 --> 01:19:40,595
Yes.

690
01:19:41,271 --> 01:19:43,831
I can see it,
the two of us standing together.

691
01:19:44,007 --> 01:19:48,376
Me, politician. You, warrior.
Our voices as one.

692
01:19:49,712 --> 01:19:51,179
But why would I want to do that?

693
01:19:52,148 --> 01:19:56,107
It proves you care for a king who right now
fights for the very water we drink.

694
01:19:56,452 --> 01:19:58,044
True.

695
01:19:58,421 --> 01:20:01,049
But this is politics, not war.

696
01:20:01,357 --> 01:20:02,881
Leonidas is an idealist.

697
01:20:03,293 --> 01:20:07,229
I know your kind too well. You send men
to slaughter for your own gain.

698
01:20:07,397 --> 01:20:12,300
Your husband, our king,
has taken 300 of our finest to slaughter.

699
01:20:12,468 --> 01:20:17,098
He's broken our laws
and left without the council's consent.

700
01:20:17,607 --> 01:20:20,599
- I'm simply a realist.
- You're an opportunist.

701
01:20:21,577 --> 01:20:25,877
You're as foolish as Leonidas if you think
men don't have a price in this world.

702
01:20:26,049 --> 01:20:30,611
All men are not created equal.
That's the Spartan code, my little queen.

703
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:36,690
I admire your passion.

704
01:20:38,027 --> 01:20:39,756
But don't think that you...

705
01:20:40,196 --> 01:20:42,528
...a woman, even a queen...

706
01:20:42,699 --> 01:20:46,635
...can walk into the council chamber
and sway the minds of men.

707
01:20:46,803 --> 01:20:49,237
I own that chamber...

708
01:20:49,405 --> 01:20:51,464
...as if it were built with these hands.

709
01:20:55,945 --> 01:20:59,472
I could crush
the life out of you right now.

710
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:04,213
You will go before the council,
but your words will fall on deaf ears.

711
01:21:04,387 --> 01:21:10,155
Leonidas will receive no reinforcements,
and if he returns, without my help...

712
01:21:10,326 --> 01:21:13,295
...he will go to jail or worse.

713
01:21:17,033 --> 01:21:18,500
Do you love your Sparta?

714
01:21:19,002 --> 01:21:20,697
Yes.

715
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:23,134
- And your king?
- I do.

716
01:21:28,978 --> 01:21:32,675
Your husband fights for his land
and his love.

717
01:21:33,349 --> 01:21:35,647
What do you have to offer...

718
01:21:36,419 --> 01:21:39,388
...in return for my word
that I'll help you send our army north?

719
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:46,021
What does a realist want with his queen?

720
01:21:50,633 --> 01:21:52,362
I think you know.

721
01:22:06,816 --> 01:22:09,512
This will not be over quickly.

722
01:22:10,553 --> 01:22:13,044
You will not enjoy this.

723
01:22:13,589 --> 01:22:15,853
I'm not your king.

724
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:42,447
Dilios.

725
01:22:44,454 --> 01:22:48,481
I trust that scratch
hasn't made you useless?

726
01:22:48,658 --> 01:22:51,684
Hardly, my lord. It's just an eye.

727
01:22:51,861 --> 01:22:55,058
The gods saw fit to grace me
with a spare.

728
01:22:56,933 --> 01:22:58,867
My captain?

729
01:23:00,169 --> 01:23:03,969
Curses the gods and mourns alone.

730
01:23:05,942 --> 01:23:07,910
Leonidas!

731
01:23:09,112 --> 01:23:12,104
We are undone.
Undone, I tell you. Destroyed.

732
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:13,714
Daxos, calm yourself.

733
01:23:13,883 --> 01:23:17,478
Our hunchback traitor led Xerxes' lmmortals
to the hidden goat path behind us.

734
01:23:17,887 --> 01:23:20,720
The Phocians you posted there
were scattered without a fight.

735
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:26,123
- This battle is over, Leonidas.
- This battle is over when I say it is over.

736
01:23:26,295 --> 01:23:30,664
By morning, the lmmortals will surround us.
The Hot Gates will fall.

737
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:35,669
Spartans! Prepare for glory!

738
01:23:35,838 --> 01:23:39,035
Glory? Have you gone mad?

739
01:23:39,208 --> 01:23:40,766
There is no glory to be had now.

740
01:23:41,377 --> 01:23:44,972
Only retreat or surrender. Or death.

741
01:23:45,148 --> 01:23:48,311
Well, that's an easy choice
for us, Arcadian.

742
01:23:48,484 --> 01:23:53,979
Spartans never retreat.
Spartans never surrender.

743
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:56,683
Go spread the word.

744
01:23:56,926 --> 01:24:00,589
Let every Greek assembled
know the truth of this.

745
01:24:00,763 --> 01:24:03,596
Let each among them
search his own soul.

746
01:24:05,301 --> 01:24:09,431
And while you're at it, search your own.

747
01:24:16,946 --> 01:24:19,210
My men will leave with me.

748
01:24:24,554 --> 01:24:26,784
Godspeed, Leonidas.

749
01:24:33,095 --> 01:24:34,687
Children!

750
01:24:35,665 --> 01:24:36,996
Children.

751
01:24:38,034 --> 01:24:40,025
Gather round.

752
01:24:41,904 --> 01:24:45,169
No retreat, no surrender.

753
01:24:45,341 --> 01:24:49,209
That is Spartan law.

754
01:24:49,445 --> 01:24:54,508
And by Spartan law,
we will stand and fight...

755
01:24:54,684 --> 01:24:56,675
...and die.

756
01:25:00,122 --> 01:25:03,614
A new age has begun.

757
01:25:05,361 --> 01:25:08,489
An age of freedom.

758
01:25:09,565 --> 01:25:13,228
And all will know that 300 Spartans...

759
01:25:13,402 --> 01:25:16,667
...gave their last breath to defend it.

760
01:25:36,959 --> 01:25:38,722
My friend.

761
01:25:42,265 --> 01:25:47,828
I have lived my entire life
without regret until now.

762
01:25:51,207 --> 01:25:57,146
It's not that my son
gave up his life for his country.

763
01:25:59,048 --> 01:26:02,916
It's just that I never told him
that I loved him the most.

764
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,387
That he stood by me with honor.

765
01:26:08,824 --> 01:26:11,759
That he was all that was best in me.

766
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:23,395
My heart is broken for your loss.

767
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:25,835
Heart?

768
01:26:30,913 --> 01:26:34,007
I have filled my heart...

769
01:26:34,183 --> 01:26:35,912
...with hate.

770
01:26:40,056 --> 01:26:41,717
Good.

771
01:26:50,866 --> 01:26:52,697
Dilios...

772
01:26:54,403 --> 01:26:56,530
...let's take a walk.

773
01:26:58,007 --> 01:27:00,066
Yes, my lord.

774
01:27:02,478 --> 01:27:05,140
But, sire, I am fit and ready for battle.

775
01:27:05,314 --> 01:27:08,442
That you are, one of the finest.

776
01:27:08,751 --> 01:27:12,346
But you have another talent
unlike any other Spartan.

777
01:27:15,057 --> 01:27:18,493
You will deliver my final orders
to the council...

778
01:27:18,661 --> 01:27:21,152
...with force and verve.

779
01:27:23,666 --> 01:27:25,930
Tell them our story.

780
01:27:26,102 --> 01:27:30,630
Make every Greek know
what happened here.

781
01:27:31,474 --> 01:27:34,102
You'll have a grand tale to tell.

782
01:27:35,911 --> 01:27:37,606
A tale of victory.

783
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,838
Victory.

784
01:27:43,886 --> 01:27:45,877
Yes, my lord.

785
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,926
Sire, any message...?

786
01:27:56,799 --> 01:27:58,164
For the queen?

787
01:28:20,623 --> 01:28:23,057
None that need be spoken.

788
01:28:38,174 --> 01:28:40,574
Hundreds leave.

789
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:43,644
A handful stay.

790
01:28:48,818 --> 01:28:51,446
Only one looks back.

791
01:29:01,764 --> 01:29:03,959
Spartans!

792
01:29:05,034 --> 01:29:08,197
Ready your breakfast and eat hearty...

793
01:29:08,370 --> 01:29:12,306
...for tonight we dine in hell!

794
01:29:21,183 --> 01:29:23,845
May I give the floor now...

795
01:29:24,019 --> 01:29:28,456
...to the wife of Leonidas
and queen of Sparta.

796
01:29:40,169 --> 01:29:41,898
- What's this?
- This is nothing.

797
01:29:42,071 --> 01:29:43,902
Councilmen...

798
01:29:44,073 --> 01:29:47,839
...I stand before you
not only as your queen.

799
01:29:48,711 --> 01:29:51,441
I come to you as a mother.

800
01:29:52,715 --> 01:29:55,115
I come to you as a wife.

801
01:29:56,919 --> 01:29:59,444
I come to you as a Spartan woman.

802
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:07,554
I come to you with great humility.

803
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,400
I am not here to represent Leonidas.

804
01:30:13,569 --> 01:30:16,333
His actions speak louder
than my words ever could.

805
01:30:16,672 --> 01:30:19,072
I am here for all those voices
which cannot be heard.

806
01:30:19,241 --> 01:30:21,766
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons.

807
01:30:21,944 --> 01:30:24,913
Three hundred families
that bleed for our rights...

808
01:30:25,347 --> 01:30:28,544
...and for the very principles
this room was built upon.

809
01:30:29,151 --> 01:30:31,244
We are at war, gentlemen.

810
01:30:31,687 --> 01:30:34,212
We must send the entire Spartan army
to aid our king...

811
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:37,484
...in the preservation of not just ourselves,
but of our children.

812
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:41,188
Send the army
for the preservation of liberty.

813
01:30:41,363 --> 01:30:43,695
Send it for justice.

814
01:30:43,866 --> 01:30:45,493
Send it for law and order.

815
01:30:46,035 --> 01:30:48,230
Send it for reason.

816
01:30:48,404 --> 01:30:52,500
But most importantly,
send our army for hope.

817
01:30:52,675 --> 01:30:56,236
Hope that a king and his men have not
been wasted to the pages of history.

818
01:30:57,079 --> 01:31:00,515
That their courage bonds us together.

819
01:31:00,816 --> 01:31:04,013
That we are made stronger
by their actions...

820
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:09,116
...and that your choices today
reflect their bravery.

821
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:12,721
Three hundred.

822
01:31:15,064 --> 01:31:16,895
We must send them.

823
01:31:20,669 --> 01:31:22,500
Moving...

824
01:31:22,838 --> 01:31:25,739
...eloquent, passionate.

825
01:31:26,141 --> 01:31:30,305
But it doesn't change the fact
that your husband has brought war upon us.

826
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:32,913
You are wrong.
Xerxes brought it forth...

827
01:31:33,082 --> 01:31:35,550
...and before that,
his father Darius at Marathon.

828
01:31:35,718 --> 01:31:37,447
The Persians will not stop...

829
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:40,987
...until the only shelter we will find
is rubble and chaos.

830
01:31:41,390 --> 01:31:45,121
This chamber needs no
history lesson, my queen.

831
01:31:45,628 --> 01:31:47,823
Then what is the lesson
you would like to leave?

832
01:31:47,997 --> 01:31:50,090
Shall I begin to enumerate all of them?

833
01:31:50,499 --> 01:31:53,935
Honor. Duty. Glory.

834
01:31:54,203 --> 01:31:59,231
You speak of honor, duty and glory?

835
01:32:00,542 --> 01:32:01,770
But what of adultery?

836
01:32:01,944 --> 01:32:04,412
- How dare you.
- How dare I?

837
01:32:04,847 --> 01:32:07,839
Watch her carefully.

838
01:32:08,017 --> 01:32:10,986
She is a trickster in true form.

839
01:32:11,153 --> 01:32:14,316
Do not play with the members
of this sacred chamber, my queen.

840
01:32:14,490 --> 01:32:17,584
Just hours ago,
you offered yourself to me.

841
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:22,197
Were I a weaker man,
I would have her scent on me still.

842
01:32:22,364 --> 01:32:25,356
- This is outrage.
- Oh, the hypocrite speaks!

843
01:32:25,534 --> 01:32:28,526
Did you not receive a similar payment,
which you took...

844
01:32:28,704 --> 01:32:31,935
...in exchange for her having an audience
with these noble men?

845
01:32:32,107 --> 01:32:33,870
- That is a lie.
- Is it?

846
01:32:34,043 --> 01:32:37,809
Was he not, by your invitation,
asked to come to the king's bedchamber?

847
01:32:38,347 --> 01:32:42,977
The very bed where you attempted
to negotiate with me so vigorously?

848
01:32:45,621 --> 01:32:49,079
You look shocked.
A bribe of the flesh, gentlemen...

849
01:32:49,258 --> 01:32:52,557
...while her husband
promotes anarchy and war.

850
01:32:55,497 --> 01:32:56,691
He speaks truth.

851
01:32:57,299 --> 01:33:00,496
Words escape
even the most cunning tongue...

852
01:33:00,669 --> 01:33:02,728
...my little whore queen.

853
01:33:07,476 --> 01:33:09,307
What queen-like behavior.

854
01:33:11,013 --> 01:33:14,141
Remove her from this chamber
before she infects us further...

855
01:33:14,316 --> 01:33:17,308
...with her inglorious and shabby self.

856
01:33:24,126 --> 01:33:25,718
This will not be over quickly.

857
01:33:27,062 --> 01:33:30,589
You will not enjoy this.
I am not your queen.

858
01:33:52,755 --> 01:33:54,689
Traitor.

859
01:33:55,224 --> 01:34:00,025
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!

860
01:34:00,295 --> 01:34:02,559
Traitor!

861
01:34:39,601 --> 01:34:45,597
Leonidas, my compliments
and congratulations.

862
01:34:45,774 --> 01:34:49,437
You surely have turned calamity
into victory.

863
01:34:49,611 --> 01:34:52,603
Despite your insufferable arrogance...

864
01:34:52,781 --> 01:34:56,945
...the god-king has come
to admire Spartan valor and fighting skill.

865
01:34:57,686 --> 01:34:59,051
You will make a mighty ally.

866
01:34:59,221 --> 01:35:00,950
Yield, Leonidas.

867
01:35:02,124 --> 01:35:04,991
Use your reason. Think of your men.

868
01:35:07,830 --> 01:35:09,457
I beg you.

869
01:35:10,032 --> 01:35:12,000
Listen to your fellow Greek.

870
01:35:12,167 --> 01:35:15,864
He can attest
to the divine one's generosity.

871
01:35:16,038 --> 01:35:20,498
Despite your several insults,
despite your horrid blasphemies...

872
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:24,607
...the lord of hosts
is prepared to forgive all...

873
01:35:24,847 --> 01:35:27,873
...and more, to reward your service.

874
01:35:28,150 --> 01:35:29,481
You fight for your lands.

875
01:35:30,185 --> 01:35:32,016
Keep them.

876
01:35:32,721 --> 01:35:34,689
You fight for Sparta.

877
01:35:34,857 --> 01:35:38,850
She will be wealthier and more powerful
than ever before.

878
01:35:39,061 --> 01:35:40,995
You fight for your kingship.

879
01:35:41,897 --> 01:35:44,866
You will be proclaimed warlord
of all Greece...

880
01:35:45,033 --> 01:35:49,333
...answerable only
to the one true master of the world.

881
01:35:49,705 --> 01:35:54,438
Leonidas, your victory will be complete...

882
01:35:54,610 --> 01:35:57,204
...if you but lay down your arms...

883
01:35:57,379 --> 01:36:00,542
...and kneel to holy Xerxes.

884
01:36:31,046 --> 01:36:35,983
It's been more than 30 years
since the wolf in the winter cold.

885
01:36:36,151 --> 01:36:40,713
And now, as then,
it's not fear that grips him...

886
01:36:40,889 --> 01:36:46,054
...only restlessness.
A heightened sense of things.

887
01:36:46,828 --> 01:36:51,629
The seaborne breeze coolly kissing
the sweat at his chest and neck.

888
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,290
Gulls cawing...

889
01:36:53,468 --> 01:36:57,700
...complaining even as they feast
on the thousands of floating dead.

890
01:36:59,308 --> 01:37:04,371
The steady breathing
of the 300 at his back...

891
01:37:05,147 --> 01:37:08,605
...ready to die for him
without a moment's pause.

892
01:37:11,219 --> 01:37:12,584
Every one of them...

893
01:37:14,056 --> 01:37:15,990
...ready to die.

894
01:37:31,506 --> 01:37:34,441
His helmet is stifling.

895
01:37:55,130 --> 01:37:57,963
His shield is heavy.

896
01:38:05,574 --> 01:38:06,939
Your spear.

897
01:38:15,751 --> 01:38:17,184
You there...

898
01:38:17,619 --> 01:38:19,610
...Ephialtes.

899
01:38:24,726 --> 01:38:26,990
May you live forever.

900
01:38:34,403 --> 01:38:36,701
Leonidas, your spear.

901
01:39:43,939 --> 01:39:45,531
Stelios!

902
01:39:55,550 --> 01:39:57,142
Slaughter them!

903
01:40:00,522 --> 01:40:02,114
His helmet was stifling.

904
01:40:02,290 --> 01:40:05,418
It narrowed his vision,
and he must see far.

905
01:40:06,728 --> 01:40:10,596
His shield was heavy.
It threw him off balance...

906
01:40:10,765 --> 01:40:14,428
...and his target is far away.

907
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,562
The old ones say we Spartans
are descended from Hercules himself.

908
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:29,374
Bold Leonidas gives testament
to our bloodline.

909
01:41:29,544 --> 01:41:33,674
His roar is long and loud.

910
01:42:03,778 --> 01:42:05,370
My king.

911
01:42:17,626 --> 01:42:21,255
It's an honor to die at your side.

912
01:42:22,831 --> 01:42:27,325
It's an honor to have lived at yours.

913
01:42:48,256 --> 01:42:50,349
My queen!

914
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:00,329
My wife.

915
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:13,577
My love.

916
01:45:39,994 --> 01:45:42,121
"Remember us."

917
01:45:43,798 --> 01:45:47,234
As simple an order as a king can give.

918
01:45:48,803 --> 01:45:52,000
"Remember why we died."

919
01:45:54,008 --> 01:45:58,035
For he did not wish tribute or song...

920
01:45:59,881 --> 01:46:04,079
...nor monuments,
nor poems of war and valor.

921
01:46:06,955 --> 01:46:09,253
His wish was simple.

922
01:46:14,629 --> 01:46:16,688
"Remember us"...

923
01:46:17,732 --> 01:46:19,461
...he said to me.

924
01:46:21,135 --> 01:46:23,330
That was his hope.

925
01:46:23,538 --> 01:46:27,269
Should any free soul
come across that place...

926
01:46:28,042 --> 01:46:31,375
...in all the countless
centuries yet to be...

927
01:46:31,813 --> 01:46:34,373
...may all our voices...

928
01:46:34,549 --> 01:46:38,610
...whisper to you
from the ageless stones.

929
01:46:39,587 --> 01:46:43,216
Go tell the Spartans, passerby...

930
01:46:43,558 --> 01:46:49,428
...that here, by Spartan law, we lie.

931
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,896
And so my king died...

932
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:58,398
...and my brothers died...

933
01:47:00,775 --> 01:47:03,243
...barely a year ago.

934
01:47:07,181 --> 01:47:12,414
Long I pondered my king's
cryptic talk of victory.

935
01:47:12,654 --> 01:47:15,282
Time has proven him wise.

936
01:47:16,190 --> 01:47:19,216
For from free Greek to free Greek...

937
01:47:19,394 --> 01:47:23,990
...the word was spread
that bold Leonidas and his 300...

938
01:47:24,165 --> 01:47:26,156
...so far from home...

939
01:47:26,334 --> 01:47:29,735
...laid down their lives
not just for Sparta...

940
01:47:29,904 --> 01:47:33,704
...but for all Greece
and the promise this country holds.

941
01:47:34,609 --> 01:47:39,672
Now, here on this rugged patch of earth
called Plataea...

942
01:47:39,847 --> 01:47:44,841
...Xerxes' hordes face obliteration!

943
01:47:46,521 --> 01:47:49,922
Just there the barbarians huddle...

944
01:47:50,091 --> 01:47:54,960
...sheer terror gripping tight their hearts...

945
01:47:55,129 --> 01:47:57,029
...with icy fingers...

946
01:47:57,198 --> 01:48:00,429
...knowing full well
what merciless horrors they suffered...

947
01:48:00,602 --> 01:48:03,127
...at the swords and spears of 300.

948
01:48:04,539 --> 01:48:10,102
Yet they stare now across the plain
at 10,000 Spartans...

949
01:48:10,278 --> 01:48:13,577
...commanding 30,000 free Greeks!

950
01:48:20,388 --> 01:48:24,290
The enemy outnumber us
a paltry three to one.

951
01:48:24,592 --> 01:48:26,583
Good odds for any Greek.

952
01:48:27,295 --> 01:48:31,994
This day, we rescue a world
from mysticism and tyranny...

953
01:48:32,166 --> 01:48:36,535
...and usher in a future
brighter than anything we can imagine.

954
01:48:40,975 --> 01:48:42,465
Give thanks, men...

955
01:48:43,177 --> 01:48:46,943
...to Leonidas and the brave 300.

956
01:48:47,115 --> 01:48:49,845
To victory!

957
01:56:29,242 --> 01:56:31,233
