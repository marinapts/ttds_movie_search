<i>When I was young,</i>
<i>I thought house painters painted houses.</i>

16
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:44,166
<i>What did I know?</i>

17
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,125
<i>I was a working guy.</i>

18
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:50,041
<i>A business agent for Teamster Local 107</i>

19
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,583
<i>out of South Philly.</i>

20
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,208
One of a thousand working stiffs...

21
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,583
until I wasn't no more.

22
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,625
And then...

23
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,666
I started painting houses...

24
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:07,916
myself.

25
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,208
<i>In this particular matter,</i>

26
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,833
<i>the whole thing was built
around the wedding.</i>

27
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:34,375
Bill Bufalino's daughter
was getting married in Detroit.

28
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,583
Bill was a Teamster lawyer,
but more important,

29
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,625
he was Russell Bufalino's cousin.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,458
<i>Now, Russell didn't want to fly,</i>

31
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,666
<i>so I was gonna drive him to the wedding.</i>

32
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,625
<i>He wanted to take care of
some business along the way,</i>

33
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,708
<i>which in Russell's case
meant only one thing:</i>

34
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,166
<i>Money... collecting it.</i>

35
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,666
<i>So we'd drive.</i>

36
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,875
<i>Him and his wife Carrie
and me and my wife Irene.</i>

37
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,791
<i>Or I call her Reenie.</i>

38
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,833
<i>I figured we would take 476 out of Philly,</i>

39
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,416
<i>and then we go up to Pittston</i>

40
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,666
<i>and pick up Russ,
which is usually how we did it,</i>

41
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,416
<i>and then Interstate 80 West</i>

42
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,083
<i>through the rest of Pennsylvania,</i>

43
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,875
<i>and then we'd go across Ohio,
all the way to Toledo,</i>

44
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,500
<i>and then we would go 75 North to Detroit.</i>

45
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,166
<i>It was gonna take about three days</i>

46
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,375
<i>with all the business breaks
and cigarette stops,</i>

47
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,625
<i>since Russell didn't allow
nobody to smoke in the car.</i>

48
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,500
<i>He says Jimmy Blue Eyes and Meyer Lansky</i>

49
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,333
<i>convinced him to stop smoking
when they were getting kicked out</i>

50
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,458
<i>of their casinos in Cuba
and getting shot at by Castro.</i>

51
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,166
<i>I don't know.
It might have been one of those,</i>

52
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,541
<i>"Please-God-if-I-ever-get-out-

<i>I'll-never-smoke-again things too."</i>

54
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,708
<i>But I do know that from Castro on,</i>

55
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,125
<i>Russ wouldn't allow
nobody to smoke in his car,</i>

56
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,583
<i>not even Carrie.</i>

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Can we stop soon?

58
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,000
We're only in the car two minutes, honey.

59
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,000
We're not even near the highway.

60
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,041
I know, Russell.
But you don't like to stop on the highway.

61
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,333
Well, it's not that so much.

62
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,916
They don't <i>let</i> you stop on the highway.

63
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,250
Okay, so then we'll smoke in the car.

64
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,958
And what about my cataracts?

65
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,500
I'll crack the window.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,291
Carrie, I made a vow.
Remember?

67
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,791
Remember I made a vow, Carrie?

68
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,291
Yeah,
now I can't smoke on...

69
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,791
All right, and now I can't smoke.

70
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,458
See where we are?

71
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,958
Is... Is that...

72
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,125
What are those odds?

73
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,000
What's the problem, kid?

74
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,375
I don't... I don't know. It sounds funny.

75
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,791
It stops, it starts, it loses power.

76
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,916
Let me see if I can give you a hand.

77
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:47,416
Let me see.
Check all these plugs.

78
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,916
Spark plugs are okay.

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,875
The distributor cap's okay.

80
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:53,791
Good.

81
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,291
It's gotta be something with...
with this.

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,666
Uh-oh. Timing chain.

83
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,875
This is what this is. There's a cap on it.

84
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,583
This cap is loose.
It ain't supposed to be loose.

85
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,583
So that means they're getting worn out.

86
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,750
You just gotta...

87
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,333
Try that now. Tighten it up.

88
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,291
Huh?

89
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,583
I can drive 'em. I can't fix 'em.

90
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,375
You're back in business, kid.

91
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,666
Thanks.

92
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,333
- I owe you anything?
- No.

93
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,333
No, you don't owe me anything.

00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,375

00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,625
Where you from?

98
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,416
- Philly.
- Oh, you're from Philly.

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,541
- Yeah.
- Ah.

Where you hang out there?

101
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,708
Callahan's.

102
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,375
Bocce Club. But it's a bar,
it's not a bocce club.

103
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,833
Oh, yeah. You play bocce?

104
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,041
- Nah.
- Oh.

105
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,041
All right, Frankie... get that fixed.

106
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,541
Because it'll go again on you,
I'm telling you.

107
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,625
- Thank you.
- All right.

108
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,750
- I will. Thanks again.
- Good luck, buddy.

109
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,166
I mean,
I thought maybe he owned the gas station.

110
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,541
'Cause he owned something, you could tell.

111
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,666
Yeah, it turns out
he owned the whole road.

He shylocks

I don't go near Choice.
I only do Prime. That's it.

161
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,666
Can I get some more for next Tuesday?

162
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,291
How many you want?

163
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,000
At least five.

164
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,833
Okay. Five, you got.

165
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,375
- Amen.
- Amen.

166
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,000
What the fuck is this?

167
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
Tony, I don't...

168
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,166
- What the fuck is this, Frank?
- I don't... I don't know.

169
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,291
I mean...

170
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,625
I don't load the truck.

171
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,250
The loaders
are supposed to load the truck.

172
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,916
Maybe they didn't do their work.
I don't know.

173
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You didn't realize you were
driving a light horse?

174
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,041
No. I just... Nothing. It felt fine.

175
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, come on, Frank. Come on.

176
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,458
I'm telling you. I...

177
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,291
God's truth.
I just don't know what happened.

178
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,000
I don't know. Maybe some...

179
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,541
- It's empty.
- I know it is.

180
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,041
I know it is.

181
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,750
What are you guys looking at?
Go back to work.

182
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,791
All of youse!

183
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,291
What am I gonna tell the boss?

184
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,208
Well, I'm telling you
that I don't know what's going on.

185
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,000
Just don't look at me
'cause I, you know...

186
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,041
Well, who else can I look at?
This is not gonna be on me, Frank.

187
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,166
I'm telling you right now.

188
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,750
Me, I just drive the truck.
That's all I do.

189
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,208
Okay, Frank Sheeran.
Am I saying that right?

190
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,708
Yeah, you said right.

191
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:06,166
Uh, under the contract,
thanks to Jimmy Hoffa...

192
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,708
management can only fire a driver
on very specific charges.

193
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,125
- So, you ever show up late?
- No.

194
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,958
- Do you have any moving violations?
- No.

195
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,791
- Do you drink on the job?
- No.

196
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,125
You ever hit anybody?

197
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,666
- On the job?
- Yeah.

198
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,375
- No.
- Okay.

199
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,666
What about stealing, that ain't grounds?

200
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,250
Well...

201
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,250
can they prove it?

202
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,625
I don't think so.

203
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,333
All right then, we don't have
nothing to worry about.

204
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,541
If they can prove it,

205
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,708
they're just gonna want names from you.
Accomplices.

206
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,875
That's all. You give them
a couple of names, you go home.

207
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,458
Keep your job.

208
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,666
What do you think about that?

209
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,708
- Would you give them names?
- No. No names.

210
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,000
You know, I don't, uh...

211
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,708
I don't care whether you did it or not.

212
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,416
That makes no difference to me.

213
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,041
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm here to defend you. Right?

214
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,083
Right.

215
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,666
What, you want to know if I did it or not?

216
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,791
Well...

217
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,208
I'm gonna defend you either way.

218
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,500
Yeah, all right, but...

219
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,958
I, I work hard for them
when I ain't stealing from 'em.

220
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,833
Your Honor,
if this was about right or wrong,

221
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,333
the company would have
sought Mr. Sheeran's dismissal.

222
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,416
They didn't.

223
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,125
They only accused Mr. Sheeran

224
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,541
because the company hoped
he could name conspirators,

225
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,791
which he couldn't do
because they don't exist.

226
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,625
They don't exist
because he didn't steal anything.

227
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:42,250
He didn't steal anything
because he's an exemplary employee,

228
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,666
who in eight years
has never taken a day of sick leave.

229
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,375
The only rule he ever broke
is his own union's,

230
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,708
by helping others
carry sides of beef from his truck

231
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,541
to their refrigerators
in the dead of winter.

232
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,583
All rise.

233
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,666
Court is in session.

234
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,875
I'm dismissing this case
with a warning.

235
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,333
Yes, Your Honor.

236
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,750
No, no, not you, Mr. Sheeran.

237
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,375
You bring another working man
before this court

238
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,375
with threats instead of evidence,

239
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,750
believe me, you'll be sorry.

240
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,250
If I owned stock in this company,
I would sell it.

241
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,125
<i>I don't know how he did it,</i>
<i>and I ain't gonna ask.</i>

242
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,708
<i>All I know is that Bill Bufalino
got me out of a case</i>

243
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,250
<i>where I should never
have gotten away with it.</i>

244
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,583
<i>I should've been down for the count.</i>

245
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,916
People are gonna appreciate
what you did today, Frank.

246
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,041
You know, they got families,
they got kids.

247
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,416
They need those jobs.

248
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,500
<i>Instead,</i>
<i>we went out celebrating...</i>

249
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,791
Russell!

250
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,416
<i>...and I met</i>
<i>what was gonna turn out to be</i>

251
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
<i>the rest of my life.</i>

252
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,791
You know, I thought that was you
walking in outside.

253
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,416
Yeah, yeah, you know,
this is our place.

254
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,750
Can I introduce you to this new guy Frank?

255
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,166
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

256
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,791
Frank, I want you to meet
my cousin Russell Bufalino.

257
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,541
- How are ya?
- Hi, nice to meet you.

258
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,625
You helped me with my truck
a couple of months ago.

259
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,958
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
The timing chain.

260
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,750
- Yeah.
- Did you get it fixed?

261
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,500
- I fixed it the next day, yeah.
- Attaboy.

262
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,583
- Thanks again.
- Oh, you're welcome.

263
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,166
My pleasure. I'm glad you fixed it.

264
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,208
You better watch.

265
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,458
There's a lot of tough guys around here.
Did he tell ya?

266
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,375
You're not afraid of tough guys, are ya?

267
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,291
No.

268
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,416
I didn't think so. I'll see you around.

269
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,583
- Okay.
- Thanks, Russell.

270
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,583
Your cousin saved my ass.

271
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,375
I could've lost the whole load.

272
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah, yeah. Well, he knows
everything about trucks, really.

273
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,916
Yeah, he worked at Canada Dry
for a long time.

274
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,166
- Vito, how are you?
- Pleasure.

275
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,958
I think, uh... Let's take the booth.

276
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,666
Come on. You're gonna love this.

277
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,041
<i>Maybe I didn't know</i>

278
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,500
<i>who Russell Bufalino was back then,</i>

279
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,791
<i>but I'd seen enough pictures and stories
in the newspapers</i>

280
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,875
<i>to know he was eatin' with Angelo Bruno.</i>

281
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:48,333
<i>I mean, Bruno, he... he was just made
the new boss of Philadelphia.</i>

282
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,208
<i>He took care of everything
from Philadelphia to Atlantic City.</i>

283
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,458
<i>That, I knew.</i>

284
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,083
<i>And that was all I had to know</i>

285
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,666
<i>to know that Russell Bufalino</i>

286
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,540
<i>was no truck mechanic from Canada Dry.</i>

287
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,958
This bread is very good.

288
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,125
Good, eh?

289
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,958
Where did an Irisher like you
learn to speak Italian?

290
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,375
In Italy - the war.

291
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,583
Ah. Where?

292
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,540
Salerno.

293
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:29,833
Anzio.

294
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,375
Sicily...

295
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,708
around Catania.

296
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,708
Catania? I'm from Catania.

297
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:40,208
Yeah? I thought you had
an accent like Catania.

298
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,666
How long were you in the war?

299
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,666
Four years.

300
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,208
411 days in combat...

301
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,875
122 at Anzio.

302
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,375
Forty-fifth Infantry.

303
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,833
<i>Minchia.</i>

304
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,208
- Yeah. Yeah.
<i>- Minchia.</i>

305
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,291
Were you afraid of dying?

306
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,750
Always afraid.

307
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:13,000
And don't let anybody
tell you that they weren't afraid.

308
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,125
- That's a lot of bullshit. You know?
- Yeah.

309
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,458
Everybody's afraid.
And you pray a lot.

310
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,583
I prayed a lot.

311
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,208
I prayed that I'd never sin again
as long as I live

312
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,875
if I could just get out of here.

313
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,041
But then the fighting starts
and then you forget about everything.

314
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,333
You're just trying to survive,
stay alive.

315
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,375
Once I saw
that I was getting through the war,

316
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,416
I looked around me, I said...

317
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,583
I said, "From now on,
whatever happens, happens."

318
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,833
<i>Che successe successe.</i>
Fuck it.

319
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,500
You know, you got orders, you follow them.

320
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,458
They tell you to bring some prisoners
into... into the woods,

321
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,625
you know,
and they don't tell you what to do...

322
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,833
But they just say, you know, "Hurry up."

323
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,416
<i>It's crazy, but I never understood</i>

324
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,791
<i>how they would just keep digging</i>

325
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,416
<i>their own graves, you know. I mean...</i>

326
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,625
Stop!

327
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,250
<i>Raus!</i>

328
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,875
<i>Well, I mean,</i>
<i>maybe they thought if they did a good job,</i>

329
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,458
<i>the guy with the gun</i>

330
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,583
<i>would change his mind.</i>

331
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,250
<i>Russell,</i>
<i>he... he took a shine to me right away.</i>

332
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,750
<i>After a while,</i>

333
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,250
<i>he started giving me little things to do.</i>

334
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,333
<i>But then Angelo himself,</i>

335
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,541
<i>he started giving me
little things to do too.</i>

336
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,041
<i>Russ's wife, Carrie, her family</i>

337
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,958
<i>goes all the way back, way, way back</i>

338
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,708
<i>to the same town in Sicily
as the Bufalinos.</i>

339
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,625
<i>They talked about it all the time.</i>

340
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,750
<i>She came from mob royalty,
if you want to call it that.</i>

341
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,958
<i>To them,
it was like they came over on the...</i>

342
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,041
<i>the Italian Mayflower.</i>

343
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,875
Why don't you go upstairs, wash up.

344
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,333
Give me those clothes.
I'll get rid of them.

345
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,166
Don't forget your shoes, Russell.

346
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,666
Hey, Frank,

347
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,708
can we stop soon?

348
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,250
Yeah, yeah,
well, ask your husband. Russell?

349
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,333
He's out cold.

350
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,708
No, no, I got it.

351
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:26,875
- Sure?
- Yeah.

352
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,500
Where are we?

353
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,833
We're close to Lewisburg.

354
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,833
Let me know when we get there.
Remind me.

355
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,041
- I got some stops to make.
- Okay.

356
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,458
<i>Russell had a piece of everything.</i>

357
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:02,041
<i>He had this store in Pittston
called Penn Drape &amp; Curtains.</i>

358
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,958
<i>And he ran everything out of there.</i>

359
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,583
<i>Who knew what it all was?</i>

360
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,458
<i>I mean, I'm sure the man had partners.</i>

361
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,291
<i>They always have partners.</i>

362
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,083
<i>Nobody keeps all the money.</i>

363
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,125
<i>But everybody listened to Russ.
That I can tell you.</i>

364
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,875
<i>You wanted to bribe a judge,
you asked Russell.</i>

365
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,291
<i>You didn't know how much to bribe him,</i>

366
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,125
<i>Russell was gonna tell you.</i>

367
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,333
All right, all right.
Uh, I'll be right there.

368
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,125
Come on. I'll take care of it.
Don't worry about it.

369
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,791
<i>You want to promote</i>
<i>one of your guys,</i>

370
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,583
<i>Russ would tell you
you could or you could not.</i>

371
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:36,833
Do me a favor.

372
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,500
Go with Steve down to his place.
Take Vito with you.

373
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:40,791
And just hang around for a while.

374
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,958
These guys keep coming around,
so straighten them out.

375
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,416
- I'll take care of it, Russ.
- Okay.

376
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,583
- Thank you.
- No problem.

377
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:46,791
Where's... Oh, here you are.

378
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:47,708
I'm right here.

379
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,666
<i>You want</i>
<i>to make somebody disappear,</i>

380
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,458
<i>you got to get Russell's permission.</i>

381
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,291
<i>You know, no two ways about it.</i>

382
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,208
- No, I wasn't worried.
- I didn't think so.

383
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,958
- Tell your father I said "Hi."
- I'll tell him. Thanks.

384
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,666
What are you doing here?
I just told Bruno.

385
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,750
You gotta go with Bruno.

386
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,416
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way.
- Yeah. Take care.

387
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,416
<i>And when you did something</i>
<i>for Russ,</i>

388
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,208
<i>you did it yourself.</i>

389
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,083
<i>Like Russ used to say...</i>

390
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,666
<i>When I ask somebody</i>
<i>to take care of something for me,</i>

391
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,833
I expect them
to take care of it themselves.

392
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,250
I don't need two roads coming back to me.

393
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:23,500
<i>When Anastasia</i>
<i>got killed in the barbershop,</i>

394
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:26,625
<i>it was Russell they brought in
to calm things down,</i>

395
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:29,416
<i>so that everybody
wasn't just going around killing everybody</i>

396
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,916
<i>and it could all get straightened out.</i>

397
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,250
We know what happened.

398
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,333
We can't change it. It is what it is.

399
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:39,291
Please tell my friend I'm happy to help.

400
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,958
<i>You'd never know it</i>
<i>by looking at this guy,</i>

401
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:44,958
<i>but all roads led back to Russ.</i>

402
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,958
Where's the money?

403
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,583
- He don't have it.
- He don't have it?

404
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,500
He said something about his mother...

405
00:24:58,583 --> 00:24:59,583
Stop. Don't tell me.

406
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,666
Let me guess.

407
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,541
His mother died
and the funeral set him back.

408
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:06,333
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

409
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:07,791
His fucking mother's...

410
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,958
fucking dying over and over
for the last ten years.

411
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:13,333
What do I do?

412
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:14,750
Don't leave.

413
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,458
Here.

414
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:30,833
Just show it to him. Don't use it.

415
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:50,000
Hey. Look.

416
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,083
Hey, Frank.

417
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,250
Skinny wants to see you.
You get in the car.

418
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,708
- I was just gonna go see him.
- Get in the fucking car.

419
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,041
- I was just gonna...
- Get in the fucking car!

420
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,041
- I was just gonna go see him!
- Yeah, don't get cute with me.

421
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,416
You give me that bullshit
about your mother.

422
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,625
Get in the fucking car!

423
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:05,958
Frank, I swear to God,
I was just gonna...

424
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,625
Get in the fucking car!

425
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,750
You want to get cute with me?

426
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,500
All that fucking bullshit
about your mother

427
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,375
and sick and all that and dying.

428
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:18,708
I swear,
I was just gonna go see him.

429
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:19,625
You'll see him right now.

430
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,375
I swear to God,
I was gonna come see you tomorrow.

431
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:22,958
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow. I swear to God.

432
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,916
Tomorrow. Here.

433
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
- What time?
- What time do you want me?

434
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,250
One o'clock? I'll be here at 1:00.

435
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,333
One o'clock? What, are you sleeping in?

436
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:31,041
You tell me.

437
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:32,958
Ten o'clock. Here.

438
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,291
- Ten o'clock. Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

439
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,166
Swear on your mother.
Swear on your mother!

440
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,000
- Swear on your mother!
- I swear on my mother!

441
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:39,916
I swear on my mother!

442
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,333
What time you gonna be here tomorrow?

443
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,000
- I'll be here at ten o'clock.
- Ten o'clock?

444
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:45,250
- Tomorrow. Here.
- Yeah. Yeah.

445
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,333
I'll bring you the money tomorrow.
The whole thing.

446
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:48,416
Get him out of here.

447
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:50,791
Get out of here.

448
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:53,416
I swear to God, I'll be here.
How am I supposed to get home?

449
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,166
- Get out of here.
- Take the fucking bus!

450
00:26:58,041 --> 00:26:59,541
Let his mother pick him up.

451
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:11,791
What's the matter with her?

452
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:13,625
Nothing.
She knocked something over

453
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:16,416
at the grocery store and made a mess,

454
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
- and the grocer yelled at her.
- He yelled at her?

455
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,958
Yeah, and he shoved her.

456
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,125
He shoved her?

457
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,291
Yeah.

458
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,333
Did he shove you?

459
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:27,083
Who was this? The guy at the store?

460
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:29,041
The grocery store on the corner? Joe?

461
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:33,666
Did he?

462
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:35,958
Honey, did he shove you?

463
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:39,750
Just answer me. Did he push you?

464
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:42,125
Did he shove you?
Whatever it is, did he do that?

465
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:43,791
Let's go.

466
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:47,875
Frank.

467
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,458
Frank, he didn't mean it, the man.
It just happened.

468
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:51,541
What do you mean,
he didn't mean it?

469
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:52,875
He touched her.
What, are you kidding me?

470
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:54,708
He has no right to push her. Touch her.

471
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:56,916
Not even put one pinky on her.

472
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,250
That's him, right?

473
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:06,541
Stay here. Stay here.

474
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:12,625
Frank, I'm sorry,
but your kid was out of line.

475
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,458
- I only did what...
- You touched my daughter?

476
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:21,666
God, I'm sorry.

477
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:23,708
No. Please. No, no, Frank.

478
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:25,750
Frank, please, please, please. No.

479
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,291
No, no, Frank! No!

480
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,208
- Take that, you motherfucker!
- No! Come on!

481
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:48,041
Oh, my fucking hand.
My fucking hand!

482
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,708
Dolores.

483
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,125
- Amen.
- Amen.

484
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:27,541
<i>Russell and Carrie baptized</i>
<i>our new daughter, Dolores.</i>

485
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:31,458
<i>It was a wonderful occasion,
and we were honored.</i>

486
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,500
<i>Everybody showed up.</i>

487
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:34,583
Amen.

488
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,333
- Amen.
- Amen.

489
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:57,041
<i>The only thing is,</i>

490
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,875
<i>you got more kids,
you gotta earn more money.</i>

491
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:04,625
You wanna make a quick ten grand?

492
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:07,166
<i>Whispers DiTullio.</i>
<i>Not the Whispers</i>

493
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,541
<i>they blew up in that car
around the same time.</i>

494
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:12,833
<i>This was the other Whispers.</i>

495
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:14,500
<i>The good one who knew how to make money.</i>

496
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:17,333
I got this place I front money to.

497
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,416
It's a good business.
Really good business.

498
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,541
It's a laundry.

499
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:22,958
What they do is,
they collect the linen, towels,

500
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:27,125
<i>sheets and everything from all the hotels
and restaurants in Atlantic City.</i>

501
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,458
<i>They wash it, they iron it.</i>

502
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:32,041
Normally, it's like a license
to print fucking money.

503
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,666
Until recently.

504
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,875
There's this other company
that opened up down in Delaware.

505
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,500
They're trying to put us out of business.

506
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:42,666
<i>They're cutting their prices.
They're scaring our drivers.</i>

507
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,250
<i>They're trying to take
our customers from us.</i>

508
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:48,791
To tell you the truth,
I'm a little concerned.

509
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:51,833
<i>Whenever anybody says</i>
<i>they're a little concerned,</i>

510
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,208
<i>they're very concerned.</i>

511
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:55,125
As a matter of fact,

512
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:57,333
I'm really more than a little concerned.

513
00:30:57,416 --> 00:31:00,875
<i>And when they say</i>
<i>they're more than a little concerned,</i>

514
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,083
<i>they're desperate.</i>

515
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,125
I want this fucking place bombed,

516
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,416
burnt, torched,
whatever the fuck you have to do.

517
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,291
You were in the war. You know what to do.

518
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,333
Leave that fucking place
like you left Berlin.

519
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:13,208
Burnt to the fucking ground.

520
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:15,416
I want them out of fucking business.

521
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,000
Who... Who are they?

522
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,083
It's the Cadillac Linen Service
in Delaware.

523
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,541
It's run by a bunch of Jews.

524
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:26,208
Let them collect their insurance,
which I'm sure they have plenty,

525
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:28,458
and leave this fucking other place alone,

526
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:30,166
the one I'm involved in.

527
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:33,583
- This ain't ten grand.
- It's two grand.

528
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:35,625
When you put
these Jew fucking washerwomen

529
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:38,458
out of business,
then you get the rest of your money.

530
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,458
The reason I'm a little short
on the money right now,

531
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:42,958
I don't wanna go to Skinny,

532
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:45,625
I don't wanna ask anybody
when they're gonna charge me a vig,

533
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,416
and I'm gonna be paying them forever.

534
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,333
I'm getting the money somewhere else.

535
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,583
And nobody has to know.

536
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:52,666
Especially not Skinny

537
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,708
because I'm not getting
the money from him.

538
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,166
And I see you look a little hesitant.

539
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,416
Believe me, I know what you can do.

540
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,375
If I stiff you on the money,

541
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,625
you're gonna do something terrible to me.

542
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:06,750
I do not want that.

543
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:20,000
I hit the number.

544
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:21,583
It's about 1,500.

545
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,666
I'll see you in a few hours.

546
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:07,500
Hey, Frank.

547
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:09,541
- Hey.
- Hey.

548
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,041
Angelo wants to see you.

549
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:14,291
- Now?
- Yeah, now is good.

550
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,208
What's it about?

551
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,750
I don't know. Come on. I'll drive you.

552
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,291
Sit down, Frank.

553
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:07,458
What're you doing in Delaware?

554
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,750
Bombing out a laundry place.

555
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,291
Uh, I was just doing a job
to make some extra money.

556
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:30,166
Putting this place out of action.

557
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:34,791
Putting this...
Putting this place out of commission.

558
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,708
For who?

559
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,416
Now is not the time to not say.

560
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,125
Um...

561
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:57,166
Whispers.

562
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,458
The other Whispers.

563
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:05,208
You know who owns
the Cadillac Linen Service?

564
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:08,083
Some Jews in the laundry business.

565
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,083
- That's what they told me.
- They own a part of it.

566
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:12,875
Somebody else got an interest in that.

567
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,041
- You know who?
- No.

568
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:15,000
I do.

569
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,708
- Who?
- No. I do.

570
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:20,250
I own the other part.

571
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:22,958
Not I know somebody
who owns the other part.

572
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:29,833
Angelo, I didn't know
you had any part of it.

573
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:31,583
I would never have done what I did

574
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:33,291
if I knew you were involved.
I didn't know.

575
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,791
I would never, never do that against you.

576
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,875
Whispers didn't tell you it was Jew mob?

577
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:39,291
No, he said Jew washerwomen.

578
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,083
Jew washerwomen.

579
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:46,458
What else he say?

580
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,666
I bet he said keep it to yourself.

581
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,875
Don't say nothing to nobody Downtown.

582
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:55,916
He did.

583
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,416
I didn't check.

584
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,208
I'm sorry. I should've checked.

585
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,250
- Can I give him his money back?
- He won't need it.

586
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,208
You can keep it.

587
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:10,750
I... I don't want no trouble.

588
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:13,083
I'll just give it back to him
and I'm okay.

589
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:15,125
He won't need it.

590
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,083
Okay. Thanks.

591
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:22,375
Thank Russell.

592
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I wouldn't have wasted my time.

593
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,291
I'd have let the Jew mob have you.

594
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,458
You got a good friend here.

595
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,750
You don't know how good a friend you got.

596
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:36,291
- Oh, I... I know.
- No, you don't know.

597
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,708
Wait by the bar, would you?

598
00:37:58,166 --> 00:37:59,541
<i>In a case like this,</i>

599
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,916
<i>the best thing to do is
you use something brand new.</i>

600
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,416
<i>Right out of the box.</i>

601
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,416
<i>Otherwise, you don't know where it's been.</i>

602
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,208
<i>You don't know who's used it,</i>

603
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:10,583
<i>what crime it was connected to.</i>

604
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,208
<i>That's suicide.</i>

605
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:16,250
<i>So I recommend something new,
straight out of the... the box.</i>

606
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,166
<i>Stone cold. Clean.</i>

607
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:22,875
- Hey.
- Hey, there you are.

608
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:24,666
I didn't know which way
you were coming from.

609
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,208
- Huh?
- I didn't know which way...

610
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:34,708
<i> Naturally,</i>
<i>the next thing you wanna do</i>

611
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:36,916
is throw the thing away.
You wanna get rid of it.

612
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,041
<i>There's a spot
in the Schuylkill River everybody uses.</i>

613
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:47,333
<i>If they ever send divers down there,
they'd be able to arm a small country.</i>

614
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,208
<i>For me,</i>
<i>everything changed after Whispers.</i>

615
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:20,333
<i>It was like the army.</i>

616
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,041
<i>You followed orders.</i>

617
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:26,875
<i>You did the right thing.</i>

618
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:28,875
You got rewarded.

619
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:33,708
<i>And when I handled things for Russell,</i>

620
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:35,208
<i>it was never for money,</i>

621
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,125
<i>but as a show of respect.</i>

622
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,875
<i>When you ran a little errand,
you did a little favor,</i>

623
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:42,708
<i>you got a little favor back
if you ever needed it.</i>

624
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:44,708
<i>And you always hurried back.</i>

625
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:46,083
- Hey, Phil, how you doing?
- How are you?

626
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:51,416
<i>♪ See the pyramids along the Nile ♪</i>

627

What can I get for you?

- Yeah.

00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:53,000
Thanks.

But your kid is a real <i>sfigato.</i>

You understand? He's a pain in the ass.

658
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,541
He's a wild kid.
You gotta learn to control him.

659
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,541
And if you don't,

660
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:06,291
nobody's gonna want to shop here anymore.

661
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:09,250
If it's not good for you,
it's not good for me.

662
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:12,458
You understand what I'm saying.

663
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,958
I want to apologize, Russell,
for the aggravation.

664
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:17,583
This is from Russell and I.
That's from you and Frank.

665
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:19,291
This one'll be from you and me.

666
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:20,791
Well, what about a baby spoon?

667
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:23,041
What's she gonna do with a baby spoon?

668
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,416
- They're not even married.
- Have a baby.

669
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,958
They're not even married yet.

670
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:27,458
I give you my word, Russ.

671
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:29,958
- All right. Your word's good, Phil.
- Thank you.

672
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,791
Okay, let's go, girls.

673
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:33,541
- Okay, we're done?
- Yes, we're done.

674
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:36,666
What are you doing? Huh?

675
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,791
- When the hell are you gonna wise up, huh?
- What?

676
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,500
Whoa!

677
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,125
There we go. That's my girl.

678
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:56,875
Oh, my God!

679
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:04,000
Yes!

680
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:08,458
Hey, Peggy.

681
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:11,375
Come over here.

682
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:16,166
I don't know. I don't...

683
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:18,916
I get the feeling she don't like me.

684
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,625
- Like she's afraid of me.
- No, no.

685
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:22,125
That's the way she is.

686
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,708
She's afraid of me at times too.

687
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:25,750
So, uh, it's just she's a sensitive kid,

688
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:26,916
but that's all it is.

689
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,583
I can understand her being afraid of me,

690
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:29,958
but she shouldn't be scared of you, Frank.

691
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,041
No, well...

692
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:33,375
And then she hears about me
in the papers sometimes...

693
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:34,708
- Really?
- Yeah.

694
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:36,958
You gotta be close to your kids, Frank.

695
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:37,916
I am. I am.

696
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,541
You're blessed to have them.

697
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:41,708
I mean, Carrie and I can't have kids.
I told you.

698
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:44,458
But you're blessed. You're blessed.

699
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:46,125
Call her. Call her. Tell her to come over.

700
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:48,416
Hey. Sweetheart. Peggy. Come here.

701
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,375
Come here.

702
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:56,916
- Come here.
- Come over by Uncle Russ.

703
00:43:58,083 --> 00:43:59,916
- How are you?
- Good.

704
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:03,791
Do you know why
God made the sky so high?

705
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:06,416
No.

706
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,375
So that the little birdies
don't bunk their head on it

707
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:10,958
when they're flying around.

708
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:13,625
Isn't that cute?

709
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:15,250
A little joke. Huh?

710
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,708
Isn't that funny?

711
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:18,083
You want some candy
or something?

712
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:19,500
No.

713
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,708
No, you guys don't want any candy.

714
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:25,583
There's nothing I could do for you?

715
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:26,791
No.

716
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:28,875
Well, if there is,
you let Uncle Russell know.

717
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,000
Okay.

718
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:31,541
Go back. Have some fun.

719
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:35,500
You see what I mean?

720
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:37,333
You see that feeling I get?

721
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:39,458
She's just...
She's shy, that's all.

722
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:41,000
She... She don't mean nothing.

723
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:44,125
Sometimes,
when the parents get divorced,

724
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:47,000
the kids get all confused,
and then they get resentful

725
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,875
and they don't know who to take it out on,

726
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:50,416
or, you know, which side, or...

727
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,458
No, you're right.

728
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:53,583
I'm lucky in that way because

729
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:56,666
Reenie and Mary,
they get along like gangbusters,

730
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,375
so the kids go back and forth
with no problem.

731
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:01,375
Keep your family close.
Keep an eye on that.

732
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:03,333
Anyway, I'm just telling you, you know.

733
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:05,625
I mean, I'm... I'm just lucky.

734
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:07,708
Yeah.

735
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,375
How's it going with the union?

736
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:13,958
The union's the best in the world.

737
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:15,833
- You like it, huh?
- Yeah, well, it's just...

738
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:19,083
I mean, I wish I had something
more steady, but...

739
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:20,333
Yeah, it's...

740
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:22,583
- How about organizing?
- Yeah.

741
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:24,375
- I would like to do that. But...
- Yeah?

742
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:26,208
There's a long line.

743
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:28,375
- A long waiting list, if you will.
- Yeah.

744
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,875
Well, a friend of ours
is having a little trouble.

745
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:35,208
- Friend at the top.
- Who's that?

746
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,041
The top.

747
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:38,458
Hoffa?

748
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:39,416
Yeah.

749
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:42,208
I heard the other day

750
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:44,833
that some guys
tried to pipe him because of

751
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:46,416
- a workman's comp case.
- Yeah.

752
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,250
Yeah, I heard
he beat the shit out of them.

753
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,125
Yeah, but how long
is he gonna keep doing that?

754
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:52,291
Things are gonna keep happening.

755
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,500
He needs somebody
he can trust around him.

756
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:56,625
Somebody to be with him all the time.

757
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:57,750
Yeah.

758
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:02,750
<i>Let me put McGee on the phone.</i>

759
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,958
Hello.

760
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:08,708
Hiya, my friend. How are you?

761
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:12,875
Listen, I got that kid
I was talking to you about here.

762
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:16,041
I'm gonna put him on the phone,
let you talk to him, okay?

763
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:17,166
All right.

764
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,458
Hello.

765
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:22,041
- Is that Frank?
<i>- Yes.</i>

766
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,250
Hiya, Frank. This is Jimmy Hoffa.

767
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:25,875
Yeah, yeah. Glad to meet you.

768
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:28,958
Well, glad to meet you, too,
even if it's over the phone.

769
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,666
I heard you paint houses.

770
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,791
Yes. Yes, sir, I... I do. I do.

771
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:37,041
And I, uh...

772
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,000
I also do my own carpentry.

773
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:40,916
<i>Oh! I'm glad to hear that.</i>

774
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,375
I understand you're a brother of mine.

775
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:46,625
Yes, sir. Local 107. Since 1947.

776
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:48,458
<i>Yeah! You know, uh,</i>

777
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:50,375
our friend speaks very highly of you.

778
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:52,583
Well, thank you.

779
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:56,333
- He's not an easy man to please.
- Well, I do my best.

780
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:57,958
<i>Well, you know, there's a situation...</i>

781
00:46:58,041 --> 00:47:02,250
<i>Nowadays, young people,</i>
<i>they don't know who Jimmy Hoffa was.</i>

782
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:04,083
<i>They don't have a clue.</i>

783
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:06,875
<i>I mean, maybe they know
that he disappeared or something,</i>

784
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,791
<i>but that's about it.</i>

785
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:10,791
<i>But back then, there wasn't nobody</i>

786
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:14,375
<i>in this country who didn't know
who Jimmy Hoffa was.</i>

787
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:15,666
- God bless, Jimmy.
- Oh!

788
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,708
Everything you've done,
you're a real gentleman.

789
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:18,958
That's good.

790
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:22,166
<i>In the '50s,</i>
<i>he was as big as Elvis.</i>

791
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,833
<i>In the '60s, he was like the Beatles.</i>

792
00:47:25,416 --> 00:47:26,541
<i>Next to the president, he was like</i>

793
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:29,333
<i>the most powerful man in the country.
Bar none.</i>

794
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:31,166
If you got it,

795
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,458
a truck brought it to you.

796
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,125
If you got your food, your clothing,

797
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:41,375
your medicine,
if you got fuel for your homes,

798
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,291
fuel for your industries,

799
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:46,041
a truck brought it to them!

800
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:51,250
The day our trucks stop,

801
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:52,958
America stops!

802
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,166
<i>Well, there's a situation</i>

803
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,083
<i>going on now, Frank,
that needs to be attended to.</i>

804
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:02,250
You know,
they're trying to tear the union apart.

805
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:06,375
Big business and the government
working together, trying to pull us down.

806
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:08,333
<i>Big business</i>
<i>is on the attack!</i>

807
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:10,666
They're coming! They're coming hard

808
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,041
and they're coming fast!

809
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:16,458
Big business and the government
are trying to sow the seeds of dissent

810
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:18,250
among our ranks,

811
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:21,750
at a time when we need unity!

812
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:24,000
We need solidarity!

813
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:26,458
I want to write it in the sky.

814
00:48:27,125 --> 00:48:28,458
Solidarity!

815
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:31,166
Solidarity!

816
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:34,125
Solidarity!

817
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:36,291
<i>You wanna be</i>
<i>a part of this fight?</i>

818
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:37,666
Yes, I do, sir.

819
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,291
<i>Would you like to be
a part of this history?</i>

820
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,458
Yes, I would.

821
00:48:42,291 --> 00:48:45,000
Whatever you need me to do,
I'm available.

822
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:46,666
Can you come to Chicago tomorrow?

823
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:47,958
Yes, I can, sir.

824
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:49,166
<i>All right, then. See you then.</i>

825
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:56,583
- He likes to talk, don't he?
- Yeah.

826
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,458
Thought I was talking to General Patton.

827
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:11,416
<i>You know, Frank,</i>
<i>the only reason why you're here,</i>

828
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,375
<i>the Seafarers Union,
they're signing up</i>

829
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:16,166
<i>the same non-union cab drivers</i>

830
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,791
<i>as we want to do.</i>

831
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:20,041
Nobody knows who you are

832
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:23,333
and nobody knows
what the fuck you're doing here. Okay?

833
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:25,125
- Yeah.
- You and I know why you're here.

834
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:27,958
We gotta be able to sign these drivers up

835
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:31,166
so Paul Hall doesn't get 'em
for his fucking union.

836
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,583
For some reason, lesbians.

837
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:35,583
Most of these drivers
are fucking lesbians.

838
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:37,625
I have no reason why.

839
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:41,416
Paul Hall's running around saying
that he's gonna get a better contract

840
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,291
than our boy fucking Jimmy.

841
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:45,541
He's a cocksucker. Yeah.

842
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:49,625
Jimmy has Mayor fucking Daley
in his pocket.

843
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:52,166
The cops are okay
with whatever the fuck we do.

844
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,500
They're not gonna help us
push these cars in,

845
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:57,458
but they certainly are not gonna
let anybody fucking stop us.

846
00:49:57,541 --> 00:49:58,416
Okay?

847
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,875
Come on! All of you guys.
Come on!

848
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:23,333
Let's get this fucking thing in there.
Watch yourself!

849
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:27,833
This is a lot of work.

850
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:29,291
Yeah, you ever think of using candy?

851
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:31,083
- What?
- Candy.

852
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:33,125
What the fuck is candy?

853
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:39,958
Hey, Lou, open the fucking gate.

854
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:41,708
I got it. I got it.

855
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,833
Here, you take the gas.

856
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,416
Frank, there's one thing
about Jimmy.

857
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,250
Don't ever make him wait.

858
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:06,833
If you make a meeting with him,
you get there on time.

859
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:08,208
Better yet, get there early.

860
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:09,833
I can't stress this enough.

861
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:13,208
His problem is that time is of essence.

862
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:15,125
And that's the important thing.

863
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:17,541
I gotta tell you one more thing.
Jimmy doesn't drink.

864
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,583
Yeah. The head of the largest
trucking union in the world,

865
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:21,500
he don't drink.

866
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:22,958
The worst part about it is,

867
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:25,166
he doesn't allow anybody
to drink around him.

868
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:31,833
Another thing about him,

869
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:34,500
Jimmy hates fucking watermelon.

870
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,083
But we're gonna like watermelon.

871
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:41,791
Jimmy, you shoulda seen it,

872
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:44,250
sinking in the water.

873
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:46,708
One by one.
I bet you, when they woke up

874
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:49,333
the next morning,
those fucking cab drivers,

875
00:51:49,416 --> 00:51:50,833
they went to look for their cabs,

876
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:52,333
they didn't know what the fuck hit 'em.

877
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:54,958
That's a great idea, Joey.

878
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:56,250
Great idea.

879
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,291
Well, it wasn't my idea.

880
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:01,416
My man Frank. It was his idea.

881
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,000
Let me tell you something.

882
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:05,875
Frank hit that pier,
he took over the pier.

883
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:08,041
Whatever he told them to do,
whatever he said,

884
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,291
they did it, you know.

885
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:14,041
I never seen a guy walk
through a crowd like he does.

886
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:15,375
He doesn't touch a fucking person!

887
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:16,791
Everybody gets out of the way.

888
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:18,666
I'm not kidding you. I swear.

889
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,083
Guys he never met in his life.
You know, it was like...

890
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:23,000
like Moses. Remember Moses?

891
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:25,125
When he walked into the ocean,
the sea,

892
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,250
whatever the fuck it was,
and it opened up!

893
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:30,416
That's him. I'm telling you.
Jimmy, he's got it.

894
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,666
So, uh, what do you think?

895
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,541
You need him
a couple of days more?

896
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:36,250
Yeah, we gotta clear up
a few dribs and drabs.

897
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:40,583
You guys sure like watermelon.

898
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:42,166
Want a bite?

899
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,708
Not on your life.

900
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:47,708
You were there. You saw it firsthand.

901
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:49,708
Those guys ain't union.

902
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,791
They're like Nazi collaborators,
operating behind the lines.

903
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:56,500
- You know. You were in the war.
- I sure do.

904
00:52:56,958 --> 00:53:01,916
In a war,
you go from point A to point B.

905
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:04,291
Sometimes,

906
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:07,250
you spill a little beer along the way.

907
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:11,000
That philosophy make sense to you?

908
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:12,125
Sure does.

909
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:14,291
Good.

910
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,250
<i>Jimmy, he didn't make me</i>
<i>stay in his suite</i>

911
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,750
<i>because he liked me.</i>

912
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,416
<i>He made me stay with him
because he didn't want me</i>

913
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,708
<i>registering in my name at the hotel.</i>

914
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:43,875
<i>This way, there was no proof
I was even in Chicago.</i>

915
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,041
Come on, Jimmy, you're way behind.

916
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:57,666
Nothing stops her.

917
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,250
<i>After Chicago,</i>
<i>Jimmy and I got close.</i>

918
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:01,500
<i>The wives hit it off.</i>

919
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:03,875
<i>And with Jimmy and Josephine's kids</i>

920
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:05,750
<i>mostly grown up and out of the house,</i>

921
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:07,666
<i>they got a kick out of our kids too.</i>

922
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,458
Jimmy, Peggy, let's get a picture.

923
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:10,791
Oh. Yes. Come on.

924
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:12,250
<i>Especially Peggy.</i>

925
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:15,250
<i>She and Jimmy,
they fell for each other right away.</i>

926
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:19,583
You know what I like even better
than getting my picture took?

927
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:20,666
What?

928
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:24,250
Surprise!

929
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:25,750
Peggy!

930
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:27,916
<i>To Peggy, Jimmy wasn't like Russ,</i>

931
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,791
<i>or Skinny or even me.</i>

932
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:33,083
Sorry, everybody.
This is just for Peggy and I.

933
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:35,208
<i>For one thing,</i>
<i>Jimmy didn't have a nickname</i>

934
00:54:35,291 --> 00:54:37,625
<i>like "The Razor," or "The Hunchback,"</i>

935
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,833
<i>or "The Weasel," or "Whispers."</i>

936
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:41,833
So what happened to "Thank you"?

937
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:43,416
- Thank you!
- Oh!

938
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,166
<i>And also, to her,</i>
<i>he was helping people.</i>

939
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,041
<i>He was helping them
make more money, live better lives.</i>

940
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,875
<i>He wasn't stomping on somebody's hand.</i>

941
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:55,958
"'If you have it,
a truck brought it to you."

942
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:57,583
This is what Mr. Hoffa says.

943
00:54:57,666 --> 00:55:00,125
He's the president of the Teamsters Union

944
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:02,250
with over a million members.

945
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:05,208
They all support him
because they have steady jobs,

946
00:55:05,291 --> 00:55:07,958
great pay and a pension
for when they retire.

947
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:10,958
<i>The Teamster Pension Fund</i>

948
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,000
<i>had eight billion dollars in it.</i>

949
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:16,750
<i>And Jimmy had complete control
over every bit of it.</i>

950
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:19,416
Isn't this
a beautiful presentation?

951
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,000
I mean, a bridge loan is really
all I'm asking, Jimmy.

952
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:25,250
I'm not gonna piss away
my members' pension dough

953
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:26,583
on something too risky.

954
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:28,500
This is not a risk, Jimmy.

955
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:30,833
I got Minsky's Follies.

956
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:33,291
I got the first topless act on the Strip.

957
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,791
I'm telling you, we're booming in there.

958
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:35,958
I can't get the drinks out...

959
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,666
Just asking for a golf course.

960
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,083
You know you never lost a dime with me.

961
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:41,125
Jimmy, we'd really just appreciate

962
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:42,833
whatever you could do
to help Jake along here.

963
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:45,416
One-five is all I need
for a completion bond.

964
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:50,625
Okay. Okay. Go to the bank.

965
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:51,833
Thank you.

966
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:52,958
It's gonna be a big success.

967
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,000
Thank you, Jimmy. You're a prince.

968
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:57,083
- You're a <i>mensch.</i>
- Yeah, I'm a <i>mensch.</i>

969
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:07,666
<i>And, because of Mr. Hoffa,</i>

970
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,750
workers have medical insurance
for when they get sick,

971
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:14,750
and know when they retire,
they're not going to go hungry.

972
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:18,000
<i>There was</i>
<i>so much paperwork back then</i>

973
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,916
<i>that Jimmy had to use
an insurance company</i>

974
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,666
<i>that was run by this kid, Allen Dorfman,
to work out the loans.</i>

975
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,166
No, no, nothing for nothing.

976
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:27,375
Next time,
try asking a little bit fucking nicer.

977
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:34,750
And? And? How'd it go?

978
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:37,416
It was a little touch and go
for a little bit.

979
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,041
- But at the end, fine.
- Good.

980
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:40,375
<i>It was Russ who got Jimmy</i>

981
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:42,208
<i>to give guys like Gottlieb the loans,</i>

982
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:44,958
<i>and, you know,
he would get like 10% of that.</i>

983
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:47,500
<i>Or whatever, you know. Maybe more.</i>

984
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:50,916
Listen, you tell Marteduzzo
from me that I appreciate it.

985
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,500
And everybody's gonna appreciate it.

986
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:53,458
It's a good thing.

987
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:54,500
Okay. I'll do that.

988
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:56,541
<i>Back then,</i>
<i>you couldn't go to regular banks</i>

989
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,291
<i>because the money was for gambling.</i>

990
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,958
<i>God's truth, that's what it was.
I'm serious. You couldn't.</i>

991
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:02,833
<i>So the Mob, what did they do?</i>

992
00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:04,708
<i>They went to the Teamsters
for the money.</i>

993
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:06,583
<i>It was the Teamsters that stepped in</i>

994
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:08,541
<i>and lent the money that built Las Vegas.</i>

995
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,375
- This is the mahogany...
- Don't, Billy.

996
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:11,708
- Don't touch the stuff.
- I won't.

997
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:13,250
- Just go where you gotta go.
- Okay.

998
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:15,916
<i>There was more business</i>
<i>than anybody could handle.</i>

999
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,291
<i>So Jimmy had to shove
some of the deals</i>

1000
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:19,916
<i>off on to his wife Jo,</i>

1001
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,166
<i>who had no idea she had 22%</i>

1002
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,916
<i>of a Florida land deal
called "Sun Valley,"</i>

1003
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,625
<i>some charter fishing boats,</i>

1004
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:28,916
<i>and a ski lodge with its own mountain.</i>

1005
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:37,583
<i>One of Jimmy's clients
was Sam "Momo" Giancana,</i>

1006
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:40,208
<i>who was friends with the Kennedys
from back when Jack's father</i>

1007
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:42,166
<i>made his fortune with the Italians</i>

1008
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,333
<i>as a bootlegger during Prohibition.</i>

1009
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:48,083
<i>Momo, Sinatra hung out together
with the Kennedys.</i>

1010
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,208
Momo and Kennedy,

1011
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:53,625
believe it or not,
even had the same girlfriend.

1012
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:55,750
Together. At the same time.

1013
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:57,416
Talk about crazy.

1014
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:00,458
<i>So it was easy for the Mob
to help Joe Kennedy</i>

1015
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:03,041
<i>get his son elected president.
That was easy.</i>

1016
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:05,500
<i>They just punched up the vote a little</i>

1017
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:08,041
<i>to make sure that he won in Illinois.</i>

1018
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:13,291
<i>In exchange for that,</i>

1019
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,666
the new president was supposedly
gonna get Castro out of Cuba

1020
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,333
so our guys could get their casinos back,

1021
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:21,416
and race tracks, and shrimp boats,

1022
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,833
and everything else that they had,

1023
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,291
and owned down there from Havana back.

1024
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:27,291
But that... that didn't happen.

1025
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:38,333
<i>The Italians wanted Kennedy
the Irishman for president,</i>

1026
00:58:38,416 --> 00:58:40,375
<i>and that's what they got.</i>

1027
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,250
Get used to it,
because we're gonna be seeing it 24/7.

1028
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:46,875
Son of a bitch!

1029
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,000
Goddamn Kennedys.

1030
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:49,458
I'm looking at the goddamn Kennedys.

1031
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:51,500
Jimmy, the kids. Language.

1032
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:53,458
Oh, what difference does it make?

1033
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:55,125
I mean, they gotta learn sooner or later.

1034
00:58:55,208 --> 00:58:56,958
We're going to war with these people.

1035
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:58,166
War!

1036
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:00,958
If I said it once,
I said it a thousand times,

1037
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:02,791
I don't care they're Irish.

1038
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:05,000
I don't care they're Catholic.

1039
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,458
If there's one person
you can't trust in this life,

1040
00:59:08,541 --> 00:59:10,041
it's millionaires' kids.

1041
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:11,916
You're right, Jimmy.

1042
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,625
Especially that little son of a bitch.

1043
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:18,375
Are you saying you don't remember

1044
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:20,458
doing any favors for Johnny Dio,

1045
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:22,416
or you don't remember
the conversation?

1046
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:26,875
I'm saying,
to the best of my recollection,

1047
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:29,875
I must recall on my memory,

1048
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:31,833
I cannot remember.

1049
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:36,958
Then where did this $20,000 come from?

1050
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:40,000
Individuals.

1051
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,833
Which individuals, Mr. Hoffa?

1052
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:44,708
Uh...

1053
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:50,166
Off hand, that particular amount of money
I borrowed,

1054
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,750
I don't know at this particular moment.

1055
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:58,500
But the record of my loans,
which I requested, I have,

1056
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:00,875
and out of all the moneys I loaned

1057
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:04,833
during this period of time
I went into these ventures.

1058
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:12,375
<i>Those goddamn Kennedys,</i>

1059
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:13,875
they get what they want!

1060
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:15,000
Jimmy. Jimmy, the kids.

1061
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:16,833
Him and all the bullshit problems

1062
01:00:16,916 --> 01:00:18,708
- he put me through already.
- Jimmy.

1063
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:20,916
I gotta go.
You don't expect me to look at this.

1064
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,375
No, I don't.

1065
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,791
- Whoa!
<i>- For guys like Russ,</i>

1066
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:26,291
<i>it couldn't have been better.</i>

1067
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:27,458
<i>I mean, Russ,</i>

1068
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:30,958
<i>oh, yeah, he did his part
for getting Kennedy elected,</i>

1069
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:31,958
<i>that's for sure.</i>

1070
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:33,458
What are you doing?
I told you to put it...

1071
01:00:33,541 --> 01:00:35,000
I told you to put them on every pole.

1072
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:35,958
You're still walking around.

1073
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:37,250
<i>So what's the first thing</i>

1074
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,250
<i>that Jack Kennedy does
to thank Chicago for all their help?</i>

1075
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:43,500
He puts his shitass brother in there,

1076
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:44,833
<i>that little prep school punk,</i>

1077
01:00:44,916 --> 01:00:47,333
<i>and he winds up making him
attorney general.</i>

1078
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:49,125
Oh!

1079
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:52,083
And what's the first thing Bobby does?

1080
01:00:52,166 --> 01:00:54,041
He goes after not just Jimmy,

1081
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:56,708
which in a way you could understand.

1082
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:58,625
I mean, Jimmy hated the Kennedys so much

1083
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:01,458
he gave Nixon $500,000 in Teamster cash.

1084
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:04,250
But Bobby also goes after Giancana,

1085
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:07,625
Marcello, Trafficante,
and all the other guys

1086
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:10,666
who put his brother in the White House
in the first place.

1087
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:14,125
What's that about?

1088
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:15,291
Frank.

1089
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:17,041
- Oh, thank you.
- Merry Christmas.

1090
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:18,250
Am I missing something?

1091
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:20,291
Thank you, Carrie.

1092
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,375
- That's gorgeous.
- Beautiful.

1093
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:29,958
Wear it in the best of health.
We love you.

1094
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:33,083
Okay, now this one is for Peggy

1095
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:35,916
from Uncle Russell.
Merry Christmas, my love.

1096
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,458
Oh, look at those.

1097
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:42,041
So nice!

1098
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:43,833
I heard you like to skate.

1099
01:01:45,416 --> 01:01:46,666
What do you say?

1100
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:49,541
Thank you.

1101
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:52,083
Now me and Uncle Russell
could take you ice skating.

1102
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:56,000
I think Santa Claus left you
a little something extra in there too.

1103
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:02,791
What do you say
to Uncle Russell?

1104
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:06,083
What do you say?

1105
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:08,333
Huh?

1106
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:09,875
Frank, it's all right.

1107
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,041
She said thank you once.
That's enough.

1108
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:18,958
<i>With Bobby as attorney general,</i>
<i>I mean, they were all over us.</i>

1109
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:21,125
<i>I mean, we couldn't talk on the phone</i>

1110
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:23,083
<i>because we knew it was being bugged.</i>

1111
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:24,916
<i>You couldn't do nothing.
You couldn't go nowhere.</i>

1112
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,250
<i>You couldn't do anything.</i>

1113
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:28,625
<i>It was a bad, bad, bad situation.</i>

1114
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:30,750
<i>And then Jimmy... Forget it.</i>

1115
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:33,416
<i>Bobby, now as attorney general,
he has the power</i>

1116
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,583
<i>to send anybody to jail,
and no question about it.</i>

1117
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:38,125
<i>And Jimmy was at the top
of Bobby's hit list.</i>

1118
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:40,875
<i>He even set up
a special "Get Hoffa Squad,"</i>

1119
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:42,791
<i>where he had his own guys from the FBI,</i>

1120
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:44,625
<i>the IRS working 'round the clock.</i>

1121
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:47,791
<i>Their only job
was to put Jimmy Hoffa in jail.</i>

1122
01:02:47,875 --> 01:02:49,083
<i>I'm serious. That's all they did.</i>

1123
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,041
I am sitting in a room
full of fuckin' idiots.

1124
01:02:57,666 --> 01:03:00,125
You dumb motherfuckers!

1125
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:01,833
You know what you did?

1126
01:03:01,916 --> 01:03:04,333
You take Johnny O'Rourke's kid

1127
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:06,583
and you put him on

1128
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:08,875
as general organizer,

1129
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:12,375
pay him 36 fucking grand,

1130
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:14,458
at the same time,

1131
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:19,500
you let him sell insurance
to his fucking father's...

1132
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,375
to his fucking father's...

1133
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:34,916
to his fucking father's locals!

1134
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Damn it!

1135
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:39,375
How do you do that?

1136
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,833
How stupid can you be?

1137
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,000
That fucking cocksucker Kennedy

1138
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:51,541
has got his nose up my ass
everywhere I go!

1139
01:03:51,625 --> 01:03:53,500
You don't know
that they're hounding me?

1140
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:55,000
They're looking at everything I do.

1141
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:57,458
And you let this happen in public!

1142
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,833
You're giving it to him!

1143
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:01,916
I'm going to jail. You understand?

1144
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:04,958
I'm going to prison because of you,

1145
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,291
you dumb motherfuckers.

1146
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:09,750
This is what you wanted.
You wanted to put me in jail.

1147
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,708
Tell me now so I can kill you right here.

1148
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:12,750
Right here!

1149
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:19,458
Where're you going?

1150
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:20,458
What do you mean,
where am I going?

1151
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:22,041
I fucking quit, that's where I'm going.

1152
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:23,208
What are you quitting for?

1153
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:25,375
You gonna call me a motherfucker?

1154
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:27,375
You can talk to them like that,
you can't talk to me like that.

1155
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:29,583
Frank. No! That didn't apply to you.
What are you...

1156
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:30,666
- Didn't apply?
- No!

1157
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,208
Then you gotta let me know
it didn't apply to me.

1158
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:35,041
- I'm standing right there.
- I didn't even see you standing there!

1159
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:36,625
I was standing right there, Jimmy.

1160
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:37,875
What are you talking about?

1161
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:40,125
But it didn't apply to you!
What else can I say?

1162
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:44,416
You got a problem, you pull me aside.

1163
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,708
You don't insult me
and then you say it didn't apply to me.

1164
01:04:46,791 --> 01:04:48,958
How am I gonna put you aside?
I didn't even see you there.

1165
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:51,958
Oh, come on, Frank,
you know me better than that.

1166
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:53,875
You just know me better than that.

1167
01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:55,166
Please.

1168
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,375
Come on. It's gonna be all right.

1169
01:04:57,458 --> 01:04:59,333
It's gonna be all right. Come on.

1170
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:01,375
Come on, why would I ever
say anything like that to you?

1171
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:02,625
You gotta control these people.

1172
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:04,291
I'm controlling everything.
Don't worry about it.

1173
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:06,958
But certainly, certainly, I... you know.

1174
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:09,916
Come on. Okay, guys, get out of here now.

1175
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:13,625
<i>I mean, I don't know how</i>
<i>Jimmy is running the fucking union.</i>

1176
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:16,208
Between Bobby and the FBI
up his ass all the time,

1177
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:17,875
he's going fucking crazy.

1178
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:21,291
Tell Jimmy I'm sorry for his troubles.

1179
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,791
The old-timers know the Old Man.
They'll talk to him.

1180
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:25,958
At some point,
they'll straighten it out for him.

1181
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:27,333
Yeah, but he can't understand,

1182
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:29,666
and I gotta be honest with you,
I don't understand either,

1183
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,791
how youse could help get
those two fucking Kennedy pricks

1184
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:33,041
elected in the first place.

1185
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:34,916
It don't make no sense to him,
that's for sure.

1186
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,125
He doesn't have to understand everything.

1187
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:39,458
You know what I'm talking about.
Sometimes it's better.

1188
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:40,791
Well...

1189
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:43,125
When I see him like that,
I don't, you know,

1190
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:44,750
I... I'm tryin' to... I feel bad.

1191
01:05:44,833 --> 01:05:46,958
I wanna help him in some way.

1192
01:05:47,041 --> 01:05:49,083
Listen, he's too emotional.

1193
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:51,250
Like some guy who's always
rushing, rushing

1194
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:54,208
all over the place
and they miss the big picture.

1195
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:56,250
Like Cuba.

1196
01:05:58,083 --> 01:06:01,041
Getting us back into casinos.

1197
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,500
Getting us back into Havana.

1198
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:06,583
Like getting rid
of that fucking Castro prick.

1199
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:12,541
The old-timers spoke to the Old Man.

1200
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:15,958
The Old Man talked to his son Jack,
and he told him,

1201
01:06:16,041 --> 01:06:18,625
"Don't forget who the fuck he owes."

1202
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:23,250
He knows who the fuck he owes.

1203
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:26,625
<i>So I want you</i>

1204
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:30,208
<i>to go down to a place
called Milestone Hauling.</i>

1205
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:33,875
<i>There's a guy named Phil.</i>

1206
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:35,833
<i>He's gonna give you a rig.</i>

1207
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:45,583
<i>You drive the rig down to Baltimore</i>

1208
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:47,375
<i>to a concrete plant.</i>

1209
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:48,791
<i>It's on Eastern Avenue.</i>

1210
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:51,458
<i>It's the only one on the street.
You can't miss it.</i>

1211
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:57,458
<i>A guy's gonna meet you there.</i>

1212
01:06:57,541 --> 01:06:59,750
<i>A fairy named Ferrie.</i>

1213
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:03,166
Just pull it forward and then back it in.

1214
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,625
Let's go, let's go.

1215
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,416
<i>You'll pick up some things.</i>

1216
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:29,916
<i>He'll give you some paperwork
in case you get stopped.</i>

1217
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:42,416
<i>You drive the truck down to Florida.</i>

1218
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:45,500
<i>A dog track outside Jacksonville.</i>

1219
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:48,625
<i>You leave it there.</i>

1220
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:53,791
<i>A guy with big ears named Hunt
will meet you there.</i>

1221
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,250
<i>He's gonna give you a car
to drive back to Philly.</i>

1222
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:13,291
What are you looking at?

1223
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:14,833
You looking at my ears?

1224
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:17,541
Sorry?

1225
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:19,041
My ears.

1226
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:21,082
- Are you looking at my ears?
- Your ears?

1227
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:23,041
No.

1228
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:27,082
I had an operation,
so there's no need for anyone

1229
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:28,625
looking at my ears anymore.

1230
01:08:28,707 --> 01:08:30,916
Yeah, well, I ain't looking at your ears.

1231
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:31,832
Right.

1232
01:08:34,416 --> 01:08:36,207
Get out of here. Go on.

1233
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,291
<i>unfolded in the Bay of Pigs.</i>

1234
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:00,957
<i>Nothing went as planned.</i>

1235
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:02,375
<i>Paratroopers were unable</i>

1236
01:09:02,457 --> 01:09:04,625
<i>to blow up roadways
leading to the beach area.</i>

1237
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:06,707
<i>Castro raced toward the scene.</i>

1238
01:09:06,791 --> 01:09:09,207
<i>The underground might have blown up
the roads but it knew nothing.</i>

1239
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:12,082
<i>Soon, Castro had artillery
firing on the beachhead.</i>

1240
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:13,832
<i>His planes destroyed invading ships</i>

1241
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,250
<i>carrying a brigade of men
and vital ammunition.</i>

1242
01:09:16,332 --> 01:09:18,082
<i>The beachhead could not be enlarged</i>

1243
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:20,625
<i>and paratroopers were soon
trying to fight their way back</i>

1244
01:09:20,707 --> 01:09:23,832
<i>to the small section of the shore
where the invaders were pinned down.</i>

1245
01:09:23,916 --> 01:09:26,832
<i>1,500 men had been dumped
on a shore without air cover</i>

1246
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:28,625
<i>or protective fire from ships.</i>

1247
01:09:28,707 --> 01:09:31,207
<i>Castro had to wait
only until they ran out of ammunition</i>

1248
01:09:31,291 --> 01:09:32,750
<i>before mopping them up.</i>

1249
01:09:32,832 --> 01:09:36,332
<i>Later, Castro was to strut around
the invasion area with newsmen,</i>

1250
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:38,500
<i>and expound on the errors
that had been made.</i>

1251
01:09:38,582 --> 01:09:40,166
<i>He had ample material.</i>

1252
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:43,041
<i>The United States, already humiliated,</i>

1253
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:45,832
<i>stood condemned
by most of the countries of the world.</i>

1254
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:46,832
<i> Ah, shit!</i>

1255
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:49,832
Just as I predicted. They fuck up Cuba,

1256
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:53,082
Boobie starts coming after me
and the union.

1257
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:55,916
He's looking for some cheap publicity.

1258
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,875
That's all it is.
That's what he's doing.

1259
01:09:57,958 --> 01:09:59,375
Okay.
Well, it's all gonna blow over, Jimmy.

1260
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:01,958
No, it's not gonna blow over.
How's it gonna blow over?

1261
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:03,875
They're never gonna forget

1262
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:07,250
- that I gave money to Nixon!
- Calm down. Jimmy, please.

1263
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:08,416
We're gonna handle this.

1264
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,416
Couple of the old-timers,
they're gonna get to Old Man Kennedy now.

1265
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,125
Okay? They're gonna get to him.
He's a little sick, but...

1266
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:14,375
- Sick?
- Yeah. But...

1267
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:17,208
He had a fucking stroke.
That's not sick.

1268
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:19,666
That's you're...
you're close to the grave, is what.

1269
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:21,708
He's turning into a fucking eggplant.

1270
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:24,000
Okay. Well, you can't blame
anybody for that. That's...

1271
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:25,333
I'm not looking to blame anybody.

1272
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:27,750
But if there's any blame going around,
it's the Kennedys.

1273
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:29,833
His kids killed him. Let me tell you that.

1274
01:10:29,916 --> 01:10:32,458
He's not dead, but he's going.
He's going.

1275
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:35,500
They killed him.
They'd give anybody a heart attack.

1276
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:11,416
Where are you going?

1277
01:11:12,416 --> 01:11:13,333
I'm going to work.

1278
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:15,958
Go back to sleep.

1279
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:08,041
<i>All I can say is that,</i>
<i>we will not stop.</i>

1280
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:10,500
<i>Because we've been
doing that for 50 years!</i>

1281
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,541
<i>What good does it do?</i>

1282
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:16,875
<i>Let the lawyers...
Let the lawyers drive a truck.</i>

1283
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:19,833
<i>They need their pencils
and papers and their ink pads.</i>

1284
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:24,000
That's... That's a whole other story.

1285
01:12:24,083 --> 01:12:25,916
But we're gonna get through this.

1286
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,916
We're gonna get through
this legal bullshit

1287
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,375
and garbage they're throwing at us.

1288
01:12:31,458 --> 01:12:33,833
We're gonna get through it because

1289
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:36,625
"Boobie" Kennedy wants something,
that doesn't mean

1290
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:38,500
the rich boy is gonna get it.

1291
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:40,750
You understand what I'm saying?

1292
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:43,083
I don't care what he wants.
He's not gonna get it!

1293
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:48,625
He's not gonna get it because

1294
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:52,291
we are the biggest and best,

1295
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:55,125
and most honest union

1296
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:56,958
in this country!

1297
01:12:57,041 --> 01:12:58,083
Yeah, that's right.

1298
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,500
I waited for that!

1299
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:07,958
And you know the operative word
I'm talking about here.

1300
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:10,125
- Solidarity.
- Yeah!

1301
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:12,250
And it works. It works for all of us.

1302
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:16,625
And it works for our friend here,
Frank Fitzsimmons!

1303
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:18,750
Frank Fitzsimmons here,

1304
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:22,041
my executive vice president.

1305
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:25,375
If there's anyone that can do
this job, it's this man here.

1306
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:28,083
And with him at my back,

1307
01:13:28,166 --> 01:13:30,166
where are we gonna go but up!

1308
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:33,375
Is that right, Fitz?

1309
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:35,291
All the way, Jimmy!

1310
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:38,125
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

1311
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:40,458
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

1312

Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

1315
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:49,791
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

1316
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:52,000
A union man!

1317
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:56,041
You know, I felt they liked Fitz.

1318
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:57,375
No two ways about it.

1319
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:59,750
Yeah, you gave Fitz some buildup.

1320
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:01,166
I mean, I hope he deserves it.

1321
01:14:03,166 --> 01:14:04,958
Why? What's wrong with Fitz?

1322
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:08,625
I don't know.
I don't want to knock the guy,

1323
01:14:08,708 --> 01:14:09,791
but I... I don't know.

1324
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:12,041
Well, you're not knocking him.
Just tell me...

1325
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:13,791
Tell me what you feel.

1326
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,375
I mean, he's a loyal guy, I'm sure.

1327
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:18,666
Uh, he's a nice guy,

1328
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,000
but he ain't that sharp.
He ain't that smart.

1329
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:22,208
And he's also like a...

1330
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,208
He plays a lot of fucking golf,
you know.

1331
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:25,416
He plays golf?

1332
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:28,291
So what?
That's what you want from a number two.

1333
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:30,375
You don't want somebody too smart.

1334
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:33,583
You want a nice guy.
People like him, you know.

1335
01:14:33,666 --> 01:14:35,541
Not dumb, but somebody,

1336
01:14:35,625 --> 01:14:37,000
you know you can have
walking behind you

1337
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:39,083
without getting knifed.

1338
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:41,791
- Well, I hope you're right.
- I'm always right.

1339
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:44,833
I can sleep like a babe with Fitz.

1340
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:48,583
It's the Little Guy I have to worry about.

1341
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:50,208
You know what I'm saying.

1342
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:51,250
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1343
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:52,416
The Little Guy.

1344
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,875
- That's my worry.
- Yeah.

1345
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:56,916
That son of a bitch.

1346
01:14:58,541 --> 01:14:59,458
What's the matter?

1347
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:01,458
Nothing. Nothing. You're right.

1348
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:03,458
I'm right. Yeah.

1349
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,208
- You're not perplexed, are you?
- Not at all. Not at all.

1350
01:15:06,291 --> 01:15:09,791
I mean, I told you how I felt about Fitz.
Pro. You know.

1351
01:15:09,875 --> 01:15:11,500
Yeah. Good, because sometimes I feel

1352
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:14,541
I'm the only one

01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:17,375
I'm just saying get working guys

1410
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:19,958
who know the unions,
card-carrying Teamsters,

1411
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:21,416
like you and me.

1412
01:18:22,083 --> 01:18:23,333
Start running,

1413
01:18:23,416 --> 01:18:24,916
take over some of the locals.

1414
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:27,333
What do you think?

1415
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:28,916
- He ain't gonna like that.
- Who?

1416
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,125
Fuck him. Who the fuck is he?

1417
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:32,500
He's a gangster.

1418
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:34,666
I run the union, I'm the president.

1419
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:36,125
So, I mean...

1420
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:39,583
All I need is some guys
who know their ways around.

1421
01:18:40,291 --> 01:18:41,958
Know how to handle themselves, you know.

1422
01:18:42,041 --> 01:18:43,041
That's all.

1423
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:46,625
That's why I want you to run for president

1424
01:18:46,708 --> 01:18:48,208
of Local 326.

1425
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:53,708
You're like family to me, Frank.
You know.

1426
01:18:53,791 --> 01:18:55,083
You, Irene,

1427
01:18:55,666 --> 01:18:56,791
the girls.

1428
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:57,875
The lovely Peggy.

1429
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:01,000
But that's not why I'm doing this.

1430
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:03,583
I'm not giving you anything
you didn't earn,

1431
01:19:04,541 --> 01:19:05,583
you didn't deserve.

1432
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:07,958
What do you think?

1433
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,083
Um, I... I don't know what to say, Jimmy.

1434
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:15,333
- I mean, um...
- Well, just say you'll do it.

1435
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,750
That's all you got to say.

1436
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:20,166
Plus, I can guarantee you're gonna win.

1437
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:23,166
Ha! When you run for president

1438
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:26,708
of 326, you're gonna win.

1439
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:29,333
I guarantee it.

1440
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:32,291
Yeah, okay, I'll do it. Yeah.

1441
01:19:33,958 --> 01:19:35,041
You mean it, huh?

1442
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:37,333
Yeah, yeah. I'm... I'm honored.

1443
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:40,166
I love you. I just love you, you know.
Come here.

1444
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,833
I love you, man.

1445
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:43,458
I can't tell ya.

1446
01:19:43,541 --> 01:19:44,416
Oh, gee.

1447
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,125
Oh, this is so good, you know.

1448
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:48,416
I feel like I can breathe again.

1449
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,041
It's so funny. I...

1450
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:51,208
Somehow I...

1451
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:54,666
I don't know.
I thought you would've said no.

1452
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,250
- Oh, um...
- I'm glad you said yes.

1453
01:19:58,333 --> 01:19:59,208
I mean...

1454
01:20:00,583 --> 01:20:01,625
Frank...

1455
01:20:03,541 --> 01:20:06,625
You never reveal how you feel, you know.
It's hard to tell.

1456
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:08,833
I'm honored, Jimmy. I don't know...

1457
01:20:08,916 --> 01:20:10,916
It's just I don't know what to... say,

1458
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,250
you know, but I'm honored.

1459
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:14,791
Well, that's good.

1460
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:18,125
That makes me feel good.

1461
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:20,958
Oh, I can breathe.

1462
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,416
That's so great.

1463
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:26,208
I...

1464
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:57,625
<i>What can I say?</i>
<i>I mean, I owe it all to Jimmy.</i>

1465
01:20:57,708 --> 01:21:01,041
<i>He took me out of a meat truck,
he gave me my start.</i>

1466
01:21:01,125 --> 01:21:04,750
<i>He gave me my first charter.
He gave me my first union.</i>

1467
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:07,375
- How are ya?
- Hey, how are you?

1468
01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:09,750
Frank Sheeran,
the new president of Union 326.

1469
01:21:09,833 --> 01:21:12,291
- I wanted to introduce myself.
- Nice to meet ya.

1470
01:21:12,916 --> 01:21:14,541
- What's your name?
- My name's Al.

1471
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:16,375
Al. Nice to meet ya, Al.

1472
01:21:16,458 --> 01:21:18,333
- A little something...
- No, no. Don't need it.

1473
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:20,250
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1474
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:21,791
Just came here to say hello,
introduce myself.

1475
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:23,666
You need anything,
just get in touch with me.

1476
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:24,750
- Okay? Yeah.
- You sure?

1477
01:21:24,833 --> 01:21:25,791
Thank you.

1478
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:28,041
So, hypothetically,
if they can prove

1479
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:29,041
that you stole from them,

1480
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:31,833
what they're gonna want are names, so...

1481
01:21:33,583 --> 01:21:36,833
Would you be willing to give up names
to keep from going to jail?

1482
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:38,291
No.

1483
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:41,041
Okay. So you got nothing to worry about.

1484
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:44,500
- The lawyers will take care of it.
- Thank you, Mr. Sheeran.

1485
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:57,708
<i>The Interstate 80 West</i>
<i>through the rest of Pennsylvania,</i>

1486
01:21:58,208 --> 01:22:02,500
<i>and then we'd go across Ohio
all the way to Toledo,</i>

1487
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:06,125
<i>and then we'd go 75 North to Detroit.</i>

1488
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:09,250
<i>And we'd still get there on time.</i>

1489
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:14,458
<i>Your Honor,</i>
<i>my client had been advised by counsel</i>

1490
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:16,791
that it was perfectly legal for his wife

1491
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:19,041
to be part owner of a trucking business.

1492
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:22,291
Still, when the McClellan Committee
challenged its legality,

1493
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:24,666
she withdrew from the company
immediately.

1494
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:26,916
That should be the end of the matter.

1495
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,708
There had been not one indictment served

1496
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:33,041
against my client
in 13 grand jury investigations.

1497
01:22:33,875 --> 01:22:36,750
Your Honor, this is an example of

1498
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:39,041
a personal vendetta against my client,

1499
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:42,708
against his family,
by a frustrated Justice Department

1500
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,833
and the attorney general, Robert Kennedy.

1501
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,166
Whoa!

1502
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:53,083
He's got a gun!

1503
01:22:53,791 --> 01:22:54,666
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1504
01:22:58,166 --> 01:22:59,333
Get that gun out of his hand!

1505
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:04,208
Easy, boy.

1506
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:11,625
That was not a real gun, was it?

1507
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:13,166
How'd that gun get in?

1508
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:14,375
How'd it get in here?

1509
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:16,041
It wasn't my fault!

1510
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:17,333
I don't know!

1511
01:23:17,416 --> 01:23:18,500
Oh, my Chuckie!

1512
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:20,791
Hey, it's my son!

1513
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:23,083
That's my kid. I raised this kid.

1514
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:24,916
You see him? You see what he did?

1515
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:28,625
I'll tell you this.

1516
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:31,791
He shot at me,
and it was like a pellet or something.

1517
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:33,958
I didn't feel it,
I just felt a little impact,

1518
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:36,291
like I was shot not even with a BB gun.

1519
01:23:36,375 --> 01:23:38,125
Something even lighter.

1520
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:39,375
But I charged him.

1521
01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:41,083
I charged him and so did Chuckie,
if you noticed.

1522
01:23:41,166 --> 01:23:42,083
I taught him well.

1523
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:46,166
You charge a guy,
always charge a guy with a gun.

1524
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:47,625
With a knife, you run away.

1525
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:51,083
Run away from a knife.
So you charge with a gun,

1526
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:52,750
- with a knife, you run.
- That's right.

1527
01:23:52,833 --> 01:23:54,875
Hey! I rhymed!

1528
01:23:56,666 --> 01:23:59,000
I know it sounds crazy,
but I got a message from a higher power

1529
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:00,208
telling me to shoot Jimmy Hoffa.

1530
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:01,166
Come with me.

1531
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:03,333
A lot of nuts in Nashville, Frank.

1532
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:05,291
Come on down, Frank.

1533
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,208
Yeah, I got one of them
with me now, you see.

1534
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:08,541
<i>Get down here, Frank.</i>

1535
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:10,541
<i>Eddie Partin, you know the guy
from Baton Rouge,</i>

1536
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:11,541
<i>he's here with me.</i>

1537
01:24:11,625 --> 01:24:12,791
Yeah. Yeah, I'll get right down.

1538
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:14,625
Out of my way, boys. Come on.

1539
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:17,333
Come on, come on.

1540
01:24:20,958 --> 01:24:22,250
Hey.

1541
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:24,000
Did Mr. Brennan first say,

1542
01:24:24,083 --> 01:24:25,583
or do you remember him first saying

1543
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:28,625
something about, say,
"I had to change the deal.

1544
01:24:28,708 --> 01:24:30,833
I have to cut Hoffa in on the new deal"?

1545
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:33,833
Wasn't that like the chronology
of the whole thing?

1546
01:24:33,916 --> 01:24:36,250
I don't know he changed the deal,

1547
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:39,541
but it was my understanding
over the telephone that Brennan

1548
01:24:39,625 --> 01:24:41,083
was speaking for himself.

1549
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:42,833
<i>She's an angry woman.</i>
<i>That's an angry woman.</i>

1550
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:43,958
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1551
01:24:44,041 --> 01:24:46,291
- She was a teacher I think.
- Oh, that's right.

1552
01:24:46,375 --> 01:24:48,000
What we're looking at
is this one.

1553
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:49,375
This one is not approachable.

1554
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:50,958
No, she'd be
a tough nut to crack.

1555
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:52,458
There's a lot
of family money there.

1556
01:24:52,541 --> 01:24:54,166
<i>...will hail,</i>
<i>stop, and search</i>

1557
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,166
<i>all ships bound for Cuba.</i>

1558
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:58,083
<i>If the ships' captains do not stop,</i>

1559
01:24:58,166 --> 01:24:59,833
<i>force will be used to stop them.</i>

1560
01:24:59,916 --> 01:25:01,375
<i>If the ships do stop...</i>

1561
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:03,541
See, I think there's an in here...

1562
01:25:03,625 --> 01:25:06,583
Did you make this statement
to the grand jury? I'll read it for you.

1563
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:09,791
"Brennan came to me and said words
to the effect he's gonna go ahead..."

<i>He's got a restaurant.</i>

1565
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:12,541
Did you look into violations?

1566
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:14,041
Yeah.
I'd rather stick with the women.

1567
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:16,458
- They're more approachable.
- Jimmy, thank you.

1568
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:19,666
<i>...in Cuba of operational</i>
<i>medium-range missiles.</i>

1569
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:21,791
<i>He added that if one
of the missiles is launched,</i>

1570
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:23,875
<i>it would probably carry a nuclear warhead.</i>

1571
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:27,375
<i>It could hit any spot
in the southeast United States,</i>

1572
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:28,791
<i>south of Washington.</i>

1573
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:31,458
<i>And that we would have no way
of intercepting it</i>

1574
01:25:31,541 --> 01:25:33,500
<i>or issuing a warning about it.</i>

1575
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:36,541
This one's married
to a state trooper named Plechette.

1576
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:37,875
Ooh, that's good.

1577
01:25:38,708 --> 01:25:39,791
We know anyone?

1578
01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:43,375
Well, yeah,
we got an ex-cop in the Local.

1579
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:44,583
That's good.

1580
01:25:44,666 --> 01:25:46,916
<i>All our forces
have been put on increased alert.</i>

1581
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:10,291
<i>...came to me</i>
<i>and said words to the effect</i>

1582
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:13,333
<i>he's gonna go ahead
and set up a company to lease trucks.</i>

1583
01:26:13,416 --> 01:26:16,333
But later, he called me
on the phone and said quote,

1584
01:26:16,416 --> 01:26:20,583
"I gotta change the deal
'cause I gotta cut Hoffa in on the deal."

1585
01:26:20,666 --> 01:26:21,875
Is that accurate, sir?

1586
01:26:21,958 --> 01:26:23,791
This one's another possibility.

1587
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:25,875
- Wait.
- Well, she had a boyfriend,

1588
01:26:25,958 --> 01:26:28,250
she's seeing somebody else
while she's married.

1589
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:30,625
So it could be... It could grab her,

1590
01:26:30,708 --> 01:26:31,750
- hold on to her.
- Yeah, but...

1591
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:33,083
But this guy,

1592
01:26:33,166 --> 01:26:36,041
the construction business.
He has a couple of violations,

1593
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:38,583
there's a lien on his house.

1594
01:26:38,666 --> 01:26:40,083
His car is unpaid.

1595
01:26:40,875 --> 01:26:44,000
That's good. Keep going.
Don't quit while you're ahead.

1596
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:52,958
Thank you. See you, Big Eddie.

1597
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:56,083
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

1598
01:26:56,166 --> 01:26:58,291
- so help you God?
- I do.

1599
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:08,500
Mr. King, you're a member of

1600
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:11,833
the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, is that correct, sir?

1601
01:27:11,916 --> 01:27:15,458
I respectfully decline
to answer that under the, uh,

1602
01:27:15,541 --> 01:27:18,291
protection afforded me by the...

1603
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:19,500
Fifth Amendment.

1604
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:21,125
I just asked if you're a Teamster, sir.

1605
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:22,875
I respectfully decline to answer...

1606
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:24,750
Okay. All right. Fine.

1607
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:26,750
I'm gonna show you
a photograph, all right?

1608
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:29,375
- I respectfully decline to answer...
- Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait...

1609
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:30,416
under the protection...

1610
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,666
You haven't even seen the photograph yet.

1611
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,625
Look at the photograph, wait a smidge,

1612
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:37,625
- and then you can...
- I want to avail myself

1613
01:27:37,708 --> 01:27:41,916
of my right under the constitution,
as I understand it.

1614
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,916
- Jim, let him avail himself.
- Oh, okay.

1615
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:54,041
- Oh, yeah.
- Mmm.

1616
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:55,958
That King's the best.

1617
01:27:56,041 --> 01:27:58,500
He's the best. He's a good guy.

1618
01:27:58,583 --> 01:28:00,125
You see him stand up to that jerk?

1619
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:02,083
Yeah, yeah, I know.
He was great.

1620
01:28:02,166 --> 01:28:03,750
I love what he did.

1621
01:28:03,833 --> 01:28:05,916
They tried to get him,
they tried their best.

1622
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,875
- We need more like him.
- Oh, my God!

will you be attending

the President's funeral?

1654
01:29:47,541 --> 01:29:48,458
I wasn't invited.

1655
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:51,125
You don't have to be invited.
A million Americans will be there.

1656
01:29:51,208 --> 01:29:52,458
Well...

1657
01:29:52,541 --> 01:29:54,291
I guess I'll have to check my schedule.

1658
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:57,250
If you were to go and asked to speak,
what would you say?

1659
01:29:57,333 --> 01:29:58,791
I'd say, uh,

1660
01:29:58,875 --> 01:30:01,208
Bobby Kennedy is just another lawyer now.

1661
01:30:06,291 --> 01:30:07,750
Son of a bitch.

1662
01:30:23,375 --> 01:30:24,750
Good, Eric. Thank you very much.

<i>That was the end of it with Bobby.</i>

1666
01:30:43,625 --> 01:30:46,708
<i>So much for him being
the attorney general. That was done.</i>

1667

<i>Bobby's vendetta was over, with us.</i>

1668
01:30:58,458 --> 01:30:59,958
Mr. Hoffa,

1669
01:31:00,916 --> 01:31:03,000
you stand here convicted
of having tampered

1670
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:05,458
with the very soul of this nation.

1671
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:09,125
<i>But there was still</i>
<i>that jury thing in Nashville.</i>

1672
01:31:09,208 --> 01:31:11,333
The soul of this nation, sir,

1673
01:31:11,416 --> 01:31:14,125
lies in its sacred processes of justice.

1674
01:31:14,666 --> 01:31:16,375
Justice must be done.

1675
01:31:16,458 --> 01:31:19,916
And for your wicked attempts
to corrupt these processes,

1676
01:31:21,208 --> 01:31:23,583
justice will be done on you.

1677
01:31:23,666 --> 01:31:26,041
We got him now.

1678
01:31:26,125 --> 01:31:27,041
We got him.

1679
01:31:27,125 --> 01:31:30,375
Ladies and gentlemen, we did it!

1680
01:31:47,666 --> 01:31:50,416
<i>But Jimmy, you know,</i>
<i>he had it all set up.</i>

1681
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:53,708
<i>Although you knew
it was supposed to look like Fitz</i>

1682

<i>was the one in charge.</i>

1683
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:59,041
<i>He gave Fitz his orders
through Bill Bufalino and Allen Dorfman,</i>

1684
01:31:59,125 --> 01:32:00,583
<i>and they ran Jimmy's loans.</i>

1685
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:03,083
But things are good in here?
Everything is...

1686
01:32:03,166 --> 01:32:04,291
Everything's terrible.

1687
01:32:04,375 --> 01:32:05,875
You don't sleep at night

someone's gonna knife you.

1689
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:09,375
'Cause you look okay. You look okay.

1690
01:32:09,458 --> 01:32:11,791
Where's Fitz? He's late.

1691
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:14,708
Yeah. Well, we were gonna meet him
in the front. He...

1692
01:32:14,791 --> 01:32:15,875
Meet him in the front?

1693
01:32:15,958 --> 01:32:16,875
Here he is, here he is.

1694
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:19,541
Where the hell have you been?
What are you doing here?

1695
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:21,083
Why did you even come at all, Fitz?

1696
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,000
You know, are you aware you're late?

1697
01:32:23,083 --> 01:32:24,833
That's all I want to know.
Do you know you're late?

1698
01:32:24,916 --> 01:32:27,875
I'm sorry I'm late, Jimmy,
but we got a lot going on.

1699
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:30,541
I don't wanna hear that.
I wanna hear something concrete,

1700
01:32:30,625 --> 01:32:32,583
I wanna hear something straight on.

1701
01:32:32,666 --> 01:32:35,250
Uh, I'm just gonna ask you
to be a little more patient.

1702
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:36,583
I think we're gonna have...

1703
01:32:36,666 --> 01:32:38,291
I'm inside here.
I'm not gonna be too patient.

1704
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:42,125

Fitz is okay. We like Fitz.

1712
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:02,958
I'll tell you what the problem is.

1713
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:05,041
Jimmy's got that ballbusting Dorfman

1714

1717
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:18,416
What do you want me to do?

1718
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:21,000
No, not that. Not that.

1719
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:26,375
What you gotta do is, you know,
put a firecracker up Dorfman's ass.

1720
01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:28,750
Fitz'll get the message.

1721
01:33:29,416 --> 01:33:31,166
He'll get the message.

1722
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:33,083
I mean,
you can't do it to Fitz because if...

1723
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,083
if you do it to that lush,

1724
01:33:35,166 --> 01:33:37,541
he'll run right to the feds
and screw up everything.

1725
01:33:38,166 --> 01:33:39,416
But Dorfman...

1726
01:33:39,916 --> 01:33:41,708
You gotta do it to Dorfman.

Who let you in?

1736
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,583
Mr. Provenzano.
I'm Agent DiGregorio of the FBI.

1737
01:34:46,666 --> 01:34:48,333
I have a warrant for your arrest.
Please stand.

- No, sir. Please stand.

a bad fucking hand anyway.

Other arm, please.

1743
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,000
- Can I get my bags?
- No, sir.

1744
01:34:59,083 --> 01:35:01,500
I got nothing in my pocket.
I got fucking shorts on here.

1745
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:03,458
Look at this penguin over there, huh?

1746
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:05,583
Hey, Tony, will you get my bags?

1747
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:06,875
Yeah, I'll get your bags, Tony.

1748
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:08,750

Thank you, Pete.

1757

I gotta talk to you about a problem
I got with my pension.

1758
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I know.

1759
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:50,708
Oh, you know?

1760
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:52,958
What do you know?

1761
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:55,833
I know

1762
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:57,625
you got a million two

1763
01:35:57,708 --> 01:36:00,166
and, uh, there's a problem with it.

1764
01:36:02,416 --> 01:36:04,083
So you'll look into it for me?

1765
01:36:04,791 --> 01:36:06,916
How am I going to look into it?
What am I gonna look into?

1766
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:09,250
It is what it is.

1767
01:36:09,875 --> 01:36:11,000
Well, what is it?

1768
01:36:11,833 --> 01:36:12,791
You lost it.

1769
01:36:13,291 --> 01:36:16,750
You forfeited it when you came in here.
That's it.

1770
01:36:18,416 --> 01:36:20,333
So is yours forfeited too?

1771
01:36:20,416 --> 01:36:21,375
No.

1772
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:27,125
Let me get this straight.
So yours is still there,

1773
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:29,291
your million five, whatever it is,

1774
01:36:29,375 --> 01:36:30,750
but mine's gone?

1775
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:33,958
Yeah. Mine's still there.

1776
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:38,458
But we're both sitting here.

1777
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:40,916
We're both sitting here. That's right.

1778
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,375
Only we're sitting here
for different things.

1779
01:36:44,166 --> 01:36:46,458
You're sitting here for extortion.

1780
01:36:46,541 --> 01:36:48,833
I'm sitting here for fraud.

1781
01:36:49,416 --> 01:36:52,458
- So?
- So? So there's a difference.

1782
01:36:52,541 --> 01:36:53,666
What's the difference?

1783
01:36:56,875 --> 01:36:59,500
I didn't threaten anybody, you did.

1784
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:01,333
So what? That makes no sense.

1785
01:37:01,416 --> 01:37:02,625
What do you mean? It does.

1786
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:04,500
No, it doesn't. I don't want a debate.

1787
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:07,000
- Think about it.
- I'm thinking about it, Jimmy.

1788
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:08,416
No, don't fuck with me, Jimmy.

1789
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:09,958
Just do something about it.

1790
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:16,791
What do you mean,
"do something about it"?

1791
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:17,791
What am I gonna do?

1792
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:19,541
Come on,
there's always something you can do.

1793
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:20,833
No. It's federal law.

1794
01:37:20,916 --> 01:37:22,583
- I don't care.
- You don't care?

1795
01:37:22,666 --> 01:37:24,541
No, you can still do something about it.

1796
01:37:24,625 --> 01:37:26,458
There's nothing I can do.
What can I do?

1797
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:28,166
You can get my fucking money.

1798
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:29,166
How?

1799
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:30,541
- Some other way.
- What way?

1800
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:32,000
The same way you got your money.

1801
01:37:32,083 --> 01:37:34,125
Shh. Lower your fucking voice.

1802
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,625
You telling me to lower my voice?

1803
01:37:36,708 --> 01:37:37,750
I'm tellin' you to lower
your fucking voice.

1804
01:37:37,833 --> 01:37:39,000
Cocksucker.

1805
01:37:39,083 --> 01:37:40,458
- Don't call me a cocksucker.
- Fuck you.

1806
01:37:40,541 --> 01:37:42,041
Don't you fucking dare.

1807
01:37:43,333 --> 01:37:45,083
Look, you're here for fraud.

1808
01:37:45,166 --> 01:37:46,750
- You stole money.
- I stole money?

1809
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:47,833
Yeah, I stole money.

1810
01:37:47,916 --> 01:37:49,541
Okay, fine, in a different way, but still,

1811
01:37:50,166 --> 01:37:52,125
I want what I'm fucking owed.

1812

You people. You people.

1813
01:37:55,416 --> 01:37:56,583
- What did you say?
- Oh, my God!

1814
01:37:56,666 --> 01:37:57,500
What did you say?

1815
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:59,000
Oh, come on, what I said.

1816
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:00,500
What the fuck did I say?

1817
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:01,791
"You people." You said "You people."

1818
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:03,708
What does that fucking mean,
"You people"?

1819
01:38:03,791 --> 01:38:05,125
I'm done

1820
01:38:05,208 --> 01:38:06,916

1821
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:09,208
- "You people"?
- I'm done!

1822
01:38:09,291 --> 01:38:11,083
You're done?
I'll rip your fucking head off!

1823
01:38:11,166 --> 01:38:12,916

Yeah.

<i>Who does he think he is, Erroll Flynn?</i>

1852

He went against

1853
01:40:19,291 --> 01:40:20,791
Just didn't give a shit.

1854

And, growing up,
he kidnapped his own bosses.

01:40:23,541 --> 01:40:25,333
I don't know how he got away with that.

1856

You don't get away with that.
You do that, you die.

1857
01:40:28,458 --> 01:40:29,541
That simple.

1858
01:40:29,625 --> 01:40:31,083
When he went away to the can,

1859
01:40:31,166 --> 01:40:33,958
he recruited black guys
instead of his own kind.

1860
01:40:34,041 --> 01:40:36,041
And when he got out,
nobody knew what he was doing,

1861
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:37,125
or who he was doing with it.

1862
01:40:37,208 --> 01:40:39,833
We didn't know what the hell
was going on. Nobody did.

1863
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:41,916
And if you don't like what he's doing,

1864
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,416
and you say something,

1865
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:45,333

01:41:25,416 --> 01:41:26,791
It was just Jackie.

1873
01:41:26,875 --> 01:41:29,333
Joey, your doctor called.
You died an hour ago.

1874
01:41:31,125 --> 01:41:32,833
You a Jewish fellow?

1875
01:41:32,916 --> 01:41:35,000
Would you like to be?

1876
01:41:35,083 --> 01:41:37,458
Don't worry about the operation.
We don't do that no more.

1877
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:38,875
We freeze it.

1878
01:41:39,375 --> 01:41:41,000
And you stand there
and don't do anything

1879
01:41:41,083 --> 01:41:43,000
and a Mexican broad
comes over with a wet rock.

1880
01:41:43,083 --> 01:41:44,541
Thwack!

1881
01:41:44,625 --> 01:41:46,958
See, it's okay to laugh.
I make fun of everybody.

1882
01:41:47,041 --> 01:41:49,791
That's why God put us on this earth,
to laugh.

1883
01:41:49,875 --> 01:41:51,125
I work everyone.

1884
01:41:51,208 --> 01:41:53,416
I make fun of blacks, I make fun of Jews.

1885
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,750
I work Gypsies, I work Italians.

1886
01:41:55,833 --> 01:41:57,583
Well, not those Italians.

1887
01:41:57,666 --> 01:41:59,416
No, no, no, no!

1888
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:01,916
It's okay, Joey.
I got the money. Don't shoot.

1889
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,208
I was told today,

1890
01:42:05,291 --> 01:42:07,750
"Be very careful about what you say."

1891
01:42:07,833 --> 01:42:11,000
But, uh, all kidding aside,
happy birthday, Joey.

1892
01:42:21,916 --> 01:42:22,791
Hey, Russ.

1893
01:42:24,666 --> 01:42:27,000
Hey. What are you doing with that?

1894
01:42:29,958 --> 01:42:32,166
You really believe
in that bullshit league?

1895
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:35,041
Well, it's not that.

1896
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:36,333
It's Italian.

1897
01:42:36,416 --> 01:42:37,750
Joey. Joey.

1898
01:42:37,833 --> 01:42:38,833
- What did I say?
- Oh, no, no.

1899
01:42:38,916 --> 01:42:40,625
- What did I say?
- Joey, Joey. Joey. Joey.

1900
01:42:41,416 --> 01:42:42,375
Now, listen.

1901
01:42:43,625 --> 01:42:46,166
You can't say that stuff like that here.
Okay? You can't do that.

1902
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:48,083
Why not? Rickles is the only one
who can make jokes?

1903
01:42:48,166 --> 01:42:49,333
The man's a boss.

1904
01:42:49,416 --> 01:42:52,000
So I'm a boss. He's a boss.
We're all supposed to be brothers, right?

1905
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:52,916
I know you're a boss.

1906
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,666
I know, but we don't wanna
have a beef now. Okay?

1907
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:56,875
- We're brothers, right?
- That's right, brothers.

1908
01:42:56,958 --> 01:42:58,625
- We're brothers?
- You're brothers.

1909
01:42:58,708 --> 01:43:00,291
- We're brothers.
- I'm not arguing with you.

1910
01:43:00,375 --> 01:43:01,458
Everybody's a brother.

1911
01:43:01,541 --> 01:43:03,250
That's right, you're a brother.
You're his brother.

1912
01:43:03,333 --> 01:43:04,625
I'm not, but you guys are.

1913
01:43:04,708 --> 01:43:06,708
So that's why
I would like it if you just...

1914
01:43:06,791 --> 01:43:07,750
- All right.
- Okay?

1915
01:43:07,833 --> 01:43:09,333
- We're brothers?
- You're brothers.

1916
01:43:09,416 --> 01:43:11,125
Oh, yeah. It's my birthday.

1917
01:43:11,208 --> 01:43:12,541
Happy birthday.

1918
01:43:12,625 --> 01:43:14,000
Happy birthday.

1919
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,958
Get the fuck out of here.

1920
01:43:39,416 --> 01:43:41,333
<i>Now, for something like this,</i>

1921
01:43:41,416 --> 01:43:43,333
<i>you're gonna need two guns.</i>

1922
01:43:43,416 --> 01:43:45,958
<i>The one you're gonna use
and a backup.</i>

1923
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:50,083
<i>You want something with more
stopping power than a .22.</i>

1924
01:43:55,708 --> 01:43:57,750
<i>You definitely don't want a silencer.</i>

1925
01:43:57,833 --> 01:44:00,833
<i>You want to make a lot of noise
to make the witnesses run away</i>

1926
01:44:00,916 --> 01:44:02,750
<i>so they ain't gonna be looking at you.</i>

1927
01:44:05,583 --> 01:44:07,583
<i>But not the noise a .45 makes</i>

1928
01:44:07,666 --> 01:44:09,208
<i>'cause that makes too much noise,</i>

1929
01:44:09,291 --> 01:44:11,833
<i>and a patrol car can hear it
a few blocks away at least.</i>

1930
01:44:15,708 --> 01:44:19,625
<i>The cops call a .32 a woman's gun
because it's easier to handle</i>

1931
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:21,708
<i>and don't do the damage a .38 does,</i>

1932
01:44:21,791 --> 01:44:24,208
<i>but, you know, it does enough.</i>

1933
01:44:31,708 --> 01:44:36,125
<i> It would be late,</i>
<i>so the tourists from Idaho</i>

1934
01:44:36,208 --> 01:44:38,208
<i>wouldn't be there.
They'd be in bed.</i>

1935
01:44:38,291 --> 01:44:40,291
<i>And him being down there in Little Italy,</i>

1936
01:44:40,375 --> 01:44:43,375
<i>maybe he'd be more comfortable,
more relaxed.</i>

1937
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:47,750
<i>It was his birthday
so he'd be there with his wife</i>

1938
01:44:47,833 --> 01:44:50,125
<i>and his kid which, in this case,</i>

1939
01:44:50,208 --> 01:44:52,458
<i>that's good
because that's the point.</i>

1940
01:44:52,541 --> 01:44:54,500
<i>They should have to see what it's like.</i>

1941
01:44:56,375 --> 01:44:58,250
<i>He'd already been drinking,</i>

1942
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:00,250
<i>which would have slowed him down a lot.</i>

1943
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:02,833
<i>His bodyguard would be with him</i>

1944
01:45:02,916 --> 01:45:04,750
<i>and Joey himself could be carrying, too,</i>

1945
01:45:04,833 --> 01:45:07,958
<i>but then the piece would be
in his wife's purse probably.</i>

1946
01:45:14,291 --> 01:45:17,000
<i>You never got
a lot of advance notice.</i>

1947
01:45:17,583 --> 01:45:19,666
<i>All you knew was your part of it.</i>

1948
01:45:21,708 --> 01:45:24,708
<i>John the Redhead knew only one thing:</i>

1949
01:45:24,791 --> 01:45:26,666
<i>he was gonna drop me off,</i>

1950
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:29,750
<i>circle the block and pick me up.</i>

1951
01:45:37,916 --> 01:45:40,375
<i>You wanna take out the bodyguard first.</i>

1952
01:45:40,458 --> 01:45:43,416
<i>Not kill him.
Don't kill him, just disable him.</i>

1953
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,375
<i>You got no argument with him,</i>

1954
01:45:45,458 --> 01:45:48,000
<i>so, not in the face or the chest.</i>

1955
01:45:49,458 --> 01:45:52,166
<i>Sometimes, with something like this,</i>

1956
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:54,750
<i>you might want to go
to the bathroom first.</i>

1957
01:45:55,666 --> 01:45:58,375
<i>It gives you a chance to make sure
nobody followed you in.</i>

1958
01:45:58,458 --> 01:45:59,833
<i>It also gives you a chance to make sure</i>

1959
01:45:59,916 --> 01:46:02,416
<i>nobody is in the bathroom
you have to worry about.</i>

1960
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,291
<i>It also gives you a chance
to go to the bathroom.</i>

1961
01:46:05,375 --> 01:46:07,125
<i>You don't want to be uncomfortable.</i>

1962
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:11,000
<i>But I went before,
and in a place this small, this late,</i>

1963
01:46:11,083 --> 01:46:13,125
<i>you might as well just get to work.</i>

1964
01:46:13,208 --> 01:46:14,500
We need more wine, all right?

1965
01:46:14,583 --> 01:46:16,750
Hey, Tommy, some more wine.

1966
01:46:16,833 --> 01:46:17,708
So how about after?

1967
01:46:17,791 --> 01:46:19,500
- Cake, cake, cake!
- Not yet.

1968
01:46:19,583 --> 01:46:21,333
You're not even done eating the meal yet.

1969
01:46:21,416 --> 01:46:23,666
You want the cake?
Come on, you can't do that.

1970
01:46:27,041 --> 01:46:28,041
Shit!

1971
01:46:28,125 --> 01:46:29,833
Fuck! Fuck!

1972
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:06,416
<i>It happened</i>
<i>in New York's Little Italy,</i>

1973
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:09,833
<i>an area rumored to be neutral territory
among mobsters.</i>

1974
01:47:09,916 --> 01:47:11,041
<i>After the killing,</i>

1975
01:47:11,125 --> 01:47:13,291
<i>police found several guns
and some fingerprints</i>

1976
01:47:13,375 --> 01:47:15,166
<i>which they were tracing today.</i>

1977
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:16,625
<i>Joseph "Crazy Joe" Gallo</i>

1978
01:47:16,708 --> 01:47:19,083
<i>had come
to the intimate seafood restaurant</i>

1979
01:47:19,166 --> 01:47:20,875
<i>to cap an evening of celebration</i>

1980
01:47:20,958 --> 01:47:22,750
<i>with his new bride of less than a month,</i>

1981
01:47:22,833 --> 01:47:25,541
<i>and his 11-year-old daughter
by a previous marriage.</i>

1982
01:47:25,625 --> 01:47:29,500
<i>They were, uh, celebrating</i>
<i>Joe's 47th birthday.</i>

1983
01:47:29,583 --> 01:47:32,250
<i>They had been to a nightclub
early in the evening.</i>

1984
01:47:32,333 --> 01:47:36,625
<i>They were sitting at a rear table,
this group of six people,</i>

1985
01:47:37,208 --> 01:47:38,458
<i>when a, uh...</i>

1986
01:47:39,291 --> 01:47:40,291
<i>a man walked in</i>

1987
01:47:40,375 --> 01:47:43,916
<i>from the back door,
and he walked up, uh,</i>

1988
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,625
<i>to the side of the table.
He fired three shots.</i>

1989
01:47:47,708 --> 01:47:49,458
<i>He hit Joe twice</i>

1990
01:47:49,541 --> 01:47:51,250
<i>- and he hit his bodyguard...</i>
- Peggy, let's go.

1991
01:47:51,333 --> 01:47:53,541
<i>...Pete the Greek, one time.</i>

1992
01:47:53,625 --> 01:47:56,125
<i>There was a total of 14 shots fired.</i>

1993
01:47:56,208 --> 01:47:57,041
Peggy, come on.

1994
01:47:57,833 --> 01:47:59,916
<i>It's quiet here</i>
<i>on President Street,</i>

1995

<i>Joey Gallo's turf.</i>

1996

<i>In fact, it's too quiet.</i>

1997

<i>Out here in Brooklyn,</i>

1998
01:48:05,083 --> 01:48:06,708
<i>Joey Gallo was a hero.</i>

1999

<i>Speculation has it

2001
01:48:46,416 --> 01:48:48,583
- Take it easy, Jimmy.
- You too, Mikey.

2002
01:48:48,666 --> 01:48:50,250
Take good care, Jimmy.

2003
01:48:50,333 --> 01:48:51,750

What are you
gonna do now, Jimmy?

2011
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:10,375
Well, the first thing
I'm gonna do is register

2012

with the Federal Probation Office,

2013
01:49:12,125 --> 01:49:16,416

2014
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:17,500
Any plans after that?

Yeah, I'm gonna take back
control of my union.

How're you gonna do that, Jimmy?

How do you like Fitz running against you?

2018

I don't.

2019
01:49:26,166 --> 01:49:28,083
What was it like

01:49:35,083 --> 01:49:37,291
<i>which Jimmy loved
almost as much as ice cream.</i>

2023
01:49:37,375 --> 01:49:41,000
<i>A consultant to President Richard Nixon's
re-election campaign committee...</i>

2024
01:49:41,083 --> 01:49:43,333
<i>The secret is</i>
<i>they steam them in beer.</i>

2025
01:49:43,416 --> 01:49:45,500
<i>There ain't a better hot dog in America.</i>

2026
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:49,666
<i>Police say McCord and his accomplices
brought electronic listening devices</i>

2027
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:52,625
<i>with them and had removed
two ceiling panels...</i>

2028
01:49:52,708 --> 01:49:55,250
<i>while installing
eavesdropping equipment</i>

2029
01:49:55,333 --> 01:49:57,041
<i>at the Democratic National Committee.</i>

2030
01:49:58,083 --> 01:50:01,125
Look at this. He's got the balls
to run for President of the Teamsters.

2031
01:50:01,208 --> 01:50:03,750
Look at this.
And Tony Pro giving him an award.

2032
01:50:03,833 --> 01:50:05,416
This fuck... Do you believe it?

2033
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:08,083
Look, Fitz is very popular
with certain people.

2034
01:50:08,166 --> 01:50:10,000
Of course he's popular.
Who wouldn't be popular?

2035
01:50:10,083 --> 01:50:12,541
He loans money
to every goombah who asks.

2036
01:50:12,625 --> 01:50:15,916
That's why Tony's behind him.
He's given Fitz all his votes.

2037
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,166
You got great support
from most of the union.

2038
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:21,333
All you need is Tony Pro's voters
in the Northeast, and you can win.

2039
01:50:21,416 --> 01:50:23,541
- You sure you don't want one of these?
- No, thank you.

2040
01:50:23,625 --> 01:50:27,541
I just can't believe
I gotta go to Tony Pro to get votes.

2041
01:50:27,625 --> 01:50:28,625
What is that?

2042
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:33,041
Tony has Fitz
in his pocket, Jimmy.

2043
01:50:33,125 --> 01:50:34,666
Wise guys don't run the union.

2044
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:35,958
With Fitz, they do.

2045
01:50:37,041 --> 01:50:39,583
Jimmy, listen,
as soon as you're back as president,

2046
01:50:39,666 --> 01:50:40,625
you can do anything you want to.

2047
01:50:40,708 --> 01:50:42,541
You can fire anybody you want to.

2048
01:50:42,625 --> 01:50:44,583
You can even fire Tony Pro.

2049
01:50:44,666 --> 01:50:45,750
Whoa.

2050
01:50:45,833 --> 01:50:48,666
You could stand over him,
watch him clear out his desk.

2051
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:50,708
You could strip-search the guy.

2052
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:53,541
Make sure he doesn't walk off
with a paper clip.

2053
01:50:53,625 --> 01:50:55,708
Ooh, yes. See that? Did you hear that?

2054
01:50:57,333 --> 01:50:59,000
See, everybody thinks
Jo's the nice one

2055
01:50:59,083 --> 01:51:00,791
and I'm the bad guy.

2056
01:51:00,875 --> 01:51:02,125
But it's opposite.

2057
01:51:02,875 --> 01:51:05,583
She's the killer and I'm the sweetheart.

2058
01:51:06,916 --> 01:51:09,291
Now I gotta make peace
with the cocksucker.

2059
01:51:09,375 --> 01:51:12,166
Oh, I want
to make up with you.

2060
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:15,541
I need you to endorse me. Please, Tony.

2061
01:51:15,625 --> 01:51:16,916
Please.

2062
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,250
Fucking...

2063
01:51:18,333 --> 01:51:20,708
I'm not gonna get through this.

2064
01:51:20,791 --> 01:51:22,833
You gotta talk to him, that's all.
Just...

2065
01:51:22,916 --> 01:51:24,666
- You gotta deal with it.
<i>- Let the chips fall</i>

2066
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:27,083
<i>- where they may.</i>
- Oh, he is a cocksucker, though.

2067
01:51:28,125 --> 01:51:30,250
If I sat down with him,
would you come along?

2068
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:31,583
What are you talking about?
Of course.

2069
01:51:31,666 --> 01:51:33,125
How am I not gonna go with you?

2070
01:51:42,875 --> 01:51:43,875
Fuck it. Let's go.

2071
01:51:43,958 --> 01:51:45,750
Ah, Jimmy, Jimmy. Give it a chance.

2072
01:51:45,833 --> 01:51:47,666
Give it a chance.
Give it a few more minutes.

2073
01:51:49,875 --> 01:51:51,250
- Just...
- This isn't right.

2074
01:51:51,333 --> 01:51:53,125
This isn't right. You don't do this.

2075
01:51:53,208 --> 01:51:55,166
You don't keep a man waiting.

2076
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:56,500
I know. I know.

2077
01:51:57,750 --> 01:51:59,666
The only time you do

2078
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:01,875
is when you want to say something.

2079
01:52:02,583 --> 01:52:03,416
I know.

2080
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,291
When you want to say "Fuck you."

2081
01:52:05,375 --> 01:52:06,875
That's the only time.

2082
01:52:06,958 --> 01:52:08,916
Here they are.

2083
01:52:11,125 --> 01:52:13,333
Can you believe this weather, Frank? Huh?

2084
01:52:13,416 --> 01:52:16,500
It's 85 degrees outside. Perfect.

2085
01:52:16,583 --> 01:52:18,083
Hey, Tony Jack.

2086
01:52:18,166 --> 01:52:19,000
Jimmy.

2087
01:52:19,083 --> 01:52:22,416
People freezing to death
in New York and look at us, huh?

2088
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,416
Why we don't live here all year round
is what I wanna know.

2089
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:26,416
- Oh.
- Beautiful.

2090
01:52:27,416 --> 01:52:29,500
- It's summer.
- What?

2091
01:52:30,291 --> 01:52:31,291
It's summer.

2092
01:52:32,416 --> 01:52:34,583
People aren't freezing to death
in New York.

2093
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,166
It's summer.

2094
01:52:39,583 --> 01:52:41,458
In my mind,
it's always eight degrees in New York.

2095
01:52:41,541 --> 01:52:42,666
I'm making a point.

2096
01:52:43,333 --> 01:52:44,541
You're making a point.

2097
01:52:45,125 --> 01:52:46,875
Making a point dressing like that?

2098
01:52:47,583 --> 01:52:48,666
Is that how you dress for a meeting?

2099
01:52:50,625 --> 01:52:54,041
This is how you dress in Florida?
In a suit?

2100
01:52:54,125 --> 01:52:55,375
For a meeting?

2101
01:52:56,083 --> 01:52:59,583
Anywhere.
Florida, Timbuktu, I dress in a suit.

2102
01:52:59,666 --> 01:53:00,833
For a meetin'.

2103
01:53:01,583 --> 01:53:03,291
- And you're late.
- What?

2104
01:53:04,375 --> 01:53:05,375
You're late.

2105
01:53:07,541 --> 01:53:08,791
Yeah, there was traffic.

2106
01:53:08,875 --> 01:53:09,791
Yes, traffic.

2107
01:53:09,875 --> 01:53:11,958
Wasn't there traffic?

2108
01:53:12,041 --> 01:53:13,416
- You give me traffic?
- There was traffic.

2109
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:14,583
What do you want from us?

2110
01:53:14,666 --> 01:53:15,916
It was bumper to fuckin' bumper.

2111
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,875
Yeah, yeah. No, it's bad, you know?

2112
01:53:17,958 --> 01:53:18,958
Traffic.

2113
01:53:19,791 --> 01:53:22,833
I never waited for anyone who was late

2114
01:53:23,458 --> 01:53:26,000
more than ten minutes in my life.

2115
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:28,333
I'd say fifteen. Fifteen's right.

2116
01:53:28,416 --> 01:53:29,541
No, ten.

2117
01:53:30,833 --> 01:53:32,500
I don't think so, ten's not enough.

2118
01:53:32,583 --> 01:53:34,375
You have to take traffic into account.

2119
01:53:34,458 --> 01:53:37,291
That's what I'm doing.
I'm taking traffic into account.

2120
01:53:38,083 --> 01:53:39,083
That's why it's ten.

2121
01:53:39,166 --> 01:53:41,166
- I still say 15.
- No, ten.

2122
01:53:42,208 --> 01:53:44,250
Fine. We disagree on that.

2123
01:53:44,333 --> 01:53:45,875
How about twelve and a half minutes?

2124
01:53:45,958 --> 01:53:47,250
There we go, 12.5.

2125
01:53:47,333 --> 01:53:49,458
The middle. Right in the middle.
Beautiful.

2126
01:53:49,541 --> 01:53:51,125
More than ten...

2127
01:53:52,291 --> 01:53:53,541
you're saying something.

2128
01:53:54,791 --> 01:53:56,708
- You saying something to me?
- I'm here.

2129
01:53:57,375 --> 01:53:59,541
- Mmm.
- It says what it says.

2130
01:54:01,083 --> 01:54:02,666
So there it is.

2131
01:54:04,208 --> 01:54:05,333
Where do we go from here?

2132
01:54:08,125 --> 01:54:09,583
Well, what can I do for you?

2133
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,333
I want you...

2134
01:54:16,541 --> 01:54:17,708
I...

2135
01:54:18,666 --> 01:54:20,250
I want you to endorse me...

2136
01:54:22,333 --> 01:54:24,458
for you know what.

2137
01:54:24,541 --> 01:54:27,875
Before we get to that,
let's straighten that other thing up.

2138
01:54:27,958 --> 01:54:30,125
No. The other thing
is none of my business.

2139
01:54:30,208 --> 01:54:32,541
I can't do anything about your pension.

2140
01:54:32,625 --> 01:54:36,166
I can't. Not with Fitz in there.
Fitz is in there, you know.

2141
01:54:36,250 --> 01:54:37,416
- You go to Fitz.
- I did.

2142
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:38,750
- He'll help you out.
- I did.

2143
01:54:38,833 --> 01:54:41,083
He said he'll take care of it,
no questions asked.

2144
01:54:41,166 --> 01:54:43,083
You wouldn't do that but he will.

2145
01:54:43,791 --> 01:54:45,291
I meant the other thing.

2146
01:54:47,166 --> 01:54:48,166
What other thing?

2147
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:49,625
You know.

2148
01:54:49,708 --> 01:54:51,083
I don't know.

2149
01:54:51,166 --> 01:54:52,458
Your apology.

2150
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:55,625
My apology?

2151
01:54:57,375 --> 01:54:58,625
My apology for what?

2152
01:54:58,708 --> 01:55:00,375
For what you said
when you were sitting there

2153
01:55:00,458 --> 01:55:02,666
eating your ice cream
like some fucking king.

2154
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,333
That was an ethnic slur. "You people."

2155
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:08,958
- Did you know what he said?
- Nah, I mean, I heard...

2156
01:55:09,041 --> 01:55:11,333
I heard you had an altercation
in the can, but I don't know.

2157
01:55:11,416 --> 01:55:13,041
Yeah, "you people."

2158
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:16,250
That's what you said. Right, Jim?

2159
01:55:17,833 --> 01:55:20,041
"You people." Am I beneath you?

2160
01:55:22,125 --> 01:55:23,291
Definitely.

2161
01:55:23,375 --> 01:55:25,333
- Jimmy, come on.
- Jimmy, what're you doing?

2162
01:55:25,416 --> 01:55:27,458
Don't forget, "you people"
got you where you are.

2163
01:55:27,541 --> 01:55:29,416
Oh, don't tell me that, you fucking...

2164
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:30,666
That's your problem, Jimmy.

2165
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:32,875
Your problem is you're a piece of shit.

2166
01:55:32,958 --> 01:55:33,875
Jimmy, come on.

2167
01:55:33,958 --> 01:55:35,833
- Jimmy, what are you doin'?
- Jesus, Jimmy, come on.

2168
01:55:35,916 --> 01:55:37,916
I asked for your endorsement
and you're giving me...

2169
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,041
I asked for your apology.

2170
01:55:39,125 --> 01:55:41,500
Who the fuck are you to apologize to?

2171
01:55:41,583 --> 01:55:42,875
Jimmy...

2172
01:55:42,958 --> 01:55:44,333
Who the fuck are you?

2173
01:55:44,416 --> 01:55:45,416
Be gentle.

2174
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,250
- I don't need this.
- Let's just sit down. Tony.

2175
01:55:47,333 --> 01:55:49,291
I need this? I need you?

2176
01:55:49,375 --> 01:55:50,791
- Yeah, you need me.
- Oh, please.

2177
01:55:50,875 --> 01:55:52,333
Jimmy, come on.
You're asking him for something.

2178
01:55:52,416 --> 01:55:55,333
The guy gets me nervous.
He talks about things that get me upset.

2179
01:55:55,416 --> 01:55:56,583
Take it easy. Everybody's here.

2180
01:55:56,666 --> 01:55:59,208
Let's have the fucking meeting.
Come on.

2181
01:55:59,291 --> 01:56:00,875
- Let's talk.
- That's all.

2182
01:56:00,958 --> 01:56:02,083
He's here.

2183
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:08,583
Was this the altercation
youse had in the can?

2184
01:56:08,666 --> 01:56:09,625
Yeah, it was something like this.

2185
01:56:09,708 --> 01:56:11,375
We... We got to arm wrestling.

2186
01:56:12,541 --> 01:56:13,416
He lost.

2187
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:15,458
I lost. You should see his ribs.

2188
01:56:16,583 --> 01:56:17,416
Why don't you just talk about

2189
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,916
what you need to talk about.

2190
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,250
What do you want me to do?

2191
01:56:22,208 --> 01:56:23,041
I said, "you people."

2192
01:56:23,125 --> 01:56:25,000
What do you want me to do,
apologize for it?

2193
01:56:25,083 --> 01:56:27,166
That's exactly what I want,
Jimmy. An apology.

2194
01:56:27,791 --> 01:56:29,666
I'll apologize for it.

2195
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:30,875
That's all I want.

2196
01:56:32,541 --> 01:56:34,125
After you apologize

2197
01:56:34,708 --> 01:56:36,000
for being late,

2198
01:56:36,750 --> 01:56:39,041
you motherfucking wop cocksucker.

2199
01:56:39,125 --> 01:56:42,458
Jimmy, are you
out of your fucking mind?

2200
01:56:42,541 --> 01:56:44,333
I'll apologize for being late

2201
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:46,791
after I kidnap your granddaughter,
rip her guts out,

2202
01:56:46,875 --> 01:56:48,500
and send them to you
in a fucking envelope!

2203
01:56:52,916 --> 01:56:54,833
Get him off! Come on!

2204
01:56:54,916 --> 01:56:55,833
I'll fucking kill him!

2205
01:56:55,916 --> 01:56:57,166
Come on, Tony! Jesus!

2206
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,708
You think Russ would...

2207
01:57:04,791 --> 01:57:06,541
would do something about this guy?

2208
01:57:07,458 --> 01:57:09,125
Ah, that's complicated.

2209
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:11,458
Yeah. It's complicated.

2210
01:57:11,541 --> 01:57:13,875
I'd like to clip the motherfucker myself,
you know,

2211
01:57:13,958 --> 01:57:16,250
- get the okay from them. But...
- I know.

2212
01:57:16,333 --> 01:57:17,791
This guy's gotta go.

2213
01:57:18,458 --> 01:57:19,541
- He's gotta go, Frank.
- Yeah.

2214
01:57:20,375 --> 01:57:22,208
I'm not gonna get the okay to do that.

2215
01:57:23,666 --> 01:57:25,541
Frank, just talk to the guy.

2216
01:57:25,625 --> 01:57:27,708
Okay? Just talk to him.

2217
01:57:36,458 --> 01:57:37,541
<i>These guys from Jersey keep</i>

2218
01:57:37,625 --> 01:57:40,000
<i>fucking calling me about this bullshit
between these two guys.</i>

2219
01:57:40,083 --> 01:57:42,500
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told them.

2220
01:57:43,333 --> 01:57:44,166
I don't approve

2221
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:45,833
- of what Pro said about Jimmy.
- No.

2222
01:57:45,916 --> 01:57:48,833
I mean, who talks like that
about a person's grandchildren?

2223
01:57:49,375 --> 01:57:51,166
- It's not fucking right.
- No.

2224
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:57,708
But Pro isn't nobody.

2225
01:57:58,916 --> 01:58:00,208
Jimmy should know that.

2226
01:58:00,291 --> 01:58:01,541
Hey, what am I gonna go?

2227
01:58:01,625 --> 01:58:04,375
I'm not gonna tell this guy
what he can or can't fucking say,

2228
01:58:04,458 --> 01:58:05,708
like he's a child.

2229
01:58:05,791 --> 01:58:07,083
Well, listen.

2230
01:58:07,166 --> 01:58:09,083
Jimmy don't mean nothing.
He just gets upset.

2231
01:58:09,166 --> 01:58:11,000
Russ, come on,
we all know he's a fucking hothead.

2232
01:58:11,083 --> 01:58:12,416
We're all hotheads once in a while.

2233
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:14,750
Yeah, but Jimmy says things
he shouldn't say sometimes.

2234
01:58:14,833 --> 01:58:16,375
Yeah. We all do that too.

2235
01:58:16,458 --> 01:58:18,333
Well, somebody should just calm him down.

2236
01:58:23,083 --> 01:58:24,708
Yeah, well, that... I'm gonna...

2237
01:58:24,791 --> 01:58:26,791
I'm gonna calm him down.
He's difficult, but...

2238
01:58:26,875 --> 01:58:28,791
Maybe this could help him calm down.

2239
01:58:28,875 --> 01:58:30,666
You could tell him
that I always liked him.

2240
01:58:31,666 --> 01:58:32,666
Huh?

2241
01:58:32,750 --> 01:58:35,750
And I won't stand in his way
of him trying to get his job back.

2242
01:58:35,833 --> 01:58:36,958
I will. I will tell him that, Tony.

2243
01:58:37,041 --> 01:58:38,000
- Okay?
- Yes.

2244
01:58:38,083 --> 01:58:40,666
That's not making me calm down.

2245
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:42,000
Standing by me.

2246
01:58:42,541 --> 01:58:44,625
What the fuck does that mean?

2247
01:58:44,708 --> 01:58:48,125
Standing by me ain't the same thing
as doing something

2248
01:58:48,208 --> 01:58:51,708
about some out-of-control
fucking psycho!

2249
01:58:52,333 --> 01:58:55,208
Jimmy, the Little Guy ain't a nobody.
You gotta understand that.

2250
01:58:55,291 --> 01:58:56,958
- He ain't a nobody.
- He's a cocksucker.

2251
01:58:57,041 --> 01:58:58,750
Fitz is a cocksucker.

2252
01:58:59,625 --> 01:59:02,083
I'm gonna deal
with both these cocksuckers...

2253
01:59:02,166 --> 01:59:03,291
myself!

2254
01:59:04,125 --> 01:59:06,208
This used to be my office.

2255
01:59:06,291 --> 01:59:09,375
Go look for Frank Fitzsimmons there.
You're not gonna find him.

2256
01:59:09,458 --> 01:59:12,458
That's because he travels
all over the country

2257
01:59:12,541 --> 01:59:15,750
looking for goddamn golf courses
because that's what he does.

2258
01:59:15,833 --> 01:59:16,875
<i>He plays golf.</i>

2259
01:59:16,958 --> 01:59:20,791
<i>Who is he to run around with Nixon,
run around with the attorney general?</i>

2260
01:59:20,875 --> 01:59:24,958
<i>He does this and collects full-time salary
while he's doing it.</i>

2261
01:59:25,041 --> 01:59:26,291
<i>Now, how do you do that?</i>

2262
01:59:26,375 --> 01:59:29,375
<i>There's not enough hours
in a day to do this job.</i>

2263
01:59:29,458 --> 01:59:31,625
<i>I was sent to prison for fraud.</i>

2264
01:59:32,333 --> 01:59:34,041
<i>This is fraud, what he's doing.</i>

2265
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,291
<i>So what's Fitz's answer to Jimmy?</i>

2266
01:59:38,375 --> 01:59:39,708
<i>He does it by sending a message</i>

2267
01:59:39,791 --> 01:59:42,500
<i>to Jimmy's old friend, Dave Johnson.</i>

2268
01:59:42,583 --> 01:59:45,833
<i>Now, Dave Johnson, he ran Local 299.</i>

2269
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:49,041
<i>This was the message.</i>

2270
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:54,416
<i>So this is how</i>

2271
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:57,333
Fitz says he wants my old pal Dave Johnson

2272
01:59:57,416 --> 02:00:00,041
to step down so he can have his son

2273
02:00:00,125 --> 02:00:02,625
take over Local 299.

2274
02:00:03,125 --> 02:00:07,333
This is how I'm gonna say no to his son,
little fucking Fitz.

2275
02:00:08,791 --> 02:00:09,958
She looked a lot like your mother.

2276
02:00:10,041 --> 02:00:11,875
- About the same size.
- Pops, come on, you told me...

2277
02:00:11,958 --> 02:00:14,291
Good-looking girl.
She was a good-looking girl.

2278
02:00:14,375 --> 02:00:16,666
But I had no idea
that it wasn't your mother.

2279
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:17,583
It was dark and...

2280
02:00:26,916 --> 02:00:29,458
<i>This is how</i>
<i>Fitz says he doesn't like</i>

2281
02:00:29,541 --> 02:00:31,791
<i>who I say runs the 299.</i>

2282
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:34,041
<i>By firing my wife from her</i>

2283
02:00:34,125 --> 02:00:37,958
forty-eight-fucking-thousand-
dollar-a-year union job!

2284
02:01:21,166 --> 02:01:23,541
Son of a bitch. Fuck him!

2285
02:01:23,625 --> 02:01:25,583
<i>He had</i>
<i>previously taped the locks</i>

2286
02:01:25,666 --> 02:01:28,375
<i>on the entry door
of the basement of the Watergate...</i>

2287
02:01:28,458 --> 02:01:29,916
- What are you looking at?
- Uh, it's...

2288
02:01:31,083 --> 02:01:32,166
It's Big Ears.

2289
02:01:32,708 --> 02:01:35,458
<i>He had noticed
that the tape had been removed,</i>

2290
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:38,833
<i>and he re-taped the door.</i>

2291
02:01:39,458 --> 02:01:40,291
Big Ears?

2292
02:01:41,125 --> 02:01:42,291
That's, uh...

2293
02:01:42,375 --> 02:01:44,041
Somebody I met a long time ago. Just...

2294
02:01:46,583 --> 02:01:47,791
His ears ain't so big.

2295
02:01:47,875 --> 02:01:50,875
<i>...at that point,</i>
<i>I said "Let us junk it,"</i>

2296
02:01:50,958 --> 02:01:52,541
<i>meaning let us scrap the operation.</i>

2297
02:01:52,625 --> 02:01:56,750
<i>Mr. Liddy and Mr. McCord
talked between themselves</i>

2298
02:01:56,833 --> 02:01:59,583
<i>and the decision was made to go.</i>

2299
02:01:59,666 --> 02:02:00,958
<i>I thought it was very foolhardy...</i>

2300
02:02:01,041 --> 02:02:02,916
<i>So, Frank Fitzsimmons,</i>
<i>in your opinion,</i>

2301
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,416
should he remain
president of the Teamsters?

2302
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:06,333
Absolutely not.

2303
02:02:06,416 --> 02:02:09,500
Frank Fitzsimmons
has sold his union out

2304
02:02:09,583 --> 02:02:11,125
to his underworld pals.

2305
02:02:11,208 --> 02:02:12,833
<i>The mob controls him,</i>

2306
02:02:13,416 --> 02:02:15,458
<i>which means it controls our pension fund.</i>

2307
02:02:15,541 --> 02:02:19,625
<i>I'm talking about a billion dollars
in low or no-interest loans</i>

2308
02:02:19,708 --> 02:02:22,333
<i>this man has given to known racketeers</i>

2309
02:02:22,416 --> 02:02:24,041
<i>for their illegal enterprises.</i>

2310
02:02:24,125 --> 02:02:25,000
<i>Not anymore.</i>

2311
02:02:25,083 --> 02:02:28,250
<i>It's time for the rats to abandon ship.</i>

2312
02:02:28,791 --> 02:02:29,833
Is he serious?

2313
02:02:30,333 --> 02:02:32,416
Not Jimmy. This is all publicity.

2314
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:34,458
He's running for office.
He's putting on a show.

2315
02:02:34,541 --> 02:02:37,291
Yeah, it's all puff.
It's got no substance, nothing.

2316
02:02:37,375 --> 02:02:39,291
Maybe he means what he says.

2317
02:02:39,375 --> 02:02:41,958
- Tony, he's campaigning.
- Russ.

2318
02:02:42,041 --> 02:02:43,875
He's liable to say any fucking thing.

2319
02:02:43,958 --> 02:02:45,666
I don't care
if he's campaigning.

2320
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:47,000
He can't talk like that.

2321
02:02:47,083 --> 02:02:48,250
It's no fucking good.

2322
02:02:48,333 --> 02:02:51,375
- I understand what you're saying.
- You know what he should do, Russ?

2323
02:02:51,458 --> 02:02:53,583
He should cash in that big pension of his.

2324
02:02:53,666 --> 02:02:56,291
Spend more time with his grandchildren.

2325
02:02:56,375 --> 02:02:58,291
He got a beautiful family, no?

2326
02:02:59,333 --> 02:03:00,375
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, right.

2327
02:03:00,458 --> 02:03:01,791
Maybe he should relax.

2328
02:03:03,958 --> 02:03:05,791
Word should get back to him.

2329
02:03:10,333 --> 02:03:11,708
<i>I... I just wanna say...</i>

2330
02:03:11,791 --> 02:03:14,083
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

2331
02:03:14,625 --> 02:03:15,958
But there I was with some people

2332
02:03:16,041 --> 02:03:17,875
and they were saying,
and you know who they are...

2333
02:03:17,958 --> 02:03:19,083
They were saying...

2334
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:23,041
"Please tell Jimmy we love the guy."

2335
02:03:23,875 --> 02:03:26,083
We don't want any problem.

2336
02:03:26,166 --> 02:03:27,833
We just think that he should...

2337
02:03:28,875 --> 02:03:30,666
maybe enjoy his grandchildren,

2338
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:33,208
"enjoy his pension, enjoy his life as is."

2339
02:03:33,291 --> 02:03:34,875
Go no further, Frank.

2340
02:03:36,791 --> 02:03:37,666
Who said it?

2341
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:41,958
- It don't matter who said it.
- Oh, it matters.

2342
02:03:42,041 --> 02:03:43,791
- Was it Russell? No.
- No.

2343
02:03:43,875 --> 02:03:46,583
Of course it's not Russell.
It's that little cocksucker

2344
02:03:46,666 --> 02:03:48,625
from the Miami fiasco?

2345
02:03:48,708 --> 02:03:49,833
- No?
- No.

2346
02:03:49,916 --> 02:03:51,666
Not him. No?

2347
02:03:51,750 --> 02:03:52,666
Then who?

2348
02:03:55,333 --> 02:03:56,750
I'm gonna tell you.

2349
02:03:56,833 --> 02:03:57,958
Tony.

2350
02:03:58,041 --> 02:03:58,958
Tony?

2351
02:03:59,708 --> 02:04:01,000
Which Tony?

2352
02:04:01,083 --> 02:04:03,083
They're all named Tony.

2353
02:04:03,166 --> 02:04:05,125
I mean, what's the matter with Italians?

2354
02:04:05,208 --> 02:04:07,666
They can only think of one name.

2355
02:04:08,666 --> 02:04:09,625
The other Tony.

2356
02:04:11,583 --> 02:04:12,625
What Tony?

2357
02:04:15,583 --> 02:04:16,666
Salerno.

2358
02:04:25,375 --> 02:04:26,916
Well, what can I say?

2359
02:04:28,958 --> 02:04:30,125
Jimmy, I'm trying to help you.

2360
02:04:30,208 --> 02:04:32,583
- I'm trying to tell you something.
- I know you are.

2361
02:04:32,666 --> 02:04:35,208
Frank, don't even think about it.

2362
02:04:35,833 --> 02:04:37,333
I don't keep my mouth shut...

2363
02:04:37,416 --> 02:04:38,750
- I know that.
- for anyone.

2364
02:04:38,833 --> 02:04:42,333
I know that, you know that,
they don't know that.

2365
02:04:44,083 --> 02:04:47,541
That's who I am, that's what I am
and that's what I'm gonna do.

2366
02:04:49,291 --> 02:04:50,791
Somebody can tell him that.

2367
02:04:50,875 --> 02:04:52,166
He said that?

2368
02:04:52,958 --> 02:04:54,166
In so many words, you know.

2369
02:04:54,250 --> 02:04:56,291
Well, before he says something like that,

2370
02:04:56,375 --> 02:04:58,000
he should remember
that Joe Gallo liked to make

2371
02:04:58,083 --> 02:04:59,791
a lot of fucking noise, too.

2372
02:04:59,875 --> 02:05:01,416
Somebody should tell him that.

2373
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:02,791
Who said?

2374
02:05:04,333 --> 02:05:05,708
- Tony.
- He said that?

2375
02:05:05,791 --> 02:05:08,166
Oh, that's it. That does it.

2376
02:05:09,625 --> 02:05:11,333
I'm never gonna retire now.

2377
02:05:12,583 --> 02:05:13,958
Somebody can tell him that.

2378
02:05:14,041 --> 02:05:15,666
Jimmy, I did tell him.
I told him over and over.

2379
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:18,375
All right, you told him.
Let's stop this, then. Forget it.

2380
02:05:18,458 --> 02:05:19,666
Enough.

2381
02:05:20,416 --> 02:05:22,208
Let me enjoy my ice cream here.

2382
02:05:27,833 --> 02:05:28,791
What's the matter?

2383
02:05:29,458 --> 02:05:30,708
Nothing.

2384
02:05:30,791 --> 02:05:31,666
What?

2385
02:05:31,750 --> 02:05:33,000
- Oh, nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

2386
02:05:33,083 --> 02:05:34,708
Come on, you're thinking something. What?

2387
02:05:35,458 --> 02:05:37,041
I just...

2388
02:05:38,250 --> 02:05:39,958
What? Come on. What are you doing?

2389
02:05:40,041 --> 02:05:42,000
- It ain't the right time.
- What do you mean?

2390
02:05:42,083 --> 02:05:43,833
It is the right time.
What isn't the right time?

2391
02:05:43,916 --> 02:05:45,041
Say it.

2392
02:05:47,083 --> 02:05:49,041
Uh, the Local's putting together

2393
02:05:49,125 --> 02:05:51,666
a testimonial dinner for me and...

2394
02:05:51,750 --> 02:05:53,666
A testimonial dinner for you, that's good.

2395
02:05:53,750 --> 02:05:55,791
Yeah. But later... Later, when...

2396
02:05:56,375 --> 02:05:57,291
What's the matter?

2397
02:06:01,708 --> 02:06:04,291
Uh, I was gonna ask you if you would...

2398
02:06:04,375 --> 02:06:06,000
present the award to me.

2399
02:06:07,291 --> 02:06:08,416
Well...

2400
02:06:09,250 --> 02:06:10,791
That's nice of you, Frank.

2401
02:06:10,875 --> 02:06:13,208
Really. That's nice of you.
And, you know...

2402
02:06:13,791 --> 02:06:14,833
Who's gonna be there?

2403
02:06:14,916 --> 02:06:17,541
- Everybody.
- Tony.

2404
02:06:18,375 --> 02:06:21,708
Tony, Tony, Tony, and Tony, huh?

2405
02:06:21,791 --> 02:06:24,708
Everybody from Downtown.

2406
02:06:25,791 --> 02:06:28,250
Nah. Nah, it ain't a good idea.
Everybody's gonna be there.

2407
02:06:28,333 --> 02:06:31,041
People... You're gonna be uncomfortable.

2408
02:06:31,125 --> 02:06:34,208
I don't give a fuck who's there.

2409
02:06:34,291 --> 02:06:35,708
We gonna let those cocksuckers

2410
02:06:35,791 --> 02:06:38,791
keep me from your big night?
There's no way.

2411
02:06:38,875 --> 02:06:40,000
No.

2412
02:06:40,083 --> 02:06:43,833
I'm gonna be there.
And I'll be honored to be there.

2413
02:06:43,916 --> 02:06:45,125
You deserve this.

2414
02:06:45,208 --> 02:06:47,041
- Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you.
- Yeah.

2415
02:06:50,291 --> 02:06:52,750
- Ooh, that Mo Dean.
- Yeah.

2416
02:06:53,541 --> 02:06:55,250
- She's a good-looking broad.
- She's nice.

2417
02:06:55,333 --> 02:06:56,750
<i>I did not realize</i>

2418
02:06:56,833 --> 02:06:58,791
<i>that Mr. Howard Hunt
worked most of the time</i>

2419
02:06:58,875 --> 02:07:01,916
<i>while he was at the White House
in the plumbers unit until after June...</i>

2420
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,166
He's a rat, but that's, you know...

2421
02:07:04,250 --> 02:07:05,708
He's a rat. But he's a smart rat.

2422
02:07:08,583 --> 02:07:10,625
We've got a great crowd

2423
02:07:10,708 --> 02:07:12,625
for Frank tonight, huh?
Come on. Give it up.

2424
02:07:16,041 --> 02:07:20,125
That's because Frank is a man
with a lot of friends.

2425
02:07:22,291 --> 02:07:25,166
From his war buddies
who fought with him in Italy

2426
02:07:25,250 --> 02:07:27,583
under General George Patton...

2427
02:07:29,083 --> 02:07:32,250
to the drivers, national organizers,

2428
02:07:32,333 --> 02:07:35,125
business agents, local presidents,

2429
02:07:35,208 --> 02:07:38,791
joint committee chairmen,
and regional trustees,

2430
02:07:38,875 --> 02:07:41,083
we are all friends

2431
02:07:41,166 --> 02:07:42,958
of Frank's tonight.

2432
02:07:43,041 --> 02:07:44,500
Friends of Frank.

2433
02:07:46,416 --> 02:07:49,250
Like NAACP president Cecil Moore.

2434
02:07:50,791 --> 02:07:52,958
District Attorney Emmett Fitzpatrick.

2435
02:07:54,416 --> 02:07:56,583
Philadelphia mayor Frank Rizzo.

2436
02:07:58,208 --> 02:08:00,041
Hey, they like you, Frank.

2437
02:08:00,791 --> 02:08:02,958
And, of course, our featured speaker,

2438
02:08:03,041 --> 02:08:04,750
James Riddell Hoffa.

2439
02:08:12,416 --> 02:08:14,583
And meanwhile, outside in the trees,

2440
02:08:14,666 --> 02:08:16,291
we got the FBI.

2441
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:19,041
Somebody wanna check on them?

2442
02:08:21,208 --> 02:08:23,083
Now, let me tell you
about the first time I met Frank.

2443
02:08:23,166 --> 02:08:24,916
He took me out to a steak dinner,

2444
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,458
and he asked me, he said,
"How do you like your steak?"

2445
02:08:27,541 --> 02:08:29,416
I said, "I like it rare."
He said, "Me too."

2446
02:08:29,500 --> 02:08:31,583
Well, they bring out the steaks.
Mine's rare.

2447
02:08:31,666 --> 02:08:33,500
Frank's was still walking
from the kitchen.

2448
02:08:35,458 --> 02:08:37,458
He turns to me, he said, "Well, you know",

2449
02:08:37,541 --> 02:08:39,500
I'm an animal lover.
I don't wanna hurt it."

2450
02:08:41,875 --> 02:08:42,875
He's an animal lover.

2451
02:08:46,458 --> 02:08:47,458
Oh.

2452
02:09:07,416 --> 02:09:11,166
This guy is not even the goddamn president
and he's holding up people's loans.

2453
02:09:12,125 --> 02:09:13,875
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

2454
02:09:14,375 --> 02:09:15,583
And how's he supposed to do that?

2455
02:09:15,666 --> 02:09:16,791
Because his guys
are holding 'em back loans

2456
02:09:16,875 --> 02:09:19,125
on Carlos's new hotel in New Orleans,

2457
02:09:19,208 --> 02:09:21,166
the add-on that we're doing at Caesars.

2458
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:28,125
- And what's Fitz doing all this time?
- Fitz?

2459
02:09:28,208 --> 02:09:29,958
Yeah, he's supposed to help
with this shit.

2460
02:09:30,041 --> 02:09:32,041
The money comes
from the Pension Fund trustees.

2461
02:09:32,125 --> 02:09:33,708
They gotta sign off on it.

2462
02:09:33,791 --> 02:09:35,875
They're supposed to be rubber-stamping
what Fitz says.

2463
02:09:35,958 --> 02:09:38,250
- Right, right. Yeah.
- Except Jimmy

2464
02:09:38,333 --> 02:09:40,583
has a couple of them
to stop rubber-stamping.

2465
02:09:42,666 --> 02:09:44,541
The son of a bitch.

2466
02:09:44,625 --> 02:09:46,041
I thought we took care of that.

2467
02:09:47,583 --> 02:09:48,833
You know
what he told somebody?

2468
02:09:48,916 --> 02:09:50,958
He goes, once Fitz is out and he's in,

2469
02:09:51,041 --> 02:09:53,125
he's gonna call in the old loans.

2470
02:09:53,208 --> 02:09:56,875
Hotels, casinos, real estate,
no matter what it is.

2471
02:09:56,958 --> 02:09:59,125
And if you don't have his money
and interest in two seconds,

2472
02:09:59,208 --> 02:10:00,416
he's taking 'em over.

2473
02:10:01,041 --> 02:10:02,000
We can't have that.

2474
02:10:04,791 --> 02:10:06,708
- He said that?
- He said that.

2475
02:10:06,791 --> 02:10:08,208
You sure he said that, Tony?

2476
02:10:08,291 --> 02:10:09,791
He said that.

2477
02:10:09,875 --> 02:10:11,791
Everything I'm telling you, yeah, he said.

2478
02:10:11,875 --> 02:10:13,958
I mean, who does he think he is? Castro?

02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:43,958
Oh, if it's not about money,

2489
02:10:44,041 --> 02:10:45,833
then I'm really having
trouble understanding,

2490
02:10:45,916 --> 02:10:47,833
because I don't know
what all the talk is about.

2491
02:10:48,583 --> 02:10:49,750
It's my union.

2492
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,625
- Is that hard to understand?
- No, no.

2493
02:10:52,708 --> 02:10:55,416
It's your union, that's right.
It'll always be your union.

2494
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:57,291
You could step down and still run it.

2495
02:10:57,375 --> 02:10:59,291
No, you don't step down.
What do you mean?

2496
02:10:59,375 --> 02:11:01,458
Russ, you don't step down
to run a union.

2497
02:11:01,541 --> 02:11:02,875
You step down to go to your grave.

2498
02:11:03,416 --> 02:11:05,000
Well, listen.

2499
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:08,125
I still think...
I can't help but think, I'm sorry,

2500
02:11:08,208 --> 02:11:10,291
but is there another reason or something?

2501
02:11:10,375 --> 02:11:13,166
This is my union!
What do you mean, "another reason"?

2502
02:11:14,625 --> 02:11:16,166
This is my union.

2503
02:11:16,250 --> 02:11:19,833
All right? Let's start with that
and then try to understand things.

2504
02:11:19,916 --> 02:11:21,833
Listen, some people,

2505
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:25,333
not me, but some people,

2506
02:11:25,958 --> 02:11:27,458
they're a little concerned.

2507
02:11:28,250 --> 02:11:30,708
Some people, not me,
they think that you might...

2508
02:11:31,666 --> 02:11:32,750
I might...

2509
02:11:32,833 --> 02:11:36,875
You might be demonstrating
a failure to show appreciation.

2510
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:41,000
I'm not showing appreciation?

2511
02:11:42,041 --> 02:11:43,958
According to, you know, some people.

2512
02:11:44,041 --> 02:11:46,916
I went to school for five fucking years.

2513
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,500
- Yes, you did.
- Five fucking years.

2514
02:11:51,041 --> 02:11:53,041
I didn't name one fucking name.

2515
02:11:53,125 --> 02:11:54,666
- You did the right thing.
- I did the right thing.

2516
02:11:54,750 --> 02:11:55,625
You did the right thing.

2517
02:11:55,708 --> 02:11:57,500
I sat there every day with that

2518
02:11:57,583 --> 02:12:01,750
whining cocksucker from New Jersey,
talking to me

2519
02:12:01,833 --> 02:12:04,416
about his woes, his problems,

2520
02:12:05,333 --> 02:12:08,000
and all I wanted to do
was finish my ice cream in peace.

2521
02:12:09,625 --> 02:12:10,625
This cocksucker

2522
02:12:10,708 --> 02:12:14,125
shows up at a meeting 15 minutes late,

2523
02:12:14,916 --> 02:12:16,625
wearing fucking shorts!

2524
02:12:17,625 --> 02:12:20,083
- Who wears shorts to a meeting?
- Nobody.

2525
02:12:20,166 --> 02:12:21,625
- That's right.
- Nobody.

2526
02:12:22,541 --> 02:12:24,250
I'm not showing appreciation?

2527
02:12:24,333 --> 02:12:25,166
It's not me.

2528
02:12:25,875 --> 02:12:26,875
According to some people...

2529
02:12:26,958 --> 02:12:29,166
No, I know it's not you. Some people...

2530
02:12:29,708 --> 02:12:32,083
Some people say
I'm not showing appreciation?

2531
02:12:32,166 --> 02:12:33,458
Well, then fuck them.

2532
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:35,791
I'm trying to help you, Jim.

2533
02:12:35,875 --> 02:12:36,875
I know you are.

2534
02:12:37,583 --> 02:12:39,541
But nobody threatens Hoffa.

2535
02:12:39,625 --> 02:12:41,666

<i>♪ The time is now ♪</i>

2538
02:13:01,375 --> 02:13:03,708
He has done it as a driver,

2539
02:13:03,791 --> 02:13:06,125
he has done it as an organizer,

2540
02:13:06,208 --> 02:13:08,958
and I don't think
many of you here know this,

2541
02:13:09,041 --> 02:13:11,583
but Frank holds a record.

2542
02:13:12,458 --> 02:13:16,166
It's most arrests on the picket line.

2543
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:20,291
Twenty-six times

2544
02:13:20,375 --> 02:13:23,625
in 24 hours, beating my record.

2545
02:13:26,041 --> 02:13:29,500
There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
There's no exaggeration.

2546
02:13:31,083 --> 02:13:32,791
He is a union man

2547
02:13:32,875 --> 02:13:35,666
to his bones.

2548
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:37,291
Which side are you on?

2549
02:13:37,375 --> 02:13:38,833
Your side!

2550
02:13:38,916 --> 02:13:39,916
Whose side?

2551
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Your side!

2552
02:13:41,083 --> 02:13:42,125
My side.

2553
02:13:42,208 --> 02:13:43,125
Your side.

2554
02:13:43,208 --> 02:13:44,875
- His side.
- Yeah!

2555
02:13:44,958 --> 02:13:46,208
There it is.

2556
02:13:46,958 --> 02:13:50,541
And so, it is an honor for me
to be here tonight

2557
02:13:50,625 --> 02:13:52,416
to present this award

2558
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:54,666
to my dear friend,

2559
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:56,916
Mr. Frank Sheeran!

2560
02:14:06,458 --> 02:14:08,708
Thank you, Jimmy, thank you so much.

2561
02:14:09,666 --> 02:14:12,125
And thank you to my lovely wife Reenie

2562
02:14:12,208 --> 02:14:14,583
for being here with me.

2563
02:14:14,666 --> 02:14:17,333
My lovely, sweet, adorable daughters,

2564
02:14:17,416 --> 02:14:18,833
Maryanne,

2565
02:14:18,916 --> 02:14:20,541
Dolores, Connie,

2566
02:14:20,625 --> 02:14:22,916
Peggy, for putting up with me

2567
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,666
for all these years.

2568
02:14:25,750 --> 02:14:28,791
And, Jimmy, I can't tell you
what this means to me

2569
02:14:28,875 --> 02:14:30,166
to get this honor from you.

2570
02:14:30,958 --> 02:14:34,208
It's the highlight of my life.
Thank you very, very much.

2571
02:14:34,291 --> 02:14:37,541
And this man, James Riddell Hoffa,

2572
02:14:38,291 --> 02:14:40,541
is the guy that gets the job done.

2573
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,750
I'm behind you, Jimmy.

2574
02:14:44,833 --> 02:14:45,875
All the way.

2575
02:14:47,791 --> 02:14:49,000
In any case,

2576
02:14:49,083 --> 02:14:51,458
from the deepest part of my heart,
I thank you all.

2577
02:14:51,541 --> 02:14:53,333
'Cause I don't really deserve all this.

2578
02:14:54,458 --> 02:14:57,125
But I have bursitis
and I don't deserve that either.

2579
02:14:58,916 --> 02:15:01,208
Thank you all tonight
and thank you for coming.

2580
02:15:01,291 --> 02:15:02,291
Good night.

2581
02:15:13,625 --> 02:15:15,333
What happened to "Say cheese"?

2582
02:15:15,916 --> 02:15:16,833

2590
02:16:32,708 --> 02:16:35,415
Only three people
in the world have one of these.

2591
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:37,875
And only one of them is Irish.

2592
02:16:37,958 --> 02:16:39,375
I have one.

2593
02:16:39,458 --> 02:16:40,790
Angelo has one.

2594
02:16:43,333 --> 02:16:44,458
Now you have one.

2595
02:16:49,333 --> 02:16:50,500
This is beautiful.

2596
02:16:54,583 --> 02:16:57,250
I... I don't...
I don't know what to say, Russ. It's...

2597
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:00,125
Slip it on. See how it looks.

2598
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:05,915
- Feel good?
- Yeah.

2599
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,958
You know how strong I made you?
You know how strong?

2600
02:17:12,708 --> 02:17:13,833
You're my kid.

2601
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,415
Nobody... Nobody can fuck with you.

2602
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:18,583
Nobody.

2603
02:17:44,333 --> 02:17:45,875
Listen, Frank.

2604
02:17:46,665 --> 02:17:49,750
Things have gotten out of hand
with our friend again.

2605
02:17:50,915 --> 02:17:54,208
And some people are having
serious problems with him.

2606
02:17:55,083 --> 02:17:57,708
And, uh, it's at a point where

2607
02:17:57,790 --> 02:18:00,333
you're gonna have to talk to him
and tell him

2608
02:18:01,333 --> 02:18:02,833
it's what it is.

2609
02:18:05,540 --> 02:18:06,625
What it is?

2610
02:18:06,708 --> 02:18:08,708
Yes. It's what they want.

2611
02:18:09,290 --> 02:18:10,540
It's where it's gotten.

2612
02:18:12,125 --> 02:18:14,875
You're close to him.
Maybe he'll listen to you.

2613
02:18:14,958 --> 02:18:16,375
You know I talked to him.

2614
02:18:16,458 --> 02:18:18,458
He's a tough guy to talk to.
You know him.

2615
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:20,125
He has no choice.

2616
02:18:20,208 --> 02:18:21,750
He has no choice.

2617
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:23,875
These are the higher-ups.

2618
02:18:25,875 --> 02:18:28,040
Well, he's a higher-up too.
I mean... No?

2619
02:18:29,165 --> 02:18:30,875
Not like this. You know that.

2620
02:18:30,958 --> 02:18:32,665
Oh, come on now, Frank.

2621
02:18:35,875 --> 02:18:37,915
If they can whack a president,

2622
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,833
they can whack a president of the union.

2623
02:18:41,833 --> 02:18:44,333
You know it and I know it.

2624
02:18:54,708 --> 02:18:56,500
I talk to this guy,
I talk to him, I talk to him,

2625
02:18:56,583 --> 02:18:58,040
I talk to him, he don't listen.

2626
02:18:58,125 --> 02:19:00,458
But he's gotta listen now.
I gotta make him listen.

2627
02:19:02,833 --> 02:19:06,000
That ain't right. He's...
He's a fucking knucklehead.

2628
02:19:17,083 --> 02:19:18,083
- Jimmy.
- Yeah.

2629
02:19:18,165 --> 02:19:19,790
I talked to Russ.

2630
02:19:19,875 --> 02:19:21,083
He talked to Tony.

2631
02:19:21,165 --> 02:19:22,375
He means what he's saying.

2632
02:19:23,375 --> 02:19:25,333
- Who? Russ?
- No, Tony.

2633
02:19:25,415 --> 02:19:26,540
- Tony?
- Yeah.

2634
02:19:27,415 --> 02:19:28,875
Well, I mean what I'm saying.

2635
02:19:29,790 --> 02:19:33,500
He can't seem to get that
through his fat, fucking Sicilian head.

2636
02:19:33,583 --> 02:19:35,333
Can he? Don't worry about it.

2637
02:19:35,415 --> 02:19:36,665
What's the matter with you?

2638
02:19:36,750 --> 02:19:38,165
You... You look...

2639
02:19:38,250 --> 02:19:39,208
- I'm concerned.
- Yeah, I know.

2640
02:19:39,290 --> 02:19:41,333
You look concerned.
What are you concerned about?

2641
02:19:41,415 --> 02:19:42,290
I'm... I'm...

2642
02:19:42,375 --> 02:19:43,833
They should be concerned.

2643
02:19:43,915 --> 02:19:45,333
- They are. They are.
- Well, let them be.

2644
02:19:45,415 --> 02:19:48,500
They're more than a little concerned.
There's widespread concern.

2645
02:19:48,583 --> 02:19:49,833
It's a big problem.

2646
02:19:51,333 --> 02:19:54,916
Tony told the old man
to tell me to tell you...

2647
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,833
- Hmm.
- "It's what it is."

2648
02:20:01,125 --> 02:20:02,000
What it is?

2649
02:20:02,083 --> 02:20:03,166
It's what it is.

2650
02:20:07,166 --> 02:20:08,416
Please, listen to me.

2651
02:20:10,666 --> 02:20:12,500
They wouldn't dare.

2652
02:20:12,583 --> 02:20:14,333
- Don't...
- They wouldn't dare.

2653
02:20:14,416 --> 02:20:16,250
- Jimmy...
- Please, Frank, come on.

2654
02:20:16,333 --> 02:20:18,000
- Don't say they wouldn't dare.
- No.

2655
02:20:18,083 --> 02:20:21,208
Don't... Don't tell me that kinda...
That's fairy tales.

2656
02:20:21,291 --> 02:20:22,958
No, don't say they wouldn't dare.

2657
02:20:23,541 --> 02:20:26,166
If something funny happens to me...

2658
02:20:28,250 --> 02:20:29,208
they're done.

2659
02:20:29,291 --> 02:20:31,166
You understand that? And they know it.

2660
02:20:31,250 --> 02:20:33,833
Because I got files. I got proof.

2661
02:20:33,916 --> 02:20:34,958
I got records.

2662
02:20:35,041 --> 02:20:38,166
I got tapes.
Any time I want, they'll be gone.

2663
02:20:38,250 --> 02:20:39,541
These Guinea motherfuckers

2664
02:20:39,625 --> 02:20:41,916
will spend
the rest of their lives in jail,

2665
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,583
and they know it.

2666
02:20:44,375 --> 02:20:45,250
They know it.

2667
02:20:45,333 --> 02:20:47,416
But what you're saying
is what they're concerned about.

2668
02:20:47,500 --> 02:20:49,083
What I'm saying is I know things.

2669
02:20:49,166 --> 02:20:52,166
I know things they don't know I know.

2670
02:20:52,958 --> 02:20:55,125
- Please...
- Are you gonna take that chance?

2671
02:20:55,208 --> 02:20:57,041
What chance am I...
Why should I be taking a chance?

2672
02:20:57,125 --> 02:20:58,541
They're saying this is it.

2673
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:01,083
They're saying this is it,
and then it's it?

2674
02:21:01,166 --> 02:21:03,583
Bullshit. Bullshit, Frank. Come on.

2675
02:21:03,666 --> 02:21:05,083
Jimmy, I'm trying to tell you something.

2676
02:21:05,166 --> 02:21:07,375
I know you are. You're telling me
that they're threatening me

2677
02:21:07,458 --> 02:21:08,875
and I gotta do what they say.

2678
02:21:08,958 --> 02:21:11,875
It's more than a threat.
It's the bottom line.

2679
02:21:11,958 --> 02:21:12,875
The bottom line.

2680
02:21:13,791 --> 02:21:14,958
It's what it is.

2681
02:21:15,041 --> 02:21:17,541
They do something to me,
I do something to them.

2682
02:21:18,708 --> 02:21:20,541
That's all I know.
I don't know anything else. Do you?

2683
02:21:23,625 --> 02:21:25,666
So what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna tell McGee?

2684
02:21:26,625 --> 02:21:28,125
That you're not gonna listen?

2685
02:21:28,208 --> 02:21:29,375
He ain't used to people
not listening to him.

2686
02:21:29,458 --> 02:21:30,458
Well, neither am I.

2687
02:21:32,125 --> 02:21:34,000
- What?
- Neither am I.

2688
02:21:34,083 --> 02:21:35,750
Then I don't know what to do.

2689
02:21:35,833 --> 02:21:37,541
I mean, maybe you should
get some bodies around you

2690
02:21:37,625 --> 02:21:39,541
- for protection.
- Oh, come on. Please.

2691
02:21:39,625 --> 02:21:41,208
I'm not gonna go that route.

2692
02:21:41,291 --> 02:21:42,833
Don't do this to me, Frank.

2693
02:21:42,916 --> 02:21:45,375
What do you mean, "bodies around me"?
I don't need...

2694
02:21:45,458 --> 02:21:47,833
You put bodies around you,
then they go after your family.

2695
02:21:47,916 --> 02:21:50,166
- It doesn't matter. You worried?
- I'm worried.

2696
02:21:50,250 --> 02:21:52,333
Get some bodies around you.
I'll tell you why.

2697
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:55,083
This could happen to you.

2698
02:21:55,166 --> 02:21:56,833
They could come after you

2699
02:21:57,416 --> 02:21:59,208
since you're with me.

2700
02:21:59,291 --> 02:22:00,166
No?

2701
02:22:02,791 --> 02:22:04,375
I'm worried.

2702
02:22:04,458 --> 02:22:06,208
Tell Russ I got nothing
but respect for him.

2703
02:22:06,916 --> 02:22:09,375
I got a little trouble with him.

2704
02:22:09,458 --> 02:22:11,625
We were talking before
and I just got a little crazy.

2705
02:22:11,708 --> 02:22:13,583
You know how I am. I just blow.

2706
02:22:13,666 --> 02:22:14,791
- Sometimes.
- Yeah.

2707
02:22:14,875 --> 02:22:16,208
I just walked away like that.

2708
02:22:16,291 --> 02:22:18,291
But I get that way. I get abrupt.

2709
02:22:18,375 --> 02:22:20,750
Maybe you could tell him
how much I respect him.

2710
02:22:21,625 --> 02:22:23,333
I have nothing but respect for this guy.

2711
02:22:24,166 --> 02:22:25,666
I would never hurt him,

2712
02:22:25,750 --> 02:22:28,708
no matter what I do with files,
or whatever I do with anything.

2713
02:22:28,791 --> 02:22:31,250
But you should tell him. Yourself.

2714
02:22:31,333 --> 02:22:32,208
No, I'm not gonna tell him myself.

2715
02:22:32,291 --> 02:22:33,541
- Please.
- Oh, come on.

2716
02:22:33,625 --> 02:22:35,583
- It would go a long way.
- He's your rabbi.

2717
02:22:36,333 --> 02:22:38,250
Because of him, you're here.

2718
02:22:38,333 --> 02:22:39,250
You tell him.

2719
02:22:40,125 --> 02:22:41,083
Listen to me.

2720
02:22:41,166 --> 02:22:43,708
At the end,
there's only one thing that's real.

2721
02:22:44,791 --> 02:22:46,541
This is my union.

2722
02:22:48,375 --> 02:22:51,375
This is my union, Frank.

2723
02:22:53,750 --> 02:22:55,541
Very simple when you say it that way.

2724
02:23:01,083 --> 02:23:02,375
Peggy!

2725
02:23:02,458 --> 02:23:04,000
Shall we dance?

2726
02:23:04,083 --> 02:23:05,416
Excuse us.

2727
02:23:37,250 --> 02:23:39,416
<i>A couple of hours outside Detroit,</i>

2728
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:41,833
<i>we figured we'd spend the night,</i>

2729
02:23:41,916 --> 02:23:43,750
<i>drive up in the morning.</i>

2730
02:23:43,833 --> 02:23:45,291
<i>I mean, the wedding, that was the thing.</i>

2731
02:23:46,291 --> 02:23:50,208
<i>Bill Bufalino was giving
his daughter away to a hell of a guy.</i>

2732
02:23:50,291 --> 02:23:52,750
<i>Better than the bum she was with before.</i>

2733
02:23:52,833 --> 02:23:54,416
<i>And that was all well and good.</i>

2734
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,291
<i>But the wedding
was really a peace mission.</i>

2735
02:23:59,458 --> 02:24:00,666
<i>And that's what we were there for.</i>

2736
02:24:00,750 --> 02:24:02,541
<i>And everybody kinda knew that,</i>

2737
02:24:02,625 --> 02:24:04,541
<i>and we were there
to straighten it all out.</i>

2738
02:24:05,166 --> 02:24:06,750
- Hey, Jimmy?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

2739
02:24:06,833 --> 02:24:08,375
I'm with the old man, we're driving up.

2740
02:24:08,458 --> 02:24:11,000
<i>He hopes we can straighten
this whole thing out.</i>

2741
02:24:11,083 --> 02:24:12,750
- What did he say?
<i>- He said he hopes</i>

2742
02:24:12,833 --> 02:24:14,166
we can straighten it out.
After the wedding,

2743
02:24:14,250 --> 02:24:16,250
we sit down, we talk,
we straighten it out.

2744
02:24:16,333 --> 02:24:17,458
<i>Right, the wedding.</i>

2745
02:24:17,541 --> 02:24:18,916
I'm not going to the wedding.

2746
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,125
Too many people I don't like
are gonna be there,

2747
02:24:21,208 --> 02:24:22,583
<i>so I'm not going to the wedding.</i>

2748
02:24:22,666 --> 02:24:24,166
You're not going to the wedding?

2749
02:24:24,250 --> 02:24:25,666
I'm not gonna be there.

2750
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:28,916
Well, then we could...

2751
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:30,500
Jimmy, then we could do it
anywhere you want.

2752
02:24:30,583 --> 02:24:32,666
We can do it at your house.

2753
02:24:32,750 --> 02:24:34,041
We can do it anywhere you want.

2754
02:24:34,125 --> 02:24:35,166
<i>Wherever you're comfortable.</i>

2755
02:24:36,333 --> 02:24:37,291
The lake?

2756
02:24:37,375 --> 02:24:39,666
Yeah, the lake.
You wanna do it at the lake?

2757
02:24:39,750 --> 02:24:43,625
Oh, from day one,
I wanted to work this out.

2758
02:24:43,708 --> 02:24:46,750
- I know. I know.
- From day fucking one.

2759
02:24:46,833 --> 02:24:49,416
I know. Nobody knows better than me.
I know that.

2760
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:50,666
<i>All right, uh...</i>

2761
02:24:50,750 --> 02:24:52,583
Just you two, right?

2762
02:24:52,666 --> 02:24:54,500
I mean, not the Little Guy.

2763
02:24:54,583 --> 02:24:56,291
- No, of course, the Little Guy.
<i>- No.</i>

2764
02:24:56,375 --> 02:24:58,416
I'm not doing it with him.

2765
02:24:58,500 --> 02:24:59,833
Jimmy, there's no point
just the three of us.

2766
02:24:59,916 --> 02:25:01,041
No, no. No, no.

2767
02:25:01,125 --> 02:25:03,333
Just the three of us.
That's the way it's...

2768
02:25:03,416 --> 02:25:04,958
There's no point just the three of us.

2769
02:25:05,041 --> 02:25:06,291
It's gotta be the Little Guy with us.

2770
02:25:06,375 --> 02:25:08,833
No, I'm not sitting down
with that little cocksucker again!

2771
02:25:08,916 --> 02:25:11,375
Do you understand? I can't do it, Frank!

2772
02:25:11,458 --> 02:25:13,375
You have to.
No, Jimmy, you gotta sit down with him.

2773
02:25:13,458 --> 02:25:14,458
<i>We don't gotta do anything.</i>

2774
02:25:14,541 --> 02:25:16,708
This is a courtesy with these people.

2775
02:25:16,791 --> 02:25:18,125
A complete courtesy.

2776
02:25:18,208 --> 02:25:19,500
- You know that.
<i>- I understand.</i>

2777
02:25:19,583 --> 02:25:21,166
But you gotta try and move past that.

2778
02:25:21,250 --> 02:25:22,833
Get past it? I am past it!

2779
02:25:22,916 --> 02:25:24,958
I'm never seeing that motherfucker again.

2780
02:25:25,041 --> 02:25:27,375
Jimmy, you gotta sit down.
Everybody says so.

2781
02:25:27,458 --> 02:25:29,833
But there's no point.
There's only one point,

2782
02:25:29,916 --> 02:25:31,916
I don't wanna do it
and I'm not gonna do it.

2783
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,500
Frank, I'm gonna hang up on you now.

2784
02:25:33,583 --> 02:25:35,583
Please. Understand this. Okay?

2785
02:25:49,416 --> 02:25:52,041
- What did he say?
- Uh, he's thinking about it.

2786
02:25:52,666 --> 02:25:54,750
- Thinking about it?
- Yeah.

2787
02:26:01,791 --> 02:26:02,625
That's for you.

2788
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,166
Well, that's good. Okay.

2789
02:26:25,625 --> 02:26:26,583
What time you got, Frank?

2790
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:29,333
Uh, about five.

2791
02:26:29,416 --> 02:26:30,500
Five, huh?

2792
02:26:33,083 --> 02:26:34,666
Maybe you should give Jimmy a call.

2793
02:26:34,750 --> 02:26:36,750
I mean, he said
he was gonna think about it, right?

2794
02:26:43,083 --> 02:26:43,916
Okay.

2795
02:26:55,166 --> 02:26:56,625
So when are you getting in?

2796
02:26:56,708 --> 02:26:58,000
Uh, tomorrow morning.

2797
02:26:58,083 --> 02:26:59,958
<i>Oh, that's good.
That's good, 'cause, uh...</i>

2798
02:27:00,541 --> 02:27:02,875
I changed my mind about the other thing.

2799
02:27:04,375 --> 02:27:06,166
- You did?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

2800
02:27:06,250 --> 02:27:09,500
Yeah, I'm gonna meet, uh,
with the Little Guy tomorrow afternoon.

2801
02:27:10,541 --> 02:27:11,625
With the lit...

2802
02:27:11,708 --> 02:27:12,916
- With the Little Guy?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

2803
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,833
Uh, Tony Jack set it up. I like Jack.

2804
02:27:15,916 --> 02:27:17,750
<i>Jack's good. I met with him a few times</i>

2805
02:27:17,833 --> 02:27:19,625
after that, you know, Miami fiasco.

2806
02:27:20,208 --> 02:27:21,708
With the Little Guy. Where?

2807
02:27:22,666 --> 02:27:25,750
Same place as before.
You know where it is.

2808
02:27:25,833 --> 02:27:27,000
In public.

2809
02:27:28,833 --> 02:27:30,500
You know Tony Jack is Pro's cousin?

2810
02:27:31,291 --> 02:27:32,791
Yeah. So?

2811
02:27:32,875 --> 02:27:34,458
They're all fucking cousins.
What're you gonna do?

2812
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:37,166
Jimmy, I think I should be there.

2813
02:27:37,250 --> 02:27:38,583
Oh, yeah, I want you there.

2814
02:27:38,666 --> 02:27:41,083
That's why I asked
when you're coming in.

2815
02:27:41,166 --> 02:27:42,291
What time's the meeting?

2816
02:27:42,375 --> 02:27:43,291
<i>Two-thirty.</i>

2817
02:27:43,375 --> 02:27:45,875
And he better not be late,
that cocksucker,

2818
02:27:45,958 --> 02:27:47,916
or wearing those fucking shorts.

2819
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:51,333
Listen, I'm gonna get there at 2:00,
so you should get there at 2:00.

2820
02:27:51,416 --> 02:27:52,625
- Okay?
<i>- I'll be there at 2:00.</i>

2821
02:27:52,708 --> 02:27:55,000
Oh, good. Good. Okay.

2822
02:27:55,083 --> 02:27:56,291
I'll see you at 2:00.

2823
02:27:56,375 --> 02:27:57,708
<i>- Thanks, Frank.</i>
- Okay, Jimmy.

2824
02:27:59,458 --> 02:28:00,333
See you at 2:00.

2825
02:28:06,958 --> 02:28:07,916
What did he say?

2826
02:28:08,833 --> 02:28:09,791
He's gonna meet with Pro.

2827
02:28:12,291 --> 02:28:13,333
Tony Jack set it up.

2828
02:28:14,250 --> 02:28:15,333
Very good.

2829
02:28:29,916 --> 02:28:32,333
- Hello.
- Hello. Good evening.

2830
02:28:33,375 --> 02:28:35,458
- We're starving.
- Oh, let's go, let's go.

2831
02:28:42,083 --> 02:28:43,250
It was the best move we made,

2832
02:28:43,333 --> 02:28:45,833
getting this red wine vinegar
from Angelo's guy.

2833
02:28:48,208 --> 02:28:49,500
Great Italian olive oil

2834
02:28:49,583 --> 02:28:52,125
we got from that other mooch
was not bad either.

2835
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,333
Catania olives, what better.

2836
02:28:56,416 --> 02:28:57,333
The best.

2837
02:29:02,208 --> 02:29:03,833
There's been a change.

2838
02:29:04,416 --> 02:29:05,541
Instead of, uh,

2839
02:29:07,250 --> 02:29:08,791
going up early,
we're gonna hang around

2840
02:29:08,875 --> 02:29:11,208
tomorrow morning and then go drive up.

2841
02:29:12,166 --> 02:29:15,708
But... But I told Jimmy
that we were gonna be up in the morning.

2842
02:29:17,375 --> 02:29:18,291
I told Jimmy...

2843
02:29:18,375 --> 02:29:20,541
I told Jimmy we're gonna be
up in the morning.

2844
02:29:20,625 --> 02:29:22,166
I know. I know.

2845
02:29:24,333 --> 02:29:27,875
That I would be there for that...
meeting with Pro.

2846
02:29:27,958 --> 02:29:29,416
- What?
- That I'd be...

2847
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:31,625
be there for that meeting with Pro.

2848
02:29:31,708 --> 02:29:32,833
Oh, yeah. I know. I know.

2849
02:29:37,250 --> 02:29:39,458
But what I... What am I gonna do?

2850
02:29:41,833 --> 02:29:43,541
We gotta go there. I mean, I gotta go.

2851
02:29:43,625 --> 02:29:45,000
I told him I'd be there.

2852
02:29:48,583 --> 02:29:49,666
Frank...

2853
02:29:50,541 --> 02:29:52,458
we did all we could for the man.

2854
02:30:04,125 --> 02:30:05,208
Don't call him.

2855
02:30:41,625 --> 02:30:43,958
- Hey. Good morning.
- Hey. Morning.

2856
02:30:47,083 --> 02:30:48,583
Want some coffee?

2857
02:30:48,666 --> 02:30:49,708
No, I got it here.

2858
02:30:51,583 --> 02:30:53,541
- How'd ya sleep?
- Good. You?

2859
02:30:55,458 --> 02:30:56,333
All right.

2860
02:31:00,583 --> 02:31:02,166
Want some Total or Corn Flakes?

2861
02:31:03,041 --> 02:31:04,416
Uh, maybe Total.

2862
02:31:12,708 --> 02:31:13,958
That's good, thanks.

2863
02:31:20,958 --> 02:31:23,208
We're gonna take a ride
up to Port Clinton today.

2864
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:30,250
I thought we were staying here.

2865
02:31:31,791 --> 02:31:33,375
No, the girls are gonna stay here.

2866
02:31:34,375 --> 02:31:36,166
You and me, we're going up and, uh...

2867
02:31:37,833 --> 02:31:39,833
we'll be back three hours tops.

2868
02:31:42,958 --> 02:31:45,833
Oh. But... But what's in Port Clinton?

2869
02:31:46,541 --> 02:31:47,416
A plane.

2870
02:31:51,166 --> 02:31:52,333
A plane? To where?

2871
02:31:53,416 --> 02:31:54,416
Detroit.

2872
02:32:02,166 --> 02:32:03,583
We're going to Detroit now?

2873
02:32:04,333 --> 02:32:06,375
No, you're gonna go to Detroit.

2874
02:32:09,291 --> 02:32:11,166
And when you come back,

2875
02:32:11,250 --> 02:32:12,416
me and you,

2876
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:16,125
we get together with the girls,
we take a nice slow drive up.

2877
02:32:17,041 --> 02:32:18,708
With cigarette breaks, you know.

2878
02:32:30,375 --> 02:32:31,500
Frank.

2879
02:32:32,125 --> 02:32:34,250
I had to put you into this thing,

2880
02:32:35,041 --> 02:32:36,958
or you would never let it happen.

2881
02:32:37,875 --> 02:32:39,416
And I know you wouldn't.

2882
02:32:45,041 --> 02:32:46,541
But it's gonna happen.

2883
02:32:49,208 --> 02:32:50,916
Either way,

2884
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:52,125
he's going.

2885
02:32:58,333 --> 02:33:00,666
I know how you feel, Frank. Trust me.

2886
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:02,291
I know how you feel.

2887
02:33:04,125 --> 02:33:06,583
I told you before,
we tried everything to help him.

2888
02:33:06,666 --> 02:33:07,916
You know that.

2889
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,125
You tried.

2890
02:33:12,041 --> 02:33:13,625
He brought this on himself.

2891
02:33:15,958 --> 02:33:17,791
And it's landing on us.

2892
02:33:21,666 --> 02:33:23,166
The only reason they agreed to this

2893
02:33:24,500 --> 02:33:26,375
was out of respect to me.

2894
02:33:29,125 --> 02:33:31,000
But you and Reenie will be okay,

2895
02:33:31,708 --> 02:33:33,125
'cause you're with me.

2896
02:33:38,083 --> 02:33:39,333
You're with me.

2897
02:34:18,666 --> 02:34:19,875
Give me your glasses.

2898
02:38:47,083 --> 02:38:48,000
Hey, Frank.

2899
02:38:49,041 --> 02:38:50,000
Hey, Sal.

2900
02:38:52,333 --> 02:38:54,083
Chuckie's late.

2901
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,125
- Hey.
- Hey.

2902
02:39:47,916 --> 02:39:48,833
That him?

2903
02:39:53,333 --> 02:39:54,291
Yeah.

2904
02:39:56,666 --> 02:39:57,958
Jesus.

2905
02:40:02,875 --> 02:40:03,791
I'm Sally.

2906
02:40:04,458 --> 02:40:05,333
Hi.

2907
02:40:07,125 --> 02:40:09,041
- Hey, Chuck.
- Frank.

2908
02:40:09,125 --> 02:40:11,208
Let's go. I don't want your father
yelling at me for being late.

2909
02:40:11,291 --> 02:40:12,500
Frank, you take the front.

2910
02:40:13,916 --> 02:40:15,541
- What the fuck is this?
- What?

2911
02:40:16,291 --> 02:40:17,250
It's wet.

2912
02:40:17,833 --> 02:40:21,708
Yeah, I had a frozen fish
I had to deliver for a friend of mine.

2913
02:40:22,708 --> 02:40:24,041
A fish?

2914
02:40:24,125 --> 02:40:25,416
The seat is wet from a fish?

2915
02:40:25,500 --> 02:40:27,166
Yeah, I know.
What do you want me to do about it now?

2916
02:40:27,250 --> 02:40:28,208
- Jesus Christ.
- I'll sit back there.

2917
02:40:28,291 --> 02:40:29,583
No, no, no, it's all right.
You sit in the front.

2918
02:40:29,666 --> 02:40:31,291
I'll sit there.

2919
02:40:31,375 --> 02:40:32,666
I'll sit here, you take the front.

2920
02:40:32,750 --> 02:40:33,875
No, no.

2921
02:40:33,958 --> 02:40:35,125
I'll sit there.

2922
02:40:38,333 --> 02:40:39,208
- I'm not sitting there.
- Why don't you...

2923
02:40:39,291 --> 02:40:40,291
I'm sitting there.

2924
02:40:42,916 --> 02:40:43,958
All right, sit where you want.

2925
02:40:46,750 --> 02:40:47,958
You want me to get you
a newspaper, Frank?

2926
02:40:48,041 --> 02:40:49,750
It's okay. Let's go.
We gotta hurry.

2927
02:41:04,041 --> 02:41:05,041
What kind of fish?

2928
02:41:07,375 --> 02:41:08,375
What?

2929
02:41:10,708 --> 02:41:11,875
What kind of fish?

2930
02:41:13,375 --> 02:41:16,875
Uh... I don't know.
The kind you eat. A fish.

2931
02:41:18,166 --> 02:41:19,291
You don't know what kind?

2932
02:41:21,416 --> 02:41:22,583
No. I don't.

2933
02:41:23,875 --> 02:41:24,916
Where did you get it?

2934
02:41:26,250 --> 02:41:28,250
What the fuck. At a fish place.

2935
02:41:30,458 --> 02:41:33,750
What, you just go in there and say,
"Gimme a fish"?

2936
02:41:35,083 --> 02:41:36,208
Pretty much. Yeah.

2937
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:39,583
You didn't say you want a salmon,

2938
02:41:39,666 --> 02:41:42,208
you want a... haddock, you want a...

2939
02:41:42,833 --> 02:41:43,708
a fucking cod?

2940
02:41:43,791 --> 02:41:46,458
What the fuck does it matter
what kind of fish it was?

2941
02:41:47,250 --> 02:41:48,791
Why are you so concerned
about this fish?

2942
02:41:48,875 --> 02:41:50,291
I'm just trying to understand how...

2943
02:41:50,375 --> 02:41:52,708
Does it...

2944
02:41:53,500 --> 02:41:56,083
How a person can buy a fish
and not know what kind it was.

2945
02:41:58,625 --> 02:42:00,916
There was a fish waiting for me there.

2946
02:42:01,708 --> 02:42:02,708
Uh...

2947
02:42:04,166 --> 02:42:07,416
I didn't ask what kind of fish it was.
I'm sorry.

2948
02:42:11,125 --> 02:42:12,458
So your friend
had already ordered this fish.

2949
02:42:12,541 --> 02:42:13,666
Right.

2950
02:42:20,208 --> 02:42:22,958
'Cause I wanna be able to explain this
if somebody asks me.

2951
02:42:30,250 --> 02:42:31,583
Yeah. Absolutely.

2952
02:42:44,541 --> 02:42:45,375
Dad.

2953
02:42:47,208 --> 02:42:48,208
Chuckie.

2954
02:42:48,291 --> 02:42:50,416
- Yeah, sorry I'm late. I had to drop off...
- Late?

2955
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:52,666
What the fuck are you even doing here?

2956
02:42:52,750 --> 02:42:54,625
- Who invited you?
- Hey, Jimmy.

2957
02:42:57,333 --> 02:42:58,791
Who the fuck are you?

2958
02:42:58,875 --> 02:43:00,291
I'm with Pro.

2959
02:43:00,375 --> 02:43:01,458
You're with Pro?

2960
02:43:02,083 --> 02:43:04,416
Are you with the cocksucker
who just stood me up?

2961
02:43:04,500 --> 02:43:06,625
I don't wait for anybody
more than ten minutes.

2962
02:43:06,708 --> 02:43:07,916
He's at the house.

2963
02:43:08,625 --> 02:43:09,625
What house?

2964
02:43:09,708 --> 02:43:10,958
With Russ.

2965
02:43:11,791 --> 02:43:14,375
- Russ? What the fuck is...
- Hey, look who's here.

2966
02:43:14,875 --> 02:43:16,375
- Frank.
- Jimmy.

2967
02:43:16,458 --> 02:43:18,208
What the fuck is going on?

2968
02:43:18,833 --> 02:43:20,958
I was waiting for you.
I was there at two o'clock.

2969
02:43:21,041 --> 02:43:22,125
You were supposed to show.
What happened?

2970
02:43:22,208 --> 02:43:25,083
I'm sorry.
But McGee's here, he decided to come.

2971
02:43:25,166 --> 02:43:27,333
But he ain't comfortable here.
He don't wanna come here.

2972
02:43:27,416 --> 02:43:28,416
He's at the house.

2973
02:43:28,500 --> 02:43:30,791
- McGee's in Detroit?
- Yeah, he's here.

2974
02:43:30,875 --> 02:43:32,083
He decided to come.

2975
02:43:33,875 --> 02:43:34,708
Oh.

2976
02:43:34,791 --> 02:43:36,875
Yeah, he came to help
straighten this all out.

2977
02:43:38,458 --> 02:43:39,375
The house?

2978
02:43:45,125 --> 02:43:46,750
We'll bring you back after
to get your car.

2979
02:43:52,750 --> 02:43:53,583
Yeah.

2980
02:43:55,416 --> 02:43:56,250
Okay.

2981
02:43:59,791 --> 02:44:01,708
- Hey.
- Hey.

2982
02:44:01,791 --> 02:44:03,166
Yeah.

2983
02:44:13,208 --> 02:44:14,291
There was a fish in here,

2984
02:44:14,375 --> 02:44:16,708
but we cleaned it up.

2985
02:44:16,791 --> 02:44:17,625
A fish?

2986
02:44:19,291 --> 02:44:20,958
Chuckie had a fucking fish in here.

2987
02:44:21,041 --> 02:44:21,958
Didn't even know what kind.

2988
02:44:22,041 --> 02:44:24,000
But it's okay now. I wiped it up.

2989
02:44:24,083 --> 02:44:26,958
- I got the handkerchief here.
- Yeah, I can smell it.

2990
02:44:27,041 --> 02:44:27,916
Hey, Chuckie.

2991
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,708
You had a fish in here in your car?

2992
02:44:29,791 --> 02:44:31,500
For Bobby Holmes.

2993
02:44:31,583 --> 02:44:32,958
You know, Bobby likes fish.

2994
02:44:33,583 --> 02:44:35,041
We cleaned it up, Jimmy. It's all right.

2995
02:44:35,125 --> 02:44:36,416
You cleaned it up?

2996
02:44:36,500 --> 02:44:38,333
- You cleaned it up?
- Yeah.

2997
02:44:38,416 --> 02:44:39,875
What the fuck you know about fish?

2998
02:44:40,583 --> 02:44:42,500
You ever caught
a fucking fish in your life?

2999
02:44:43,375 --> 02:44:44,208
No.

3000
02:44:44,291 --> 02:44:46,041
Well, then you don't know. See?

3001
02:44:46,541 --> 02:44:47,375
Chuck.

3002
02:44:47,458 --> 02:44:50,083
Listen to me.
Never put a fish in your car.

3003
02:44:50,166 --> 02:44:51,583
You never get the smell out.

3004
02:44:51,666 --> 02:44:52,500
No...

3005
02:44:52,583 --> 02:44:53,625
Unless you pack it tight,
you know.

3006
02:44:53,708 --> 02:44:55,250
No, I... I know.

3007
02:44:55,333 --> 02:44:56,916
- You know? Remember that.
- Right.

3008
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:58,000
I know.

3009
02:44:58,083 --> 02:44:59,416
It'll help you in life.

3010
02:45:04,916 --> 02:45:07,666
Frank, you couldn't come by
at 2:00 and tell me this?

3011
02:45:07,750 --> 02:45:10,708
I was waiting there 40 minutes
like a fuckin' moron.

3012
02:45:10,791 --> 02:45:13,541
Jimmy, I'm sorry.
I came as soon as I got here.

3013
02:45:13,625 --> 02:45:15,083
- You got in this morning.
- No, no, no.

3014
02:45:15,166 --> 02:45:16,333
I got here this afternoon.

3015
02:45:16,416 --> 02:45:19,208
Russell had business in Port Clinton.
I had to wait for him.

3016
02:45:19,291 --> 02:45:20,791
He reminded me. I forgot.

3017
02:45:20,875 --> 02:45:23,000
So, we had to come
and as soon as we got here,

3018
02:45:23,083 --> 02:45:24,625
I came right here to see you.

3019
02:45:24,708 --> 02:45:26,791
All due respect to Russ, you know,

3020
02:45:27,833 --> 02:45:30,833
but somebody should have come tell me,
you know.

3021
02:45:30,916 --> 02:45:34,541
Just come tell me it's 2:30,
2:40, at the very least.

3022
02:45:34,625 --> 02:45:35,625
You're not incorrect. I mean...

3023
02:45:35,708 --> 02:45:39,875
Who the fuck is Pro?
He sends a fucking errand boy here.

3024
02:45:39,958 --> 02:45:41,000
Oh, he ain't stayin'.

3025
02:45:41,083 --> 02:45:42,166
I know he ain't staying.

3026
02:45:42,250 --> 02:45:44,333
That's not the point,
he's staying or not staying.

3027
02:45:44,416 --> 02:45:45,875
The point is Pro sent him.

3028
02:45:45,958 --> 02:45:47,250
You know?

3029
02:45:47,333 --> 02:45:48,791
Point is,
he should've come picked me up himself.

3030
02:45:48,875 --> 02:45:50,125
That's the point I'm makin'.

3031
02:45:53,666 --> 02:45:55,416
Can you even see out of those glasses?

3032
02:45:56,916 --> 02:45:58,833
I can't see a fucking thing.

3033
02:45:58,916 --> 02:46:01,208
That's good.
I'm glad you're not driving, then.

3034
02:46:09,791 --> 02:46:11,458
Yeah, it's right... It's right up...

3035
02:46:12,041 --> 02:46:13,916
It's right up here. Right... Right up...

3036
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:15,041
That building with the staircase.

3037
02:46:17,541 --> 02:46:18,541
You got your friend with you?

3038
02:46:18,625 --> 02:46:20,541
- Right here.
- Good.

3039
02:46:21,458 --> 02:46:23,333
You never know
with this cocksucker,

3040
02:46:23,416 --> 02:46:24,916
with or without Russ there.

3041
02:47:04,750 --> 02:47:06,333

<i>former president of the Teamsters Union,</i>

<i>- about his intention...</i>
- Frank.

3058
02:49:53,666 --> 02:49:57,041
<i>To get the presidency back
from his successor, Frank Fitzsimmons.</i>

<i>Fitzsimmons' son

You haven't called Jo yet?

3077

Why?

3078
02:50:54,916 --> 02:50:55,750
What?

3079
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:57,958
Why?

I'm gonna call her now.

3087

<i>I think the union politics</i>

02:52:36,791 --> 02:52:38,500
You know, you gotta think positively.

3116
02:52:38,583 --> 02:52:40,791
It's just, you know, it ain't that long.
It's just...

3117
02:52:40,875 --> 02:52:42,125
<i>But do you... </i>

3118
02:52:42,625 --> 02:52:43,916
<i>Do you know he's okay?</i>

3119
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,541
No, no, no, I mean, you know me, I...

3120
02:52:46,625 --> 02:52:49,541
He maybe did something
like the Joe Bananas thing,

3121
02:52:49,625 --> 02:52:52,625
where, you know,
he had himself kidnapped

3122
02:52:52,708 --> 02:52:56,000
and then came back,
but he wasn't hurt, nothing happened.

3123
02:52:56,083 --> 02:52:57,875
Maybe he...

3124
02:52:57,958 --> 02:52:59,208
Maybe he just felt, you know,

3125
02:52:59,291 --> 02:53:01,000
he wanted to clear his head a bit.

3126
02:53:01,083 --> 02:53:03,041
But you gotta just think
that it's gonna be...

3127
02:53:04,083 --> 02:53:05,500
It's gonna be okay.

3128
02:53:06,291 --> 02:53:07,875
It's gonna be okay.

3129
02:53:09,541 --> 02:53:10,958
He's gonna be...

3130
02:53:12,166 --> 02:53:14,916
If you need anything, I'm here for you.

3131
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:18,083
Anything. Anything.

3132
02:53:18,166 --> 02:53:20,041
<i>Can you just...
Can you call me again?</i>

3133
02:53:20,125 --> 02:53:22,250
Yeah, I'll call... I'll call you.

3134
02:53:23,875 --> 02:53:25,375
Yeah, I'll... I'll call you.

3135
02:53:26,541 --> 02:53:28,541
I'll check in with you tomorrow.

3136
02:53:28,625 --> 02:53:30,208
<i>Yes, call me tomorrow.</i>

3137
02:53:30,291 --> 02:53:32,708
Okay. I'll call you in the morning, okay?

3138
02:53:32,791 --> 02:53:33,625
<i>Promise?</i>

3139
02:53:33,708 --> 02:53:35,500
Don't worry. Be strong.

3140
02:53:35,583 --> 02:53:36,916
Be positive, huh?

3141
02:53:37,916 --> 02:53:40,125
Okay, Jo, okay, okay.

3142
02:53:40,916 --> 02:53:42,208
Okay.

3143
02:53:42,291 --> 02:53:44,250
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Talk to ya a little later. Bye.

3144
02:53:44,333 --> 02:53:46,250
- Bye.
<i>- Goodbye, Frank.</i>

3145
02:54:45,375 --> 02:54:48,125
It was no more complicated than that.

3146
02:54:49,875 --> 02:54:51,333
Mr. Sheeran,

3147
02:54:52,125 --> 02:54:54,250
do you know who, if anyone,

3148
02:54:54,333 --> 02:54:57,083
was behind the disappearance
of James Hoffa?

3149
02:54:57,166 --> 02:55:00,625
<i>Everybody who ever had</i>
<i>anything to do with Jimmy</i>

3150
02:55:00,708 --> 02:55:02,458
<i>was hauled in and questioned.</i>

3151
02:55:02,541 --> 02:55:03,583
On the advice of counsel,

3152
02:55:03,666 --> 02:55:05,708
I respectfully decline
to answer that question

3153
02:55:05,791 --> 02:55:08,208
on the grounds
that it might tend to incriminate me.

3154
02:55:08,291 --> 02:55:09,625
Okay, let me ask you this:

3155
02:55:10,333 --> 02:55:11,583
what color is my pen?

3156
02:55:14,208 --> 02:55:15,458
<i>And everybody took the Fifth.</i>

3157
02:55:15,541 --> 02:55:17,208
<i>I mean, in that situation,</i>

3158
02:55:17,916 --> 02:55:19,416
<i>that's what you do.
What else are you gonna do?</i>

3159
02:55:20,041 --> 02:55:23,125
<i>Still, everybody got indicted or convicted</i>

3160
02:55:23,208 --> 02:55:24,625
<i>on one thing or another,</i>

3161
02:55:24,708 --> 02:55:25,833
<i>but not that.</i>

3162
02:55:25,916 --> 02:55:27,250
<i>Not about Jimmy.</i>

3163
02:55:27,333 --> 02:55:30,291
<i>Nobody, as you know,
even went to jail for that.</i>

3164
02:55:30,375 --> 02:55:32,333
<i>And nobody talked, which is unusual,</i>

3165
02:55:32,416 --> 02:55:35,000
<i>'cause usually,
three people can keep a secret</i>

3166
02:55:35,083 --> 02:55:36,916
<i>only when two of them are dead.</i>

3167
02:55:38,916 --> 02:55:41,458
<i>Bruno Denzetta and Marco Rossi,</i>

3168
02:55:41,541 --> 02:55:44,916
<i>they got 20 years each
for shaking down a trucking company.</i>

3169
02:55:46,125 --> 02:55:49,208
<i>Pro was convicted with them,
but he was already back in school</i>

3170
02:55:49,291 --> 02:55:51,666
<i>for that other matter
I talked about before.</i>

3171
02:55:51,750 --> 02:55:53,583
<i>Well, you remember
that poor union treasurer,</i>

3172
02:55:53,666 --> 02:55:56,458
<i>Tony "Three Fingers,"
who got more votes than Pro?</i>

3173
02:55:56,541 --> 02:55:58,166
<i>They got him on that.</i>

3174
02:55:58,250 --> 02:56:01,541
<i>Sally Bugs, you know, he did that one.</i>

3175
02:56:07,375 --> 02:56:10,750
<i>One day, Bugs was seen
walking into the Federal building.</i>

3176
02:56:12,333 --> 02:56:13,833
<i>What he did itself</i>
<i>ain't no crime.</i>

3177
02:56:14,541 --> 02:56:17,208
I mean, a lot of people
get called in for things.

3178
02:56:17,291 --> 02:56:19,666
But Sally knows better.

3179
02:56:19,750 --> 02:56:22,000
How come he didn't say anything
to anybody?

3180
02:56:23,208 --> 02:56:25,375
He didn't tell anybody one word.

3181
02:56:25,458 --> 02:56:26,958
Not one word.

3182
02:56:28,291 --> 02:56:30,041
And one thing for sure,

3183
02:56:30,875 --> 02:56:33,041
he didn't go there for fucking lunch.

3184
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:47,000
Sally.

3185
02:56:48,041 --> 02:56:49,833
- What's good?
- Hey, Irish.

3186
02:57:02,083 --> 02:57:05,625
<i>Turns out Sally did tell somebody</i>
<i>he had to go in there for something.</i>

3187
02:57:05,708 --> 02:57:07,291
<i>They just forgot to tell somebody else.</i>

3188
02:57:07,375 --> 02:57:09,666
<i>So it was a bad hit.</i>

3189
02:57:12,500 --> 02:57:14,541
<i>Jimmy's son, Chuckie,
you know, his foster son,</i>

3190
02:57:14,625 --> 02:57:16,125
<i>was in the thing, too,</i>

3191
02:57:16,208 --> 02:57:17,541
<i>but he didn't know it.</i>

3192
02:57:18,583 --> 02:57:20,708
<i>All Chuckie knew
was he was pickin' up</i>

3193
02:57:20,791 --> 02:57:22,375
<i>one of Pro's guys and me,</i>

3194
02:57:22,458 --> 02:57:26,541
<i>and we was all gonna pick up his dad
at the Red Fox for a meeting.</i>

3195
02:57:27,166 --> 02:57:30,875
<i>Well, I mean, he was in it, yeah,
you could say that, but stupidly.</i>

3196
02:57:31,666 --> 02:57:34,541
<i>I... I always felt sorry
for Chuckie in this whole thing.</i>

3197
02:57:34,625 --> 02:57:36,250
<i>And I... I still do.</i>

3198
02:57:36,333 --> 02:57:37,708
<i>And the Feds gave him ten months</i>

3199
02:57:37,791 --> 02:57:40,541
<i>for some bullshit thing about a car,
and that's about it.</i>

3200
02:57:40,625 --> 02:57:42,125
<i>Who knows what the fuck...</i>

3201
02:57:44,041 --> 02:57:47,125
<i>Fat Tony Salerno,
they got on an income tax thing.</i>

3202
02:57:48,041 --> 02:57:48,958
<i>A little while after,</i>

3203
02:57:49,041 --> 02:57:51,750
<i>he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.</i>

3204
02:57:55,625 --> 02:57:58,750
There's a... a pork store up in, uh...

3205
02:58:00,750 --> 02:58:02,625
northern California.

3206
02:58:03,458 --> 02:58:05,208
Uh, right around...

3207
02:58:06,375 --> 02:58:08,625
Walnut Creek.
You're from up there, ain't you?

3208
02:58:09,333 --> 02:58:10,833
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

3209
02:58:10,916 --> 02:58:12,958
And you might even know
the guy that runs it.

3210
02:58:13,791 --> 02:58:16,375
Actually,
I'm looking for a little favor...

3211
02:58:16,458 --> 02:58:18,250
for him, not for me.

3212
02:58:19,208 --> 02:58:22,958
But if you can get him a ticket,
like, to Australia...

3213
02:58:24,458 --> 02:58:25,791
You know what I mean.

3214
02:58:28,291 --> 02:58:29,458
Yeah.

3215
02:58:30,916 --> 02:58:32,916
You want to help him get down there?

3216
02:58:38,458 --> 02:58:39,583
Ye... Yeah.

3217
02:58:39,666 --> 02:58:41,208
<i>Now, Russell, he got pinched</i>

3218
02:58:41,291 --> 02:58:44,250
<i>for telling Jimmy the Weasel
to strangle Jack Napoli</i>

3219
02:58:44,333 --> 02:58:46,875
<i>over some beef
about 25 grand of jewelry</i>

3220
02:58:46,958 --> 02:58:48,458
<i>that Jack took on credit</i>

3221
02:58:48,541 --> 02:58:51,416
<i>from Russell and then he never paid for.</i>

3222
02:58:51,500 --> 02:58:53,916
<i>Now, with Russ, you don't do that.</i>

3223
02:58:55,083 --> 02:58:58,291
<i>So, only thing is, the Weasel, he flipped.</i>

3224
02:58:58,375 --> 02:58:59,958
<i>He had a wire on him.</i>

3225
02:59:00,041 --> 02:59:02,833
<i>They called it
"conspiracy to kill a witness."</i>

3226
02:59:02,916 --> 02:59:05,916
<i>It was obvious to everybody else
that Napoli was clearly in the wrong.</i>

3227
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,125
<i>I mean, how could you not see that?</i>

3228
02:59:08,208 --> 02:59:10,041
<i>He set him up. It was entrapment.</i>

3229
02:59:10,125 --> 02:59:11,583
<i>What else could you call it?</i>

3230
02:59:11,666 --> 02:59:15,625
<i>But that's another thing</i>
<i>I don't wanna get into now. </i>

3231
02:59:15,708 --> 02:59:16,708
Raise your right hand.

3232
02:59:16,791 --> 02:59:20,083
<i>They brought me up on bribery</i>
<i>and labor racketeering charges</i>

3233
02:59:20,166 --> 02:59:21,833
<i>and some other bullshit things
I don't know.</i>

3234
02:59:21,916 --> 02:59:23,208
...the truth, the whole truth

3235
02:59:23,291 --> 02:59:24,375
and nothing but the truth,

3236
02:59:24,458 --> 02:59:25,625
- so help you God?
- I do.

3237
02:59:25,708 --> 02:59:28,000
Did you also tell them that Mr. Boffa

3238
02:59:28,083 --> 02:59:30,083
had given you and your wife
luxury vehicles?

3239
02:59:30,166 --> 02:59:33,291
Mr. Cole, I worked for 44 years,

3240
02:59:33,375 --> 02:59:37,791
I never took one dime illegal
off Boffa or nobody else.

3241
02:59:37,875 --> 02:59:40,291
You can think whatever you wanna think.
Don't matter to me.

3242
02:59:40,375 --> 02:59:43,333
<i>But all they got me for was
blowing up a crane company</i>

3243
02:59:43,416 --> 02:59:45,416
<i>that fired two of my shop stewards</i>

3244
02:59:45,500 --> 02:59:46,833
<i>for no good reason.</i>

3245
02:59:49,291 --> 02:59:51,041
<i>And... And my Lincoln.</i>

3246
02:59:51,666 --> 02:59:54,250
<i>I mean,
I bought that car from Eugene Boffa.</i>

3247
02:59:55,125 --> 02:59:57,458
<i>He leased truck drivers
to freight companies,</i>

3248
02:59:57,541 --> 03:00:00,500
<i>and then he paid them substandard wages.</i>

3249
03:00:02,500 --> 03:00:04,708
<i>They said I paid a lot less for the car</i>

3250
03:00:04,791 --> 03:00:06,250
<i>than what it was worth.</i>

3251
03:00:06,833 --> 03:00:08,791
<i>They said the car was a bribe.</i>

3252
03:00:14,916 --> 03:00:16,916
<i>I... I... I loved that car.</i>

3253
03:00:17,625 --> 03:00:21,291
<i>But it wasn't worth the 18 years
they gave me for it.</i>

3254
03:00:21,375 --> 03:00:22,250
<i>That's for sure.</i>

3255
03:00:27,583 --> 03:00:29,833
<i>Russell, he had a stroke.</i>

3256
03:00:29,916 --> 03:00:33,375
<i>Fat Tony, he couldn't control
his urine no more.</i>

3257
03:00:33,458 --> 03:00:35,375
<i>And my arthritis</i>

3258
03:00:35,458 --> 03:00:38,125
<i>that started in the foxholes of Anzio</i>

3259
03:00:38,208 --> 03:00:40,791
<i>was eatin' away at my lower back now,</i>

3260
03:00:40,875 --> 03:00:43,250
<i>and I couldn't feel much
in my feet no more.</i>

3261
03:00:43,916 --> 03:00:45,250
<i>I needed a cane.</i>

3262
03:00:45,333 --> 03:00:47,916
<i>But, you know, they're not gonna
give you a cane in the can</i>

3263
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,750
<i>because they say
you're gonna use it as a weapon.</i>

3264
03:00:50,833 --> 03:00:52,583
<i>There was this medicine, Neurontin,</i>

3265
03:00:52,666 --> 03:00:55,875
<i>it helped me a little bit,
but it also made you loopy.</i>

3266
03:00:55,958 --> 03:00:57,250
He's got it!

3267
03:00:57,333 --> 03:00:58,750
- He's got it!
- Ah!

3268
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:01,416
<i>We were all falling apart</i>
<i>right there</i>

3269
03:01:01,500 --> 03:01:03,083
<i>in the freezing fucking cold.</i>

3270
03:01:03,166 --> 03:01:04,833
- I can see it from here.
- You getting scared now?

3271
03:01:04,916 --> 03:01:06,833
Yeah, you stay here
another fucking ten years,

3272
03:01:06,916 --> 03:01:07,958
you'll beat me.

3273
03:01:17,166 --> 03:01:18,666
Is this the good grape juice?

3274
03:01:31,416 --> 03:01:32,875
I can't eat it.

3275
03:01:33,375 --> 03:01:35,375
- Take a bite.
- I got no teeth. I can't.

3276
03:01:35,458 --> 03:01:36,583
Put a little piece.

3277
03:01:37,166 --> 03:01:38,333
Just a little piece, thank you.

3278
03:01:38,416 --> 03:01:39,541
That's it?

3279
03:01:53,208 --> 03:01:54,916
<i>- E buono, no?
- Buono.</i>

3280
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,041
<i>Buono.</i>

3281
03:02:01,041 --> 03:02:02,750
Jimmy was a good man.

3282
03:02:03,458 --> 03:02:05,833
You know?
He had a nice family too, huh?

3283
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:07,833
Yeah.

3284
03:02:08,583 --> 03:02:10,583
- Yeah.
- I know.

3285
03:02:12,333 --> 03:02:14,791
I never wanted it to go that far.

3286
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,666
I picked us over him.

3287
03:02:27,541 --> 03:02:28,500
Fuck 'em.

3288
03:02:29,750 --> 03:02:31,000
Fuck 'em.

3289
03:02:32,791 --> 03:02:33,833
Fuck 'em.

3290
03:02:39,708 --> 03:02:43,208
<i>Mangia che cresci... figlio mio, mangia.</i>

3291
03:02:58,541 --> 03:02:59,833
Hey, Russ.

3292
03:02:59,916 --> 03:03:01,041
Hey, Frankie.

3293
03:03:01,125 --> 03:03:02,958
- Where you goin'?
- What?

3294
03:03:03,041 --> 03:03:05,333
- Where you goin'?
- I'm going to church.

3295
03:03:05,916 --> 03:03:06,875
Church?

3296
03:03:07,416 --> 03:03:09,208
Don't laugh, you'll see.

3297
03:03:09,291 --> 03:03:10,375
Don't laugh.

3298
03:03:10,958 --> 03:03:12,041
You'll see.

3299
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:21,750
<i>Russell went to church.</i>

3300
03:03:23,875 --> 03:03:27,000
<i>Then he went to the prison hospital.</i>

3301
03:03:29,125 --> 03:03:30,125
<i>And, uh...</i>

3302
03:03:30,208 --> 03:03:32,500
<i>And then he went to the graveyard.</i>

3303
03:03:35,208 --> 03:03:38,458
Lord Jesus Christ, by your own...

3304

<i>On December 23rd, to be exact.</i>

3307
03:03:46,166 --> 03:03:47,000
<i>Lung cancer.</i>

3308

<i>No surprise.</i>

03:03:49,916 --> 03:03:52,375
...even as it claims
our mortal bodies.

3310
03:03:53,083 --> 03:03:55,958
Grant that our sister
may sleep here in peace,

3311
03:03:56,041 --> 03:03:58,208
until you awaken her to glory.

3312
03:03:59,083 --> 03:04:01,666
For you are the resurrection
and the life.

3313
03:04:01,750 --> 03:04:04,291
And then she will see you face to face,

3314
03:04:04,375 --> 03:04:06,833
and in your light will see light,

3315
03:04:06,916 --> 03:04:09,416
and know the splendor of God

3316
03:04:09,500 --> 03:04:12,125
for ever and ever. Amen.

3317

3323

You go... you go there. Yeah, yeah.

3327

Yeah, yeah.

Peggy.

3329

Peggy. I just want to talk.

<i>She walked away.</i>

3332

I know she's mad at me and all,
but I... I want...

3333
03:07:20,708 --> 03:07:23,458
Call her. Call her.
I just want to talk to her.

3334
03:07:24,916 --> 03:07:26,708
Talk to her and tell her what?

3335
03:07:26,791 --> 03:07:28,416
What...

3336
03:07:28,500 --> 03:07:30,625
I just want to say I'm sorry. That's all.

3337
03:07:32,208 --> 03:07:33,083
For?

3338
03:07:35,666 --> 03:07:36,583
Look...

3339
03:07:37,916 --> 03:07:40,875
I know I wasn't a... a good dad.
I know that.

3340
03:07:40,958 --> 03:07:43,458
I know that.
I was just trying to protect her.

3341
03:07:43,541 --> 03:07:44,791
Protect all of youse.

3342
03:07:44,875 --> 03:07:47,291
I mean, that's what I was doing.
That's...

3343
03:07:48,458 --> 03:07:49,458
From what?

3344
03:07:50,500 --> 03:07:51,583
Well, everything.

3345
03:07:52,250 --> 03:07:53,625
I mean...

3346
03:07:53,708 --> 03:07:57,166
You... Youse had
a sheltered life, in a way,

3347
03:07:57,250 --> 03:07:58,750
because you didn't see what I see

3348
03:07:58,833 --> 03:08:00,458
and what I've been through.

3349
03:08:03,166 --> 03:08:04,958
There's a lot of bad people out there.

3350
03:08:05,041 --> 03:08:07,000
What else am I gonna do?

3351
03:08:07,083 --> 03:08:10,000
Daddy, you have no idea
what it was like for us.

3352
03:08:11,791 --> 03:08:13,416
I mean, we couldn't go to you
with a problem

3353
03:08:13,500 --> 03:08:14,958
'cause of what you would do.

3354
03:08:15,041 --> 03:08:17,416
You know,
we couldn't come to you for protection

3355
03:08:17,500 --> 03:08:19,875
because of the terrible things
that you would do.

3356
03:08:22,666 --> 03:08:24,458
I was just... I was...
I didn't want to see

3357
03:08:24,541 --> 03:08:26,666
youse get hurt, that's all.

3358
03:08:27,375 --> 03:08:28,250
Um...

3359
03:08:31,291 --> 03:08:34,250
I know you read a lot of things about me,
heard about me.

3360
03:08:34,333 --> 03:08:35,416
I'm sorry.

3361
03:08:35,916 --> 03:08:36,958
I... um...

3362
03:08:38,958 --> 03:08:41,791
Can I do anything now
to make it up to you?

3363
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:45,833
Huh?

3364
03:08:53,916 --> 03:08:56,250
If you're looking for something
with a little bit more luxury,

3365
03:08:56,333 --> 03:08:58,541
we have these two models
over here.

3366
03:08:58,625 --> 03:09:00,750
They're like the Cadillacs of caskets.

3367
03:09:01,291 --> 03:09:02,875
Now, if we puttin' you
in the fuckin' oven,

3368
03:09:02,958 --> 03:09:04,666
it really doesn't matter what you go in.

3369
03:09:05,250 --> 03:09:06,583
The cheapest shit possible.

3370
03:09:06,666 --> 03:09:08,500
Particle board, that's it.

3371
03:09:08,583 --> 03:09:10,958
What are we doin' today?
Are we doin' a cremation?

3372
03:09:11,791 --> 03:09:13,666
- A burial.
- Burial?

3373
03:09:14,250 --> 03:09:15,791
Uh, is it for a man or for a woman?

3374
03:09:15,875 --> 03:09:16,833
Me.

3375
03:09:17,916 --> 03:09:18,750
Shit.

3376
03:09:23,708 --> 03:09:24,833
You see anything you like?

3377
03:09:27,458 --> 03:09:28,500
Uh...

3378
03:09:36,333 --> 03:09:38,333
- That green one.
- That's a beauty.

3379
03:09:38,416 --> 03:09:40,833
That one'll set you back about $7,500

3380
03:09:40,916 --> 03:09:42,166
if you take it home today.

3381
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:43,916
What do you think?

3382
03:09:45,583 --> 03:09:46,958
Can you do any better?

3383
03:09:47,708 --> 03:09:51,791
I mean, buddy,
this is what you want to go home in, no?

3384
03:09:53,125 --> 03:09:56,375
I think we could go six
on that for you. How about that?

3385
03:09:57,125 --> 03:09:59,500
- Six flat cash work for you?
- That's good.

3386
03:10:00,666 --> 03:10:01,666
Good for me.

3387
03:10:21,708 --> 03:10:23,416
<i>Sooner or later,</i>

3388
03:10:23,500 --> 03:10:26,500
<i>everybody put here has a date
when he's gonna go.</i>

3389
03:10:26,583 --> 03:10:28,083
<i>That's just the way it is.</i>

3390
03:10:29,333 --> 03:10:33,166
<i>And I think there's gotta be
something when you go</i>

3391
03:10:33,833 --> 03:10:38,291
<i>'cause, I mean, how the hell
did this whole thing start?</i>

3392
03:10:42,250 --> 03:10:44,750
<i>People smarter than me
can't figure it out.</i>

3393
03:10:44,833 --> 03:10:47,541
<i>That's why I would never go for cremation
because it's so...</i>

3394
03:10:47,625 --> 03:10:48,958
<i>it's so final.</i>

3395
03:10:50,833 --> 03:10:52,083
This... This one.

3396
03:10:53,583 --> 03:10:54,916
1948.

3397
03:10:56,250 --> 03:10:59,250
<i>That's the hardest part</i>
<i>of anybody when they bury youse,</i>

3398
03:10:59,333 --> 03:11:02,208
<i>is when they go into the ground
because it's...</i>

3399
03:11:02,291 --> 03:11:03,416
<i>it's so final.</i>

3400
03:11:04,750 --> 03:11:07,333
<i>If you go into a building,
the building's there.</i>

3401
03:11:07,416 --> 03:11:08,833
<i>The crypt is there.</i>

3402
03:11:08,916 --> 03:11:10,583
<i>It has to be a metal casket,</i>

3403
03:11:10,666 --> 03:11:12,166
and they have you in the room.

3404
03:11:12,666 --> 03:11:14,000
And all that there.

3405
03:11:14,083 --> 03:11:15,875
It's just not as final. You're dead,

3406
03:11:15,958 --> 03:11:18,125
but it ain't that final.

3407
03:11:21,458 --> 03:11:24,583
I'm sorry, but I gotta direct youse

3408
03:11:24,666 --> 03:11:27,041
to my attorney, Mr. Ragano...

3409
03:11:28,916 --> 03:11:31,333
if youse want to talk about
Mr. Hoffa or...

3410
03:11:32,041 --> 03:11:34,041
or any matter, for that matter.

3411
03:11:34,125 --> 03:11:35,833
I got noth... nothing new to say.

3412
03:11:37,041 --> 03:11:38,000
He's dead.

3413
03:11:38,916 --> 03:11:39,875
Who's dead?

3414
03:11:40,708 --> 03:11:42,166
Your attorney, Mr. Ragano.

3415
03:11:42,250 --> 03:11:43,083
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

3416
03:11:43,166 --> 03:11:44,250
Who did it?

3417
03:11:46,125 --> 03:11:46,958
Cancer.

3418
03:11:49,875 --> 03:11:51,708
Everybody's dead, Mr. Sheeran.

3419
03:11:53,583 --> 03:11:54,583
It's over.

3420
03:11:55,250 --> 03:11:56,250
They're all gone.

3421
03:11:56,333 --> 03:11:58,833
Russell, Angelo, Salerno,

3422
03:11:58,916 --> 03:12:02,083
Pro, Dorfman, Sally Bugs.
They're gone.

3423
03:12:04,125 --> 03:12:05,333
Who are you protecting?

3424
03:12:07,500 --> 03:12:08,875
You know who's not gone?

3425
03:12:10,416 --> 03:12:12,708
Mr. Hoffa's family. His children.

3426
03:12:13,416 --> 03:12:16,375
They're here.
And they gotta live not knowing.

3427
03:12:17,916 --> 03:12:18,958
That's hard to do.

3428
03:12:21,958 --> 03:12:23,333
I mean, you got kids, Frank.

3429
03:12:24,208 --> 03:12:25,250
Can you imagine?

3430
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:34,083
Frank, it's time.
It's time you say what happened.

3431
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:43,000
You seem like nice fellas.

3432
03:12:43,833 --> 03:12:45,833
I appreciate youse coming to see me.

3433
03:12:46,666 --> 03:12:48,375
But I... I can't help you.

3434
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:52,875
That's it?

3435
03:12:52,958 --> 03:12:54,083
That's it.

3436
03:13:01,125 --> 03:13:03,666
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God...</i>

3437
03:13:03,750 --> 03:13:04,916
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God...</i>

3438
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:07,500
- Pray for us sinners...
- Pray for us sinners...

3439
03:13:07,583 --> 03:13:10,708
Now and at the hour of our death.

3440
03:13:11,333 --> 03:13:12,958
- Amen.
- Amen.

3441
03:13:15,791 --> 03:13:16,875
That was...

3442
03:13:17,500 --> 03:13:19,083
That wasn't too bad.

3443
03:13:19,166 --> 03:13:20,291
It's been a while.

3444
03:13:20,375 --> 03:13:22,000
Not bad at all.

3445
03:13:22,083 --> 03:13:24,708
And the intention was there.
The intention.

3446
03:13:24,791 --> 03:13:25,875
I know.

3447
03:13:26,541 --> 03:13:28,250
I know the intention is there.

3448
03:13:28,333 --> 03:13:29,666
It was there, Father.

3449
03:13:31,458 --> 03:13:33,458
Do you feel anything for...

3450
03:13:33,541 --> 03:13:35,708
for what you've done?

3451
03:13:39,250 --> 03:13:42,583
I, I don't. I mean, maybe that...

3452
03:13:43,708 --> 03:13:45,833
Because I'm here now talking to you,

3453
03:13:45,916 --> 03:13:47,708
that in itself is,

3454
03:13:47,791 --> 03:13:51,000
you know, an attempt to...

3455
03:13:54,500 --> 03:13:57,750
But you don't feel anything at all?

3456
03:13:59,500 --> 03:14:00,583
No.

3457
03:14:03,041 --> 03:14:05,750
- Water under the dam.
- Mmm.

3458
03:14:09,291 --> 03:14:11,208
Any... Any remorse

3459
03:14:11,958 --> 03:14:13,416
for the families?

3460
03:14:13,500 --> 03:14:15,958
I... I didn't know the families.

3461
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:21,208
I didn't know 'em. Except one I knew.

3462
03:14:26,791 --> 03:14:29,750
I think we can... we can be sorry...

3463
03:14:29,833 --> 03:14:33,333
We can be sorry
even when we don't feel sorry.

3464
03:14:33,416 --> 03:14:36,458
Well, for us to say,
to make a decision of the will...

3465
03:14:36,541 --> 03:14:37,500
"God..."

3466
03:14:38,166 --> 03:14:39,833
I am sorry, God.

3467
03:14:41,666 --> 03:14:42,666
"Forgive me."

3468
03:14:43,708 --> 03:14:46,583
And that... that's a decision of the will.

3469
03:14:53,250 --> 03:14:55,791
What kind of man

3470
03:14:57,375 --> 03:15:00,125
makes a... a phone call like that?

3471
03:15:05,750 --> 03:15:08,000
What do you mean? What phone call?

3472
03:15:08,083 --> 03:15:10,458
Well, I can't tell you. Uh...

3473
03:15:10,541 --> 03:15:11,625
Mmm.

3474
03:15:12,625 --> 03:15:13,958
I can't. I got...

3475
03:15:15,125 --> 03:15:16,291
That's okay.

3476
03:15:19,833 --> 03:15:21,666
Frank, do you wanna pray with me again?

3477
03:15:21,750 --> 03:15:22,583
Yeah.

3478
03:15:23,583 --> 03:15:25,416
This time,
we'll do it in our own words. Okay?

3479
03:15:25,500 --> 03:15:26,583
Okay.

3480
03:15:28,791 --> 03:15:30,541
God, we come before you

3481
03:15:31,375 --> 03:15:33,625
sinful and sorrowful.

3482
03:15:33,708 --> 03:15:35,916
Sinful and sorrowful.

3483
03:15:37,291 --> 03:15:41,250
<i>We know you are</i>
<i>all good and all merciful.</i>

3484
03:15:41,333 --> 03:15:44,625
<i> We know you are</i>
<i>all good and all merciful.</i>

3485
03:15:45,958 --> 03:15:49,041
- <i>We ask you...</i>
<i>-  We ask you...</i>

3486
03:15:49,125 --> 03:15:54,208
<i>- to help us see ourselves...
- to help us see ourselves...</i>

3487
03:15:54,291 --> 03:15:57,125
<i>- as you see us.
- as you see us.</i>

3488
03:16:00,083 --> 03:16:01,791
That's my daughter, Peggy.

3489
03:16:01,875 --> 03:16:03,375
- Is it?
- Yeah.

3490
03:16:03,458 --> 03:16:04,916
I don't think I've met her yet.

3491
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:08,000
Well, she...
she ain't been around too much.

3492
03:16:08,083 --> 03:16:09,500
Is she your only child?

3493
03:16:09,583 --> 03:16:11,916
No, I got four daughters.

3494
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:13,916
Over there. See?

3495
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:15,041
Beautiful.

3496
03:16:15,583 --> 03:16:17,458
- Busy man.
- Yeah.

3497
03:16:19,250 --> 03:16:20,250
Yeah.

3498
03:16:21,250 --> 03:16:22,333
Who's that with her?

3499
03:16:24,083 --> 03:16:25,500
You don't know who that is?

3500
03:16:27,458 --> 03:16:28,333
No.

3501
03:16:29,583 --> 03:16:30,708
Jimmy Hoffa.

3502
03:16:32,833 --> 03:16:33,791
Oh, yeah.

3503
03:16:33,875 --> 03:16:34,875
Yeah, right, "Oh, yeah."

3504
03:16:37,083 --> 03:16:38,208
You don't know who he is.

3505
03:16:38,291 --> 03:16:40,041
Okay, I don't.

3506
03:16:40,833 --> 03:16:43,250
Yeah. Oh, boy, you don't know how fast

3507
03:16:43,333 --> 03:16:45,708
time goes by until you get there.

3508
03:16:46,500 --> 03:16:48,291
But you don't have to worry about that

3509
03:16:48,375 --> 03:16:50,875
because you have
your whole life ahead of you.

3510
03:16:50,958 --> 03:16:53,291
- Forever. It goes fast, time...
- Hey.

3511
03:16:53,375 --> 03:16:54,875
I'm tellin' ya.

3512
03:16:54,958 --> 03:16:56,791
I'm trying to take your pulse,
Mr. Sheeran.

3513
03:16:56,875 --> 03:16:58,333
Please, please don't talk.

3514
03:17:00,416 --> 03:17:01,333
It's great today.

3515
03:17:01,916 --> 03:17:03,416
I'm still alive?

3516
03:17:03,500 --> 03:17:05,750
- Yes, you are.
- That's good to know.

3517
03:17:06,291 --> 03:17:07,625
Alive and well.

3518
03:17:07,708 --> 03:17:08,833
And you're free

3519
03:17:08,916 --> 03:17:11,625
till later today when we have
to put you through all this again.

3520
03:17:11,708 --> 03:17:12,666
I'm here.

3521
03:17:31,666 --> 03:17:33,125
...ministry of the church.

3522
03:17:33,208 --> 03:17:36,000
May God grant you pardon and peace, Frank.

3523
03:17:36,083 --> 03:17:37,708
And I absolve you from your sins.

3524
03:17:37,791 --> 03:17:40,208
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son,

3525
03:17:40,291 --> 03:17:42,541
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

3526
03:17:43,500 --> 03:17:46,083
Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.

3527
03:17:46,166 --> 03:17:47,208
His mercy...

3528
03:17:47,291 --> 03:17:49,458
- His mercy endures forever.
- endures forever.

3529
03:17:49,541 --> 03:17:52,833
All right, Frank.
I'll be back to visit, okay? Very soon.

3530
03:17:52,916 --> 03:17:55,333
Probably after the Christmas holidays.

3531
03:17:55,416 --> 03:17:56,958
Oh, okay.

3532
03:17:57,041 --> 03:17:59,833
- Frank, God bless you.
- You too. Thank you.

3533
03:18:02,250 --> 03:18:03,250
It's Christmas?

3534
03:18:04,541 --> 03:18:05,541
Almost.

3535
03:18:06,583 --> 03:18:08,166
Well, I ain't going nowhere.

3536
03:18:10,750 --> 03:18:12,791
- Hey, Father?
- Yup?

3537
03:18:12,875 --> 03:18:15,250
- Do me a favor?
- Mmm-hmm.

3538
03:18:15,333 --> 03:18:18,250
Don't shut the door all the way.
I don't like that. Just...

3539
03:18:18,333 --> 03:18:20,541
- leave it open a little bit.
- Oh, okay.
