1
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,678
I'm going for a cup of tea.
Do you want one?

2
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:18,524
<i>- Do you want a cup of tea, Withnail?
- No.</i>

3
00:04:07,807 --> 00:04:10,674
<i>Thirteen million
Londoners have to wake up to this.</i>

4
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:13,678
<i>The murder and all-bran
and rape?</i>

5
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,272
<i>And I'm sitting in this bloody shack,
and I can't cope with Withnail.</i>

6
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:19,442
<i>I must be out of my mind.</i>

7
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:22,612
<i>I must go home at once and
discuss his problems in depth.</i>

8
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:28,087
I have some extremely
distressing news.

9
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:31,186
<i>I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear anything.</i>

10
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:36,394
<i>My God, it's a nightmare,
let me tell you. It's a nightmare.</i>

11
00:04:36,502 --> 00:04:39,494
We've just run out of wine.
What are we gonna do about it?

12
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:42,096
<i>I don't know.
I don't know.</i>

13
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,234
Oh, God!
I don't feel good.

14
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:49,543
My thumbs have gone weird!

15
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:52,914
I'm in the middle
of a bloody overdose.

16
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:55,988
Oh, God!

17
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:59,149
My heart's beating
like a fucked clock!

18
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,692
I feel dreadful.
I feel really dreadful.

19
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:04,160
So do I.
So does everybody.

20
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,288
Look at my tongue.

21
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,867
Gray yellow sock.

22
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:11,698
Sit down, for Christ's sake.
What's the matter with you?

23
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:15,834
Eat some sugar.

24
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:19,309
Listen to this.

Look at Jeff Wode!

His head must weigh
50 pounds on its own.

Imagine the size of his balls.

40

Imagine getting into a fight

41

Please, I don't feel good.

42

That's what you'd say.
But that wouldn't wash with Jeff.

No. He'd like a bit of pleading.
Adds spice to it.

44
00:06:27,246 --> 00:06:32,411
In fact, he'd probably tell you
what he was gonna do before he did it.

"I'm gonna pull your head off."

Have you got soup?
Why didn't I get any soup?

49
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:53,005
Coffee.

50
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:55,266
Why don't you use a cup
like any other human being?

51

Why don't you wash up occasionally

How dare you!

How dare you
call me inhumane!

54
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:07,709
I didn't call you inhumane.
You merely imagined it. Calm down.

55
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,653
Right, you fucker.
I'm gonna do the washing up.

56
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:13,919
No, no, you can't.
It's impossible, I swear.

57
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:16,756
I've looked into it.
Listen to me! Listen to me!

58
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:19,696
There are things in there.
There's a tea bag growing.

59
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:23,064
You haven't slept in 60 hours.
You're in no state to tackle it.

60
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:25,637
Wait till the morning.
We'll go in together.

61
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:28,366
This is the morning!
Stand aside!

62
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:32,433
You don't understand! I think
there may be something living in there.

63
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:34,809
I think there may be
something alive.

64
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:37,678
- What do you mean? A rat?
- It's possible.

65
00:07:37,783 --> 00:07:40,843
Then the fucker
will rue the day.

66
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:47,426
Oh, Christ Almighty!
A sinew in nicotine base.

67
00:07:47,527 --> 00:07:50,985
Keep back, keep back.
The entire sink's gone rotten.

68
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:52,997
I don't know what's in here.

69
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:57,229
I told you, you've been bitten!

70
00:07:57,336 --> 00:08:00,066
Burnt! Burnt!
The fucking kettle's on fire!

71
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:02,640
- There's something floating up.
- Fork it!

72
00:08:02,742 --> 00:08:06,234
- L-l-I don't...
- You must! You must!

73
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:10,441
<i>The poop will boil through the glaze.
We'll never be able to use
our dinner service again.</i>

74
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,950
Here. Get it with the pliers.

75
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:15,452
<i>No, no. No, no.
Give me the gloves.</i>

76
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:18,251
That's right.
Put on the gloves.

77
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:21,258
Don't attempt anything
without the gloves.

78
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,531
- Ugh.
- What is it? What have you found?

79
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:30,261
Matter.

80
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:32,860
Matter?
Where's it coming from?

81
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:35,964
Don't look.
I'm dealing with it.

82
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:40,410
I think we've been
in here too long.

83
00:08:40,513 --> 00:08:44,142
I feel unusual.
I think we should go outside.

84
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:52,156
This is ridiculous.
Look at me.

85
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:55,750
I'm 30 in a month, and I've got
a sole flapping off my shoe.

86
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:58,853
It will get better.
It has to.

87
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:01,900
Easy for you to say, lovey.
You've had an audition.

88
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:04,469
Why can't I have an audition?

89
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,269
It's ridiculous. I've been
to drama school. I'm good-looking.

90
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,471
I tell you,
I've a fuck sight more talent than half
the rubbish that gets on television.

91
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:15,672
Why can't I get on television?

92
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:18,011
I don't know.
It'll happen.

93
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:20,677
Will it?
That's what you say.

94
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:24,381
The only program I'm likely to get on
is the fucking news.

95
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,958
I tell you, I can't take
much more of this.

96
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:29,493
- I'm gonna crack.
- I'm in the same boat.

97
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:31,495
Yeah, yeah.

98
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:34,191
I feel as sick as a pike.

99
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,427
I'm gonna have to sit down.

100
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:44,701
You know what we should do?

101
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,438
I say, you know
what we should do?

102
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,538
How can I possibly know
what we should do?

103
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,177
- What should we do?
- Get out of it for a while.

104
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:57,050
Get into the countryside,
rejuvenate.

105
00:09:57,156 --> 00:10:01,183
Rejuvenate? I'm in a park,
and I'm practically dead.

106
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:04,194
What good's the countryside?

107
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:08,460
- What time is it?
- It's 8:00.

108
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:12,970
Four hours till opening time.
God help us.

109
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:15,472
Have we got any embrocation?

110
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:19,911
- What for?
- To rub on us, you fool.

111
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:23,106
We can cover ourselves in Deep Heat
and get up against the radiator,

112
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:25,683
keep ourselves alive till 12:00.

113
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:29,920
Jesus, look at that!

114
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:32,820
Apart from a raw potato,
that's the only solid...

115
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:36,053
to have passed my lips
in the last 60 hours.

116
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:38,562
I must be ill.

117
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:44,667
<i>Even a stopped clock
gives the right time twice a day.</i>

118
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:50,131
<i>And for once, I'm inclined to
believe that Withnail is right.</i>

119
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:54,679
<i>We are, indeed, drifting
into the arena of the unwell,</i>

120
00:10:56,515 --> 00:10:59,507
<i>making an enemy
of our own future.</i>

121
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,587
<i>What we need is harmony,</i>

122
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:05,782
<i>fresh air, stuff like that.</i>

123
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:09,383
Wasn't much in the tube.
Nothing left for you.

124
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:12,794
<i>Why don't you ask your father
for some money?</i>

125
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:15,867
If we had some money,
we could go away.

126
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:19,631
Why don't you ask your father?
How can it be so cold in here?

127
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:22,071
Like Greenland in here.

128
00:11:23,843 --> 00:11:28,303
We've got to get some booze. It's
the only solution for this intense cold.

129
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:32,510
Something's got to be done.
We can't go on like this!

130
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:36,816
I'm a trained actor
reduced to the status of a bum!

131
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:41,621
I mean, look at us!
Nothing that reasonable members
of society demand as their rights!

132
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:44,958
No fridges, no televisions,
no phones!

133
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:47,396
Much more of this, I'm gonna
apply for Meals On Wheels.

134
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,402
- What happened
to your cigar commercial?
- That's what I want to know.

135
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:54,701
What happened to my agent?
Bastard must have died.

136
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:56,707
<i>September. Bad patch.</i>

137
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:59,937
Rubbish. I haven't seen Gielgud
down the Labor Exchange.

138
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:01,945
Why doesn't he retire?

139
00:12:02,047 --> 00:12:04,948
Oh, look at this little bastard!

140
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,383
"Boy lands plum role
for top Italian director."

141
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:12,548
'Course he does. Probably
on a tenner a day, and I know what for.

142
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:16,492
Two pound ten a tit,
and a fiver for his arse.

143
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,996
- Have you been at the controls?
- What are you talking about?

144
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:24,763
The thermostats!
What have you done to them?

145
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,033
<i>- I haven't touched them.
- Then why has my head gone numb?</i>

146
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,631
I must have some booze.

147
00:12:30,743 --> 00:12:33,473
I demand to have some booze!

148
00:12:35,614 --> 00:12:38,344
- I wouldn't drink that if I was you.
- Why not?

149
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,350
Because I don't advise it.

150
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:43,353
Even the wankers on the site wouldn't
drink that. That's worse than meths.

151
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:46,424
Nonsense. This is a far
superior drink to meths.

152
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:49,392
Wankers don't drink it
because they can't afford it.

153
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:56,735
Have we got any more?

154
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:59,566
Liar!
What's in your toolbox?

155
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:01,731
No, we have nothing.
Sit down.

156
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:04,241
Liar!
You've got antifreeze.

157
00:13:04,343 --> 00:13:07,244
You bloody fool.
You should never mix your drinks!

158
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:20,023
All right, this is the plan.
We'll get in there and get wrecked.

159
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:24,061
Then we'll eat a pork pie. Then we'll
drop a couple of Surmontil 50s each.

160
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:27,599
Means we'll miss out Monday
but come up smiling Tuesday morning.

161
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,101
- What's that appalling smell?
- Perfume on my boots.

162
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:34,263
I had to scrub them
with essence of petunia.

163
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:45,574
Two large gins, two pints of cider,
ice in the cider.

164
00:13:45,684 --> 00:13:48,244
If my father was loaded,
I'd ask him for some money.

165
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:51,118
If your father was my
father, you wouldn't get it.

166
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:53,623
- Here you are, lads.
- Chin-chin.

167
00:13:57,396 --> 00:13:59,296
Ugh!

168
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,461
What about what's-his-name?

169
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:06,902
- What about him?
- Why don't you give him a call?

170
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:10,442
- What for?
- Ask him about his house.

171
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:13,636
You want me to call what's-his-name
and ask him about his house?

172
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:17,079
- Why not?
- All right. What's his number?

173
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:19,844
I have no idea.
I've never met him.

174
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:22,853
Well, neither have I.
Who the fuck are you talking about?

175
00:14:22,955 --> 00:14:25,287
Your relative with the house
in the country.

176
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:28,053
- Monty? Uncle Monty?
- Same. That's the one.

177
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,129
Get theJag fixed up,
spend a week in the country.

178
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,030
All right. Give us a tanner,
and I'll give him a bell.

179
00:14:35,134 --> 00:14:39,628
Here. Get a couple more.
I'm going for a slash.

180
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:48,478
Ponce.

181
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,146
<i>I could hardly
piss straight with fear.</i>

182
00:14:54,253 --> 00:14:57,814
<i>A man with three-quarters of an inch
of brain had taken a dislike to me.</i>

183
00:14:57,923 --> 00:15:02,326
<i>What have I done to offend him?
I don't consciously offend
big men like this.</i>

184
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:05,329
<i>And this one has a definite
imbalance of hormone in him.</i>

185
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:08,559
<i>Get any more masculine than him,
you'd have to live up a tree.</i>

186
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,898
<i>"I fuck arses."
Who fucks arses?</i>

187
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:14,700
<i>Maybe he fucks arses.</i>

188
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:17,935
<i>Maybe he's written this in some
moment of drunken sincerity?</i>

189
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,511
<i>I'm in considerable
danger in here.</i>

190
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:22,603
<i>I must get out of here at once.</i>

191
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:29,113
Perfumed ponce!

192
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,221
You'll be pleased to hear
Monty's invited us for drinks.

193
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:36,521
Balls to Monty.
We're getting out.

194
00:15:36,628 --> 00:15:39,756
Balls to Monty? I already spent
an hour flattering the bugger.

195
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:43,801
There's a man over there doesn't like
the perfume. A big one. Don't look.

196
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,632
We're in danger.
We've got to get out.

197
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:50,766
- What are you talking about?
- I've been called a ponce.

198
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:54,004
What fucker said that?

199
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:02,520
I called him a ponce,

200
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:04,987
and now I'm calling you one.

201
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,217
Ponce!

202
00:16:07,326 --> 00:16:09,658
Would you like a drink?

203
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:11,787
What's your name? McFuck?

204
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:16,726
I have a heart condition.
I have a heart condition.

205
00:16:16,835 --> 00:16:19,565
If you hit me, it's murder.

206
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:22,367
I'll murder the pair of yous!

207
00:16:22,474 --> 00:16:25,170
My wife is having a baby.

208
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:29,805
<i>Listen, I don't know what my...
acquaintance did to upset you,</i>

209
00:16:29,915 --> 00:16:32,440
but it's nothing to do with me.

210
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:35,179
I suggest you both go outside...

211
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:38,051
and discuss it sensibly
in the street.

212
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:42,626
Out of my way!

213
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:51,359
<i>Speed is like
a dozen transatlantic flights...</i>

214
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,836
<i>without ever
getting off the plane.</i>

215
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:58,035
<i>Time change.
You lose. You gain.</i>

216
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:02,170
<i>Makes no difference, so long
as you keep taking the pills.</i>

217
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:05,114
<i>But sooner or later,
you gotta get out...</i>

218
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:07,344
<i>because it's crashing,</i>

219
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:10,445
<i>and all at once
those frozen hours...</i>

220
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:13,184
<i>melt through
the nervous system...</i>

221
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:16,455
<i>and seep out the pores.</i>

222
00:17:17,763 --> 00:17:20,960
Bastards! Just to suck...

223
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:24,524
some miserable cheap cigar,
and the bastards won't see me.

224
00:17:27,072 --> 00:17:29,040
Why are we having lunch in here?

225
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:31,132
It's dinner, and Danny's here.

226
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:33,143
Danny?
How did he get in?

227
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:36,009
I let him in this morning.
He lost one of his clogs.

228
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:38,743
He's come in because
of this perpetual cold.

229
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:41,684
Oh, I hope
tobacco sales plummet.

230
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:45,723
I've got your saveloy.
Here. I don't want it.

231
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:48,588
Then stick it in a soap tray
and save it for later.

232
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:51,356
Don't vent spleen on me!
I'm in the same boat!

233
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:54,296
Stop saying that!
You're not in the same boat.

234
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:58,836
The only thing you're in that
I have been in is this fucking bath!

235
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:05,338
<i>Danny's here.
Headhunter to his friends.</i>

236
00:18:05,444 --> 00:18:09,346
<i>Headhunter to everybody.
He doesn't have any friends.</i>

237
00:18:09,448 --> 00:18:12,178
<i>The only people
he converses with...</i>

238
00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:15,185
<i>are his clients
and occasionally the police.</i>

239
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:20,190
<i>The purveyor of rare herbs and
prescribed chemicals is back.</i>

240
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:23,318
<i>Will we never be set free?</i>

241
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:31,493
- Danny.
- You're looking very beautiful, man.

242
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:33,503
Have you been away?

243
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:37,666
St. Peter preached the epistles
to the apostles looking like that.

244
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:40,108
Have you got any food?

245
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:43,613
Mmm. As a matter of fact,
I got a saveloy.

246
00:18:43,715 --> 00:18:46,582
How much is it?

247
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:48,880
You can have it for nothing.

248
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:52,047
- I see you're wearing a suit.
- What's it got to do with you?

249
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:56,389
<i>No need to get uptight, man.
I was merely making an observation.</i>

250
00:18:56,495 --> 00:19:01,023
<i>I happened to be looking for a suit
for the Coalman two weeks ago.</i>

251
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:04,364
For reasons I can't really
discuss with you...

252
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:07,063
the Coalman
had to go toJamaica.

253
00:19:07,172 --> 00:19:09,936
Got busted coming back
through Heathrow.

254
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:14,945
Had a weight under his fez.

255
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:19,177
<i>We worked out, it would be very handy
karma for him to get hold of a suit.</i>

256
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,651
But he's a very low-temperature
spade, the Coalman.

257
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:25,723
Goes into court
in his caftan and a bell.

258
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:29,760
This doesn't go down at all well.

259
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:33,422
They can handle the caftan,
but they can't handle the bell.

260
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:37,093
So there's this judge sitting there
in the cape like fucking Batman...

261
00:19:37,202 --> 00:19:40,763
<i>- with this really
rather far-out looking hat...
- Wig.</i>

262
00:19:40,872 --> 00:19:44,933
<i>No, man. This was more
like a long white hat.</i>

263
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:47,568
So he looks at the Coalman
and says,

264
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,274
"What's all this? This is a court,
man. This ain't fancy dress."

265
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:54,079
And the Coalman
looks at him and says,

266
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:57,212
"You think you look normal,
Your Honor?"

267
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:00,348
Cunt give him two years.

268
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:05,421
I'm afraid I can't offer
you gentlemen anything.

269
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,260
That's all right, Danny.
We decided to lay off for a bit.

270
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:12,133
That's what I thought. Except
for personal use, I concur with you.

271
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:16,640
As a matter of fact, I'm thinking
of retiring and going into business.

272
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:19,233
Doing what?

273
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:22,575
<i>- The toy industry.
- I thought you
were in the bottle industry.</i>

274
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:26,845
No, man. That's a sideline.
You can have that.

275
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:29,682
Instructions are included.

276
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:33,952
Yeah, my partner's got a really
good idea for making dolls.

277
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:38,621
His name's Presuming Ed.
His sister give him the idea.

278
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,426
She got a doll on Christmas
what pisses itself.

279
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,969
- Really?
- Yeah, and you gotta
change its drawers for it.

280
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,096
It's horrible, really.
But they like that, little girls.

281
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:51,107
So we're gonna make one
that shits itself as well.

282
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,803
- Shits itself?
- He's an expert.

283
00:20:53,912 --> 00:20:56,676
He's building the prototype now.

284
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:01,612
Why is he behaving so uptightly?

285
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,679
Because a gang
of cheeroot vendors considered
a haircut beyond my abilities.

286
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,692
I don't advise a haircut, man.

287
00:21:08,794 --> 00:21:11,957
All hairdressers are
in the employment of the government.

288
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:14,225
Hair are your aerials.

289
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,801
They pick up signals
from the cosmos...

290
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:19,700
and transmit them
directly into the brain.

291
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:22,933
This is the reason
bald-headed men are uptight.

292
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,373
What absolute twaddle.

293
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:28,712
- Has he just been busted?
- No.

294
00:21:28,814 --> 00:21:31,044
Then why is he wearing
that old suit?

295
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:35,210
Old suit? This suit
was cut by Hawke's of Savile Row.

296
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,279
Just because the best tailoring
you've ever seen is above your fucking
appendix doesn't mean anything!

297
00:21:39,391 --> 00:21:41,882
Don't get uptight with me, man.

298
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:46,521
'Cause if you do, I'll have to
give you a dose of medicine.

299
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:50,727
And if I spike you, you'll know
you've been spoken to.

300
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:53,566
You wouldn't spike me.
You're too mean.

301
00:21:53,672 --> 00:21:56,573
Besides, there's nothing
invented I couldn't take.

302
00:21:56,675 --> 00:22:01,510
If I medicined you, you'd think
a brain tumor was a birthday present.

303
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:06,442
I could take double
anything you could.

304
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:11,754
Very, very foolish words, man.

305
00:22:11,857 --> 00:22:14,257
He's right, Withnail.
Look at him.

306
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,260
His mechanism's gone. He's had
more drugs than you've had hot dinners.

307
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:19,796
I'm not having this
shag sack insulting me.

308
00:22:19,898 --> 00:22:22,093
Let him get his drugs out.

309
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,068
This doll
is extremely dangerous.

310
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:31,842
It has voodoo qualities.

311
00:22:40,886 --> 00:22:46,552
Trade,
"Phenodihydrochrolide benzorex."

312
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:49,957
Street, "the embalmer."

313
00:22:50,061 --> 00:22:52,291
Balls! I'll swallow it
and run a mile.

314
00:22:52,397 --> 00:22:57,096
Cool your boots, man.
This pill's valued at two quid.

315
00:22:57,202 --> 00:23:00,103
- Two quid? You're out of your mind.
- That's sense, Withnail.

316
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:03,732
You can stuff it
up your arse for nothing
and fuck off while you're doing it!

317
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:10,738
<i>No need to insult me, man.
I was leaving anyway.</i>

318
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:17,248
Have either of you got shoes?

319
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:45,249
Monty's car.

320
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:56,784
Oh, hello! Come in.

321
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,567
Sit down, do.
Would you like a drink?

322
00:24:08,673 --> 00:24:10,766
- Sherry.
- Sherry.

323
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:15,779
- Sherry?
- Sherry.

324
00:24:15,881 --> 00:24:17,781
Sherry.

325
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,380
Do you like vegetables?

326
00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:27,219
I've always been fond
of root crops,

327
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:29,850
but I only started
to grow last summer.

328
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:33,556
I happen to think the cauliflower
more beautiful than the rose.

329
00:24:33,665 --> 00:24:35,565
Chin-chin.

330
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:38,067
- Do you grow?
- Geraniums.

331
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:40,262
Little traitors.

332
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:43,603
I think the carrot infinitely
more fascinating than the geranium.

333
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:47,166
Mmm. The carrot has mystery.

334
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,305
Flowers are essentially tarts,

335
00:24:50,415 --> 00:24:53,441
prostitutes for the bees.

336
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:57,913
<i>There is, you will agree,
a certain "je ne sai quoi,"</i>

337
00:24:58,023 --> 00:25:01,686
something very special
about a firm, young carrot.

338
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:03,920
Hmm, excuse me.

339
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:07,590
Do help yourselves to another drink.

340
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:10,167
What's all this?
The man's mad.

341
00:25:10,268 --> 00:25:12,828
- Eccentric.
- Eccentric? He's insane!

342
00:25:12,938 --> 00:25:15,532
Not only that,
he's a raving homosexual.

343
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:19,906
<i>You beastly little parasite!
How dare you?</i>

344
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:22,775
You little thug!
How dare you!

345
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:27,977
Beastly, ungrateful little swine!

346
00:25:28,086 --> 00:25:31,817
- Shall I get you a drink?
- Yes, yes, yes, please, dear boy.

347
00:25:31,923 --> 00:25:34,483
You can prepare me a small
rhesus-negative Bloody Mary.

348
00:25:34,593 --> 00:25:38,723
You must tell me all the news.
I haven't seen you since you
finished your last show.

349
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,628
Rather busy, Uncle.
TV and stuff.

350
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:45,032
My agent's attempting to edge me
towards Royal Shakespeare Company again.

351
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:49,038
<i>- Oh, splendid.
- And he's just had an audition for rep.</i>

352
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,303
Oh, splendid!
So you're a Thespian too?

353
00:25:55,747 --> 00:25:57,738
Monty used to act.

354
00:25:57,849 --> 00:25:59,749
One hardly says that.

355
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:03,412
I cracked the boards in my youth,
but I never really had it in my blood.

356
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:06,081
And that's what's
so essential, isn't it?

357
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:08,625
The theatrical zeal in the veins.

358
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:12,788
Alas, I have little more
than vintage wine and memories.

359
00:26:17,102 --> 00:26:20,833
It is the most shattering experience
of a young man's life...

360
00:26:20,939 --> 00:26:24,841
when one morning he awakes
and quite reasonably says to himself,

361
00:26:24,943 --> 00:26:30,404
"I will never play the Dane."

362
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:33,678
When that moment comes,

363
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:37,243
one's ambition ceases.

364
00:26:39,624 --> 00:26:42,115
Don't you agree?

365
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:46,027
- It's a part I intend to play, Uncle.
- And you'll be marvelous.

366
00:26:46,131 --> 00:26:48,429
Marvelous.

367
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:52,394
"It's gone.

368
00:26:52,504 --> 00:26:55,701
<i>"We do it wrong,
being so ma'jestical...</i>

369
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:58,537
to offer it
the show of violence."

370
00:26:58,643 --> 00:27:01,737
Let's go. He's a madman.

371
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:04,610
Any minute now, he's gonna rush out
and get into his tights.

372
00:27:04,716 --> 00:27:08,550
- Okay, okay. Any minute.
- The house or out.

373
00:27:10,488 --> 00:27:12,683
Could I have a word
with you, Monty?

374
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:15,726
Oh, forgive me, dear boy.
Forgive me.

375
00:27:15,827 --> 00:27:18,887
<i>I was allowing memory
to have the better of me.</i>

376
00:27:18,997 --> 00:27:21,898
<i>Shall I get you a topper?</i>

377
00:27:30,842 --> 00:27:34,403
Indeed, I remember my first agent.

378
00:27:34,512 --> 00:27:36,639
Raymond Duck.

379
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:41,475
He was a dreadful little Israelite.

380
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:44,555
Four floors up
on the Charing Cross Road,

381
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:47,454
and never a job
at the top of them.

382
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:52,092
I'm told you're a writer too.

383
00:27:54,032 --> 00:27:56,523
<i>Do you write poems?</i>

384
00:27:56,634 --> 00:28:00,593
No. I wish I could.
It's just thoughts, really.

385
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:04,775
- Are you published?
- Oh, no.

386
00:28:04,876 --> 00:28:07,106
Where did you school?

387
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:09,840
He went to the other place, Monty.

388
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:13,179
Oh, you went to Eton?

389
00:28:13,284 --> 00:28:15,980
Get that damned little
swine out of here!

390
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:21,889
It's trying to get itself in with you.
It's trying for even more advantage.

391
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:24,154
It's obsessed with its gut.
It's like a bloody rugby ball now.

392
00:28:24,262 --> 00:28:27,561
- It will die! It will die!
- Monty. Monty.

393
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,463
No, no, dear boy.
You must leave.

394
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:32,934
Yet again, that oaf
has destroyed my day.

395
00:28:33,037 --> 00:28:36,063
Listen, Monty. Could I just have
a quick word with you? In private?

396
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:38,335
Oh... very well.

397
00:28:49,821 --> 00:28:52,813
- Good night, my dears.
- Good night, Monty.

398
00:28:52,924 --> 00:28:56,382
What's all this
going off in private business?
Why did you tell him I went to Eton?

399
00:28:56,494 --> 00:28:59,327
Because it wouldn't
have helped if I hadn't.

400
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,661
I'm just trying to establish you
in some sort of context he'd understand.

401
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:06,464
- What do you mean by that?
- I mean, free
to those who can afford it.

402
00:29:06,571 --> 00:29:09,335
Very expensive
to those that can't.

403
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:20,643
<i>"All Along the Watchtower"]</i>

405
00:29:57,856 --> 00:30:01,383
- Scrubbers! Scrubbers!
- Shut up!

406
00:30:01,492 --> 00:30:04,689
Little tarts.
They love it.

They're throwing themselves

412

Throwing themselves into the road

<i>Throw yourself
into the road, darling!</i>

You haven't got a chance!

415
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:12,556
At some point or another,
I want to stop and get hold of a child.

416
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:14,564
What do you want a child for?

417
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,793
To tutor it in the ways
of righteousness...

418
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:19,199
and procure some
uncontaminated urine.

419
00:31:19,304 --> 00:31:23,638
This is a device enabling the drunken
driver to operate in absolute safety.

420
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:28,644
You fill this with piss,
take this pipe down the trouser...

421
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:32,910
and cellotape this valve
to the end of the old chap.

422
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:36,885
Then you get horribly drunk,
and they can't fucking touch you.

423
00:31:36,988 --> 00:31:39,980
According
to these instructions,

424
00:31:40,091 --> 00:31:43,151
you refuse everything
but a urine sample.

425
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:45,991
You undo your valve...

426
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:49,692
and give 'em a dose
of unadulterated child's piss,

427
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:52,827
and they have to give you
your keys back.

428
00:31:52,937 --> 00:31:57,033
Danny's a genius.
I'm gonna have a doze.

- Are we there?
- No, we're not. We're here.

430
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:24,592
We're in the middle
of a fucking gale.

431
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:27,255
You'll have to keep
a look out your side.

432
00:33:27,365 --> 00:33:30,198
If you see anything, tell me.
Get hold of that map.

433
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:33,031
- Where's the whiskey?
- What for?

434
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:35,697
I got a bastard
behind the eyes.

435
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,605
I can't take aspirins
without a drink.

436
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:41,610
- Where's the aspirins?
- Probably in the bathroom.

437
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:45,409
We've come out here in the middle
of nowhere without aspirins?

438
00:33:45,516 --> 00:33:48,781
- Where are we?
- How should I know where we are?

439
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:52,287
I feel like a pig
shat in my head.

440
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,951
Get hold of that map and look
for a place called Crow Crag.

441
00:34:13,077 --> 00:34:16,911
There must and shall be aspirin.

442
00:34:18,216 --> 00:34:21,276
Give me the keys.
Get out of the way.

443
00:34:21,385 --> 00:34:25,082
If I don't get aspirin,
I shall die...

fucking mountainside!

- Sitting down to enjoy my holiday.

448
00:35:48,206 --> 00:35:51,505
Right. Now, we're gonna have to
approach this scientifically.

00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:54,407
First thing we've got to do
is get this fire alight.

450
00:35:54,512 --> 00:35:56,742
Then we split into two
fact-finding groups.

451
00:35:56,847 --> 00:35:59,281
I'll deal with the water
and other plumbing.

452
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:02,045
You can check the fuel
and wood situation.

453
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:09,091
- What's that?
- The fuel and wood situation.

454
00:36:09,193 --> 00:36:12,185
There's nothing out there
except a hurricane.

455
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,328
- This place is uninhabitable.
- Give it a chance. It's got to warm up.

456
00:36:19,437 --> 00:36:22,531
Warm up? We may as well
sit around a cigarette.

457
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,200
This is ridiculous.

458
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:28,642
We'll be found dead
in here next spring.

459
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,644
I've got a blinding
fucking headache.

460
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,310
We must have heat.

461
00:36:38,556 --> 00:36:40,786
<i>We've got to keep
this bastard burning.</i>

462
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:43,553
Well, we've got enough
furniture for tonight.

463
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:46,562
Tomorrow we'll go down
that farm and get some logs.

464
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:50,862
Mistake, I'm telling you.
This was a dreadful mistake.

465
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:04,459
<i>- Who's there?
- Me.</i>

466
00:39:07,905 --> 00:39:09,805
What do you want?

467
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:13,138
I'm a friend of Montague Withnail's.
He's lent us his cottage.

468
00:39:13,244 --> 00:39:17,704
I wondered if you could
sell us some food... eggs and things.

469
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:20,375
Hmm?

470
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,047
What about wood and coal?

471
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:29,126
I'm not from London, you know.

472
00:39:29,226 --> 00:39:32,491
I don't care
where you come from!

473
00:39:32,596 --> 00:39:35,463
<i>Not the attitude
I'd been given to expect...</i>

474
00:39:35,566 --> 00:39:37,796
<i>from the H.E. Bates novel
I'd read.</i>

475
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:42,635
<i>I thought they'd all be out the back,
drinking cider, discussing butter.</i>

476
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,640
<i>Clearly a myth.</i>

477
00:39:44,742 --> 00:39:48,838
<i>Evidently, country people are
no more receptive to strangers
than city dwellers.</i>

478
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:55,818
Do you think you could tell me
where I could buy some coal and wood?

479
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,048
<i>You'll have to see me son.
He runs this farm.</i>

480
00:39:59,156 --> 00:40:02,148
<i>- Where is your son?
- Up in top fields.</i>

481
00:40:02,259 --> 00:40:06,355
<i>You can't miss him.
His leg's bound in polythene.</i>

482
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:34,222
Wake up, you bastard!
Wake up!

483
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,193
Wake up, you bastard!
You gotta get wood.

484
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:43,361
Jesus! You're covered in shit.

485
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:45,367
I tried to get the fuel and wood.

486
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:48,370
There's a miserable
little pensioner down there.

487
00:40:48,472 --> 00:40:51,202
- She wouldn't give it to me.
- Where are we gonna get it, then?

488
00:40:51,308 --> 00:40:53,606
There's a man on the mountain.

489
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:57,238
Why he's up there fuck knows.

490
00:40:57,348 --> 00:41:00,078
But he's up there
with a leg in polythene.

491
00:41:00,184 --> 00:41:02,584
You can't miss him.
He's your man.

492
00:41:02,686 --> 00:41:05,382
And have another look
in that shed. Find anything.

493
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:08,390
If you can't find anything,
bring in the shed.

494
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,958
How come Monty owns
such a horrible little shack?

495
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:18,000
No idea.

496
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:20,662
You never discuss
your family, do you?

497
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:23,569
I fail to see my family
as of any interest to you.

498
00:41:23,674 --> 00:41:26,234
I have absolutely
no interest in yours.

499
00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:29,972
I dislike relatives in general,
my own in particular.

500
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,413
- Why?
- Because... I've told you why.

501
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:37,476
We're incompatible.
They don't like me being on stage.

502
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:40,250
<i>Then they must be delighted
with your career.</i>

503
00:41:40,357 --> 00:41:43,019
- What do you mean?
- You rarely are.

504
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:45,322
You just wait!
Just you wait!

505
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:48,489
When I strike, they
won't know what hit them.

506
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,794
Tractor approaching.

507
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:53,870
Now get after him.
That's the man.

508
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,605
- Hey, stop!
- Stop!

509
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,678
Stop! Please!

510
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:04,475
Stop, please!
Please stop!

511
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:10,347
Please stop!

512
00:42:10,454 --> 00:42:13,355
<i>- Are you the farmer?
- Shut up! I'll deal with this!</i>

513
00:42:13,457 --> 00:42:15,550
We've gone on holiday
by mistake.

514
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:18,025
We're in this cottage here.
Are you the farmer?

515
00:42:18,128 --> 00:42:21,188
Stop saying that, Withnail!
Of course he's the fucking farmer!

516
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:24,426
We're friends
of Montague Withnail.

517
00:42:24,535 --> 00:42:27,129
We desperately need
fuel and wood.

518
00:42:27,237 --> 00:42:30,536
Montague Withnail.
You must know him!

519
00:42:30,641 --> 00:42:32,802
Fat man, owns the cottage.

520
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,811
I seen a fat man.
London type. Queer sort.

521
00:42:35,913 --> 00:42:38,143
Think his name's French, or summit.

522
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:40,876
<i>- French?
- Aye. Adriene De La Touche.</i>

523
00:42:40,985 --> 00:42:43,545
He ain't been here
for a couple of years.

524
00:42:43,654 --> 00:42:46,953
- Last time I saw him
he was with his son.
- Yeah, that's him.

525
00:42:47,057 --> 00:42:51,255
Listen, we're bona fide.
We're not from London.
Could we have some fuel and wood?

526
00:42:51,362 --> 00:42:54,729
I could bring you some logs up later.
I've got the cows to feed first.

527
00:42:54,832 --> 00:42:57,266
- When?
- Shut up! That would be very kind.

528
00:42:57,368 --> 00:43:00,531
What about food? Do you think
you could sell us something to eat?

529
00:43:00,638 --> 00:43:03,607
I could bring you a chicken,
but you'll have to go to the village.

530
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:05,766
- That would be very kind, Mr...
- Parkin.

531
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:08,777
Mr. Parkin.
What happened to your leg?

532
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:12,212
Got a randy bull up there.
Give me one in the knee.

533
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:28,696
You wanna go out back?
Get some spuds up?

534
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:32,530
Sorry, I can't.
My boots are in the oven.

535
00:43:32,636 --> 00:43:35,366
- You'd go if you had boots?

536
00:43:35,472 --> 00:43:37,463
<i>Gladly.</i>

537
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:05,224
- I've got one!

538
00:44:30,894 --> 00:44:34,125
- Great. How much do we owe you?
- Pay us when you come down.

539
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:36,495
- What about this chicken?
- He's on the back.

540
00:44:47,077 --> 00:44:50,012
With. With.

541
00:44:50,114 --> 00:44:53,208
Parkin's been.
There's our supper.

542
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:56,115
- What are we supposed to do with that?
- Eat it.

543
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,154
Eat it?
The fucker's alive.

544
00:44:58,255 --> 00:45:00,155
- Yeah, I know that.
You've gotta kill it.
- Me?

545
00:45:00,257 --> 00:45:04,284
- I'm fire lighter and fuel collector.
- Yeah, I know that,
but I got the logs in.

546
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:11,495
It takes away your appetite
looking at it.

547
00:45:11,602 --> 00:45:14,093
No, it doesn't.
I'm starving.

548
00:45:14,204 --> 00:45:17,332
- How can we make it die?
- You have to throttle them.

549
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:22,071
I think you should strangle it
instantly, in case it starts
to make friends with us.

550
00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:25,945
All right, get hold of it.
You hold it down. I'll strangle it.

551
00:45:26,049 --> 00:45:30,110
I can't. Those dreadful, beady eyes.
They stare you out.

552
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:34,088
It's a bloody chicken! Just think
of it with bacon across its back.

553
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:36,716
All right,
I'll deal with this.

554
00:45:36,827 --> 00:45:39,387
You'll have to get
its guts out.

555
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:49,898
Never point guns at people!
It's extremely dangerous.

556
00:45:50,007 --> 00:45:52,840
What about this roasting dish?
What are we gonna cook it in?

557
00:45:52,943 --> 00:45:56,674
You're the food and plumbings man.
I have no idea.
I wish I'd found this an hour ago.

558
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,544
I'd have taken great pleasure
in gunning this pullet down.

559
00:46:02,986 --> 00:46:06,012
- Shouldn't it be more bald than that?
- No, it shouldn't.

560
00:46:06,123 --> 00:46:10,719
Right. We're gonna
have to reverse the roles.

561
00:46:10,828 --> 00:46:15,026
We can bake the potatoes
in the oven...

562
00:46:15,132 --> 00:46:17,828
and we can boil
this bastard over the fire.

563
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:20,699
- Let's get its feet off.
- No.

564
00:46:20,804 --> 00:46:23,295
It's gonna need its feet.

565
00:46:38,488 --> 00:46:41,218
It can stand with its legs
on either side of that.

566
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:51,964
I've already put
two shilling pieces in.

567
00:46:52,069 --> 00:46:54,833
No, I haven't got another.

568
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:58,237
It's not my fault
if the system doesn't work.

569
00:47:00,644 --> 00:47:03,010
The bitch hung up on me.

570
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:20,363
<i>Hello? How are you?</i>

571
00:47:20,464 --> 00:47:23,126
Very well.

572
00:47:23,233 --> 00:47:27,602
A what? Why
wouldn't they see me?

573
00:47:27,704 --> 00:47:30,070
This is ridiculous.

574
00:47:30,173 --> 00:47:32,869
I haven't been up for a job
in three months!

575
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:36,468
Understudy Constantine?
I'm not going to understudy Constantine.

576
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,810
Why can't I play the part?

577
00:47:38,916 --> 00:47:41,146
This is ridiculous.

578
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:44,118
No, I'm not in London.
Penrith.

579
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:46,348
Penrith!

580
00:47:46,456 --> 00:47:48,481
Well, what about TV?

581
00:47:49,726 --> 00:47:52,490
Listen, I pay you
ten percent to do that.

582
00:47:52,596 --> 00:47:56,157
<i>Well, lick ten percent
of the asses for me, then!</i>

583
00:47:56,266 --> 00:47:58,996
<i>Hello? Hello? Hello?</i>

584
00:47:59,102 --> 00:48:03,664
Hello? How dare you?
Fuck you!

585
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:10,977
<i>The bastard asked me to understudy
Constantine in The Seagull.</i>

586
00:48:13,317 --> 00:48:17,447
I don't want to understudy anybody,
especially that little pimp.

587
00:48:18,956 --> 00:48:21,550
Anyway, I loathe
those Russian plays.

588
00:48:21,658 --> 00:48:24,559
Always full of women
staring out of windows,

589
00:48:24,661 --> 00:48:26,720
whining about ducks
going to Moscow.

590
00:48:37,441 --> 00:48:40,069
What do you think
of Desmond Wolfe?

591
00:48:40,177 --> 00:48:43,305
- In respect of what?
- I'm thinking of changing my name.

592
00:48:43,413 --> 00:48:46,576
It's too like Donald Wolfit.

593
00:48:46,683 --> 00:48:48,708
Changeover point.

594
00:48:53,323 --> 00:48:55,883
- Think he's happier than us?
- No.

595
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:03,191
I suppose happiness
is relative.

596
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,030
I never thought it would be
a polythene bag without a hole in it.

597
00:49:06,136 --> 00:49:09,264
- Hey!
- What's the matter with him?

598
00:49:09,373 --> 00:49:12,706
- Shut the gate!
- You didn't shut the gate!

599
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:14,800
<i>Stop that bull!</i>

600
00:49:16,646 --> 00:49:18,944
<i>Stop that bull!</i>

601
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:25,312
Grab its ring!
Keep your bag up!

602
00:49:25,422 --> 00:49:27,788
<i>Out-mind him.</i>

603
00:49:27,891 --> 00:49:30,917
Hey, show no fear.
Just run at it.

604
00:49:31,028 --> 00:49:33,360
That can't be sensible, can it?
The bastard's about to run at me!

605
00:49:33,463 --> 00:49:35,761
- Well, he's randy!
- Yes, I know he is!

606
00:49:35,866 --> 00:49:38,164
Wants to get down there
and have sex with those cows.

607
00:49:38,268 --> 00:49:40,395
Shut up!

608
00:49:40,504 --> 00:49:44,600
- Run at it, shouting!
- Do as he says, start shouting.

609
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:50,673
- He won't gore you.
- A coward you are, Withnail!

610
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:54,012
An expert on bulls
you are not!

611
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,363
Shut that gate
and keep it shut!

612
00:50:11,268 --> 00:50:14,169
I think an evening at the Crow.

613
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:20,774
<i>If the Crow and Crown
ever had life, it was dead now.</i>

614
00:50:20,877 --> 00:50:23,402
<i>It was like
walking into a lung,</i>

615
00:50:23,513 --> 00:50:27,745
<i>a sulfer-stained, nicotine
yellow and fly-blown lung.</i>

616
00:50:27,851 --> 00:50:31,981
<i>Its landlord was a retired alcoholic
with military pretensions...</i>

617
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:34,455
<i>and a complexion
like the inside of a teapot.</i>

618
00:50:35,459 --> 00:50:38,724
<i>By the time the doors opened,
he was arse-holed on rum...</i>

619
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:40,956
<i>and got progressively
more arse-holed...</i>

620
00:50:41,064 --> 00:50:44,329
<i>till he could take no more</i>

621
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:49,966
We'll have another pair
of large scotches.

622
00:51:07,624 --> 00:51:10,559
Thought I was going
for a minute.

623
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,651
No man's put me down yet.

624
00:51:12,762 --> 00:51:14,855
Have you had any training
in the martial arts?

625
00:51:14,965 --> 00:51:17,365
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I have.

626
00:51:17,467 --> 00:51:20,334
Before I became a journalist,
I was in the Territorials.

627
00:51:20,437 --> 00:51:23,235
You know,
when you first came in,

628
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,309
I knew you were a services man.

629
00:51:26,409 --> 00:51:29,867
You could never, never disguise it.

630
00:51:32,482 --> 00:51:35,713
- What were you in?
- Tanks.

631
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:39,084
Africa Corps.
Little before your time.

632
00:51:39,189 --> 00:51:41,919
I don't suppose you've
engaged, have you?

633
00:51:42,025 --> 00:51:46,189
- Ireland.
- Ooh, crack at the Mick?

634
00:51:46,296 --> 00:51:49,231
We'll have another pair
of large scotches.

635
00:51:49,332 --> 00:51:51,892
These shall be my pleasure.

636
00:51:57,274 --> 00:51:59,242
What are you doing
up here, then?

637
00:51:59,342 --> 00:52:01,310
<i>We're doing
a feature for Country Life.</i>

638
00:52:01,411 --> 00:52:03,311
Survey of rural types.

639
00:52:03,413 --> 00:52:07,747
You know, farmers,
traveling tinkers,

640
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:10,217
milkmen, that sort of thing.

641
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,220
Have you...

642
00:52:14,724 --> 00:52:16,851
Have you metJake?

643
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,520
Poacher.
Works the lake.

644
00:52:19,629 --> 00:52:23,156
But, uh, keep it
under your hat, hmm?

645
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,103
What's all this army bollocks?

646
00:52:36,213 --> 00:52:38,841
We got a drink, didn't we?

647
00:52:41,585 --> 00:52:44,145
Time, gentlemen.

648
00:52:46,489 --> 00:52:48,480
I think he means it.

649
00:53:19,556 --> 00:53:22,650
- Go ask him if we can have one.
- What for?

650
00:53:22,759 --> 00:53:26,388
So we can eat it.
We're fed up with stew!

651
00:53:32,736 --> 00:53:35,728
Excuse me.
Could we have an eel?

652
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:39,434
- You've got eels down your leg.
- You leave them alone.

653
00:53:39,542 --> 00:53:43,376
Nothing down there
of interest to you.

654
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,244
Help us out, Raymond.

655
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:50,513
These be fed
from asshole to beak.

656
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:56,382
How about one of those pheasants?
Go on, ask him.

657
00:53:58,161 --> 00:54:01,927
Excuse me. We were wondering if we
could purchase a pheasant off of you?

658
00:54:02,032 --> 00:54:04,364
No. I've got nothing to sell.

659
00:54:04,467 --> 00:54:07,436
Come on, old boy.
What's in your hump?

660
00:54:07,537 --> 00:54:12,440
Now look, you. Them pheasants are
for his pot. These here are for my pot.

661
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:15,477
<i>Now what makes you think I should
give you something for your pot?</i>

662
00:54:15,578 --> 00:54:18,342
- What pot?
- Our cooking pot.

663
00:54:18,448 --> 00:54:22,145
He knows. Hey, give us
a wheeze on that fag.

664
00:54:25,955 --> 00:54:29,391
I might come and see you lads in a week.
I might fetch you up a rabbit.

665
00:54:29,492 --> 00:54:32,256
We don't want a rabbit.
We want a pheasant.

666
00:54:32,362 --> 00:54:35,388
<i>Listen, you young prat.
I ain't got no pheasants.</i>

667
00:54:35,498 --> 00:54:38,023
I ain't got no birds,
no more than you have.

668
00:54:38,134 --> 00:54:41,262
Of course you have.
You're the poacher.

669
00:54:41,371 --> 00:54:44,363
If I hear more words
out of you,

670
00:54:44,474 --> 00:54:47,705
I'll put one of these here
black pods on you.

671
00:54:47,811 --> 00:54:50,871
- Don't threaten me with a dead fish.
- Half dead, he may be.

672
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:54,643
But I'll come up after you,
and I'll wake you up with a live one.

673
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:58,710
Sod your pheasants!
You'll have to find us first.

674
00:54:58,822 --> 00:55:01,655
<i>I know where you are,
at Crow Crag.</i>

675
00:55:01,758 --> 00:55:03,851
<i>I've been watching you.</i>

676
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,724
Especially you,
prancing like a tit.

677
00:55:08,498 --> 00:55:11,296
You want working on, boy.

678
00:55:11,401 --> 00:55:15,201
If I see that silage heap
hanging about up here,

679
00:55:15,305 --> 00:55:18,536
I'll take the bastard
axe to him!

680
00:55:18,641 --> 00:55:22,543
Bastards!
You'll all suffer!

681
00:55:22,645 --> 00:55:25,113
I'll show the lot of you!

682
00:55:25,215 --> 00:55:28,651
I'm gonna be a star!

683
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:34,548
Vegetables again.

684
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:37,286
I'll be sprouting
bloody feelers soon.

685
00:55:37,394 --> 00:55:40,261
Must be 20,000 sheep
out there on those volcanoes,

686
00:55:40,363 --> 00:55:42,957
and we got a plate
full of carrots.

687
00:55:43,066 --> 00:55:46,433
- There's black puddings in it.
- Black puddings are no good to us.

688
00:55:46,536 --> 00:55:49,334
I want something's flesh!

689
00:56:00,917 --> 00:56:03,681
Look! Come here!
Down here. Look.

690
00:56:03,787 --> 00:56:06,517
Under the rock. I can see it.

691
00:56:07,757 --> 00:56:10,453
See him? Look.

692
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,790
He's over there.
Look. Here.

693
00:56:12,896 --> 00:56:15,729
There's two of them here.
Look. Come on, come on.

694
00:56:15,832 --> 00:56:17,993
Where?

695
00:56:41,124 --> 00:56:44,321
I think I'll call myself
Donald Twain.

696
00:56:45,428 --> 00:56:49,558
Stop. Get down.

697
00:56:51,134 --> 00:56:53,602
It's him.
What does he want?

698
00:56:53,703 --> 00:56:57,070
- Go down there and ask him.
- Don't be a fool. He's got a gun.

699
00:56:57,173 --> 00:56:59,835
Bastard's psychotic.
You've only got to look at him.

700
00:57:10,153 --> 00:57:13,384
This place has become impossible.

701
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:16,948
Perpetual rain, freezing cold.

702
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:19,824
Now a bloody madman
on the prowl outside with eels.

703
00:57:19,929 --> 00:57:22,693
All right,
you made your point.

704
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:25,962
We pack up.
We get out tomorrow.

705
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:28,162
- What are you doing?
- I'm going for a slash.

706
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:30,865
No, you're not. I can't get
my boots on when they're hot.

707
00:57:30,974 --> 00:57:33,704
- I'll go alone.
- You're not leaving me in here alone.

708
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:37,371
<i>- Those are the kind of windows
faces look in at.
- Then I won't have a slash.</i>

709
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,710
And in both our interests, I think
we should sleep together tonight.

710
00:57:39,816 --> 00:57:42,876
Don't be ridiculous.
He's not gonna come up here in the dark.

711
00:57:42,986 --> 00:57:45,386
Of course he is.
If he catches one of us,

712
00:57:45,488 --> 00:57:48,218
he's got a better chance
of dealing with the other.

713
00:57:48,324 --> 00:57:50,918
<i>No.</i>

714
00:58:03,973 --> 00:58:07,340
What's the matter with you?
What are you laughing at?

715
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:09,809
I was dreaming.
What do you want?

716
00:58:09,913 --> 00:58:13,371
You frightened the piss out of me.
Move over. I'm getting in.

717
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:21,413
Oh, this is ridiculous.
I'll have to sleep in your bed.

718
00:58:21,524 --> 00:58:23,924
- I'll have to come with you.
- Will you get out?

719
00:58:24,027 --> 00:58:26,791
- No.
- All right, then I will.

720
00:58:35,238 --> 00:58:38,139
All right, you can stay,
but the gun doesn't.

721
00:58:38,241 --> 00:58:40,937
No. I have to keep the gun.
I intend to remain awake.

722
00:58:41,044 --> 00:58:43,638
- This is my bed,
and I demand precedence.
- No!

723
00:58:49,385 --> 00:58:52,616
Mad fucking bastard!

724
00:59:15,278 --> 00:59:18,247
Shhh! Shhh!

725
00:59:18,348 --> 00:59:21,476
- Listen.
- There is nothing! Get to bed!

726
00:59:21,584 --> 00:59:23,984
I heard a noise.

727
00:59:24,087 --> 00:59:25,987
I must get in.

728
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:31,248
<i>Oh, for fuck's sake.</i>

729
00:59:31,361 --> 00:59:33,556
- What was that?
- That's it. That's it.

730
00:59:33,663 --> 00:59:36,257
- What is it?
- It's the killer.

731
00:59:36,366 --> 00:59:40,325
<i>- It's probably foxes looking for grub.
- Listen. Listen.</i>

732
00:59:40,436 --> 00:59:43,166
Maybe it's the farmer.

733
00:59:43,272 --> 00:59:47,106
At 2:00 in the morning?
It's the killer.

734
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:50,702
He's come to kill us.
What are we gonna do?

735
00:59:53,282 --> 00:59:56,217
He wants to come in.
He's trying to get in.

736
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:59,311
He can't. He'll go away.

737
00:59:59,422 --> 01:00:01,515
He's going away.

738
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:09,023
<i>This is all your fault.</i>

739
01:00:09,132 --> 01:00:12,101
You've even given him
the fucking gun.

740
01:00:17,006 --> 01:00:20,203
He's coming through the window.
He's getting in.

741
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:23,472
- Give me the matches.
- Downstairs.

742
01:00:25,148 --> 01:00:29,710
He's in.
He's sharpening a fucking knife.

743
01:00:31,921 --> 01:00:35,322
We'll have to tackle him. You stay
in bed, pretending to be asleep.

744
01:00:35,425 --> 01:00:38,326
He'll go for you.
When he does, I'll jump on his back.

745
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:41,363
No, no, no. It'll be too late.
I'll be knifed by then.

746
01:00:41,464 --> 01:00:44,297
We'll have to try
and make friends with him.

747
01:00:50,339 --> 01:00:53,706
They're going into your room.
It's you he wants.

748
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:56,973
Offer him yourself.

749
01:01:07,724 --> 01:01:11,057
We mean no harm!

750
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,494
<i>Oh, my boys!
My boys! Forgive me!</i>

751
01:01:15,598 --> 01:01:19,694
- Monty! Monty, Monty!
- Monty, you terrible cunt!

752
01:01:19,802 --> 01:01:23,033
<i>Forgive me. It was inconsiderate
of me not to have telegrammed.</i>

753
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:26,131
What are you doing, prowling around
in the middle of the fucking night!

754
01:01:26,242 --> 01:01:30,178
I had a punctured tire.
I had to wait an eon for assistance.

755
01:01:30,279 --> 01:01:33,578
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
I should have knocked, but...

756
01:01:33,683 --> 01:01:37,676
<i>- l- l-I'll sleep
in the other room, if I may.
- Anywhere you like.</i>

757
01:01:37,787 --> 01:01:41,279
Uh, yes, well.
Uh... good night.

758
01:01:45,461 --> 01:01:48,624
Brrr! Ah, good morning.
Did you sleep well?

759
01:01:48,731 --> 01:01:50,631
Mm-hmm.

760
01:01:55,204 --> 01:01:58,571
Um, l-l-I do apologize
for last night.

761
01:01:58,674 --> 01:02:02,576
- It was perfectly inconsiderate of me.
- It's perfectly all right, Monty.

762
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:05,511
- You've been busy in here?
- As a bee.

763
01:02:05,615 --> 01:02:09,551
- How did you repair the window?
- Oh, I didn't break it.

764
01:02:09,652 --> 01:02:14,316
Merely forced it a little.
Sorry if I frightened you.

765
01:02:14,423 --> 01:02:17,517
There was an empty
wine bottle on the ledge.

766
01:02:17,627 --> 01:02:20,755
Oh, tomatoes. Yes.

767
01:02:26,402 --> 01:02:29,860
<i>Why don't you go and wake him?
Breakfast in 15 minutes.</i>

768
01:02:29,972 --> 01:02:34,306
The old order changeth,

769
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:37,902
yielding place to new.

770
01:02:38,014 --> 01:02:42,747
And God fulfills Himself
in many ways.

771
01:02:42,852 --> 01:02:45,320
And soon...

772
01:02:46,422 --> 01:02:48,720
I suppose...

773
01:02:48,825 --> 01:02:50,918
I shall be swept away...

774
01:02:51,027 --> 01:02:54,326
by some vulgar little tumor.

775
01:02:55,798 --> 01:02:58,232
Oh, my boys.

776
01:02:58,334 --> 01:03:01,792
My boys,
we're at the end of an age.

777
01:03:01,904 --> 01:03:05,203
We live in a land
of weather forecasts...

778
01:03:05,308 --> 01:03:08,209
and breakfasts that 'set in,'

779
01:03:08,311 --> 01:03:12,247
shat on by Tories,
shoveled up by Labor.

780
01:03:12,348 --> 01:03:16,148
And here we are... we three...

781
01:03:16,252 --> 01:03:20,655
perhaps the last island
of beauty in the world.

782
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:27,627
Now, which of you is going to be
a splendid fellow...

783
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:30,722
and go down to the Rolls
for the rest of the wine?

784
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:34,098
- I will.
- No, I'd better go.
I wanna dig the car out anyway.

785
01:03:34,203 --> 01:03:37,969
- But we have my car, dear boy.
- Yes, but if it rains, we're buggered.

786
01:03:38,074 --> 01:03:40,406
- I mean...
- Stranded!

787
01:03:40,509 --> 01:03:44,001
- We'll leave the car till later.
Leave this to me.
- I'll come. I fancy a walk.

788
01:03:44,113 --> 01:03:47,947
No, I hear you're
a little wizard in the kitchen.
I shall need you, to work the joint.

789
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:52,919
<i>- Yeah, you're the cook.
- And... what on earth are those?</i>

790
01:03:53,022 --> 01:03:55,354
- We forgot to bring our Wellingtons.
- Oh, but how dreadful.

791
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:58,689
Do you mean you've been up here
in all this beastly mud and oomska
without Wellingtons?

792
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:01,592
Well, this afternoon
I shall take you both into Penrith...

793
01:04:01,697 --> 01:04:05,326
and get you fitted with some
good quality rubber boots.

794
01:04:08,938 --> 01:04:12,430
Garlic, rosemary and salt.

795
01:04:14,176 --> 01:04:17,168
I brought two of these in case either
of you was any good in the kitchen.

796
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,545
- I'm not.
- Of course you are. Cooking
is one of the natural instincts.

797
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:24,381
Listen, Monty.
This is all very kind of you,

798
01:04:24,487 --> 01:04:26,955
but I really think I ought to be
out there getting work done on the car.

799
01:04:27,056 --> 01:04:29,650
You haven't time.
We're taking late luncheon at 3:00.

800
01:04:29,759 --> 01:04:32,819
- I'm afraid we have to leave
by 3:00, Monty.
- Leave?

801
01:04:32,929 --> 01:04:35,796
Oh, didn't he tell you?
We have to get back to sign on.

802
01:04:35,898 --> 01:04:41,393
- Sign on? At the Labor Exchange?
- Yeah.

803
01:04:41,504 --> 01:04:45,873
It's sort of fashionable, actually.
All the actors do it. Even Redgrave.

804
01:04:47,543 --> 01:04:51,912
But surely you could forego
for just this one occasion.

805
01:04:52,014 --> 01:04:54,847
I've come a very long way
to see you both.

806
01:04:54,951 --> 01:04:59,888
<i>Can't, actually. I mean,
I'd love to stay, but he's more
adamant to get back than I am.</i>

807
01:04:59,989 --> 01:05:03,117
Then we must choose
our moment...

808
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:08,626
and have a word with him.

809
01:05:11,233 --> 01:05:13,997
I'm sure together
we could persuade him.

810
01:05:16,572 --> 01:05:20,064
There. Now, garlic,

811
01:05:20,176 --> 01:05:22,838
rosemary and salt.

812
01:05:22,945 --> 01:05:26,142
I can never touch meat
until it's cooked.

813
01:05:26,248 --> 01:05:29,513
As a youth, I used to weep
in butcher shops.

814
01:05:29,618 --> 01:05:32,781
<i>- I can't find the rosemary.
- Ah.</i>

815
01:05:34,857 --> 01:05:37,724
Can't find the rosemary.

816
01:05:39,395 --> 01:05:41,363
I'm sure we could find it
together.

817
01:05:44,266 --> 01:05:47,360
- Perhaps it's in the other bag.
- Perhaps it is.

818
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:49,370
Shall we look?

819
01:05:53,209 --> 01:05:55,734
Oh, sorry. Sherry's in there.

820
01:06:01,217 --> 01:06:04,277
What do you mean, "sorry"? What's
going on? What's he doing here?

821
01:06:04,387 --> 01:06:06,651
We can't stay.
He won't leave me alone.

822
01:06:06,756 --> 01:06:09,156
<i>All right. We'll get the lunch done,
and then we'll leave.</i>

823
01:06:10,893 --> 01:06:14,454
I'm afraid
we must drink from these.

824
01:06:19,535 --> 01:06:22,800
I trust their shapes
will not offend your palates.

825
01:06:22,905 --> 01:06:27,308
- Chin-chin.
- To a delightful weekend in the country.

826
01:06:51,834 --> 01:06:54,166
I do think you could have shaved.

827
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:57,364
What on earth will people
think of me turning up with you two?

828
01:06:57,473 --> 01:06:59,771
You look like a pair
of farm hands.

829
01:07:05,848 --> 01:07:07,748
Tsk!

830
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:09,750
This is most embarrassing.

831
01:07:11,987 --> 01:07:14,455
Get away from the car.

832
01:07:14,557 --> 01:07:17,458
Buy the Wellingtons.

833
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,961
I'm going to buy some razors
and shaving soap.

834
01:07:21,063 --> 01:07:23,827
I'll see you over there
in half an hour.

835
01:07:23,933 --> 01:07:26,834
- Pair of blues.
- One each.

836
01:07:28,337 --> 01:07:30,805
- I think a drink, don't you?
- What about the Wellingtons?

837
01:07:30,906 --> 01:07:32,806
Oh, bollocks
to the Wellingtons.

838
01:07:32,908 --> 01:07:35,809
We'll tell them they had a farmer's
conference and had a run on them.

839
01:07:45,287 --> 01:07:48,381
Okay. Yeah. Promise.

840
01:07:48,491 --> 01:07:50,857
Bye.

841
01:07:54,163 --> 01:07:59,123
No, hasn't heard a thing.
Apparently, they're still seeing people.

842
01:07:59,235 --> 01:08:02,227
You don't want to go to Manchester
anyway. Play a bloody soldier?

843
01:08:02,338 --> 01:08:04,670
Don't I?
I damned well do.

844
01:08:04,773 --> 01:08:07,469
- It's a bloody good little theater.
- It's not much of a part, is it?

845
01:08:07,576 --> 01:08:09,544
Well, it's better than nothing.

846
01:08:09,645 --> 01:08:13,046
- They'll make you cut your hair.
- So what? You'd lose a leg.

847
01:08:13,149 --> 01:08:16,118
- Time gents, please.
- All right. We're gonna
have to work quickly.

848
01:08:16,218 --> 01:08:19,881
A pair of quadruple whiskies
and another pair of pints, please.

849
01:08:24,059 --> 01:08:27,551
Where is he?
I'm utterly assholed.

850
01:08:27,663 --> 01:08:29,563
We're early.

851
01:08:31,567 --> 01:08:34,365
We want to get in there,
don't we?

852
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:37,303
Eat some cake,
soak up the booze.

853
01:08:48,584 --> 01:08:50,882
- All right here?
- What do you want?

854
01:08:50,986 --> 01:08:55,116
- Cake. All right here?
- Uh, no. We're closing in a minute.

855
01:08:55,224 --> 01:08:57,624
We're leaving in a minute.

856
01:09:02,765 --> 01:09:06,963
- We want cake and tea.
- Didn't you hear?

857
01:09:07,069 --> 01:09:10,334
She said she'd closed.
What do you want in here?

858
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:13,966
Cake.
What's it got to do with you?

859
01:09:14,076 --> 01:09:16,772
I happen to be the proprietor.

860
01:09:16,879 --> 01:09:19,313
Now, would you leave?

861
01:09:19,415 --> 01:09:22,612
Ah, I'm glad
you're the proprietor.

862
01:09:22,718 --> 01:09:25,653
I was gonna have to have
a word with you anyway.

863
01:09:25,754 --> 01:09:28,188
We're working on a film up here.

864
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,815
Location, see.

865
01:09:30,926 --> 01:09:33,588
We might want to do
a film in here.

866
01:09:33,696 --> 01:09:38,326
- You're drunk.
- Just bring out the cakes.
Cake and fine wine.

867
01:09:38,434 --> 01:09:41,767
- If you don't leave,
we'll call the police.
- Balls!

868
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:44,498
We want the finest wines
available to humanity.

869
01:09:44,607 --> 01:09:46,973
And we want them here,
and we want them now.

870
01:09:47,076 --> 01:09:49,442
<i>Miss Blenehassitt, telephone the police.</i>

871
01:09:49,545 --> 01:09:53,948
It's all right,
Miss Blenehassitt.

872
01:09:54,049 --> 01:09:58,247
<i>I'm warning you,
if you do, you're fired.</i>

873
01:09:58,354 --> 01:10:00,845
We're multimillionaires.

874
01:10:00,956 --> 01:10:03,288
We shall buy this place
and fire you immediately.

875
01:10:03,392 --> 01:10:08,329
Yes, we'll buy this place, and we'll
install a fucking jukebox in here...

876
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:11,957
and liven
all of you stiffs up a bit.

877
01:10:12,067 --> 01:10:14,433
The police, Miss Blenehassitt.

878
01:10:14,536 --> 01:10:18,495
Just say there are a couple of drunks
in the Penrith Tea Rooms,
and we want them removed.

879
01:10:18,607 --> 01:10:21,974
We are not drunks.
We are multimillionaires.

880
01:10:22,077 --> 01:10:25,478
Hurry up, Mabs.
We'll keep them here till they arrive.

881
01:10:25,581 --> 01:10:27,742
<i>You won't keep us anywhere.</i>

882
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,977
We'll buy this place
and have it knocked down.

883
01:10:30,085 --> 01:10:32,383
<i>- Right, right, right.
- Police, please.</i>

884
01:10:32,488 --> 01:10:35,116
Right. We're going.

885
01:10:35,224 --> 01:10:38,216
Our car has arrived.

886
01:10:38,327 --> 01:10:40,852
We'll be back.

887
01:10:40,963 --> 01:10:44,956
<i>We're coming back in here.</i>

888
01:10:49,972 --> 01:10:52,634
- Where is he?
- Sulking up the hill.

889
01:10:52,741 --> 01:10:55,107
He says he won't come in
for lunch without an apology.

890
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,610
Suits me.
He can eat his fucking radish.

891
01:10:59,381 --> 01:11:01,281
It's all your fault.

892
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:05,285
- You lead him astray.
- I beg your pardon, Monty.

893
01:11:05,387 --> 01:11:09,517
Don't tell me you're not aware of it.
I know what you're up to, and so do you.

894
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:13,117
- Sherry?
- Sherry? Oh, dear, no, no, no.

895
01:11:13,228 --> 01:11:17,790
I'd be sucked into his trap.
One of us has got to stay on guard.

896
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:21,063
He's so mauve.
We don't know what he's planning.

897
01:11:31,613 --> 01:11:34,844
I'm preparing myself
to forgive you.

898
01:11:36,819 --> 01:11:39,754
I think
you've been punished enough.

899
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:44,857
I think we'd better release you
from the lgumes...

900
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,451
and transfer your talents
to the meat.

901
01:11:54,937 --> 01:11:57,770
You shouldn't treat each other
so badly.

902
01:11:57,873 --> 01:12:00,967
This boy's been out there
frozen to the marrow,

903
01:12:01,076 --> 01:12:03,476
and you just sit in here
drinking.

904
01:12:03,579 --> 01:12:07,709
Come along. He's going
to revitalize himself, and you're
going to finish the vegetables.

905
01:12:07,816 --> 01:12:10,250
- I don't know how to do them.
- Well, of course you don't.

906
01:12:10,352 --> 01:12:12,752
You are incapable of indulging
in anything but pleasure.

907
01:12:12,855 --> 01:12:15,790
Am I not right?
You don't deserve such loyalty.

908
01:12:15,891 --> 01:12:20,521
Now, come along. I'm going
to teach you how to peel a potato.

909
01:12:25,868 --> 01:12:29,099
Isn't it stimulating, getting back
to a basic sort of life for a while?

910
01:12:29,204 --> 01:12:31,968
- Yes.
- Surrounded by trees and nature,

911
01:12:32,074 --> 01:12:35,066
one feels a glorious stirring
of the senses...

912
01:12:35,177 --> 01:12:37,475
a rejection
of poisonous inhibition...

913
01:12:37,579 --> 01:12:40,070
and a fecund motion of the soul.

914
01:12:40,182 --> 01:12:45,245
Except, of course, the problems
tend to take the edge off the pleasure.

915
01:12:45,354 --> 01:12:49,848
I mean, with no proper facilities.

916
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:53,655
All the glorious trials
of youth, dear boy.

917
01:12:53,762 --> 01:12:59,428
When I was a lad, I'd rocket off
on my tandem with Wrigglesworth,
and we'd just ride and ride.

918
01:12:59,535 --> 01:13:04,302
And at night we'd find
some barn and fall asleep,

919
01:13:04,406 --> 01:13:07,967
with the perfumes of nature
sighing on our skin.

920
01:13:08,076 --> 01:13:11,603
Would it be in bad form
to plagiarize a toast?

921
01:13:11,713 --> 01:13:14,546
It depends entirely
on the quality of the wine.

922
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:17,915
In this instance,
it most certainly would not.

923
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:22,582
In that case, to a delightful
weekend in the country.

924
01:13:22,691 --> 01:13:24,591
<i>Oh, splendid!</i>

925
01:13:28,464 --> 01:13:31,262
We expected a volley of argument
concerning Mr. Redgrave.

926
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:35,029
- We're forgetting aboutJake...
- Not another word.

927
01:13:35,137 --> 01:13:37,332
Not another word.
Jake can wait too.

928
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:40,897
Jake isn't a friend, Monty.
I'd hoped to avoid telling you this,

929
01:13:41,009 --> 01:13:43,773
but there's a psychotic
on the prowl outside this house.

930
01:13:43,879 --> 01:13:47,713
Ask him if I exaggerate.
He's threatened us, and he's dangerous.

931
01:13:47,816 --> 01:13:49,841
Is this true?

932
01:13:49,952 --> 01:13:53,012
Well, there's this local type
hanging about.

933
01:13:53,121 --> 01:13:57,581
A poacher. We got into a tiff,
and he threatened me with a dead fish.

934
01:13:57,693 --> 01:14:00,457
Yes, it was rather amusing, actually.

935
01:14:00,562 --> 01:14:03,759
<i>When you came in,
we thought it was him.</i>

936
01:14:03,866 --> 01:14:07,962
And we thought that you
cleaning your boots...

937
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:09,970
was him sharpening his knife.

938
01:14:12,774 --> 01:14:15,902
Oh, how delicious.

939
01:14:16,011 --> 01:14:19,538
Mmm, more meat?

940
01:14:19,648 --> 01:14:22,116
No, thank you.
I'll go out for a walk.

941
01:14:22,217 --> 01:14:26,244
Oh, wait for us to finish,
dear boy. We'll all go.

942
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:32,786
Listen, I know what you're thinking,
but I had no alternative.

943
01:14:32,895 --> 01:14:35,659
The old bugger's come a long way, and
I didn't want to put the wind up him.

944
01:14:35,764 --> 01:14:37,925
Your sensitivity overwhelms me.

945
01:14:38,033 --> 01:14:41,560
If you think you're gonna have
a weekend's indulgence at his expense,

946
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:44,230
which means him having
a weekend's indulgence at my expense,

947
01:14:44,339 --> 01:14:46,569
- you've got another thing coming.
- I give you my word.

948
01:14:46,675 --> 01:14:49,439
- We'll leave first thing
tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow? What about tonight?

949
01:14:49,545 --> 01:14:51,945
- He's not gonna try anything.
- Of course he is!

950
01:14:52,047 --> 01:14:55,881
- He means business.
- Anyway, he sent me out
to tell you coffee's ready.

951
01:14:55,984 --> 01:14:59,385
I couldn't drink it. I've got
a cramp in the mouth from grinning.

952
01:14:59,488 --> 01:15:01,956
- Well, stop smiling at him.
- I can't help it.

953
01:15:02,057 --> 01:15:05,151
I'm so uptight with him,
I can't stop myself.

954
01:15:07,329 --> 01:15:11,129
<i>"Laisse-moir respirir,</i>

955
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:16,102
<i>longtemps longtemps
L 'odeur de tes cheveux. "</i>

956
01:15:16,204 --> 01:15:19,367
Ah, Baudelaire.

957
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:23,137
Brings back such memories
of Oxford!

958
01:15:23,245 --> 01:15:25,236
Oh, Oxford!

959
01:15:25,347 --> 01:15:28,874
<i>Followed by yet another
anecdote about his sensitive crimes...</i>

960
01:15:28,984 --> 01:15:31,145
<i>in a punt with a chap
called Norman...</i>

961
01:15:31,253 --> 01:15:33,153
<i>who had red hair
and a book of poetry...</i>

962
01:15:33,255 --> 01:15:35,382
<i>stained with the butter drips
from crumpets.</i>

963
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:38,584
I often wonder
where Norman is now.

964
01:15:38,694 --> 01:15:40,992
Probably wintering
with his mother in Guildford.

965
01:15:41,096 --> 01:15:42,996
A cat and rain.

966
01:15:43,098 --> 01:15:44,998
Vim under the sink.

967
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:48,126
And both bars on.

968
01:15:48,236 --> 01:15:51,137
But old now... old.

969
01:15:51,239 --> 01:15:53,901
There can be no true beauty
without decay.

970
01:15:54,009 --> 01:15:59,504
"A requiem for England."
- How right you are. How right you are.

971
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:03,107
We live in a kingdom of rains...

972
01:16:03,218 --> 01:16:07,018
where royalty comes in gangs.

973
01:16:07,122 --> 01:16:10,455
Come on, lads. Let's get home.
The sky is beginning to bruise.

974
01:16:10,559 --> 01:16:14,086
Night must fall,
and we shall be forced to camp.

975
01:16:15,731 --> 01:16:18,291
He's not in my room, all right?
That's the condition, all right?

976
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,868
- All right.
- I want the room with the lock.
Agree to that, or I'm off.

977
01:16:20,969 --> 01:16:22,869
All right. All right.

978
01:16:30,278 --> 01:16:34,214
<i>Good ol'Jake, eh?
I told you. He's back.</i>

979
01:16:34,316 --> 01:16:37,217
And that's precisely the reason
I'm off to London.

980
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:40,015
Let's all have a good laugh,
eh, Withnail?

981
01:16:40,122 --> 01:16:43,216
Good ol'Jake is back.

982
01:16:43,325 --> 01:16:45,759
He's going away.
He's leaving.

983
01:16:45,861 --> 01:16:49,058
Come on. Let's pack up and get out
of here before it gets dark.

984
01:17:06,548 --> 01:17:10,279
"Here hare, here."

985
01:17:11,386 --> 01:17:13,650
"Here hare, here."

986
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:15,655
Good ol'Jake.

987
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,960
<i>Ace bets.
Ace bets two and it's over to you.</i>

988
01:17:30,038 --> 01:17:33,735
Your two and up two.

989
01:17:33,842 --> 01:17:35,742
<i>- Mmm.
- So that's four?</i>

990
01:17:35,844 --> 01:17:38,039
That's four.

991
01:17:39,981 --> 01:17:45,544
<i>- Four.
- This is for the raise.
We'll see the two.</i>

992
01:17:45,654 --> 01:17:48,589
Now, last card up.

993
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:50,715
"Looking a bit lonely, isn't he?"

994
01:17:50,826 --> 01:17:53,852
" He needs a queen
to come to the rescue."

995
01:17:56,331 --> 01:17:59,061
And... oh!

996
01:18:02,037 --> 01:18:04,597
There she is.

997
01:18:04,706 --> 01:18:08,142
Oh!

998
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:15,508
Well, it's the two queens
to beat.

999
01:18:29,531 --> 01:18:31,726
Another hand?

1000
01:18:35,604 --> 01:18:38,573
I think we'd better
get him to bed.

1001
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:41,107
No, no. He's down here.

1002
01:18:43,478 --> 01:18:45,708
You're in my room,
I'm in his room and he's down here.

1003
01:18:45,814 --> 01:18:49,910
I wouldn't dream of depriving
the dear fellow of his bed,
especially in that condition.

1004
01:18:50,018 --> 01:18:52,714
- But it's agreed. It's what he wants.
- No, I don't.

1005
01:18:52,821 --> 01:18:54,721
I wanna get to bed.

1006
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:59,260
All right then, lovey.
Let's get you to bed.

1007
01:18:59,361 --> 01:19:01,795
Early night will do us both good.

1008
01:19:03,932 --> 01:19:08,028
<i>- Night-night, then, Monty.
- I want to be alone!</i>

1009
01:19:10,806 --> 01:19:12,706
I wanna be alone.

1010
01:19:35,163 --> 01:19:37,723
I think he'd better
sleep alone tonight.

1011
01:19:39,868 --> 01:19:44,305
- He doesn't want to sleep with you.
- Right.

1012
01:19:44,406 --> 01:19:47,898
Well, you're in there,

1013
01:19:48,009 --> 01:19:50,477
and I'll take these
and I'll have the couch.

1014
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:54,414
I'll say good night, then, Monty.

1015
01:19:54,516 --> 01:19:58,748
You already have... twice.

1016
01:20:27,349 --> 01:20:30,910
What is it, Monty? I'm terribly tired.
I need to go to sleep.

1017
01:20:31,019 --> 01:20:34,455
<i>But not that tired, eh?</i>

1018
01:20:39,594 --> 01:20:44,588
- Are you a sponge or a stone?
- What do you mean?

1019
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:48,191
<i>Do you like to experience
all facets of life?</i>

1020
01:20:48,303 --> 01:20:51,795
Or do you shut yourself off
from new experience?

1021
01:20:51,907 --> 01:20:54,171
<i>- I voted Conservative.
- Are you faithful?</i>

1022
01:20:54,276 --> 01:20:57,712
- To whom?
- Faithfulness isn't selective.

1023
01:20:57,812 --> 01:21:01,748
<i>I agree. It's more a question of
selecting to whom one will be faithful.</i>

1024
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:06,048
- Have you selected?
- I'm terribly tired.

1025
01:21:06,154 --> 01:21:10,090
I've been watching you
all evening.

1026
01:21:10,191 --> 01:21:13,354
You've been avoiding my eyes,
haven't you?

1027
01:21:13,461 --> 01:21:15,861
- Your eyes?
- Mmm.

1028
01:21:15,964 --> 01:21:19,331
At luncheon, you couldn't tear
your gaze from mine.

1029
01:21:19,434 --> 01:21:21,994
This evening,
you barely looked at me.

1030
01:21:22,103 --> 01:21:24,264
What did he say to you?

1031
01:21:24,372 --> 01:21:27,239
<i>- Nothing.
- You can tell me.</i>

1032
01:21:27,342 --> 01:21:29,970
I assure you, nothing, M-Monty.

1033
01:21:30,078 --> 01:21:33,980
I'm terribly tired.
I need to go to bed.

1034
01:21:34,082 --> 01:21:37,017
<i>Yes, you must, mustn't you?</i>

1035
01:21:37,118 --> 01:21:39,746
Off you go, then.

1036
01:21:39,854 --> 01:21:41,947
I'll sleep here.

1037
01:21:42,057 --> 01:21:46,084
It won't be the first time
I've been left with the couch.

1038
01:22:03,004 --> 01:22:05,495
Boy.

1039
01:22:07,409 --> 01:22:10,207
Boy.

1040
01:22:10,311 --> 01:22:14,338
I know you're not asleep, boy.

1041
01:22:14,449 --> 01:22:18,283
<i>But he is.</i>

1042
01:22:18,386 --> 01:22:21,981
I've been into his room.

1043
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:24,888
He won't hear a thing.

1044
01:22:27,862 --> 01:22:29,762
I know you're not asleep, boy.

1045
01:22:29,864 --> 01:22:33,027
No, I'm not.
What is it, Monty?

1046
01:22:33,134 --> 01:22:37,093
What do you want?

1047
01:22:37,205 --> 01:22:41,039
I had to come.
I tried not to.

1048
01:22:41,142 --> 01:22:43,770
Oh, how I tried not to.

1049
01:22:43,878 --> 01:22:46,176
Monty, there's something
I have to explain to you.

1050
01:22:46,281 --> 01:22:48,681
You needn't explain.
He's told me everything.

1051
01:22:48,783 --> 01:22:50,683
He told me that
first day you came to Chelsea.

1052
01:22:50,785 --> 01:22:55,313
- What's he told you?
- He told me about your arrest
in the Tottenham Court Road.

1053
01:22:55,423 --> 01:22:57,891
He told me about your problems,

1054
01:22:57,992 --> 01:23:00,722
how you feel, your desires.

1055
01:23:00,829 --> 01:23:04,560
- Problems? What problems?
- You are a toilet trader.

1056
01:23:04,666 --> 01:23:07,294
- He told you that?
- You mustn't blame him.

1057
01:23:07,402 --> 01:23:11,566
You mustn't blame yourself. I know
how you feel and how difficult it is.

1058
01:23:11,673 --> 01:23:16,940
And that's why you mustn't hold back,
let it ruin your youth as I nearly did
over Eric.

1059
01:23:17,045 --> 01:23:20,105
It's like a tide.
Give in to it, boy.

1060
01:23:20,215 --> 01:23:24,618
Go with it.
It's society's crime, not ours.

1061
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:27,847
- I'm not homosexual, Monty.
- Yes, you are!

1062
01:23:27,956 --> 01:23:31,687
Of course you are. You're
simply blackmailing your emotions...

1063
01:23:31,793 --> 01:23:34,455
to avoid the realities
of your relationship with him.

1064
01:23:34,562 --> 01:23:37,690
- What are you talking about?
- You love him.

1065
01:23:37,799 --> 01:23:40,199
And it isn't his fault
he cannot love you...

1066
01:23:40,301 --> 01:23:43,327
any more than it's mine
that I adore you.

1067
01:23:47,108 --> 01:23:50,271
Couldn't we allow ourselves
just this one moment of indiscretion?

1068
01:23:50,378 --> 01:23:52,278
- No!
- He need never know.

1069
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:55,474
I don't care what he knows! Monty,
you've gotta go! You've gotta leave!

1070
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:58,108
If you want to humiliate me,
humiliate me.

1071
01:23:58,219 --> 01:24:00,153
I adore you.

1072
01:24:00,255 --> 01:24:02,951
Tell him, if you must.
I no longer care.

1073
01:24:03,057 --> 01:24:07,016
I mean to have you,
even if it must be burglary!

1074
01:24:08,863 --> 01:24:10,763
It's not me, it's him!

1075
01:24:16,805 --> 01:24:19,330
He lied to you.
We're an affair.

1076
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,170
We have been for years,
but he doesn't want you to know.

1077
01:24:22,277 --> 01:24:26,179
He doesn't want anybody to know.
We're both in it.
We're obsessed with each other.

1078
01:24:26,281 --> 01:24:29,910
But he's ashamed. He refuses
to come out and accept what he is.

1079
01:24:30,018 --> 01:24:32,816
That's why he's rejecting me
while you're here.

1080
01:24:32,921 --> 01:24:37,688
On my life, Monty, this is the first
night we haven't slept together
for six years.

1081
01:24:37,792 --> 01:24:39,817
I can't cheat on him.
It would kill him.

1082
01:24:39,928 --> 01:24:43,364
But he told me you were in purgatory
because he couldn't love you.

1083
01:24:43,464 --> 01:24:46,456
<i>He's lying. Lying!</i>

1084
01:24:46,568 --> 01:24:50,834
Oh, my dear boy.

1085
01:24:50,939 --> 01:24:54,067
If I had known that, I would never
have attempted to come between you.

1086
01:24:54,175 --> 01:24:56,609
I know that, Monty.

1087
01:24:56,711 --> 01:24:59,179
I respect you
for your sensitivity.

1088
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,544
I thank you for it,

1089
01:25:01,649 --> 01:25:03,913
but you must leave.

1090
01:25:06,154 --> 01:25:09,282
Yes.

1091
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:12,757
Yes. You'd better go to him.

1092
01:25:12,861 --> 01:25:15,056
Oh, I intend to.

1093
01:25:15,163 --> 01:25:17,290
This instant.

1094
01:25:17,732 --> 01:25:21,065
<i>Withnail, you bastard. Wake up.</i>

1095
01:25:21,135 --> 01:25:26,163
Wake up, you bastard,
or I'll burn this bastard bed down.

1096
01:25:26,274 --> 01:25:30,734
I deny all accusations.
What do you want?

1097
01:25:30,845 --> 01:25:33,075
I have just narrowly avoided
having a buggering.

1098
01:25:33,181 --> 01:25:36,150
I've come in here with the express
intention of wishing one on you.

1099
01:25:36,251 --> 01:25:38,811
Having said that, I now intend
to leave for London.

1100
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,445
Hold on. Don't let your
imagination run away with you.

1101
01:25:41,556 --> 01:25:43,854
Imagination? I just finished
fighting a naked man.

1102
01:25:43,958 --> 01:25:46,426
How dare you tell him
I'm a toilet trader!

1103
01:25:46,527 --> 01:25:49,087
It was a tactical necessity.

1104
01:25:49,197 --> 01:25:52,030
If I hadn't told him you were active,
we'd never have got the cottage.

1105
01:25:52,133 --> 01:25:54,033
I never have wanted it...
not with him in it!

1106
01:25:54,135 --> 01:25:57,901
Geez. He'd come all this way.

1107
01:25:58,006 --> 01:26:02,306
<i>- Monty? He'd go to New York.
- It was a calculated risk.</i>

1108
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:05,004
What is all this tactical
necessity and calculated risk?

1109
01:26:05,113 --> 01:26:07,809
This is me naked in a corner!

1110
01:26:07,916 --> 01:26:10,510
And how dare you tell him
I love you.

1111
01:26:10,618 --> 01:26:13,451
And how dare you tell him
you rejected me.

1112
01:26:13,554 --> 01:26:16,489
<i>- How dare you tell him that!
- Sorry about that.</i>

1113
01:26:16,591 --> 01:26:19,958
Got a bit carried away.
Sort of said it without thinking.

1114
01:26:20,061 --> 01:26:23,588
<i>Let me tell you something, Withnail.
If he comes into my room again,
it's murder,</i>

1115
01:26:23,698 --> 01:26:26,690
and you will be held
responsible in law.

1116
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:35,837
"Perhaps it is appropriate justice
for the eavesdropper...

1117
01:26:35,944 --> 01:26:39,311
"that he should leave
as his trade determines...

1118
01:26:39,414 --> 01:26:43,510
"in secrecy and in the dead of night.

1119
01:26:43,618 --> 01:26:47,315
<i>- "I do sincerely hope that
you will find the happiness...</i>

1120
01:26:47,422 --> 01:26:50,983
"which, alas,
has always been denied to me.

1121
01:26:52,927 --> 01:26:55,987
"I am yours ever faithfully,

1122
01:26:56,097 --> 01:26:57,997
Montague H. Withnail."

1123
01:26:59,701 --> 01:27:02,135
Poor old bastard.

1124
01:27:02,236 --> 01:27:04,136
I would say...

1125
01:27:05,673 --> 01:27:09,769
that that represents
a degree of hypocrisy...

1126
01:27:09,877 --> 01:27:14,473
I've hitherto suspected in you but not
noticed, due to highly evasive skills.

1127
01:27:14,582 --> 01:27:18,541
Christ, Withnail.
You'll suffer for this.

1128
01:27:18,653 --> 01:27:21,087
What you have done
will have to be paid for.

1129
01:27:21,189 --> 01:27:23,157
I will say one thing for Monty.

1130
01:27:23,257 --> 01:27:25,452
He keeps a sensational cellar.

1131
01:27:35,269 --> 01:27:37,897
<i>- Who's there?
- Telegram.</i>

1132
01:28:01,896 --> 01:28:04,330
Well done.

1133
01:28:04,432 --> 01:28:08,334
Well, it doesn't mean
to say I've got it. They probably
just want to see me again.

1134
01:28:11,305 --> 01:28:14,365
Well, that settles it, then.
We'll leave immediately.

1135
01:28:14,475 --> 01:28:17,239
What?

1136
01:28:17,345 --> 01:28:20,508
- Get your kit together.
We're leaving in half an hour.
- Half an hour?

1137
01:28:20,615 --> 01:28:23,516
Don't be ridiculous.
I need at least an hour for lunch.

1138
01:28:32,293 --> 01:28:36,252
You've got a truck coming up.
About 200 yards.

1139
01:28:36,364 --> 01:28:39,959
Followed by a left slow hander.

1140
01:28:40,068 --> 01:28:42,901
This is insanity!
I can't keep this up!

1141
01:28:43,004 --> 01:28:46,565
Stay in this lane.
Bear right. Bear right.

1142
01:28:46,674 --> 01:28:49,234
What lane? What lane?
I can't see the fucking lane.

1143
01:28:49,343 --> 01:28:51,777
Bear right! Bear right!
Bear right!

1144
01:28:54,749 --> 01:28:59,152
That's it. Next garage, I've gotta
do something about that wiper.

1145
01:28:59,253 --> 01:29:02,984
And I've got to get some sleep.

1146
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:33,151
- What's going on?
- I'm making time.

1147
01:29:47,201 --> 01:29:50,637
<i>Are you out of your mind? Pull over.
You haven't got a license.</i>

1148
01:29:50,738 --> 01:29:52,706
No. I'm making time.

1149
01:30:03,217 --> 01:30:05,617
- Where are we?
- We're approaching London.

1150
01:30:08,789 --> 01:30:13,055
- Here comes another fucker.

1151
01:30:21,169 --> 01:30:23,797
- Oh, no!

1152
01:30:23,905 --> 01:30:26,772
Perfectly all right.
Leave him to me.

1153
01:30:26,874 --> 01:30:29,672
You're full of scotch,
you silly tool.

1154
01:31:40,281 --> 01:31:43,739
A bit early in the morning
for festivities, isn't it?

1155
01:31:43,851 --> 01:31:46,149
These aren't mine.
They belong to him.

1156
01:31:46,254 --> 01:31:50,054
- You're drunk.
- I assure you I'm not, officer.

1157
01:31:50,157 --> 01:31:53,422
Honestly,
I've only had a few ales.

1158
01:31:53,527 --> 01:31:57,520
Out of the car... please.

1159
01:31:57,632 --> 01:31:59,532
Sir.

1160
01:32:06,574 --> 01:32:09,509
I want you to take one
deep breath and fill this bag.

1161
01:32:11,112 --> 01:32:14,809
- Are you refusing to fill this bag?
- I most certainly am.

1162
01:32:14,915 --> 01:32:18,146
- I'm placing you under arrest.
- Don't be ridiculous.
I haven't done anything.

1163
01:32:18,252 --> 01:32:20,447
- Come on.
- Look here, my cousin's a QC.

1164
01:32:20,554 --> 01:32:22,454
Get in the back of the van!

1165
01:32:35,569 --> 01:32:37,969
Hey, sarge,
what's that clown doing?

1166
01:33:13,774 --> 01:33:17,175
- Where's our checks?
- Didn't sign on.

1167
01:33:17,278 --> 01:33:20,509
That wouldn't make any difference
in last week's payments.

1168
01:33:48,776 --> 01:33:51,540
What are you doing in my bed?

1169
01:33:51,645 --> 01:33:56,139
- I've been asleep.
- Who is the huge spade in the bath?

1170
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:58,650
Presuming Ed.

1171
01:33:58,753 --> 01:34:01,620
You've got ten minutes, right?
I want you out 'cause I want to get in.

1172
01:34:01,722 --> 01:34:04,350
Ten minutes, right?
You better be on your feet.

1173
01:34:07,728 --> 01:34:10,925
- How did you get in?
- Ingenuity, man.

1174
01:34:11,031 --> 01:34:13,295
Come up the drain pipe.

1175
01:34:13,401 --> 01:34:16,461
- Would you like a smoke?
- Yes.

1176
01:34:16,570 --> 01:34:19,004
No, thanks.
I've got a call to make.

1177
01:34:23,511 --> 01:34:25,445
What are you gonna do
with those?

1178
01:34:25,546 --> 01:34:29,880
The joint I'm about to roll
requires a craftsman.

1179
01:34:29,984 --> 01:34:32,475
It can utilize up to 12 skins.

1180
01:34:32,586 --> 01:34:35,555
It is called
a Camberwell Carrot.

1181
01:34:35,656 --> 01:34:38,056
It's impossible to use
12 papers in one joint.

1182
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:41,856
It's impossible to make
a Camberwell Carrot with anything less.

1183
01:34:41,962 --> 01:34:44,726
- Who says it's a Camberwell Carrot?
- I do.

1184
01:34:44,832 --> 01:34:48,632
I invented it in Camberwell,
and it looks like a carrot.

1185
01:34:48,736 --> 01:34:51,830
Do you realize this gaff's
overwhelmed with rodents?

1186
01:34:51,939 --> 01:34:54,499
When I come in, I seen one
the size of a fucking dog.

1187
01:34:54,608 --> 01:34:57,736
<i>That is a dog. Belongs
to the fellow downstairs.</i>

1188
01:34:57,845 --> 01:35:00,006
Does his dog get in the oven?

1189
01:35:00,114 --> 01:35:03,345
- No, his dog doesn't come up here.
- Then it was a rodent.

1190
01:35:03,451 --> 01:35:06,648
Opened the oven door, and
it was in there looking at me.

1191
01:35:06,754 --> 01:35:11,020
Quite freaked me at the time.
I was gonna cook onions.

1192
01:35:11,125 --> 01:35:13,320
- Are you going to bed now?
- No.

1193
01:35:13,427 --> 01:35:15,327
Phone.

1194
01:35:17,498 --> 01:35:20,490
- Who's he going to telephone?
- Squat Betty.

1195
01:35:21,969 --> 01:35:25,336
His agent. He's wasting his time
because he won't be in.

1196
01:35:49,363 --> 01:35:52,560
This'll tend
to make you very high.

1197
01:35:55,803 --> 01:36:00,331
This grass is the most powerful
in the Western Hemisphere.

1198
01:36:00,441 --> 01:36:04,571
I have it specially flown in
from my man in Mexico.

1199
01:36:06,046 --> 01:36:08,344
He's an expert.

1200
01:36:08,449 --> 01:36:10,917
His name is Juan.

1201
01:36:11,018 --> 01:36:16,115
This grass grows at exactly
2,000 feet above sea level.

1202
01:36:18,359 --> 01:36:20,691
You got the part, man?

1203
01:36:25,232 --> 01:36:29,601
I got a different one.
They want me to play the lead.

1204
01:36:29,703 --> 01:36:33,537
- Congratulations.
- Where exactly have you two been?

1205
01:36:33,641 --> 01:36:37,805
- Holiday in the countryside.
- That's a very good idea.

1206
01:36:37,912 --> 01:36:40,904
London is a country
coming down from its trip.

1207
01:36:41,015 --> 01:36:45,213
<i>We are 91 days
from the end of this decade,</i>

1208
01:36:45,319 --> 01:36:48,447
and there's gonna be
a lot of refugees.

1209
01:36:51,358 --> 01:36:55,658
They'll be goin' round this town
shoutin', "Bring out your dead."

1210
01:36:57,932 --> 01:37:01,026
There was a geezer around here
the other day lookin' for you.

1211
01:37:01,135 --> 01:37:03,399
<i>- What geezer?
- Some bald geezer.</i>

1212
01:37:03,504 --> 01:37:07,838
Reckons you owe him 266 quid
back rent.

1213
01:37:07,942 --> 01:37:12,936
I told him there's no question of payin'
rent on a property cut with rodents.

1214
01:37:13,047 --> 01:37:15,174
He takes exception to this.

1215
01:37:15,282 --> 01:37:17,773
Starts comin' on really bald
with me.

1216
01:37:17,885 --> 01:37:21,252
- You mean ratty.
- I told him to piss off.

1217
01:37:21,355 --> 01:37:23,585
You bloody fool.
We'll end up in court again.

1218
01:37:23,691 --> 01:37:27,127
<i>- No we won't. It ain't legal.
- I assume we can quote you.</i>

1219
01:37:27,227 --> 01:37:30,890
The law rather
appeals to me, actually.

1220
01:37:36,103 --> 01:37:39,095
<i>Just high.</i>

1221
01:37:40,908 --> 01:37:42,808
Stop laughing, Withnail.
This is serious.

1222
01:37:42,910 --> 01:37:46,744
No, it ain't. I looked into it,
studied the papers.

1223
01:37:46,847 --> 01:37:49,907
- What papers?
- Legal papers.

1224
01:37:50,017 --> 01:37:52,645
<i>What papers, Danny?</i>

1225
01:38:02,696 --> 01:38:05,927
He's got our checks.
What are you doing with these?

1226
01:38:06,033 --> 01:38:09,662
<i>I was gonna cash 'em in for you.</i>

1227
01:38:17,778 --> 01:38:21,771
For Christ's sake, Withnail, stop
laughing. This is a notice of eviction.

1228
01:38:28,889 --> 01:38:31,187
Will you stop laughing?
They wanna throw us out.

1229
01:38:33,494 --> 01:38:36,895
For God... Will you shut up, for
God's sake? You're giving me the fear.

1230
01:38:36,997 --> 01:38:39,056
<i>Give me a downer, Danny.
My brain's capsizing.</i>

1231
01:38:39,166 --> 01:38:41,293
- I've gone and fucked my brain!
- Change, man.

1232
01:38:41,402 --> 01:38:44,803
<i>Find your neutral space.
You've got a rush.</i>

1233
01:38:44,905 --> 01:38:48,068
It will pass. Be seated.

1234
01:38:54,948 --> 01:38:56,848
Aren't you getting absurdly high?

1235
01:38:56,950 --> 01:39:00,317
Precisely the reason
I'm smokin' it.

1236
01:39:05,592 --> 01:39:07,617
I couldn't. I'm spaced.

1237
01:39:07,728 --> 01:39:09,753
Not as spaced as your rodents.

1238
01:39:09,863 --> 01:39:13,993
- Don't talk about them.
- I imagine they're talkin'
to each other.

1239
01:39:16,403 --> 01:39:18,837
<i>- What do you mean?
- I've dealt with 'em.</i>

1240
01:39:18,939 --> 01:39:20,839
Dealt with 'em.
What the fuck do you mean?

1241
01:39:20,941 --> 01:39:24,604
Dosed 'em. I expect
they're dead down the drain.

1242
01:39:24,712 --> 01:39:27,681
Dead down the drain?
What have you done to them?

1243
01:39:27,781 --> 01:39:31,239
Given them all drugged onions.

1244
01:39:31,351 --> 01:39:34,184
Jesus Christ!
Why have you drugged their onions?

1245
01:39:34,288 --> 01:39:37,451
Sit down, man.
Take control.

1246
01:39:37,558 --> 01:39:40,288
Give me a Valium.
I'm getting the fear!

1247
01:39:40,394 --> 01:39:42,692
<i>You have done something
to your brain.</i>

1248
01:39:42,796 --> 01:39:44,696
You have made it high.

1249
01:39:44,798 --> 01:39:49,735
If I lay ten mils
of Diazepam on you, you will do
something else to your brain.

1250
01:39:49,837 --> 01:39:54,035
You will make it low. Why trust
one drug and not the other?

1251
01:39:54,141 --> 01:39:56,041
That's politics, isn't it?

1252
01:39:56,143 --> 01:39:58,043
I'm gonna eat some sugar.

1253
01:39:59,646 --> 01:40:02,376
I recommend
you smoke some more grass.

1254
01:40:02,483 --> 01:40:05,111
No way. No fucking way.

1255
01:40:05,219 --> 01:40:08,518
That is an unfortunate
political decision,

1256
01:40:08,622 --> 01:40:11,022
reflectin' these times.

1257
01:40:18,198 --> 01:40:20,758
<i>- What are you talking about, Danny?
- Politics, man.</i>

1258
01:40:20,868 --> 01:40:23,393
If you were hanging on
to a rising balloon,

1259
01:40:23,504 --> 01:40:26,166
you're presented
with a difficult decision...

1260
01:40:26,273 --> 01:40:28,639
let go before it's too late?

1261
01:40:28,742 --> 01:40:30,733
Or hang on
and keep getting higher?

1262
01:40:30,844 --> 01:40:35,474
Posing the question, how long
can you keep a grip on the rope?

1263
01:40:37,417 --> 01:40:40,113
They're sellin' hippie wigs
in Woolworth's, man.

1264
01:40:41,655 --> 01:40:45,819
<i>The greatest decade in
the history of mankind is over.</i>

1265
01:40:47,694 --> 01:40:51,721
And as Presuming Ed here
has so consistently pointed out...

1266
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:56,030
we have failed
to paint it black.

1267
01:41:46,086 --> 01:41:49,146
My Dad'll pick up the boxes
in a week.

1268
01:41:49,256 --> 01:41:51,520
And he's gonna do something
about the car.

1269
01:41:53,627 --> 01:41:55,618
- I'm off now.
- Already?

1270
01:41:55,729 --> 01:41:58,254
But I've got us a bottle open.

1271
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,366
I confiscated it
from Monty's supplies.

1272
01:42:03,537 --> 01:42:06,665
'53 Margaux.
Best of the century.

1273
01:42:07,941 --> 01:42:10,239
I'm sure he wouldn't resent us
a parting drink.

1274
01:42:10,344 --> 01:42:13,507
I can't, Withnail. I've gotta walk
to the station. I'll be late.

1275
01:42:13,614 --> 01:42:16,742
- There's always time for a drink.
- No.

1276
01:42:16,850 --> 01:42:19,182
I don't have the time.

1277
01:42:19,286 --> 01:42:22,949
All right. I'll walk with you
through the park.

1278
01:42:24,958 --> 01:42:27,358
We can drink it on the way.

1279
01:42:35,469 --> 01:42:37,994
No. No more, thank you.

1280
01:42:38,105 --> 01:42:40,596
Listen, Withnail. It's a stinker.
Why don't you go back?

1281
01:42:40,707 --> 01:42:43,642
- Because I wanna walk you
to the station.
- Well, don't.

1282
01:42:43,744 --> 01:42:46,212
Please don't.

1283
01:42:46,313 --> 01:42:48,372
I really don't want you to.

1284
01:42:57,424 --> 01:43:00,882
I shall miss you, Withnail.

1285
01:43:00,994 --> 01:43:05,624
<i>I shall miss you too. Chin-chin.</i>

1286
