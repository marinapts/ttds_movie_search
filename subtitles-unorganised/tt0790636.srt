To put your affairs in order.

139
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:30,173
Thirty days?

163
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:19,329
Shit, I heard you get that..

164
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:21,463
..just by touchin someone.  Or..

165
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:24,325
..that queers get it.
- Fucking faggots.

166
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:28,047
That's it.
Which is exactly why its a mistake.

167
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:31,056
Well,

168
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:32,683
what if, What ain't?

169
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:34,377
Of what it ain't?

170
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:36,402
A mistake.

171
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:45,332
Fucker!

172
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,650
Shit, I know you got a
pussy addiction, motherfucker.

173
00:14:52,387 --> 00:14:53,056
Hey, Soff.

174
00:14:53,635 --> 00:14:56,830
Hello, Debb.

175
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:03,367
We going?

176
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:05,013
Yeah, we goin'.

177
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,438
Hey?

178
00:15:08,229 --> 00:15:09,255
You wanna take these ladies
for a twirl?

179
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:12,797
Y'all go ahead. I'm good.
I'll catch up with y'all..alright?

180
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:16,017
Yeah?
Alright brother, you cool?

181
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:17,217
Cool.
- Alright.

182
00:15:17,802 --> 00:15:18,741
See you there.

183
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:22,680
Alright. See ya in little bit.
Miss Alaska..Ms Louisiana.

184
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Bye. care boy.

185
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,884
<font color=#E3D737>RICK FERRIS:</font> Azidothymidine, or AZT --
was originally developed as a treatment for cancer.

186
00:15:53,832 --> 00:15:55,229
With the onset of HIV, however,

187
00:15:56,045 --> 00:16:00,587
we at Avinex Industires began a trial
in which we administered AZT to infected lab animals.

188
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:04,718
Initial findings suggested increased CD4 counts,

189
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:09,085
restored T-cell immunity..
- Isn't it also true that it had some...

190
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:12,642
Troubleing side effects in animal tests,

191
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:17,702
a significant decrease in the red and white
blood cells in the animals?

192
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:21,372
Yes, but its effect on the virus is better than
anything else that's been tested.

193
00:16:21,865 --> 00:16:25,101
In 64, when AZT was developed for
cancer treatment, it was shelved;

194
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:29,243
due to lack of anti cancer efficacy and toxicity.

195
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:32,808
We believe those problems were dosage based.

196
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:35,322
So, you're conducting another animal study?

197
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:38,386
Actually, the FDA has given us permission
to go straight to human trials..

198
00:16:39,352 --> 00:16:41,581
...which is what brings me here today.

199
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,616
We're conducting a double-blind,
placebo-controlled randomized trial..

200
00:16:45,816 --> 00:16:46,816
..throughout the United States.

201
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,308
Dallas Mercy is one of the proposed sites.

202
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,406
How long do you see the study going on?

203
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,960
We're hoping to fast track it..

204
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,870
... within a year?

205
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,830
During which time the hospital and its administering
physicians will be very well compensated for their efforts.

206
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,700
Sadly, the AIDS crisis will only
get worse before it gets better.

207
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,864
And, I know I speak for everyone
at Aven Exem when I say,

208
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,340
This is a unique opportunity.

209
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,947
A chance to be on the forefront in finding a cure.

210
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:21,941
Does it not drive you just a little bit crazy
to see these guys talking about;

211
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,414
curing the sick
while they're flashing gold Rolexes?

212
00:17:24,614 --> 00:17:28,381
What do they know about sick patients?
- They're a big pharma reps, not doctors.

213
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:31,390
And like it or not,
this is a business.

214
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,114
How the hell did they get permission
to go straight to human trials?

215
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:36,539
People are desperate.
You know, People are dying.

216
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,160
There is nothing else out there.

217
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,440
Fuck!

218
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:44,524
<font color=#B71F04>Day 7.</font>

219
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:51,344
I need to see Dr. Sevard.

220
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:52,580
Dr. Sevards not here today.

221
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,780
I can't wait till tomorrow.

222
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,300
If you'll tell me what the problem is
maybe, I can help you.

223
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
You wanna know the list of my problems?

224
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,890
My lungs bleeding, my skin crawling,

225
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,870
there's a fucking jackhammer in my head
and thats the least of my fucking problems lady.

226
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,602
Mr. Woodroof?
- No, no..no...no.

227
00:19:10,802 --> 00:19:13,166
I dont want no nurse.
I want a doctor.

228
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,550
I want a goddamn doctor!
NOW!

229
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,720
Well..How can I help you?
- Are you fuckin' deaf, lady?

230
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,780
No. I'm a fucking doctor!

231
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,970
If you want to discuss your list of problems,
you can meet me in my office in twenty minutes.

232
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:33,410
Okay?

233
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:42,604
I like your style, Doc.

234
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,790
Mr.Woodroof.

235
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,850
Can you get me AZT?

236
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,950
I know the Avinex industries,

237
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,480
just released it for testing, right?

238
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,290
I wanna buy some,

239
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,305
now.

240
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,670
That isnt how it works.

241
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,190
For about a year, a group of patients will
either get the drug or a placebo,

242
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,654
Its totally left up to chance,
not even the doctors are allowed to know.

243
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,380
Who you give..

244
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,060
.. dyin people sugar pills?

245
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,717
Its the only way to know if a drug works.

246
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,520
Can you get some for me?

247
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,820
I got cash.

248
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:41,990
I can go a month..

249
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,969
..a week. However you wanna do.
- I hear you.

250
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,560
Unfortunately, no.

251
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,220
But, when it's proven to work and..

252
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,638
...if you fit the profile,
then yes.

253
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,890
So, youre tellin me Im as good as a horse,

254
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,850
being held for dog food..huh?

255
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,729
Okay.

256
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,680
How about this stuffs, overseas..huh?

257
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,720
In Germany, they got this..

258
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,400
Dextran Sulfate.

259
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,065
Alright, they got this DDC in France,
It's suppose to keep the healthy cells you got.

260
00:21:20,265 --> 00:21:22,014
From getting, the HIV.

261
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:26,330
They got AL 721 over in Israel...
How can i get some of this?

262
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,970
None of those drugs have
been approved by the FDA.

263
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,120
Screw the FDA,

264
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,260
Im gonna be DOA.

265
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,230
What..I gotta..

266
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,408
... sue this hospital to get my medicine?
- Mr. Woodroof, I assure you,

267
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:40,734
that would be a waste of precious time.

268
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:49,105
There is a support group that meets daily,
at Draddy Auditorium.

269
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,300
I suggest, you try it out.

270
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,545
Maybe, talk about your feelings
and your concerns...

271
00:21:54,745 --> 00:21:55,745
Im dying.

272
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,430
What're you tellin me
to go get a hug from a bunch of faggots?

273
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,130
Good day.

274
00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:24,882
Hey! Neddie Jay,

275
00:22:25,082 --> 00:22:27,281
get me a shot of Cactus and a buck back.

276
00:22:29,344 --> 00:22:30,360
Goddamn.

277
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,319
It's hard to say,
how much I missed your all ugly mugs.

278
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:36,379
What do you say Clinto, where you hangin

279
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:37,579
..your pants lately today?

280
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,890
Get me another beer,
will you, sweetheart?

281
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,530
What the fuck, did you say?

282
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,560
I said grab me a cold one,

283
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,140
Sugarcake.

284
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,840
You askin me to kick yer ass?

285
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,545
Nah, wouldn't wanna get none of that
faggot blood on me.

286
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,139
Hey, come on.
- Fucker!

287
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,230
No..no, I'm alright.
That motherfucker is the fucking problem.

288
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,551
What the fuck is your problem, man?

289
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:15,751
Hey Ron, I dont want no trouble, alright?

290
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,340
Fuck you all!

291
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,760
Fuck, all of y'all!

292
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,669
Fuckin' goddamn it.
He spit on my face.

293
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,169
Can I get a fuckin' soap?
- Get me a towel...please. c'mon.

294
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,420
Fucking Christ!

295
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,500
As I stand here tonight,
clinical trials are underway..

296
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,602
with an eye toward fast-tracking AZT

297
00:24:04,802 --> 00:24:07,096
and making it available
for the public as soon as possible.

298
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:10,260
In short, I'm happy to say that help
may finally be on the way.

299
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,198
How long before the drug is approved?

300
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,693
The FDA standard procedure to approve
a new drug is eight to twelve years.

301
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:23,771
Hey, It's your first time right?
- Back the fuck off Tinkerbell.

302
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,480
I'll knock your teeths off.
You goddamn ___

303
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,435
But, we need it now!

304
00:24:32,635 --> 00:24:35,524
It may help, Hell..we'll take the chance!

305
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,910
What about dextran sulfate?!

306
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,950
We're working closely with the FDA
to make sure every effort is made to fast track..

307
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,500
It's both our job and the FDA's
to make sure the drug is safe -

308
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,900
Forget it, we can get it in Mexico.

309
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,900
I just need to slow it down a little.

310
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,290
Get me down and catch my breath, will you?

311
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,300
I ain't ready to crawl into a corner. Alright?

312
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,390
I just ain't fucking ready.

313
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,650
Man, if you're up there you better
be listening, a'right.

314
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,710
And if I got one chance, I don't mind.

315
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,390
Fucking chance, show we a sign.

316
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,900
Show me the sign.

317
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:06,295
If you're not gonna look or buy a dance,
you could at least tip me.

318
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,571
Here's twenty.

319
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,050
I'll take a dance, it ain't fer me.

320
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:19,708
You just keep it on shaking,
I'll see you.

321
00:26:52,638 --> 00:26:54,925
<font color=#B71F04>Day 8.</font>

322
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,512
<font color=#B71F04>Day 9.</font>
<i>A beautiful day, in Dallas..Texas.</i>

323
00:28:04,508 --> 00:28:07,076
Right here, Motherfuckers!

324
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,670
There ain't no more,
they started  lockin' it up.

325
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,410
I got more cash.

326
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,400
Here.

327
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,571
What the fuck is this?
-   In Mexico. A doctor, he has some.

328
00:29:26,771 --> 00:29:27,771
What the hell is this bullshit?
You don't think I know..

329
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:31,055
what you're fuckin' doing man.. huh?

330
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,660
Ron?

331
00:29:52,556 --> 00:29:54,188
Hi.

332
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,654
Beautiful.

333
00:29:57,854 --> 00:29:58,854
Youre in the hospital.

334
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,330
You almost died.

335
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,322
I bet that didnt surprise anyone. Right?

336
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,860
Was that a smile?

337
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,570
You've had a blood transfusion.

338
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,470
Mr. Woodroof..

339
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,060
I'm doctor Sevard.

340
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,170
Yeah.

341
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,630
I remember you.

342
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,810
I need you to tell me where you obtained AZT from.

343
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,070
I worked out in your blood.

344
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,078
Oh, I don't know.
A shopping mall.

345
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,301
Dealing in pharmaceutical drugs is illegal.

346
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,660
Yeah.

347
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:49,760
Get some rest.

348
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:53,760
Where are you goin'?
We were just gettin somewhere.

349
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,016
Honey, you don't have the slightest chance.

350
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,330
Im Rayon.

351
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,680
Congratulations,

352
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,640
fuck off and go back to your bed.
- Relax,

353
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,220
I don't bite.

354
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:21,230
I guess youre handsome in a Texas hick,
white trash, dumb, kinda way.

355
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,190
Get the fuck outta here,

356
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:29,282
whatever you are.
Before I kick you in the fuckin' face.

357
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,830
You wanna play cards?

358
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,050
You got cash?

359
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,230
How does that strike your fancy?

360
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:01,058
Do you mind, If i snuggle?

361
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,750
Stay at the end of the bed.

362
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,100
Ten dollar minimum?

363
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,567
Be my guest.

364
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,350
Alright, Miss Man.
What you got?

365
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,040
Full house.

366
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,060
Jacks over threes.

367
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,150
I'da figured you for queens.

368
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,350
Motherfucker!

369
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,850
Sorry darlin'.

370
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,720
Goddamned!

371
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,320
Aww!!

372
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,517
You alright?

373
00:32:38,717 --> 00:32:40,955
Wait relax. Where's it?
- Get off me.

374
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,947
I got you. I got you, don't worry.
Just relax..relax.

375
00:32:45,147 --> 00:32:46,147
Breath.

376
00:32:46,347 --> 00:32:48,817
Breath.
- Right there.

377
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:50,017
Get it..get it.

378
00:32:50,217 --> 00:32:53,221
I got it. I got it.

379
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:54,952
That's it.

380
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,840
Okay, let me get you some water.

381
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,810
Drink this, darling.

382
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,390
You gotta stay hydrated
or your muscles will cramp.

383
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,110
Ohhh!
- That better?

384
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,860
That's better.

385
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,060
That's good.

386
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,920
You got nice feet.

387
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,670
Jesus Christ, Im straight,

388
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,200
Alright!

389
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,160
Why the fuck you in here anyway?

390
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,790
The AZT trial.

391
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,480
My friend is paying me to split my dose with him.
That way well both get some.

392
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,420
How much is he paying you?

393
00:33:57,105 --> 00:33:58,562
Five grand.

394
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,720
I coulda charged him twenty.

395
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:08,082
Hey?

396
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,800
If I want any.

397
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,850
Will you sell me some?

398
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,750
I'm Sorry, sweetie.

399
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,660
I can't split my dose and hers.

400
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,919
Besides, I made a deal.

401
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,820
Anyone who plays cards like you
ain't got five grand anyhow.

402
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,530
Right here.

403
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,070
My lord, sometimes we can't get
a moment's rest around here.

404
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,040
Mr. Woodroof!

405
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,340
Where are you going?

406
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,825
I signed myself out.
- Youre too sick to leave here.

407
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,820
The worst-case scenario bein' what?

408
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,010
We can keep you comfortable.

409
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:05,463
What? Hook me up to the morphine drip.
Let me fade on out?

410
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,580
Nah, orry lady,
but I prefer to die with my  boots on.

411
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,390
I still live here, you hear me?!

412
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,320
I fuckin live here!!

413
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,650
Fuck you!

414
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,200
<font color=#B71F04>Day 29.</font>

415
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,067
<font color=#B71F04>Day 30.</font>

416
00:38:33,405 --> 00:38:35,586
Im lookin for Dr. Vass.
- Speak up.

417
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,290
Im lookin for Vass, for some AZT.

418
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,200
Yeah?
You won't find that shit here.

419
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,902
Looking to poison yourself?

420
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,070
Jesus fuckin' Christ!
Maria?

421
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,250
Check him in.

422
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:09,340
Cocaine, alcohol, methamphetamine,

423
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,416
AZT?

424
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:15,975
That's what I call a recipe for disaster.

425
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,290
This place is a shit-hole, Doc.

426
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,440
Who said I was a Doctor?

427
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,865
They revoked my license to practice
three years ago,

428
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:25,670
thats why Im down in this shit-hole.

429
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:28,905
Why? What'd you do?

430
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,660
Ahh..

431
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,330
Now, What these drugs youre doing,
they're breaking down your immune system,

432
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,420
making you susceptible to infections.

433
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,740
So, you're saying cocaine gave me pneumonia?

434
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,750
No, I'm saying, Cocaine made you
more susceptible.

435
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,630
As did AZT.

436
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,910
I thought AZT's supposed to help me.

437
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,668
The only people AZT helps are
the people who sell it.

438
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,880
It kills every cell it comes in contact with.

439
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,750
Now, I'm prescribing,
a regimen of vitamins..

440
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,900
..as well as the mineral zinc
to build your immune system.

441
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:01,490
You'll also be taking Aloe
and essential fatty acids.

442
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,770
Sounds fun?

443
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,711
You missed your last
trial appointment, Ray.

444
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,020
Where were you?

445
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,430
o you like this blouse?

446
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,870
Cause I think the neckline's
a little plungeing.

447
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,160
Rayon,

448
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,170
the whole point of this study is to determine
if AZT is helping people.

449
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,150
Come on, Evie, you know
there ain't no helpin' me.

450
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,630
That doesn't mean I'm going to stop trying.

451
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,053
Why are you so good to me?

452
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,800
Bless your little heart.

453
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,005
Just promise me,
you'll show up for the rest of the trial.

454
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:55,140
I promise you,
that I will try my very best.

455
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,210
I want you, to mean it.

456
00:41:00,442 --> 00:41:01,485
Okay.

457
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,410
Is that Marcus from home-ec?

458
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,790
I swear to God.

459
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,750
He's grown up, my Lord!

460
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,200
A little too plungey, by the way.

461
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
I think, yes.

462
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,860
I appreciate ya honesty.

463
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:25,123
Damn it.

464
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:35,810
<font color=#B71F04><i>three months later</i></font>
Well?

465
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,550
Better.

466
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,240
Your T-Cell count's improving.

467
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,890
I still got HIV?

468
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,280
You'll always test positive for HIV,

469
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,209
and now, you have AIDS,

470
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:52,977
could be all the toxic shit
you've been pumping into your body,

471
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,177
You shot your immune system.

472
00:41:54,377 --> 00:41:57,089
Now you have chronic pneumonia,
among other things.

473
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,217
It can cause memory loss,
mood swings,

474
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:02,031
aching joints...
-If it sucks, I got it.

475
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:06,250
I can't get my cock up...
all that shit..

476
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,292
Whatever is shit i go it.
Don't I?

477
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:08,730
Yeah, well..

478
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,520
Let's not start a pity party
too soon.

479
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,829
This is DDC,

480
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:19,291
it acts as an anti viral
similar to AZT but less toxic.

481
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:20,460
And this is..

482
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:24,210
Peptide T, it's a protein -- totally non-toxic.

483
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,986
Early studies have shown it
these can help with all of that.

484
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,130
This is what I had you, since you got here.

485
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,040
And you can't buy them back in the U.S.A?

486
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,722
No, not approved.

487
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,101
Look at this place.

488
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:46,910
Chinks, homos and herbs,

489
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:48,900
hot nurses..

490
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,831
you got a regular new world order
going on here, Vass.

491
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:55,563
You could be makin a fortune off of this.

492
00:43:09,956 --> 00:43:10,760
If you get caught,

493
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,580
don't say you got AIDS.

494
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:16,490
Or, they'll never let you back in.

495
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,293
A blessed day to you, Sir.

496
00:43:31,493 --> 00:43:33,743
Have ablessed day.

497
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,694
Anything to declare?
- No, nothing.

498
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:07,894
Have a good day.
- Thank you.

499
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:15,679
And, a blessed day to you, Sir.
- Father, passport, please?

500
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:24,752
Anything to declare.
- No sir. Nada.

501
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,552
You're a priest?

502
00:44:44,752 --> 00:44:45,752
Yes, I am.

503
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,560
Im Richard Barkley, from the Food and Drug
Administration office.

504
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,710
How can I help you, Mr.Barkley?

505
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:55,940
Well...

506
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,660
You have over 2,000 pills here.

507
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:04,494
You are only allowed to bring in
a ninety day supply.

508
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,960
As I was telling the gentlemen earlier,

509
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,590
I am a sick man.
I have cancer.

510
00:45:12,965 --> 00:45:17,040
I take 22 pills a day.

511
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,951
and these are my vials of Vitamins.

512
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,470
This is non-toxic protein serum.

513
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,911
This is my ninety day supply.

514
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,560
Vitamins?

515
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,870
You do realize that importing
unapproved drugs for sale..

516
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,096
... is a very serious offense?
- Of course, it is.

517
00:45:45,296 --> 00:45:46,296
As I said, they're not for sale.

518
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,430
Nor are they illegal,

519
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,030
Merely "unapproved."

520
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,090
If we get the slightest indication,
that youre selling these drugs for profit,

521
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,580
you could be thrown in jail
for a very long time...

522
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,656
Father.

523
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,060
Hand to God. I promise
to take every  one of them pills myself.

524
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:13,770
My life depends on it.

525
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,788
Son.

526
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,518
Cowboy, are you coming in?

527
00:47:19,107 --> 00:47:20,906
Are you fucking kidding me?!

528
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,370
This man also had a transfusion?

529
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,020
The AZT.

530
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,576
We can tell whos on it by the symptoms.

531
00:47:28,776 --> 00:47:30,556
Most of them need new blood.

532
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,190
He's actually getting worse.

533
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,290
So, why are they stopping the trial?

534
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,801
What do you mean?
- Avinex Industries.

535
00:47:38,001 --> 00:47:39,001
You didn't see the memo?

536
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,141
They claim most people are feeling better
and fewer people are dying.

537
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,740
Transfusions always makes
patients feel better.

538
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,680
Give the placebo patients new blood
and theyll feel better too.

539
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,180
I have questions about the
drug's safety, David.

540
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:54,002
I've seen it drop white blood cells
in a lot of my patients.

541
00:47:54,202 --> 00:47:55,225
It's their call, Eve.

542
00:47:55,425 --> 00:47:56,425
So, we can get the drug to the people
who actually need it.

543
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:58,108
After eight months?

544
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,330
Well, test results are overwhelmingly positive.
AZT is works.

545
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,698
We don't know, what the long term
effects are. It's irresponsible.

546
00:48:05,898 --> 00:48:06,950
These people die, Eve.

547
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,020
There are no long-term effects.

548
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,410
Can I read a copy of the study?

549
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,086
It's still being written.

550
00:48:21,018 --> 00:48:23,010
Hey, hey..hey...hey!

551
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,296
Jesus Fuckin' Christ!
You fucking idiot!

552
00:48:26,496 --> 00:48:29,579
I've been looking for you, Lonestar.
- You know, I could've killed you!

553
00:48:29,779 --> 00:48:32,374
I feel better!
I wanted to thank you.

554
00:48:32,574 --> 00:48:34,485
Well, Good for you.
Now get the fuck out!

555
00:48:34,685 --> 00:48:36,848
I need more of that cocktail shit you got!

556
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:40,186
Listen Tinkerbell, unless you got
more cash or new clients..

557
00:48:40,386 --> 00:48:43,765
I'm busy. Now, get the fuck out of my car.
- Let's just do this quickly so I can

558
00:48:43,965 --> 00:48:45,520
get the fuck out!

559
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:47,660
You got enough for 20 of us?

560
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:52,995
Yep.

561
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,770
You know what?

562
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,160
You don't deserve our money,

563
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,083
you homophobic asshole!

564
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:05,580
Toodle-oo.

565
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,000
Am I fuckin' dreamin'?

566
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:30,695
I got your 20 in trunk.

567
00:49:35,835 --> 00:49:37,775
Find me 20 more
and I'll cut you in.

568
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,199
Five percent.

569
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,699
Adios, cowboy.

570
00:49:45,735 --> 00:49:47,282
What the fuck is your problem?

571
00:49:47,482 --> 00:49:51,323
I can handle your insults,
but... five percent?

572
00:49:56,575 --> 00:49:57,839
Alright, Ten.

573
00:49:58,039 --> 00:49:59,039
Twenty five,

574
00:49:59,115 --> 00:50:02,655
take it or leave it.

575
00:50:09,115 --> 00:50:10,453
I don't have all day.

576
00:50:24,445 --> 00:50:25,463
Deal?

577
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,725
Deal.

578
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,520
Here y'all.

579
00:50:35,385 --> 00:50:36,767
Two T's for one of that.

580
00:50:38,483 --> 00:50:40,243
How much?
- 25.

581
00:50:40,903 --> 00:50:42,340
Rayon, where the fuck are you goin'?

582
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,199
Com on in,
It's a fucking bore out here!

583
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,170
Goddamn it.

584
00:51:08,055 --> 00:51:11,806
A tree with most honey, attracts
the most bees.

585
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,874
Lot's of customers here, darlin'.

586
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:18,997
A little smile,
will go a long way.

587
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,695
Thank you.

588
00:51:42,535 --> 00:51:43,862
Fuck off.

589
00:51:44,062 --> 00:51:46,430
Ronnie, where're you going?

590
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,240
You gotta be kidding me?!

591
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,603
This place is perfect.

592
00:52:10,803 --> 00:52:13,105
We gotta lay low.
Not get busted.

593
00:52:13,305 --> 00:52:15,699
Besides, I got a plan.

594
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:19,026
Well, it's a very attractive place.

595
00:52:19,226 --> 00:52:20,226
Right up you alley.

596
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:30,817
This place is disgusting.
We have got to disinfect.

597
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,600
Do not use the word we.

598
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:36,443
Now you wanna put your apron on
Then, start cleaning shit up.

599
00:52:36,643 --> 00:52:38,283
I wouldn't know,
where to start.

600
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,750
Howdy Counselor,

601
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,973
Hi, I'm Rayon.

602
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,670
He's my partner.

603
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:47,580
Business partner.

604
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,560
Your office's next door.

605
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,460
Have fun, boys.

606
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,300
El produco de Mexico.
Now, this is all for your...

607
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:09,430
..personal use?
-Oh, yes. Absolutely.

608
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:12,933
I got you the paper work for
your Corporation.

609
00:53:13,133 --> 00:53:14,133
I don not wanna know what that is for.

610
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,770
Well, I ain't selling drugs no more, Counselor.

611
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,660
I'm giving 'em away.
For free.

612
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:23,760
By selling memberships.

613
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,161
Four hundred dollars a month in dues..

614
00:53:26,361 --> 00:53:27,361
and you get,
all the meds you want.

615
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,263
You son of a bitch!

616
00:53:30,463 --> 00:53:32,204
Bitches. Plural.

617
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,144
There's a bunch of faggots up in New York.
Runnin' a hell of a racket.

618
00:53:35,344 --> 00:53:36,344
Just like this.

619
00:53:36,544 --> 00:53:37,544
That's where I got the idea.

620
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,964
Welcome to the Dallas Buyers Club.

621
00:53:40,164 --> 00:53:42,432
<font color=#E3D737>NEWS ANCHOR:</font><i> Avinex Industries announced today,</i>

I know, i know. It's been too long.

627
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:03,495
Oh, my lord!
I'll call you back.

628
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,609
Michael and Ian,
the happiest couple..

629
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,427
..in the entire universe.
Oh, my God!

630
00:54:09,627 --> 00:54:12,520
Give me some sugar.

631
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:16,280
Ian, you look like a
two dollar bill.

632
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,022
Hold on.
You just stay right here, okay.

633
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,035
I'm so glad that you came.
I'm gonna fix you up.

634
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:23,320
Roanie, we have two new customers.

635
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,940
If you call me Roanie again...

636
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:32,213
..Ima use this to give you the sex change

637
00:54:32,413 --> 00:54:33,413
Send them in.

638
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,490
Meet the big boss.

639
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,350
Come on, in.

640
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:42,670
Oh, shit. Sorry,
C'mon sit down.

641
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,400
Rayon, turn that shit down!

642
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:52,698
Meds and the Treatments are free,
but the membership, $400 a month.

643
00:54:52,898 --> 00:54:54,820
Alright, you're gonna have to sign a waiver.

644
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:58,372
We are not responsibility
for the drugs that we give you.

645
00:54:58,572 --> 00:54:59,572
You croak, you croak.

646
00:54:59,772 --> 00:55:01,536
 Thats not our problem.
It's yours.

647
00:55:01,736 --> 00:55:02,736
We had AZT,

648
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,743
and it helped Ian a little at the beginning,

649
00:55:05,943 --> 00:55:08,011
First of all, flush that shit down the toilet.

650
00:55:08,211 --> 00:55:09,426
It's bad news.

651
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:13,435
Secondly, stay away from anything
thatll cook your insides.

652
00:55:13,635 --> 00:55:15,180
You gotta stay clean. Alright?

653
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:20,653
Third, get healthy and if your brains broke,
I got something called Peptide T thatll fix right up.

654
00:55:20,853 --> 00:55:21,853
Clear?

655
00:55:22,053 --> 00:55:23,053
I got a start pack.

656
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:25,523
I'll have more in a week.

657
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:26,723
 Untill then,

658
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:29,585
watch what you eat
and who you eat.

659
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,557
Four hundred.
- Yeah.

660
00:55:32,757 --> 00:55:33,757
Rayon, give me some coffee.

661
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:37,469
Coming up, Roanie!

662
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,970
He didn't call, leave a message?

663
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,930
No, Nothing.

664
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:45,649
He did change his address recently.

665
00:55:51,966 --> 00:55:53,127
Thanks.

666
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,170
<i>Shohun o Kaiku.</i>

667
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,840
Uh huh, interferon.

668
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,710
How much can I buy from you?

669
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,160
Yes, Mr.Yamata.

670
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,137
Let me figure out,
how much i can take off your hands.

671
00:56:07,337 --> 00:56:10,261
..I'm gonna have to call you back.

672
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:13,665
Mr.Yamata, i'm gonna have to go.
I'm gonna call you back, Okay?

673
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,390
<i>Arigato.</i>
- What are you doing here?

674
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,970
I live here.
- Where's Rayon?

675
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,090
  You're roommates?
- uh..Not exactly.

676
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,420
 What are you doing here?

677
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,230
Roger Thompson?

678
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:35,130
This is my patient.
Are you treating these people?

679
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,740
Theyre treatin' themselves.
- With what?

680
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:42,260
Vitamins, Peptide T, DDC.
Anything but that poison you're hawkin'.

681
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:50,170
So, you ever wear any colors?

682
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,900
 Every time I see you,
All I see is white.

683
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,595
White coat, white shoes...
white...

684
00:56:55,795 --> 00:56:56,795
Tell Rayon, I was looking for him.

685
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:59,410
And, Im telling my patients
to stay away from here.

686
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,640
Why?

687
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,840
Excuse me.

688
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:06,550
Say, you wanna go grab a steak sometime?
I know its red...

689
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:13,750
Now, that's the shit thatll rot your insides.

690
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,580
What a surprise, FDA approved.

691
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,220
What the fuck is potassium benzoate?

692
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:22,140
Preservative.

693
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,840
You kiddin' me?

694
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,773
Hey, Dont pollute me with that processed crap.
 Im eatin' healthy and you should too.

695
00:57:28,973 --> 00:57:29,973
Its protein, its good for you.

696
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,220
It's processed.
Put it back.

697
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,210
You cant tell me what to do.

698
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:39,105
You're such a bully.

699
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,680
Hey Ron.

700
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,630
What say you T.J?

701
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:56,710
Howre you doin man?

702
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:58,147
Oh, just tryin' to make a living.

703
00:57:58,347 --> 00:57:59,347
You know how it is.
- Yeah, yeah.

704
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,440
Fucking faggots, everywhere.

705
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,120
Hey, T.J,
This is Rayon.

706
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:11,830
Rayon...T.J.

707
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,030
Hey.

708
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,970
He said hi to you.
Shake his hand.

709
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:23,539
Come on, buddy, what's your problem?

710
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:28,540
Fuck you!

711
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,980
Take his hands T.J.

712
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,620
Give him a good one.
Give him good one.

713
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:47,925
Now..

714
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,427
I want you to fuck off.

715
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:52,350
..and go on back to your miserable life.

716
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:55,940
Hmm?

717
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:17,460
What?

718
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,260
Put it back.

719
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,940
Alright, guys!

720
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:36,640
Hang in there.
We'll get you hook up, shortly.

721
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:44,940
Fifty bucks.

722
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:48,680
No, alright.

723
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:52,499
You aint got the money,
you dont join the club.

724
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,420
Hey, everybody!

725
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,380
Let's get this straight.
Membership, 400 bucks.

726
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,600
You're a member,
you get the meds.

727
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,240
If you're not a member,
You don't.

728
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,440
Got it?!

729
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,450
I'm not running a goddamn charity.

730
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,130
You need 350 more.

731
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:32,280
You're bags are all packed and..

732
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,320
 here's your ticket.

733
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,430
Whoa, whoa..whoa!
Ray?

734
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,030
Are you fuckin' high?

735
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,442
None of your business.
- Oh, when it concerns my business,

736
01:00:48,642 --> 01:00:49,642
It sure the fuck its.

737
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,780
If I can't trust you,
it is my business.

738
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:56,560
You motherfucker!

739
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,760
Denise, get in here.

740
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,675
You're in charge!
- No!

741
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:04,231
You can trust me!
- Look at you,

742
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:06,600
You're a fuckin' mess.
Get your shit straight!

743
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:09,860
or, I'll chunk you to curb,
along with your 25 fuckin' percent!

744
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:12,840
Quit acting like a little bitch!

745
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,800
Have my new Caddy is at the airport
for when I get back.

746
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,860
Watch over that fuckin' monkey.

747
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:41,830
Mr. Woodroof?

748
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:54,810
Regarding your order.

749
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,410
I am so sorry, but...

750
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,880
 we are no longer allowed to export..

751
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,815
... interferon to the United States.

752
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,746
What do you mean, Doc?

753
01:02:05,946 --> 01:02:08,497
We discussed this,
two weeks ago. On the telephone.

754
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,790
I was...

755
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,124
not aware of the regulation.
Two weeks ago.

756
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:17,064
I am sorry.
I know you've come a long way.

757
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:18,980
Fourteen hours..

758
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:20,730
 on a plane..

759
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,270
but hey, who gives a shit, right?
Listen..

760
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:28,095
if it's a about money,
I can make it worth your while.

761
01:02:28,295 --> 01:02:30,691
I've got case full of cash, right here.

762
01:02:30,891 --> 01:02:33,320
Please understand.

763
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:35,580
Japanese doctors,

764
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:40,649
will be the only ones
who can make the purchase.

769
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,150
Slow drip.
- Interferon?

770
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,350
 Very strong.

771
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:18,126
Goddamn, I like your style..Hiroshi.

772
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:41,378
Prepare the sedation.
10 milligrams.

773
01:03:41,578 --> 01:03:44,053
 Propofol.
- Your passport please.

774
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,610
Yes, have Dr.Sevard proceed.
Until, i get there.

775
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:53,296
Where're you coming from?
- Oh, excuse me. Japan.

776
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:56,152
Medical research.

777
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:57,820
Good to be back,

778
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:00,730
 in U.S.A.

779
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:04,810
Thank you, Sir.

780
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,440
We dont know what the drugs are.

781
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:02,455
He's got HIV.
- Woodroof?

782
01:05:02,655 --> 01:05:03,655
AIDS..

783
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:05,940
I got AIDS.

784
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,799
Come on in,
Join the party!

785
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,810
Ahh, Mr. Woodroof.

786
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,470
Doc-tor Sevard!

787
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:18,800
I bet you're surprised, to see me.

788
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,060
You nearly killed yourself.

789
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,720
So,

790
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,967
we need to know where you acquired the drugs.

791
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:31,053
And I need to know, what exactly 
you're pumpin' into bloodstream here Doc.

792
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:32,300
Alright.

793
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:37,970
This is a combination of AZT...
and uh..we also got a full spectrum of...

794
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,510
Don't...

795
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,800
Im sueing you for attempted murder!

796
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:46,121
  Wheres my stuff? Barkley..

797
01:05:46,321 --> 01:05:47,321
Your stuff gave you a heart attack.
- Go to hell.

798
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:51,843
I say what goes in my body, not you.

799
01:05:52,043 --> 01:05:55,336
That decision, like it or not,
is left up to the people in this hospital.

800
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,930
You think i'm one of your goddamn
guinea pigs, Sevard..huh?

801
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,230
Well do I look like a rodent to you?
- Mr. Woodroof, 

802
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,410
You think you're clever?

803
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:07,060
You shoot your body full of unknown
drugs. And, you're smuggling a two year supply.

804
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:09,120
Well, hear this.

805
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,100
I will bust you,

806
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,190
I will take you're drugs and I will burn them.

807
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:15,451
You are done!
-Youre a fool...

808
01:06:15,651 --> 01:06:17,175
 if you think youre helping yourself.
- That's right.

809
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,608
I fooled you, didn't I?

810
01:06:19,808 --> 01:06:21,050
You said, Id be dead in thirty days.

811
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:23,571
Well HOWDYFUCKINDOODY,
cuz it's a year later..

812
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:24,771
 and lookie who's still here?

813
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,570
Im done with you.

814
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:30,494
Roanie!
- You got anything to say to me..

815
01:06:30,694 --> 01:06:32,710
you say it to my real doctor.
Dr.Eve Sak.

816
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:35,399
And you..
bring the fuckin' army.


817
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,018
Mr.Woodroof, please get back to the bed.
- Ain't dealing with you.

818
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,540
What the hell is going on in here?

819
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:44,110
Goddamn, that was good though right?

820
01:06:46,228 --> 01:06:49,379
You're his physician and you can't tell me
what medications he's on?

821
01:06:49,579 --> 01:06:51,136
He came in once for advice.

822
01:06:51,336 --> 01:06:53,583
 I have no idea
what he does outside of this hospital.

823
01:06:53,783 --> 01:06:57,001
Well, the FDA confiscated over
two thousand vials of alpha interferon.

824
01:06:57,201 --> 01:06:58,631
Which he was about
to sell to AIDS patients.

825
01:06:58,831 --> 01:07:01,412
To our patients!
- Actually, I've been reading about Buyers Clubs.

826
01:07:01,612 --> 01:07:04,099
They've been having some success
eliminating symptoms some of this

827
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,599
 new drugs..
- Yeah and without controlled trials,

828
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,420
We're not gonna find a cure
because we'll have no legitimate data.

829
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:12,350
 Tell your patients
to stay away from him.

830
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:13,550
Yes, sir.

831
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,180
No. 

832
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,870
Yeah..uh huh.

833
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:23,209
Hold on..I said,
hold on!

834
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:27,243
This guy says the Florida
Buyers Club is cheaper.

835
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:30,241
Well then, tell him to move to
the fuckin' sunshine state!

836
01:07:30,441 --> 01:07:31,441
<font color=#219DFA>David:</font><i>That's what i'm telling you.
I can't get it back.</i>

837
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:34,980
What do you mean you can't get it back?! 
It was authorized by a doctor!

838
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:38,612
<i>The FDA said it was a Japanese doctor
with no legal standing.</i>

839
01:07:38,812 --> 01:07:40,886
<i>What can I say,
they make it up as they go.</i>

840
01:07:41,086 --> 01:07:42,086
Goddamn it!

841
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:47,198
Alright, check Amsterdam, China and Israel.
cause that's where I'm fuckin' goin'!

842
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:56,895
I like your style, Doc.

843
01:08:05,096 --> 01:08:07,048
Good doing business with you.

844
01:08:15,654 --> 01:08:18,157
 I don't trust the white coat
who's trying to sell me the drugs.

845
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,498
I fed-ex it to Seattle to my lab there
and they test if for me.

846
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:24,234
Then, I test it all on myself before
I give it to anyone.

847
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,434
I respect that
you're learning about your illness..

848
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:28,720
 but some of these people need
to be in the hospital.

849
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,220
Why? all they wants is to serve up AZT.

850
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,939
AZT helps eradicate the virus.

851
01:08:34,139 --> 01:08:37,095
Fuck the virus! Dr.Sak.
You know this.

852
01:08:37,295 --> 01:08:40,070
once you got that, you're married to it.
AZT or not.

853
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,989
We're talking about
symptoms and survival.

854
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:47,094
Look, I'm no scientist but...
- You're not? 'Cause you sounds..

855
01:08:47,294 --> 01:08:48,294
 so... scientific.

856
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,609
You fuckin' high again?

857
01:08:51,809 --> 01:08:54,390
Uhmmm..no.

858
01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:58,600
Why are my fucking walls painted red?

859
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:01,770
Its cranberry mocha.
It's for the holidays.


860
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,927
Alright, People can live with this thing
for longer than they're saying.

861
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:11,785
Ninety-six-percent of people in the U.S.A
who has AIDS today,

862
01:09:11,985 --> 01:09:13,190
Are gonna die within six months.
- I know the statistics.

863
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:17,973
Then use them. You don't give AZT
somebody with broken immune system?

864
01:09:18,173 --> 01:09:19,811
  It's toxic!
- If you're abusing it, like you did,

865
01:09:20,011 --> 01:09:22,883
and you're just taking it without
medical surveillance, of course it is.

866
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:24,083
Yeah, I did abuse it.

867
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:25,800
But I'm off it now, look at me.

868
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:28,040
 I'm here, feeling great.

869
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:30,866
And I'm not the only one.

870
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:34,440
Why is Boy Georges
mug all over my fuckin' room?

871
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,170
It's Marc Bolan, silly!

872
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:41,780
Another babe, for your wall of shame.
- Get out, both of you.

873
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:43,870
Take your sunflower and get the fuck out.

874
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:47,550
Oh, come on.
I'm not finished yet.

875
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:08,591
Where the hell are my trial patients?

876
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:15,066
We need you to fill up this form.

877
01:10:15,266 --> 01:10:16,266

Who's the girl?
- A customer.

882
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:30,271
She is HIV positive?

883
01:10:30,471 --> 01:10:33,195
She got full blown AIDS.

01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,768
Cos we need to know

887
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:25,260
For fucks sake.

888
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:31,940
You stick it in, pussy.

889
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,260
Who do you think is gonna do that
when I'm not here?

890
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,780
Stick it in.

891
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:42,840
I swear it Ray.

892
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:49,256
God sure was dressin the wrong doll
when he blessed you with a set of balls.

893
01:11:49,456 --> 01:11:50,562
Give me that.

894
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,730
Look, it's one thing for me
not to like you,

895
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,330
but why don't you be a better friend
to yourself?

896
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,210
If I really thought you were interested,

897
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,415
 I'd tell you.

898
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,360
What are you doin' here?

899
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:06,810
The IRS.

900
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:08,520
You're being audited.

901
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:14,069
Look, here's a couple of
godless shiners out there.

902
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:16,569
Huh, good job boys. Great stuff.

903
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:19,069
This is how they got Al Capone, ain't it?

904
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:21,700
Dont piss them off.
If theres a fine, we'll pay it.

905
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:23,960
Fine. You wanna find me huh?

906
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:26,180
How much you want? Huh.

907
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:29,489
Ten grand?  Twenty grand?

908
01:12:29,689 --> 01:12:31,720
You think that's gonna stop it.
What's your fucking number, huh?

909
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,032
What is it?

910
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,050
HUH?

Trying to run me outta town.

933
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:39,880
Got any ideas,
who might've tipped them off?

934
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:43,062
You don't believe that I would
actually...?

No, not you.

936
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:48,338
That snake you work for.
That's my prime candidate.

937
01:14:48,538 --> 01:14:49,850
I gotta ask you watch what you..

Cos, he's got a hard on for me, You know.

Why'd you become a doctor?

956
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:46,960
Really?

957
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,440
Why I become a do..uhm..

958
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:51,220
I was good in science.

959
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:56,180
My Dad said that
studying history was a waste of time.

960
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:58,080
So, I went to med school.

961
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:01,263
Your dad sounds like a practical man.

962
01:16:01,463 --> 01:16:02,463
He was..

963
01:16:02,663 --> 01:16:03,663
He was.

964
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:07,240
Your turn. What about you?
Why did you become... an 

965
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:10,967
Electrician.
- electrician, right?

966
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:12,167
My dad was an..

967
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:14,470
electrician.
Pretty darn good one too.

968
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:17,880
But he was a hell lot of a better drinker.

969
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:20,170
I can imagine.
- Anyway, I was around it a lot.

970
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:23,900
Electrician part.
Got kinda good at it.

971
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:27,880
Open shit up,
check out the inside..put it back together.

972
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:32,802
Well, somebody thought i was good enough,
to pay me a little money for it.

973
01:16:33,002 --> 01:16:34,002
Kept some change in my pocket.

974
01:16:34,202 --> 01:16:35,202
Then, I end up pround owner
of a Texaco card.

975
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,830
What about your mom?

976
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:43,560
Mom was a painter.

977
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:45,610
Well uhm...

978
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:48,950
Kind of a gypsy woman.

979
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:50,280
You know.

980
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:54,200
She got tired a' all the bullshit and all that.
You know how it is.

981
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:57,120
She made this, your mom?

982
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:05,236
You ain't gotta hang it if you're not..
I know you like everything perfect.

983
01:17:05,436 --> 01:17:06,436
I do not.

984
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:09,430
I'm gonna hang this.

985
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,499
Good.

986
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,814
Don't you want to keep it?

987
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:18,100
You need to enjoy your life, little lady.

988
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,790
 You only got one.

989
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:26,672
Yep Sir..
that's my favourite juice.

990
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,610
Hey..

991
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:32,010
Thanks for coming.

992
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,520
To wildflowers.

993
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:36,944
And both rib eyes.

994
01:17:57,190 --> 01:17:58,543
Im gonna kill him!

995
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,462
See you next week.

search warrant you ain't coming in.

998
01:18:18,372 --> 01:18:19,372
Ron!

999
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:21,470
The hell's all this?
- Sorry, Ron.

1000
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:26,460
Gentlemen, I'm gonna need you all to
leave the premises in an orderly  fashion, please!

1001
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:29,489
Mr. Woodroof, I have a court order
permitting us to confiscate

1002
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:32,054
any and all non-FDA approved
drugs or supplements.

1003
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:34,093
My entire inventory. 

1004
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,884
That's Aloe vera! sir,  It's a plant.

1005
01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:40,131
What the shit do you care, if we eat plants?

1006
01:18:40,331 --> 01:18:43,745
It's improperly labeled.
That's a violation of FDA regulations.

1007
01:18:43,945 --> 01:18:46,027
That's a bullshit technicality
and you  know it!

1008
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,081
Rayon, Get my lawyer on the phone.
- Yeah.

1009
01:18:48,281 --> 01:18:51,087
Our primary concern is preventing
a  market for illegal drugs.

1010
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:53,331
What's Illegal? These are vitamins
and minerals, huh?

1011
01:18:53,531 --> 01:18:56,064
Vitamins and minerals that
gave you a heart attack, remember?

1012
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:59,327
No. I ain't selling that no more,
you  confiscated it, remember?

1013
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,500
What you got Alzheimer, Richard?

1014
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:05,807
Take some of that Peptide T,
fixes that too.

1015
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:07,007
I remember this.

1016
01:19:07,207 --> 01:19:08,207
Yeah, it's a fucking protein!

1017
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:10,430
For dementia which I have.

1018
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,630
For the hundred times,

1019
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,830
just take fuckin' look at my research?

1020
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:18,047
Mr.Woodroof, I wouldnt want you
to spend your last days in jail. 

1021
01:19:18,247 --> 01:19:21,832
If you have a product you'd like tested,
fill out an application and go through the process.

1022
01:19:22,032 --> 01:19:24,982
Don't threaten me, motherfucker! 
The process?

1023
01:19:25,182 --> 01:19:28,602
FDA bullshit for pay up!
I know the fuck that is.

1024
01:19:28,802 --> 01:19:30,542
You'll be receiving your fine for non compliance

1025
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:33,120
 and improper labelling.
- Yeah, shove it up your ass!

1026
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,320
Ron,

1027
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:35,790
Your lawyer.

1028
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,430

1029
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:40,500
David, yeah listen.

<i>- Against who? Ron?</i>

1033
01:19:47,322 --> 01:19:49,430
Against the Government and their fuckin' FDA!
That's who.

1034
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:51,680
Do it!

 So, all we need is more members.
Where do we get those?

1062
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:39,800
Support groups.
- Exactly.

1063
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:42,790
In the meantime we could try the bank?

1064
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:45,900
Oh yeah, Bonnie and Clyde comin in for a loan.

Just down the street, where you can get
the meds that I'm talking about.

1081

1090
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:19,570
I guess, I didn't make the cut.

1091
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,862
You made that choice yourself.

1092
01:24:25,062 --> 01:24:27,533
It wasn't a choice, Dad.

1093
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:30,020
What do you want, Raymond?

1094
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:33,500
Oh, I'm fine, thanks.
And you?

1095
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:36,220
  Long time no see.

1096
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:42,230
I suppose I should thank you
for wearing men's clothes..

1097
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:44,100
..and not embarrassing me.

1098
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:47,581
Are you ashamed of me?
Because I never realized that.

1099
01:24:47,781 --> 01:24:49,639
God help me.

1100
01:24:49,839 --> 01:24:52,858
He is helpin you.

1101
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:14,204
Im sorry, dad.

1102
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:29,730
  I met somebody, who's been very kind to me.

1103
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:33,650
And, i'd like to repay that debt.

1104
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:39,971
But, I need help.

We're working on different angle.
Recoup it under a differrent name or something.

1109
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:03,179
<i>I understand, what you're saying.
The heat on this new rule from FDA..</i>

1110
01:26:03,379 --> 01:26:06,462
<i>Sorry, Mr.Woodroof.
I'm not changing my mind.</i>

1111
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:08,265
Goddamn it!

1112
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:23,510
God, when I meet you,

1113
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:29,690
Im gonna look pretty
if its the last thing I do.

1114
01:26:33,366 --> 01:26:35,732
 Ill be a beautiful angel.

1115
01:26:42,226 --> 01:26:43,995
Dr.Browning, I understand.

1116
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:47,110
Do you understand where i'm comin' from?

1117
01:26:47,310 --> 01:26:50,376
You..?.don..t?

1118
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:01,680
Not one fucking MD
would write me a script.

1119
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,090
Not one.

1120
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:05,470
Motherfuckers!

1121
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:10,350
Oh, well...

1122
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,260
Maybe this will help.

1123
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,520
Where'd you get this?

1124
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:30,180
Did you sell your ass?

1125
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:39,710
Really, where did you get it?

1126
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:47,643
I sold my life insurance policy.

1127
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:52,037
Not like i'm gonna need it anyway.

1128
01:28:23,448 --> 01:28:25,400
Thank you.

1129
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:42,050
Guess who's going to Mexico,
lookin' for a hot date?

1130
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:44,690
Do I look like someone,
 who takes vacations?

1131
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:48,910
A little, tequila, sunshine and tacos,
never hurt anybody.

1132
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:51,920
Is that a no?

1133
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:56,180
I kinda figure, you might rain on my
pary. But, hell I had to take a shot, Didn't I?

1134
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:58,790
Listen, I'm onto something new.

1135
01:28:59,230 --> 01:29:00,730
Alright, looks real promising.

1136
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:02,490
I need to ask you a favour.

1137
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:04,520
I need you to write me prescriptions,

1138
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:07,061
so, I can come back across the border.

1139
01:29:07,261 --> 01:29:09,554
I might not need it but if I do,

1140
01:29:09,754 --> 01:29:10,754
Then, Ill have them.

1141
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:16,314
You know this rule that
the FDA just passed,  it's total bullshit.

1142
01:29:16,514 --> 01:29:19,482
It's all lip service.
- I know, you're right.

1143
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:22,130
And I can't either.
I'm sorry.

1144
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,650
We can't write scripts for
random people and random drugs.

1145
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:27,934
Plus, what if something goes wrong
with these drugs?

1146
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,290
 We could get sued, lose our license.
- I know..I know.

1147
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:32,270
I hear you.

1148
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,465
Well, had to give it a shot.

1149
01:29:34,665 --> 01:29:35,665
Speaking of...

1150
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,968
I'll be taking one,
this afternoon;

1151
01:29:39,168 --> 01:29:40,168
Thinking about you.

1152
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:41,510
<i>Senor!</i>

1153
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:45,161
You keep that, nurse Ratched!

1154
01:30:18,619 --> 01:30:20,100
Okay, i'm taking you to the hospital.

1155
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:22,036
C'mon.
- No..no...no!

1156
01:30:23,333 --> 01:30:25,597
Rayon, trust me.
- No!

1157
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,690
I don't wanna die!

1158
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:35,670
You're not gonna die.

1159
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:39,996
You're not gonna die.
Now, just..trust me, c'mon!

1160
01:30:50,484 --> 01:30:53,391
Secretions that the caterpillar uses
to protect itself..

1161
01:30:53,591 --> 01:30:54,591
...during the incubation period...

1162
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:57,450
...act as a non-toxic
anti-viral for humans.

1163
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,940
  The answer to a question.

1164
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:03,640
Check this out.

1165
01:31:04,190 --> 01:31:05,870
It's The Lancet medical review.

1166
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:09,426
And, they published a study conducted in France.

1167
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:13,530
It proves, AZT alone is too toxic for
most to tolerate,

1168
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:16,845
 and had no lasting effect
on HIV blood levels.

1169
01:31:17,045 --> 01:31:22,321
Of course, Avinex industries and the NIH
they didn't include, the study in their press release.

1170
01:31:22,521 --> 01:31:23,521
Of course, they didn't.

1171
01:31:23,721 --> 01:31:28,123
Now, these are early trial
results for Fluconazole.

1172
01:31:28,323 --> 01:31:30,483
The anti-fungal?
<i>- Yeah.</i>  - I read about this.

1173
01:31:31,370 --> 01:31:33,420
You want to take some home?
- As much I can carry.

1174
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:43,500
You can come in, if you want.
- Oh, no.

1175
01:31:49,690 --> 01:31:50,980
I took him off of it as you instructed.

1176
01:31:51,770 --> 01:31:54,489
He's just on morphine now.

1177
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,350
I'll be in my office.

1178
01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:09,543
Thanks for calling.

1179
01:33:38,610 --> 01:33:40,010
Walker, Dorsett,

1180
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:42,020
 Blount, Newsome,

1181
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:44,250
 Jeffcoat...

1182
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:47,260
 these are patients?

1183
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:49,080
Yes, sir.

1184
01:33:57,150 --> 01:34:00,425
They're also the names of players
on the Dallas Cowboys.

1185
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:03,770
No shit?  

1186
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:06,780
Well, that's a hell of a coincidence, isn't?

1187
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:10,980
Isnt this a little ridiculous?
- You said it.

1188
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,620
Can you prove these are patients?

1189
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:15,940
Can you prove theyre not?

1190
01:34:20,085 --> 01:34:22,154
How're you doing, Denise?
- All right.

1191
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:27,570
Those are the emergencies.

1192
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:31,490
Where is the Idiot?

1193
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:35,759
I thought, you knew.

1194
01:34:36,751 --> 01:34:38,328
At the hospital.

1195
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,720
I need security on the fourth floor,
right away.

1196
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:24,964
Mr.Woodroof.

1197
01:35:25,164 --> 01:35:26,164
You need to wait outside.
- There you are, you son of a bitch.

1198
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:27,818
Mr.Woodroof.

1199
01:35:28,018 --> 01:35:29,018
Woodroof.

1200
01:35:29,218 --> 01:35:31,158
You need to wait outside.

1201
01:35:31,358 --> 01:35:33,090
You are a murderer!

1202
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:35,805
You call yourself a doctor, huh?

1203
01:35:36,005 --> 01:35:38,209
You are a fucking murderer!

1204
01:35:40,464 --> 01:35:41,952
Don't let him kill you.

1205
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:46,770
Take him out of this hopital!

1206
01:36:52,928 --> 01:36:54,686
Oh, Jesus.

1207
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:20,640
Excuse me.

1208
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:24,908
I got two from Austin.

1209
01:37:25,108 --> 01:37:26,108
  All on AZT.

1210
01:37:26,308 --> 01:37:28,493
Their insurance is paying
for the treatment..But,

1211
01:37:28,693 --> 01:37:29,693
..they dont know
if they can afford to switch.

1212
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:31,900
Hook em up.

1213
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:35,240
But...Were pretty cash poor.

1214
01:37:40,530 --> 01:37:43,289
Sell the car.

1215
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:14,710
Anemia,

1216
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:15,910
 Cancer,

1217
01:38:16,110 --> 01:38:17,140
Bone Marrow depletion.

1218
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:21,051
Seizures, Fever, Hearing loss,
Impotence,

1219
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:22,940
 Neuropathy,..

1220
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,200
 Sound like AIDS to you?

1221
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:27,690
Nah, That there comes..

1222
01:38:28,030 --> 01:38:32,429
...in a box of AZT,
a list of side effects.

1223
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:35,636
No wonder, Rayon is dead.

1224
01:38:35,836 --> 01:38:36,836
Rayon was a drug addict!

1225
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:43,000
He didn't die for one day on AZT,
He died from the disease as a whole!

1226
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:47,193
You stole my prescription pad, Ron!

1227
01:38:47,393 --> 01:38:49,707
So, dont accuse me of
acting irresponsibly!

1228
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:55,383
Rayon came to the hospital, on his own..
- ..and got dragged out in goddamn garbage bag!

1229
01:38:55,583 --> 01:38:58,136
He was my friend too!

1230
01:39:14,939 --> 01:39:16,491
Read them.

1231
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,159
I want all my HIV patients on,

1232
01:40:24,359 --> 01:40:25,359
On medical studies to have their AZT
dosage lowered to minimum 600mg.

1233
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:34,053
I got over 3 thousand people who need
to get their hands on Peptide T.

1234
01:40:34,253 --> 01:40:35,886
Including me.
- Yeah, I understand.

1235
01:40:36,086 --> 01:40:38,865
They shut her lab down. What can i say?
- If I dont get it by the end of the week..

1236
01:40:39,065 --> 01:40:41,218
 I wanna file a lawsuit.
- Come on, Ron.

1237
01:40:41,418 --> 01:40:43,708
we lost the restraining order, remember?

1238
01:40:43,908 --> 01:40:44,908
This is Texas.

1239
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:47,043
The court system is your final resort.

1240
01:40:47,243 --> 01:40:48,243
Well, find a place where it's fucking ain't.

1241
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:49,730
Alright, go to...

1242
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:53,880
San Francisco, get a sissy judge,
just figure it out!

1243
01:40:58,530 --> 01:41:00,070
Ten thousand.

1244
01:41:01,486 --> 01:41:03,447
Perfect.

1245
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:17,300
Now, I'd like to turn it over to
my collegue in the CDC

1246
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:18,500
Who'll talk about Prevention.

1247
01:41:28,530 --> 01:41:29,810
Mr.Woodroof..

1248
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,350
Would you kindly, tell us
what you are doing?

1249
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:36,420
Just giving people information, Richard.
At this trial I'm in.

1250
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:38,731
And, make sure they know
what's going on.

1251
01:41:38,931 --> 01:41:39,931
And, what is going on?

1252
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:42,000
Why did you cut off, Peptide T, Richard?

1253
01:41:43,190 --> 01:41:45,730
Non toxic drug,
that i got proof it works.

1254
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:49,066
Not only the national institute
of mental health, Your own people...

1255
01:41:49,266 --> 01:41:50,266
says, it's completely safe.

1256
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,380
Mr.Woodroof..

1257
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:56,245
I'm afraid that you're nothing more
than a common drug dealer.

1258
01:41:56,445 --> 01:41:58,992
So, if you'll excuse us..
- Oh, I'm the drug dealer,

1259
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:01,368
No, you're the fuckin' drug dealer.

1260
01:42:01,568 --> 01:42:02,980
Goddamn, people are dying.

1261
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:07,130
And, y'all up there are afraid,
that we're gonna find an alternative without you.

1262
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:10,660
See, the pharma companies
pay the FDA,

1263
01:42:11,010 --> 01:42:12,260
to push their product.

1264
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,296
Fuck no, they don't wanna see
my research.

1265
01:42:15,496 --> 01:42:18,419
I don't have enough cash
in my pocket, to make it worth their while.

1266
01:42:18,619 --> 01:42:19,619
It's enough!
- That's it right there.

1267
01:42:19,819 --> 01:42:20,819
I tell you what..
I'm gonna be a pain in your ass,

1268
01:42:21,019 --> 01:42:22,694
till I'm six feet under.
- Let's go outside, now.

1269
01:42:22,894 --> 01:42:23,894
Maybe, one day.

1270
01:42:24,094 --> 01:42:26,821
You'll get off your ass
and do your fucking job!

1271
01:42:27,021 --> 01:42:28,021
I need you to leave, let's go.

1272
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:30,140
Here, pass this around.

1273
01:42:30,610 --> 01:42:33,400
Here,
Don't listen to those cocksuckers.

1274
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,880
We think it is in everyones best
interest that you resign.

1275
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:50,980
I wont.

1276
01:42:52,270 --> 01:42:54,543
You'll have to fire me.

1277
01:42:54,743 --> 01:42:55,743
Eve.

1278
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:58,420
Eve?

1279
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:01,678
Y'all go fuck yourselves!

1280
01:43:15,150 --> 01:43:16,470
One left.

1281
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:23,730
That took some balls!

1282
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:30,130
Hey..A nice, warm hug...

1283
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:37,290
That's what you need.

1284
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:39,470
That and a..

1285
01:43:39,950 --> 01:43:41,950
..day of watchin some bull ridin,

1286
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:44,300
doctor Woodroofs orders.

1287
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,560
You ever miss a regular life?

1288
01:44:01,930 --> 01:44:03,420
Regular life?

1289
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:05,490
Whats that?

1290
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:08,180
It doesnt exist.

1291
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:11,640
Yeah, I guess.

1292
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:18,270
I just want...

1293
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:19,550
What?

1294
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:25,750
... an ice-cold beer,
bull ride again.

1295
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:28,320
Go,

1296
01:44:29,410 --> 01:44:30,750
 take my woman dancing.

1297
01:44:36,510 --> 01:44:37,650
I want kids...

1298
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:43,800
I got one..one life right?
-- mine.

1299
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,280
 But I want someone elses sometimes.

1300
01:44:55,180 --> 01:44:58,470
Sometimes, I feel I'm fighting for a life
I just ain't got the time to live.

1301
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:03,621
I want it all to mean somethin.

1302
01:45:07,356 --> 01:45:09,308
It does.

1303
01:47:04,330 --> 01:47:06,829
Sir..sir.

1304
01:47:06,830 --> 01:47:09,329
Step over by your vehicle.

1305
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:10,403
Step over by your car.

1306
01:47:10,603 --> 01:47:11,603
Hey, I got this.
- Sir, step out of the road.

1307
01:47:11,803 --> 01:47:13,873
Hey, I got it.

1308
01:47:15,273 --> 01:47:16,273
Ron, what the hell is going on?

1309
01:47:16,473 --> 01:47:19,226
Do you understand me?

1310
01:47:19,426 --> 01:47:20,426
Come on.

1311
01:47:20,626 --> 01:47:22,860
Why don't I get you home.

1312
01:48:14,290 --> 01:48:18,338
<font color=#219DFA>Judge:</font> <i>The constitution, specifically
the ninth amendment,</i>

1313
01:48:18,538 --> 01:48:21,405
<i>does not state that you have
the right to be mentally healthy..</i>

1314
01:48:21,605 --> 01:48:22,610
<i> or physically healthy.</i>

1315
01:48:23,390 --> 01:48:27,380
<i> It does state that you have a right
to chose your own medical care;</i>

1316
01:48:28,390 --> 01:48:31,810
<i> but that is interpreted
as medical care that is approved..</i>

1317
01:48:32,690 --> 01:48:33,840
<i>by the Food and Drug Administration.</i>

1318
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:39,210
<i>Regarding the FDA, the court is
highly disturbed by its bullying tactics..</i>

1319
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:43,270
<i>and direct interference with a drug
whose own agency</i>

1320
01:48:43,770 --> 01:48:45,654
<i> has found to be non-toxic.</i>

1321
01:48:45,854 --> 01:48:47,000
<i>The FDA was formed</i>

1322
01:48:47,510 --> 01:48:48,430
<i> to protect people,</i>

1323
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:51,043
<i> not prevent them from getting help.</i>

1324
01:48:51,330 --> 01:48:55,362
<i>The law does not seem to make
much common sense, sometimes.</i>

1325
01:48:56,010 --> 01:48:58,330
<i> If a person has been found to be
terminally ill..</i>

1326
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:02,140
<i>they ought to be able to take just about
anything they feel will help...</i>

1327
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:05,849
<i>but that is not the law.</i>

1328
01:49:06,230 --> 01:49:07,300
<i>Mr. Woodroof,</i>

1329
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,843
<i>I'm moved to compassion by your plight,</i>

1330
01:49:11,043 --> 01:49:15,070
<i>But, what is lacking here is
the legal authority to intervene.</i>

1331
01:49:16,030 --> 01:49:17,250
<i> I'm sorry. This..</i>

1332
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:20,976
<i> ...case is hereby dismissed.</i>

1333
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:00,526
What?

1334
01:50:24,650 --> 01:50:30,306
Following the trial, the FDA in Washington allowed
Ron to get Peptide T for his own personal use.</font>
