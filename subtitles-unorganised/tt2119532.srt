He does not practice violence.

He will not even deign to touch a weapon.

You see, Private Doss
is a conscientious objector.

560
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,797
So I plead with you, do not look to him
to save you on the battlefield,

561
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,314
because he will undoubtedly be too busy
wrestling with his conscience to assist.

00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,791
- Sarge, that's not true.
- Private, as you were.

563
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,516
Now, I realize some of you
might have strong feelings about this.

564
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,831
It is what we men fight for.

To defend our rights,
and to protect our women and children.

Even if Private Doss' beliefs
might cause women and children to die.

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,475
So I will expect everyone in this company

568

to give Private Doss
the full measure of respect he is due

just as I have loved you."
