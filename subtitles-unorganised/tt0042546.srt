1
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:34,841
After you.

2
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:44,310
Is this 348?
Yes, it is.

3
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:47,374
I've got a special delivery
here. That sounds interesting.

4
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:50,650
It's for Dowd. Dowd's my name. Elwood P.

5
00:01:50,723 --> 00:01:53,488
Here, sir. Let me give you one of my cards.

6
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,588
That won't be necessary.
Just sign right here. Uh-huh.

7
00:01:57,665 --> 00:02:02,161
Beautiful day. Every day's a beautiful day.

8
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,103
Thank you.

9
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:09,006
He was a nice man.

10
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,552
Come on.

11
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,360
Thank heavens
he's gone!

12
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,771
Oh, Myrtle, it's
a wonderful feeling...

13
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:33,141
to have your relative out of the
house before the company comes.

14
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:36,307
You're sure Uncle Elwood won't
come back and spoil everything?

15
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:39,615
Of course not, dear. Your uncle
always spends the afternoon...

16
00:02:39,687 --> 00:02:43,351
downtown at those filthy bars
and taverns, you know that.

17
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:45,860
I'll go tell the cateress
to get started.

18
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:48,626
Why, Miss Johnson, what
are you doing? Leaving.

19
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:51,567
Miss Johnson, you were hired
to serve as well as cater.

20
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:54,471
Our guests will be here any
minute. Now, Miss Johnson...

21
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,773
Myrtle, let me handle this,
dear. Miss Johnson, what's wrong?

22
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:01,111
There was a man here a minute ago
and he stopped and he spoke to me.

23
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:05,382
You didn't tell him anything about our
party, did you? I didn't tell him nothin'!

24
00:03:05,454 --> 00:03:09,517
He gave me his card. Here. And
then he introduced me to somebody.

25
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:13,531
To whom? Do you think I'd
stay in this house after that?

26
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,899
Um, well...
Oh!

27
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,466
People get run over by trucks every day.
Why can't that happen to Uncle Elwood?

28
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:24,069
Myrtle Mae Simmons,
I'm ashamed of you!

29
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:28,346
Even if people do call your uncle
peculiar, he is still my baby brother...

30
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:31,389
and this is not his
fault. Whose fault is it?

31
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,915
We'll get the cook to do the
serving. Come and lend me a hand.

32
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:38,097
We haven't got much time.
Elvira!

33
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:40,634
If it isn't his fault,
whose fault is it?

34
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:46,040
I know whose fault it is, but I'm
not telling. You're not telling?

35
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,510
Elvira?

36
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,380
Elvira, you can bring
those things in now.

37
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,852
Mother, why can't we live
like other people?

38
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:56,855
Do I have
to keep reminding you...

39
00:03:56,923 --> 00:04:00,417
your Uncle Elwood is not living
with us, we're living with him?

40
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:02,690
Living with him and his pal! You promised!

41
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:06,725
- His pal Harvey!
- Oh, you said that name.

42
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:10,331
You promised you wouldn't say
that name and you said it!

43
00:04:18,184 --> 00:04:21,416
Mother, why did grandmother leave
all her property to Uncle Elwood?

44
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:24,391
I suppose it was because
she died in his arms.

45
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:27,156
People are sentimental
about things like that.

46
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,392
You always say that
and it doesn't make sense.

47
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:33,836
She couldn't make out a will after
she died, could she? Don't be didactic.

48
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:37,536
It's not becoming in a young
girl. Besides, men loathe it.

49
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,602
Men! A fine chance
I've got!

50
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,709
Dear, the whole idea of this
party this afternoon is to...

51
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:54,929
Is to get you started socially, so
that you can meet some nice young men.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,367
What's the use?
Myrtle Mae Simmons,

53
00:04:57,437 --> 00:05:00,271
her uncle, Elwood P. Dowd,
is the biggest screw...

54
00:05:05,781 --> 00:05:09,081
Screwball in town!
Who'd want me?

55
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:13,419
Myrtle, dear, you're sweet
and you have so much to offer.

56
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:18,021
I don't care what anyone says, there's
something sweet about every young girl.

57
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:21,535
And a man takes that sweetness
and look what he does with it!

58
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:26,064
Oh, show some poise, dear. I
want you to charm Mrs. Chauvenet.

59
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:28,508
She has a grandson
just about your age.

60
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:33,608
A lot of good that'll do if Uncle Elwood
comes home. Uncle Elwood won't be home.

61
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:38,647
Or will he? I'm going to telephone
Judge Gaffney. We can't take any chances.

62
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:46,594
Mother,
you better hurry!

63
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:49,570
Mrs. Halsey and Miss
Tewksbury are here already.

64
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,370
Oh, dear.
Yes, dear, I am hurrying.

65
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:55,004
Hurry, Mother. They're
getting out of the car.

66
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,311
Oh...

67
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:07,257
Judge Gaffney, please.
Mrs. Veta Simmons calling.

68
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:13,098
Yes?

69
00:06:13,171 --> 00:06:16,039
Oh, put her on.

70
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:18,509
Veta, my girl,
this is a pleasure.

71
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,604
Judge, we haven't got
a moment to lose.

72
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:25,813
I'm having the Wednesday Forum over
for a program tea for Ethel Chauvenet.

73
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:29,119
Elwood has just gone out, but
I'm so afraid he may come back.

74
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:31,320
You can understand why.
Oh!

75
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:34,331
Hello, Miss Tewksbury,
Mrs. Halsey.

76
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,461
Go right into the drawing room.
Myrtle, take their things.

77
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:40,836
Yes, you've got to help me,
Judge.

78
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:42,899
You've got to help me.
I can't...

79
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:44,969
Speak up, Veta!

80
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:49,815
What? I can't make out...
Is that so?

81
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:56,658
Oh, yoo-hoo, Mrs. Streickelberger.
Hello, Mrs. Simmons.

82
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:05,462
Oh, no, no, no.
Yes, that'll be all right.

83
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,532
You can depend on me.

84
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,841
All right.

85
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:15,210
Minninger, in a few minutes, a
man will be crossing the square.

86
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:18,120
He'll be wearing a hat and coat and
carrying another one over his arms.

87
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,855
I want you to follow him. If necessary,
even confront him, quietly, of course.

88
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:25,058
But at all events, I want you to
prevent him from returning to his house.

89
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:28,501
His sister is giving a party. He wouldn't
fit in. His name is Elwood P. Dowd.

90
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:31,336
Elwood Dowd, sir! Couldn't
you get someone else?

91
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:34,139
Kratke maybe or Beck?
They're bigger than I am.

92
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:38,377
You'll be able to hide better. Hurry and
stick with him all afternoon. Quickly, boy.

93
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,852
Yes, sir.

94
00:07:43,824 --> 00:07:45,816
Oh, elevator!

95
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:52,600
Come in.

96
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:58,074
Yes?
Who is it?

97
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:04,382
Oh! The doctor
will see you in a minute.

98
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:09,552
Good afternoon, Mr. Dowd. Howdy do?

99
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:28,849
We must be
more careful.

100
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:38,496
After you.

101
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:47,834
How do, Mr. Dowd? Afternoon, Mr. Cracker.

102
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:49,844
Excuse me.

103
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:54,043
How is he? Oh, he's just
fine, fine. How are you?

104
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:57,418
Oh, can't complain.
That's good.

105
00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:01,987
Is this all right?
You sure, hmm?

106
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:07,126
Well, all right. Give you a hand
there. Whoop, don't slip! There.

107
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:10,194
You sure this is all right? You
wouldn't rather sit in a booth?

108
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:12,264
Well, all right. Would he prefer a booth?

109
00:09:12,342 --> 00:09:14,922
Thank you, Mr. Cracker. He
seems to prefer the bar today.

110
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:18,083
Good afternoon
to you, sir.

111
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,187
Mr. Meegles is back. Oh!

112
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:24,200
Well!

113
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:26,669
You...
Excuse me a minute.

114
00:09:26,738 --> 00:09:30,675
Mr. Meegles, this is a
pleasure! We've missed you.

115
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:32,678
How are you, Mr. Dowd? Fine.

116
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:35,875
And how is he? Oh, he's
splendid, thank you. Splendid.

117
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,852
He decided he wanted to come over
here this afternoon, so here we are.

118
00:09:38,921 --> 00:09:43,018
Sit down. Oh, thank you. You've been away.

119
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:47,862
For 90 days. Been doin' a job for
the state. Makin' license plates.

120
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:50,767
Oh, is that so?
Interesting work?

121
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:53,397
I can take it or leave it alone. Oh, I see.

122
00:09:53,473 --> 00:09:57,206
I did a job for 'em last year
too. Helpin' 'em build a road.

123
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,410
Oh. Well, Mr. Meegles, we'll just
have to do something about your return.

124
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:04,477
Would you like to come to
my house for dinner tonight?

125
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:07,491
Oh, thanks, Mr. Dowd,
but I couldn't make it tonight.

126
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,858
Ah, tomorrow night?
Would that suit you?

127
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:13,297
Yes, yes! But you know,
the last time I was there...

128
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:17,531
I kinda got the impression your sister held
it against me because I did a little time.

129
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:21,839
Oh, no. My sister loves to
entertain. She's very social.

130
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:26,849
Yes, I see by the papers. You know
I never miss the society column.

131
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:30,012
You don't? No. She's giving
a clambake this afternoon.

132
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,421
This afternoon?
Yeah.

133
00:10:32,492 --> 00:10:34,757
"Reception, program and tea,"
it says here,

134
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:39,163
"for the members of the Wednesday Afternoon
Forum," for that rich Mrs. "Shuvanut."

135
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:42,569
Cheva... Yes,
that's Aunt Ethel.

136
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,834
Is this today's paper?

137
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:48,573
Veta didn't tell me anything about
this. Must've slipped her mind.

138
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:53,142
Well, I'll see you tomorrow
night at 7:00, Mr. Meegles, huh?

139
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:57,054
Thanks, Mr. Dowd. Very glad
to have seen you. Good-bye.

140
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,616
Harvey,
I just found out...

141
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:03,392
Now, what can I do for you?
What did you have in mind?

142
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:05,401
What's your order?

143
00:11:05,469 --> 00:11:08,462
Two martinis.
Two martinis.

144
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,775
Harvey, it seems that Veta is
having a party this afternoon.

145
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:17,841
And l...
Hmm? Oh, you knew?

146
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,946
Well, I just thought she might
be offended if we weren't there.

147
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:25,985
After all, she's the only sister
I have and l... How's that?

148
00:11:26,063 --> 00:11:29,556
And the only one I'm ever likely to
have. Yes, you're absolutely right.

149
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,865
We'd better hurry, huh?

150
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:34,237
That'll be
four bits.

151
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:39,542
The one at the end will pay
for it. Oh, he'd be delighted.

152
00:11:39,614 --> 00:11:42,277
He'd be delighted.

153
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:47,351
Well...
let's drink up.

154
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:50,628
My love

155
00:11:50,696 --> 00:11:55,795
Will take me flying
to the sky

156
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,308
On a steed
with golden wings

157
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:04,871
And then
we'll ride away

158
00:12:04,948 --> 00:12:08,783
Forever high
on the moon

159
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,379
On a star
on a cloud

160
00:12:11,457 --> 00:12:14,825
In his arms

161
00:12:14,895 --> 00:12:18,696
I will stay

162
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:23,899
Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh

163
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:26,408
Ahh

164
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:30,778
Hop, hop, hop, hop hippity
hop on a golden steed

165
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:35,049
Hop, hop, hop, hop hippity
hop Love is all I need

166
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,181
Ahh-ah, ahh-ah

167
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:41,059
Hop, hop, hop, hop hippity
hop on a golden steed

168
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:47,731
Hop, hop, hop, hop hippity
hop Love is all I need

169
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:53,869
Mother.
Shh-shh.

170
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:57,884
Mrs. Chauvenet is here.
Mrs. Chauvenet is here? Oh.

171
00:12:57,952 --> 00:13:02,448
Aunt Ethel! Veta Louise
Simmons, I thought you were dead.

172
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:06,155
Oh, no! I'm very much alive, thank you.

173
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:08,288
And this is my daughter
Myrtle Mae.

174
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:12,428
My dear, you're your grandmother
all over again. I was at her funeral.

175
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:16,236
And now, where is Elwood?
Elwood couldn't be home.

176
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:18,972
That's Miss Tewksbury singing.
She'll be through in a minute.

177
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:22,642
Oh, shame on him! That was the main
reason I came. I want to see Elwood.

178
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,279
Do you realize, Veta,
I haven't seen Elwood in years?

179
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:29,851
I was saying to Mr. Chauvenet...
What do you want, my dear?

180
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:33,831
Just the other night, "What on earth
do you think happened to Elwood Dowd?

181
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,562
"He never comes to
the Yale Alumni Dances anymore.

182
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:39,765
I haven't seen him at the club
or the horse show in years."

183
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:42,174
Does Elwood see anybody
these days?

184
00:13:42,244 --> 00:13:46,045
Yes, Aunt Ethel, Elwood sees
somebody. Yes, Aunt Ethel, he does.

185
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,551
Is Elwood happy,
Veta Louise?

186
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:53,819
Oh, yes, Aunt Ethel, Elwood's
very happy. You mustn't worry.

187
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:56,987
There's Mrs. Cummings.
She's waving at you.

188
00:13:57,063 --> 00:14:01,024
Is that Mrs. Frank Cummings? Doesn't
she look ghastly? I thought she was dead.

189
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:04,197
I must get a closer look.

190
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:07,300
We can go in now. What did I do with my...

191
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:09,710
Oh, there it is.

192
00:14:11,382 --> 00:14:12,941
Oh, no!

193
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:20,884
Elwood! Elwood Dowd!
Bless your heart!

194
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,055
Aunt Ethel.
What a pleasure...

195
00:14:23,131 --> 00:14:27,068
to find a beautiful woman waiting
for me. Elwood, you haven't changed.

196
00:14:27,136 --> 00:14:28,695
Elwood!

197
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:31,241
Well, you both
look lovely.

198
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:36,646
Some mail came for you. It looked
important so I put it up in your room.

199
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:38,775
Did you, Veta?
That was nice of you.

200
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:41,185
Aunt Ethel, I'd like to have
you meet a very dear...

201
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,419
Aunt Ethel, don't you want some
tea? Not just now, thank you.

202
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:46,587
There's punch if you don't
like tea. But I do like tea.

203
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:49,155
Stop pulling me,
you two.

204
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:53,193
Elwood, what night next week can you come
to dinner? You and Veta and Myrtle Mae?

205
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:55,968
I'll have Ordway there.
Ordway is my grandson.

206
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:59,911
Any night at all, I'd be
delighted. I'd like to meet Ordway.

207
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,883
And now, Aunt Ethel,
I'd like you to meet Harvey!

208
00:15:03,952 --> 00:15:07,219
Harvey, you've heard me speak of Aunt
Ethel Chauvenet. One of my dearest friends.

209
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,986
She's the one who...
Hmm?

210
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,726
Th-That's right. Well, this
is the one. No, she's the one!

211
00:15:17,137 --> 00:15:20,437
She... He says he would've
known you anywhere.

212
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:24,605
Well, now we must go in and
greet the rest of our friends.

213
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,671
Come along, Harvey.

214
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:30,277
Oh, Aunt Ethel,
will you pardon me?

215
00:15:30,354 --> 00:15:33,256
You're standing
in his way.

216
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,723
There we are.

217
00:15:36,795 --> 00:15:38,764
I'll see you in a minute.

218
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:43,532
I can see that you're disturbed
about Harvey. Please don't be.

219
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:46,506
He stares that way at
everybody. It's his way.

220
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:50,138
But he likes you, I can
tell. He likes you very much.

221
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:53,048
I'm, I'm coming, Harvey.

222
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,849
Well, I... I think
I'll be running along.

223
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,550
No tea? Or punch? No, no. Thank you.

224
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,185
Perhaps a nice lemon fizz...
I'll be going. Good-bye.

225
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:04,459
with a turkey wing
and some walnut dressing?

226
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:08,360
Oh, no!

227
00:16:08,438 --> 00:16:12,173
Elwood.

228
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,946
Oh, no.
Not Mrs. Halsey.

229
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:19,576
She has a nephew. He's a little bit
old, but he would have done in a pinch.

230
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,010
She has a nephew. He's a little bit
old, but he would have done in a pinch.

231
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,413
Oh, Mother, I can't face
those people. I just can't!

232
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:31,948
Your uncle has disgraced us for the last
time in this house. I'm going to see to that.

233
00:16:32,026 --> 00:16:34,518
You're no match for him.
He always gets the best of you.

234
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:36,565
Where are you going? Upstairs to pack.

235
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:40,126
I'm going to lose myself in some strange
city. I'm going to change my name!

236
00:16:40,204 --> 00:16:42,139
Don't do that yet,
dear!

237
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:45,735
Wait until I telephone
Judge Gaff... Judge Gaffney.

238
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:49,772
I'm going to do something
I should've done long ago.

239
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,355
I don't understand it, Veta. Mr.
Minninger is as trustworthy as the Bible.

240
00:16:56,425 --> 00:16:58,826
I don't know anything about
your Mr. Minninger.

241
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:03,891
But I do know Elwood Dowd when I see
him and he's here. He's here, I tell you.

242
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:09,500
If you insist he's there, then I must
act on the assumption that he's there.

243
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:11,944
Minninger!
You failed!

244
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:14,846
I didn't fail, Judge.
I haven't tried yet.

245
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,578
I've been in
the doctor's office.

246
00:17:16,652 --> 00:17:19,747
Oh, excuse me.
Hold on, Judge.

247
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:22,258
Mrs. Halsey, Mrs. Krausmeyer.
You're not leaving, are you?

248
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:25,126
I just remembered the horse show
is today. Good-bye. It's been jolly.

249
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:27,530
Won't you join us
tomorrow night?

250
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:30,901
Harvey and I are having a
few people in for Mr. Meegles.

251
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:34,409
Forgive me, Mrs. Simmons. One of my
stupid headaches. Such a lovely party.

252
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:36,536
Good-bye, good-bye.

253
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:39,081
Elwood, I'd like to talk...

254
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:41,118
W-W-W...

255
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,280
There.
There we are.

256
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:48,054
I'd like to talk to you, Elwood.
I like to talk to you too.

257
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:51,792
This is very important. Would
you mind coming into the library?

258
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:54,164
Oh, of course, Veta.

259
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:58,606
Elwood, I want
to talk to you.

260
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:01,873
Oh!

261
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:06,043
I want you to wait here.
Don't move. I'll be right back.

262
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,577
Certainly, sister. I happen
to have a little free time now.

263
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:12,626
You're welcome to all of it,
Veta. Want Harvey to wait too?

264
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:16,290
Oh, yes! Yes, Elwood.
I certainly do.

265
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:18,526
Hello! Speak up, I say.

266
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:20,536
Did you say something,
Harvey? Who said that?

267
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:23,472
Veta Louise, are you there?
Are you there, girl?

268
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,772
Hello? Veta?

269
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:27,813
Hello.
Who is it please?

270
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,478
Oh, Judge, I'm so glad you
called. I was going to call you.

271
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:35,284
Oh, um... Omar,

272
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:38,259
we've got to take those steps
we discussed once.

273
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:41,298
Yes. I want you to make
all the arrangements.

274
00:18:41,365 --> 00:18:44,233
Yes.
By all means, yes.

275
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:47,329
That was Omar. We've been
neglecting the Judge lately.

276
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:50,865
Veta, do you know that it's been weeks
since Harvey and I've been up to his office?

277
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:55,940
Let's go tomorrow, shall we?
Elwood, you and I may take a ride.

278
00:18:56,018 --> 00:19:00,353
Oh, I'd like that! Only
the other day Harvey said,

279
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:03,450
"It's certainly been a long time
since we've been for a drive."

280
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:09,264
You're sweet and thoughtful. Don't
forget to wait for me. I'll be right back.

281
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:15,432
Make yourself comfortable,
Harvey.

282
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,674
There.
All right?

283
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:21,980
Veta wants to talk to us.

284
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:26,286
She, uh,
says it's very important.

285
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:30,386
I think she wants
to congratulate us...

286
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:33,331
on the impression we made
at her party.

287
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:40,942
Jane Austin.
Sense and Sensibility.

288
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:45,813
Hmm?
Oh...

289
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,479
Random House.

290
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:52,047
No, deluxe edition.

291
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,151
Usual acknowledgments.

292
00:19:55,463 --> 00:19:58,024
Chapter One.

293
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,197
"The family of Dashwood had
been long settled in Sussex..."

294
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:25,165
Will you wait here for me,
Elwood, dear?

295
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:29,640
You want both of us to
wait? Oh, yes, both of you.

296
00:20:33,414 --> 00:20:35,780
I won't be long.

297
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,549
Driver, driver, will you
keep an eye on him, please?

298
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:42,592
I won't be but a minute.

299
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:52,896
Charming place, isn't
it, Harvey? Name's Henry.

300
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:56,671
It's Henry, Harvey.
No, just plain Henry.

301
00:20:56,744 --> 00:21:01,115
Hmm, oh!
My name's Dowd, Elwood P.

302
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:05,519
Let me give you one
of my cards.

303
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:09,048
If you should ever want to
call me, call me at this number.

304
00:21:09,127 --> 00:21:12,997
Don't call me at that one.
That's the old one.

305
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:17,061
If you happen to lose the card,
don't worry, I have plenty more.

306
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:25,382
Mrs. O.R. Simmons. 348
Temple Drive. Is that right?

307
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,851
Yes. We were born
and raised there.

308
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,548
It's old, but we love it.
It's our home.

309
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,421
And you wish to enter your brother
at the sanitarium for treatment?

310
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:37,261
What is your brother's
name? It's... Oh, dear.

311
00:21:37,332 --> 00:21:40,063
Mrs. Simmons,
what is your brother's name?

312
00:21:40,136 --> 00:21:44,506
I'm sorry. Life is
not easy for any of us.

313
00:21:44,575 --> 00:21:47,477
It's Dowd.
Elwood P. Dowd.

314
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:50,447
Elwood P. Dowd.
His age?

315
00:21:50,516 --> 00:21:53,953
Forty-two
the 24th of last April.

316
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,387
He's Taurus,
Taurus the bull.

317
00:21:56,457 --> 00:22:00,519
I'm Leo, and Myrtle's on the
cusp. You have him with you now?

318
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:03,623
Oh, yes. He's outside
waiting in a taxi cab.

319
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,397
I told him to wait. He
always does what I tell him.

320
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,440
I see. Is he married?
No, Elwood never married.

321
00:22:09,508 --> 00:22:14,743
He always stayed with
Mother. He loved his home.

322
00:22:14,815 --> 00:22:18,149
Yeah? Wilson, there's a
Mr. Dowd outside in a cab.

323
00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:22,920
Will you ask him if he'll be good enough
to step up to room 24 South Wing "G"?

324
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:26,760
Ask him? Wilson, this is
his sister, Mrs. Simmons.

325
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:28,766
Oh, how do?

326
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:32,669
Why certainly.
I'll be glad to escort him.

327
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:35,766
I'll see if Dr. Sanderson
can see you, Mrs. Simmons.

328
00:22:35,843 --> 00:22:39,541
Dr. Sanderson? I want to
see Dr. Chumley himself.

329
00:22:39,614 --> 00:22:43,608
Dr. Sanderson is the one who sees
everybody. Dr. Chumley sees no one.

330
00:22:43,686 --> 00:22:46,349
I'll tell him
you're here.

331
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:59,274
l-lsn't this wonderful, Veta? Okay, buddy!

332
00:23:05,654 --> 00:23:08,590
Oh, you startled me!

333
00:23:08,658 --> 00:23:11,685
I'm sorry, Mrs. Simmons.
I am Dr. Sanderson. Oh.

334
00:23:11,762 --> 00:23:16,325
Miss Kelly tells me you're concerned
about your brother, Mister, uh, Mister...

335
00:23:16,401 --> 00:23:18,597
The card, Miss Kelly.

336
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:22,233
Miss Kelly!
The card, please.

337
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:25,608
Mr. Dowd? Elwood P. Dowd. This way.

338
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,878
I'm sorry if I awakened you,
Miss Kelly.

339
00:23:30,853 --> 00:23:33,448
I'm so...

340
00:23:33,524 --> 00:23:37,791
I do hope you don't think
I'm always as jumpy as this.

341
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:40,161
This is not easy for me,
Doctor.

342
00:23:40,232 --> 00:23:42,997
These things aren't easy
for the family. I understand.

343
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,006
Won't you sit down,
Miss Simmons? Thank you.

344
00:23:46,074 --> 00:23:50,409
How long has it been since you first noticed
any peculiarity in your brother's actions?

345
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:53,540
As a baby,
he was perfectly normal.

346
00:23:53,616 --> 00:23:57,110
I know. I was his big sister
and I had to change him.

347
00:23:57,189 --> 00:23:59,680
Babies do need changing,
you know.

348
00:23:59,758 --> 00:24:03,628
I noticed that he seemed
to be different...

349
00:24:03,697 --> 00:24:06,462
after we came back
after Mother had died.

350
00:24:06,534 --> 00:24:09,868
Myrtle Mae and I came back from
Des Moines to live with Elwood.

351
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:12,807
I could see that he...

352
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:14,969
That he...
That he what?

353
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:17,537
Take your time.
Don't strain.

354
00:24:17,615 --> 00:24:20,585
Just, just let it come.
I'll wait for it.

355
00:24:20,652 --> 00:24:25,114
Doctor, everything I say to
you is confidential, isn't it?

356
00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:29,061
I am not a gossip. I am
a psychiatrist. Of course.

357
00:24:29,131 --> 00:24:33,330
For one thing, he
drinks. Mm-hmm. To excess?

358
00:24:33,403 --> 00:24:35,371
To excess?

359
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:39,308
Don't you call it excess when
a man never lets a day go by...

360
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:42,108
without stepping
into some cheap tavern,

361
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:45,549
bringing home a lot of riffraff,
people you never heard of?

362
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,217
If you don't call that excess, Doctor,
I'm sure I don't know what excess is.

363
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:52,784
I didn't doubt
your statement.

364
00:24:52,862 --> 00:24:55,093
I merely wanted to know
if your brother drinks.

365
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:58,500
Yes, I say definitely
Elwood drinks. Mm-hmm.

366
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,199
I want him committed
out here permanently...

367
00:25:01,274 --> 00:25:05,041
because I cannot stand
another day of that Harvey!

368
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:07,638
Don't you think it would have been
a little bit kinder of Mother...

369
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:11,482
if she'd written us about
him. Now, be honest. Don't you?

370
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:14,683
I really couldn't answer
that question. I can!

371
00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:17,284
Yes, it certainly
would have.

372
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:20,354
This person
that you call Harvey,

373
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:23,527
who is he?
He's a rabbit.

374
00:25:23,603 --> 00:25:27,040
Yes, perhaps.
But just who is he?

375
00:25:27,107 --> 00:25:29,269
Someone your brother picked up
in one of these bars?

376
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,280
I've been telling you,
Harvey is a rabbit!

377
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:36,752
A big white rabbit six feet high,
or is it six feet, three and a half?

378
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,313
Heaven knows, I ought to know. He's
been around the house long enough!

379
00:25:40,392 --> 00:25:44,261
Mrs. Simmons, if I'm not
mistaken... Don't you understand?

380
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:46,823
The rabbit's name
is Harvey.

381
00:25:46,901 --> 00:25:49,769
Harvey lives
at our house.

382
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:54,469
Elwood buys theater tickets and
railroad tickets for both of them.

383
00:25:54,544 --> 00:25:56,775
He's lost interest
in everything else.

384
00:25:56,847 --> 00:26:00,750
And here I am trying to get
Myrtle Mae started...

385
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:04,085
with a nice group
of young people.

386
00:26:04,156 --> 00:26:06,250
That's my daughter.

387
00:26:06,326 --> 00:26:08,318
Doctor,

388
00:26:08,396 --> 00:26:12,925
I'm going to tell you something
I've never told anyone in this world.

389
00:26:13,002 --> 00:26:15,096
Not even Myrtle Mae.

390
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:20,110
Every once in a while, I see
this big white rabbit myself!

391
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,169
Isn't that terrible!

392
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:26,117
And what's more, he's every
bit as big as Elwood says he is!

393
00:26:26,186 --> 00:26:31,682
Don't ever tell that to anybody,
Doctor. I'm ashamed of it.

394
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,823
I can see that you've been under
a great nervous strain lately.

395
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:40,735
You just try living with those two
and see how much of a strain it is.

396
00:26:40,805 --> 00:26:43,206
Your mother's death, it
depressed you considerably.

397
00:26:43,275 --> 00:26:45,403
Nobody knows how much.

398
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:50,747
Don't you worry. I'm going
to help you. Oh, Doctor!

399
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,089
Miss Kelly. Miss Kelly!

400
00:26:55,158 --> 00:26:57,992
Wilson? Wilson!

401
00:26:58,062 --> 00:27:01,590
Don't you move. You just sit there
and make yourself comfortable.

402
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:03,931
I'll only be a minute. Yes.

403
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:06,996
Wilson? Wilson!

404
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:10,506
Hello?

405
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:17,814
Lady, you told me to keep an eye on that
fella, but a big guy in a white coat came...

406
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,356
That's quite all right.
You just wait.

407
00:27:20,424 --> 00:27:23,360
Do you want I should do
something about his suitcase?

408
00:27:23,428 --> 00:27:27,389
Oh, Elwood's things. Yes, I
better come get them, I guess.

409
00:27:27,468 --> 00:27:32,304
He might need them. Oh dear, it would
be awful if he should get hurt and...

410
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:35,344
She picked a fine time to leave her desk
just when I've got a new patient in my office.

411
00:27:35,411 --> 00:27:38,973
Mrs. Simmons?
Mrs. Simmons!

412
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:42,282
Sound the gong. That poor woman mustn't
leave the grounds. Made a getaway, huh, Doc?

413
00:27:42,354 --> 00:27:45,756
Her condition is serious. Go after her
and take her to 13 Upper West "R." Right.

414
00:27:50,931 --> 00:27:53,992
Where is she? That little dame
that just came out, where'd she go?

415
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:57,130
She's picking some posies. She wants
to bring 'em to somebody inside.

416
00:27:57,206 --> 00:27:59,505
Mac, is it safe for me
to wait around?

417
00:27:59,576 --> 00:28:02,637
I don't see no bars on these
windows. Don't need 'em.

418
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:06,743
Anybody tries to climb through those
windows will sound like a three-alarm fire.

419
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:12,351
Hello, sweetheart.
Well, well. Those for me?

420
00:28:12,427 --> 00:28:15,363
For you? I should say not.
They're for my brother Elwood.

421
00:28:15,431 --> 00:28:18,060
He's devoted to ranunculus. Sure.

422
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:21,298
Wouldn't you like to come inside
and pick some off the wallpaper?

423
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:23,705
No, thank you. These
will do nicely. Good day.

424
00:28:23,775 --> 00:28:26,768
Lady. Come, lady. Now, really, l...

425
00:28:26,846 --> 00:28:31,182
There's a man inside wants to
talk to you. No, I don't... No!

426
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:34,780
No! You let me go! Help. Help! Police!

427
00:28:34,857 --> 00:28:37,725
What do we want with the police,
love boat? They're no fun.

428
00:28:37,794 --> 00:28:41,196
You let me go! I'm a respectable
woman! That's for sure.

429
00:28:41,265 --> 00:28:44,702
Come on, lady, be nice or I'll
have to pick you up and carry you.

430
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,502
Help!

431
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:00,821
Oh, Dr. Sanderson!
Judge Gaffney!

432
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:03,326
How about giving me a hand,
beautiful?

433
00:29:03,394 --> 00:29:05,625
I'll sit on her.
You can strip her clothes off.

434
00:29:05,698 --> 00:29:08,429
You'll have to wait. I've got
to give some guy a bubble bath.

435
00:29:08,502 --> 00:29:10,869
Okay, honey,
but make it snappy.

436
00:29:10,938 --> 00:29:14,500
Somebody help me!

437
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:32,263
Doc, that Simmons dame's all
set. Yeah, no trouble at all.

438
00:29:32,467 --> 00:29:36,063
That's fine. I'll be right up and
prescribe some preliminary treatment.

439
00:29:36,138 --> 00:29:39,905
Don't you ever stay in your office?
I needed you! I had to give a hypo.

440
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:43,435
Telephone this Elwood P. Dowd right
away. His sister's condition is serious.

441
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:46,484
But, Doctor, l... He'll have to
sign these commitment papers for her.

442
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:49,249
I didn't know the woman needed the
treatment. She said it was her brother.

443
00:29:49,322 --> 00:29:51,416
Of course she did! That's
the oldest dodge in the world.

444
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:53,518
Always used by
a cunning type of psychopath.

445
00:29:53,595 --> 00:29:56,497
She knew her brother was about to commit
her, so she came here to discredit him.

446
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:59,968
Get him on the phone, please. I
thought the woman was all right...

447
00:30:00,037 --> 00:30:03,804
so I had Wilson take the
brother up to 24 South Wing "G."

448
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:06,709
He's there now. You had
Wilson take the brother in?

449
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,874
Come on, no gags, please.
You're not serious, are you?

450
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:14,946
I did, Doctor. I did.
Doctor, I'm terribly sorry.

451
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:18,687
Oh, you're terribly sorry! Well,
that's fine! That fixes everything!

452
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:20,753
That's just wonderful!

453
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:25,929
Oh, no! Kelly! Kelly, do
you realize what you've done?

454
00:30:26,004 --> 00:30:29,840
This man Dowd can sue us for false
commitment! He can own the sanitarium!

455
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,409
And I'll be kicked outta here faster than you
can say "stupid, incompetent and inefficient."

456
00:30:33,543 --> 00:30:36,741
I'll tell Dr. Chumley you had nothing
to do with it. It was all my fault.

457
00:30:36,814 --> 00:30:39,807
You're the last person I'd ever
want anything like this to happen to.

458
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:41,854
You know that,
don't you?

459
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:45,790
This is hardly the time or place to go into
the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet.

460
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:48,226
Lately, Doctor, there's
never any time or place!

461
00:30:48,296 --> 00:30:51,858
Jeepers! They may be putting him in
the hydro room right now. Get him down!

462
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,369
I'll break the news to Dr.
Chumley. He may want to handle this.

463
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:56,428
What shall I say to Mr. Dowd?
What'll I do?

464
00:30:56,506 --> 00:30:59,135
He'll probably be so furious
he'll refuse to come down.

465
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:02,112
He's probably fit to be tied,
but he's a man, isn't he?

466
00:31:02,181 --> 00:31:04,514
I guess so.
His name is "Mister."

467
00:31:04,584 --> 00:31:08,385
Then go into your routine. You
know, the eyes, the swish, the works!

468
00:31:08,455 --> 00:31:11,254
I'm immune to it, but I've seen it work
on some people. Some of the patients!

469
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:14,387
You get him down here
if you have to do a striptease.

470
00:31:14,463 --> 00:31:17,991
Dr. Chumley, I'm afraid
there's been a serious error.

471
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:21,904
Dr. Sanderson, we don't permit
errors in this institution.

472
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:32,753
Mr. Dowd?

473
00:31:34,023 --> 00:31:37,289
Elwood P. Here, let me
give you one of my cards.

474
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:40,695
Mr. Dowd, I'm Miss Kelly. I'm
at the reception desk downstairs.

475
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,530
I'm happy to know you, Miss
Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Dowd.

476
00:31:43,603 --> 00:31:47,267
I was wondering if you would come
downstairs with me to Dr. Sanderson's office.

477
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:51,244
There's something he'd like to
explain to you. Uh-huh. I'd be glad to.

478
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:56,149
But there was another very charming
girl in here. And she asked me to wait.

479
00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:58,279
She said something
about a bath.

480
00:31:58,356 --> 00:32:02,794
I don't like to disappoint her. She
seemed to have her heart set on it.

481
00:32:02,861 --> 00:32:05,228
That was Miss Dunphy.
It's quite all right, Mr. Dowd.

482
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,859
Dr. Sanderson will explain everything
in his office. Well, here we are.

483
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:10,062
Tsk-tsk. Mr. Dowd,
you haven't peeled yet.

484
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:15,202
And I regret this, but Miss Kelly
seems to want me to go with her.

485
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,180
Miss Kelly, you've met
Miss Dunphy? Yes, of course.

486
00:32:18,248 --> 00:32:22,914
I want you to meet a very dear... There's
been a mistake. Just forget everything.

487
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:28,519
I have a suggestion. Why don't I do
what she wants, and then go with you?

488
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:32,829
That won't be necessary, Mr.
Dowd. All right. Good-bye, my dear.

489
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:35,564
You could've had
a bath too.

490
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:40,440
I've already had a bath. Oh, I wasn't
speaking to you. I was speaking to my fr...

491
00:32:40,511 --> 00:32:45,815
Mr. Dowd, I take a bath every
morning just before I go on duty.

492
00:32:45,885 --> 00:32:49,481
It's always such a pleasant way
to start the day.

493
00:32:50,258 --> 00:32:52,727
Oh, after you.

494
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:04,671
Mr. Dowd?
Elwood P.

495
00:33:04,743 --> 00:33:07,440
Let me give you one
of my cards.

496
00:33:07,513 --> 00:33:10,540
I am Dr. Lyman Sanderson, Dr.
Chumley's assistant. And l...

497
00:33:10,617 --> 00:33:13,951
Good for you! Happy to know you. Yes.

498
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:18,085
I asked Miss Kelly to bring you
down here... Isn't she lovely?

499
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:20,460
You're very lovely,
my dear.

500
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:24,798
Why thank you! Some people
don't seem to think so.

501
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,999
Well, some people are blind. That's
very often brought to my attention.

502
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:31,533
I'd like both of you to meet a very dear
friend of mine... Why can't we sit down?

503
00:33:31,612 --> 00:33:34,844
Won't you have a chair?
Well, thank you very much.

504
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:37,818
There we are.

505
00:33:37,887 --> 00:33:39,913
Please, sit down.
After Miss Kelly.

506
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:44,622
No, really, Mr. Dowd. I couldn't. I'm
in and out. But you sit down, please.

507
00:33:44,697 --> 00:33:47,461
After you.
Sit down, Kelly!

508
00:33:50,805 --> 00:33:53,900
Anything we can do for you, Mr.
Dowd? What did you have in mind?

509
00:33:53,976 --> 00:33:57,708
Is your chair comfortable? Is the
chair quite comfortable, Mr. Dowd?

510
00:33:57,781 --> 00:34:01,218
Yes. Care to try it? No, no, no,
thank you. How 'bout a cigarette?

511
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:04,016
No, thank you.
Yes, a cigarette...

512
00:34:05,757 --> 00:34:08,922
Mr. Dowd, you have us
at a disadvantage here.

513
00:34:08,996 --> 00:34:12,455
You know it and we know it, so
let's lay our cards on the table.

514
00:34:12,534 --> 00:34:14,468
That appeals
to me, Doctor.

515
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:18,668
Best thing in the long run. People
are people no matter where you go.

516
00:34:18,742 --> 00:34:20,835
That is very often
the case.

517
00:34:20,911 --> 00:34:23,904
And being human,
are liable to make mistakes.

518
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:28,818
Miss Kelly and I, we've made a mistake
this afternoon and we'd like to explain it.

519
00:34:28,888 --> 00:34:32,188
The truth is... You and Miss Kelly here?

520
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:34,251
Yes.

521
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:37,299
Out here this afternoon? Yes, Mr. Dowd.

522
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,564
We hope you'll understand. Oh, yes, yes.

523
00:34:40,637 --> 00:34:44,506
These things are often the basis
of a very long, warm friendship.

524
00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:47,569
It wasn't Dr. Sanderson's
fault. It was mine.

525
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:50,172
No, the responsibility
is all mine!

526
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:55,349
Your attitude may be old-fashioned,
but I like it very much.

527
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,726
Of course, If I had seen
your sister first,

528
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:02,891
this would've been
an entirely different story.

529
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,936
There you surprise me.

530
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:08,804
I think the world and all of Veta,
but I had supposed she'd seen her day.

531
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:13,780
You mustn't attach too much blame
to her. She's a very sick woman.

532
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:18,149
She came in here insisting that you needed
treatment. That's perfectly ridiculous.

533
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,486
Veta shouldn't be upset
about me. I get along fine.

534
00:35:21,558 --> 00:35:25,587
She was extremely upset and plunged right
away into a heated tirade about your drinking.

535
00:35:25,664 --> 00:35:28,429
Ahh!
That was Veta.

536
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:32,438
I tell Veta not to worry about
that. I'll take care of that.

537
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:35,635
Exactly! Oh, I suppose that you take a
drink now and then like the rest of us.

538
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,612
M-M-M-M...

539
00:35:40,016 --> 00:35:42,042
Yes, yes I do, Doctor.

540
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,647
As a matter of fact,
I'd like one right now.

541
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:48,557
As a matter of fact,
so would I.

542
00:35:48,627 --> 00:35:51,791
But her reaction to the whole
matter was entirely too intense.

543
00:35:51,865 --> 00:35:53,834
Does she drink, Mr. Dowd?

544
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:58,533
Oh, no, oh, no. I don't think
Veta's ever taken a drink.

545
00:35:58,608 --> 00:36:01,840
I am going to surprise you. I
think she has and does constantly.

546
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:05,212
She... Is that...

547
00:36:05,283 --> 00:36:09,618
Well, I certainly
am surprised at that.

548
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:13,251
Her alcoholism isn't
the basis for my diagnosis.

549
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:18,266
It was when she became so emotional
about this big white rabbit Harvey.

550
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:22,271
Yes, I believe she called
him Harvey. Harvey's his name!

551
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:25,503
Doctor, before we go any
further, I must insist...

552
00:36:25,576 --> 00:36:27,772
that you and Miss Kelly allow me
to introduce you to a friend...

553
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:30,111
Let me make my point.

554
00:36:30,183 --> 00:36:33,915
I think your sister's condition
stems from trauma.

555
00:36:33,988 --> 00:36:37,516
From what? Trauma.
Spelled T-R-A-U-M-A.

556
00:36:37,592 --> 00:36:39,993
It means shock. There's
nothing unusual about it.

557
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:42,429
There's the birth trauma,
or the shock of being born.

558
00:36:42,563 --> 00:36:46,432
That's the one
we never get over.

559
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:50,599
You have a very nice sense of humor.
Hasn't he, Miss Kelly? Oh, he certainly has!

560
00:36:50,674 --> 00:36:53,337
May I say the same
for both of you?

561
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:57,644
Your sister's condition is
serious, but I can help her.

562
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,912
She must, however, remain
out here temporarily.

563
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:03,980
Uh-huh. Well, I've always wanted Veta
to have everything she needs. Exactly!

564
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:07,927
But I wouldn't want her to stay here
unless she likes it and wants to stay here.

565
00:37:07,996 --> 00:37:12,298
If this were an ordinary delusion on the
memory picture, that would be one thing.

566
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:14,337
But this is
much more serious.

567
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:18,343
It stands to reason no one has ever
seen a white rabbit six feet high.

568
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:20,538
Not very often,
Doctor.

569
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:22,673
So she must be committed
here temporarily.

570
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:25,412
Under the circumstances, I'd
commit my own grandmother.

571
00:37:25,486 --> 00:37:27,751
Does your grandmother
drink too?

572
00:37:27,823 --> 00:37:31,055
That's just an expression.

573
00:37:31,127 --> 00:37:34,325
Here are the commitment papers for you
to sign, and here's a visitor's pass.

574
00:37:34,398 --> 00:37:36,367
You can come and see her
whenever you like.

575
00:37:36,435 --> 00:37:39,234
I think you better
have Veta do this.

576
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:42,969
She always does all the signing and
managing for our family. She's good at it.

577
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:46,172
I'll have your family lawyer
take care of it. Judge Gaffney.

578
00:37:46,248 --> 00:37:48,342
He's already telephoned us in
connection with this matter.

579
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:50,408
Is that so?
Yes.

580
00:37:50,486 --> 00:37:53,786
I like you, Dowd. Well,
I like you too, Doctor.

581
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:56,952
And Miss Kelly here.
I certainly do like you.

582
00:37:57,028 --> 00:37:59,793
Why, thank you,
Mr. Dowd.

583
00:37:59,865 --> 00:38:04,099
You two have been so pleasant,
why don't we keep on going?

584
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:06,800
I'd like to invite you
to come downtown with me...

585
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:10,277
and we'll go to this charming little place
called Charlie's and we'll have a drink.

586
00:38:10,346 --> 00:38:13,407
Oh, I'm sorry,
but we're on duty now.

587
00:38:13,484 --> 00:38:16,249
Give us a rain check. Some
other time, we'd be glad to.

588
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:20,122
When? Well, I can't say offhand.

589
00:38:20,192 --> 00:38:22,354
Miss Kelly and I are
on duty until 10:00 tonight.

590
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:25,797
10:00 will be fine. I'll be waiting
for you. It's at Twelfth and Main.

591
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:28,063
If we can make it.
I'll be waiting.

592
00:38:28,137 --> 00:38:31,505
The four of us will spend a
very pleasant evening together.

593
00:38:31,574 --> 00:38:34,738
I want both of you to become friends
with a very dear friend of mine.

594
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,541
But you said later on,
didn't you? Yes, yes.

595
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:40,347
Later on it'll be.
Good-bye. Good-bye, Mr. Dowd.

596
00:38:49,131 --> 00:38:51,395
Boy, that was
a close shave!

597
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:54,232
But he seemed like a
reasonable sort of a fellow.

598
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:56,967
You handled him beautifully,
Doctor. You were wonderful.

599
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:59,909
Psychology. Specialized
training. Takes years of it.

600
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:08,746
Good afternoon, Mrs. Chumley.
Good afternoon, Herman.

601
00:39:11,794 --> 00:39:14,992
Oh, stop the car
a moment, Wesley.

602
00:39:15,065 --> 00:39:16,761
Yoo-hoo!

603
00:39:16,835 --> 00:39:19,737
Yoo-hoo!

604
00:39:24,444 --> 00:39:28,438
Is there something I can do for
you? What did you have in mind?

605
00:39:28,517 --> 00:39:33,353
You were walking on my husband's
prized dahlias. I'm Dr. Chumley's wife.

606
00:39:33,423 --> 00:39:38,260
Oh, Dowd's my name. Elwood
P. Let me give you...

607
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,960
Looking for someone over
there? Yes. My friend Harvey.

608
00:39:42,034 --> 00:39:45,004
I turned my back for an instant
and he seems to have wandered off.

609
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:48,839
I wish you could meet him,
Mrs. Chumley.

610
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,312
I'm sure he'd be quite taken
with you. Oh, thank you!

611
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:56,649
You're very nice to say so. Oh, not at all.

612
00:39:56,721 --> 00:40:01,785
Mrs. Chumley, would you care to come downtown
with me? I'd be happy to buy you a drink.

613
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:05,855
Oh, I can't. My husband and I
are going to a cocktail party.

614
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:08,334
Dr. McClure is giving a party
for his sister from Wichita.

615
00:40:08,403 --> 00:40:11,464
Oh! I didn't know Dr. McClure
had a sister in Wichita.

616
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:13,634
You know Dr. McClure?
No.

617
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:18,171
But you... But are you sure you wouldn't
have time to come with me and have a drink?

618
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,413
No, I can't. I'll tell
you what I'll do, however.

619
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,922
What will you do, however?
I'm interested.

620
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,926
If I meet your friend inside, I'll
be glad to give him a message for you.

621
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:29,828
Would you do that for me? I
certainly would appreciate that.

622
00:40:29,898 --> 00:40:33,232
Just tell him to meet me
downtown if he has no other plans.

623
00:40:33,303 --> 00:40:37,468
Any particular place
downtown? No, he knows where.

624
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:40,841
Harvey knows this town like a book.
How will I recognize your friend?

625
00:40:40,912 --> 00:40:45,283
Oh, you can't miss him,
Mrs. Chumley. He's a "pooka."

626
00:40:45,352 --> 00:40:48,720
A pooka?
Is that something new?

627
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:52,659
No, no. As I understand it,
that's something very old.

628
00:40:52,728 --> 00:40:56,597
But Harvey's not only a pooka,
he's also my best friend.

629
00:40:56,666 --> 00:41:02,163
Oh, if Harvey's said to me once, I'll
bet he's said probably a million times.

630
00:41:02,241 --> 00:41:06,043
He said, "Mr. Dowd,
I would do anything for you."

631
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:07,705
How sweet.

632
00:41:07,781 --> 00:41:11,240
Yeah. He's also very fond
of my sister Veta.

633
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:14,050
But Veta doesn't seem
to care for Harvey.

634
00:41:14,123 --> 00:41:16,490
Don't you think that's rather
too bad, Mrs. Chumley?

635
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,554
I don't know. I gave up long ago
expecting my family to like my friends.

636
00:41:20,632 --> 00:41:23,193
It's useless! We must
keep on trying, mustn't we?

637
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:25,329
Oh, yes.
Well, good-bye.

638
00:41:25,405 --> 00:41:27,237
Good-bye.

639
00:41:27,308 --> 00:41:29,503
Leslie, did he say
"pooka"?

640
00:41:29,577 --> 00:41:33,572
Yes, ma'am.
That's what the man said.

641
00:41:47,935 --> 00:41:50,302
Your pass? Oh! Yes, sir.

642
00:41:50,371 --> 00:41:52,340
There you are.

643
00:41:52,408 --> 00:41:55,173
Dowd.
Elwood P.

644
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:06,287
Isn't that interesting! Yes,
I constructed this myself.

645
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:10,024
Is that so? Well, I'll
declare! It's very simple. See?

646
00:42:14,604 --> 00:42:16,596
Closed.

647
00:42:18,675 --> 00:42:20,701
Opened.

648
00:42:20,778 --> 00:42:23,009
You're a very brilliant man. Thank you.

649
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:26,951
My name is Herman Shimelplatzer,
but everybody calls me Herman.

650
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:31,117
You're to be congratulated,
Mr. Shimelplatzer. Thank you.

651
00:42:31,193 --> 00:42:34,185
Would you care to come over to my
house for dinner tomorrow night?

652
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:36,493
I'm having a few friends in,
just informally.

653
00:42:36,566 --> 00:42:39,559
I certainly would. That's
very nice of you, Mr. Dowd.

654
00:42:39,637 --> 00:42:42,436
Let me give you one
of my cards.

655
00:42:42,507 --> 00:42:44,908
If you should want to call me,
call me at this number.

656
00:42:44,977 --> 00:42:48,846
Don't call me at that one.
That's the old one. Good-bye.

657
00:42:54,923 --> 00:42:57,256
That's remarkable.

658
00:43:00,398 --> 00:43:04,597
I hate to take you away, Willie, but we
did promise Dr. McClure we'd be there early.

659
00:43:04,671 --> 00:43:07,299
One moment, angel. My hat and
coat, Miss Kelly. Yes, Dr. Chumley.

660
00:43:07,373 --> 00:43:10,343
Dr. Sanderson. I'm leaving
for the day. Yes, Doctor?

661
00:43:10,411 --> 00:43:14,713
About the difficulty of this woman with the
big white rabbit. Has it been smoothed over?

662
00:43:14,784 --> 00:43:16,581
Yes, Doctor.
Good.

663
00:43:16,652 --> 00:43:21,091
I've had many patients out here with
animals, but never an animal that large.

664
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:25,426
Yes, Doctor. She called him
Harvey. Unusual name for an animal.

665
00:43:25,497 --> 00:43:29,196
I want her to have a hypo at
6:00, with another one at 9:00.

666
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:32,900
Willie... Yes, I'm
coming. My formula 9-7-7.

667
00:43:32,974 --> 00:43:34,874
Listen, Willie...

668
00:43:34,943 --> 00:43:38,506
Somebody's gonna have to give me a hand
with that Simmons dame. She's terrible!

669
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:41,076
I had to take her corset off
all by myself!

670
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:43,577
Hiya, Dr. Chumley.
How's every little...

671
00:43:43,647 --> 00:43:45,946
Hey, what's with you and that hat? Hat?

672
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:48,282
Here's your hat.
I'm wearing my hat.

673
00:43:48,353 --> 00:43:51,482
There was something... This
isn't my hat. Must be yours.

674
00:43:51,558 --> 00:43:54,221
No, mine is... Of course it's not yours.

675
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:56,958
I'd like to say... No, dear,
of course it's not yours.

676
00:43:57,032 --> 00:43:58,966
But whose hat is it?
He won't let me talk.

677
00:43:59,034 --> 00:44:01,003
Look at this!

678
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:05,702
Two holes cut in the crown.
It's probably some new fad.

679
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:07,802
Perhaps Mr. Dowd left it here, sir. Dowd?

680
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:11,145
Yes, that's what I was... That's Mrs.
Simmons' brother. I gave him a pass.

681
00:44:11,217 --> 00:44:15,918
I've been trying to tell you. I met a
gentleman at the gate. His name was Dowd.

682
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:18,858
He said he was looking for
a friend of his named Harvey.

683
00:44:18,927 --> 00:44:21,590
Harvey?
Yes! Yes, Harvey.

684
00:44:21,664 --> 00:44:25,999
Holy smoke! I left the water running
on that Simmons dame in a hydro tub!

685
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:30,509
Why are you looking at me like that,
Willie? He was a nice, polite man.

686
00:44:30,576 --> 00:44:33,637
He said his friend was a
pooka. Whatever that is.

687
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:35,739
Gimme Upper West "R."

688
00:44:35,816 --> 00:44:38,945
Where did he go, Mrs.
Chumley? He went downtown.

689
00:44:39,021 --> 00:44:42,047
Dunphy, I left that
Simmons dame soakin' in 13.

690
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:44,184
Do me a favor.
Turn off thejuice.

691
00:44:44,261 --> 00:44:46,457
So you gave him a pass!

692
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,228
Perhaps they neglected to tell you at
medical school that a rabbit has pointed ears!

693
00:44:50,302 --> 00:44:52,237
Do you know what
you've done?

694
00:44:52,305 --> 00:44:56,140
You've allowed a psychopathic case to
roam around with an overgrown white rabbit!

695
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,179
You've laid me open
to a lawsuit!

696
00:44:58,246 --> 00:45:00,715
I shall have to do something
I haven't done for 15 years.

697
00:45:00,783 --> 00:45:02,978
I'll have to go after this
man, Dowd, and bring him back!

698
00:45:03,052 --> 00:45:07,650
But when I do, Dr. Sanderson, your connection
with this institution will have ended.

699
00:45:07,725 --> 00:45:11,560
Wilson, get the car. You'll have
to go to the McClure's without me.

700
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,691
Take a cab. You two, get
that woman out of the tub!

701
00:45:14,768 --> 00:45:18,005
Willie? I'm going to call my attorney.

702
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,369
Willie? I'm going to call my attorney.

703
00:45:18,439 --> 00:45:21,432
Wilson, what's a pooka? What's a what?

704
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,071
A pooka.
A pooka?

705
00:45:24,147 --> 00:45:26,673
You could search me,
Mrs. Chumley!

706
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:36,823
"P." "O."

707
00:45:36,898 --> 00:45:39,423
Poo... Pooka!

708
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,561
Oh dear, I'm already late
for the McClure's.

709
00:45:42,638 --> 00:45:45,938
I did promise them
I'd be on time.

710
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:54,446
P-O-O-K-A.

711
00:45:55,856 --> 00:46:01,660
"Pooka.
From old Celtic mythology.

712
00:46:01,731 --> 00:46:05,395
"A fairy spirit
in animal form.

713
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:08,098
"Always very large.

714
00:46:08,172 --> 00:46:11,609
"The pooka appears
here and there,

715
00:46:11,677 --> 00:46:13,839
"now and then,

716
00:46:13,913 --> 00:46:17,714
"to this one and that one.

717
00:46:17,785 --> 00:46:22,086
"A benign but
mischievous creature.

718
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:26,459
"Very fond of rumpots,
crackpots...

719
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:30,092
and 'How are you,
Mr. Wilson?"'

720
00:46:43,152 --> 00:46:45,348
"How are you,
Mr. Wilson?"

721
00:46:45,422 --> 00:46:48,017
Who in the encyclopedia
wants to know?

722
00:46:48,092 --> 00:46:51,426
Wilson, let's go. Dr. Chumley,
the screwiest thing just hap...

723
00:46:51,496 --> 00:46:54,955
I know, and believe me, heads
will roll. But I was looking...

724
00:46:56,904 --> 00:46:59,772
Quick, downtown.
Step on it.

725
00:47:14,093 --> 00:47:16,289
Oh. Where's your mother? Where is she?

726
00:47:16,362 --> 00:47:19,355
She took Uncle Elwood out to the
sanitarium. I thought you knew.

727
00:47:19,433 --> 00:47:22,096
She just called me on the phone
at the club. She's hysterical.

728
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:25,572
Where's your phone? In the library.
What was Mother hysterical about?

729
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:27,803
I don't know. I couldn't make
out what she was talking about.

730
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:31,007
She was carrying on something fierce.
Where's the number of that sanitarium?

731
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:33,325
I'll look it up. I don't know
what Mother had to carry on about.

732
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:36,293
All she had to do was have Uncle
Elwood locked up. Maybe that's it.

733
00:47:36,363 --> 00:47:40,357
I feel bad about havin' Elwood
locked up. I always liked that boy.

734
00:47:40,435 --> 00:47:43,997
He could've done anything, been anything,
made a place for himself in the community.

735
00:47:44,073 --> 00:47:46,565
And all he did was get a
big rabbit. Yeah, I know.

736
00:47:46,643 --> 00:47:50,877
He's had that rabbit in my office many
a time. I'm old, but I don't miss much.

737
00:47:50,949 --> 00:47:54,147
What's the name of this place?
Chumley's what? Chumley's Rest.

738
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:57,850
Yeah, Elwood had everything.
Brains, personality and friends.

739
00:47:57,925 --> 00:48:00,451
Men liked him. Women
liked him. I liked him!

740
00:48:00,528 --> 00:48:03,623
Women liked him?
Uncle Elwood? Mother!

741
00:48:03,699 --> 00:48:06,726
Myrtle!
Veta Louise!

742
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:10,262
What's wrong, girl? I thought
I'd never see either of you again.

743
00:48:10,341 --> 00:48:13,470
Take hold of her. She looks like
she's going to faint. Not so fast.

744
00:48:13,545 --> 00:48:17,038
Don't rush her. Ease her in.
Get me where I can sit down.

745
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:19,985
There you are. Get her some
tea. Let me sit down somewhere.

746
00:48:20,054 --> 00:48:23,889
You want some tea? Oh,
no. I don't want any tea.

747
00:48:23,959 --> 00:48:27,795
The minute their backs were turned,
I ran like a frightened rabbit.

748
00:48:27,865 --> 00:48:32,098
Oh, I didn't mean to say that!
I don't know what I'm saying.

749
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:35,629
Just let me sit here. Let me get
my breath. Let her get her breath.

750
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:41,205
Let me get my breath and then let me get
upstairs to my own bed where I can let go.

751
00:48:41,282 --> 00:48:43,444
Mother,
what happened?

752
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,752
I want you to sue them. They
put me in and let Elwood out.

753
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:52,354
What's this? As I was going to the
taxi cab to get Elwood's things,

754
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:56,959
this awful man stepped out, he
was a white slaver, I know he was.

755
00:48:57,036 --> 00:49:00,268
He was wearing one of those white
suits. That's how they advertise.

756
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:05,507
What did he do? He grabbed hold of
me and took me in there, and he...

757
00:49:05,581 --> 00:49:07,709
Oh!

758
00:49:07,784 --> 00:49:12,154
Go on, Veta. Go on,
Mother. Was he a young man?

759
00:49:12,223 --> 00:49:15,250
Myrtle Mae, perhaps you'd better
leave the room. Now? I should say not.

760
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,694
Go on, Mother.
What'd he do, Veta?

761
00:49:17,764 --> 00:49:22,362
He took me upstairs
and tore my clothes off.

762
00:49:22,437 --> 00:49:25,031
Did you hear that?
Go on, Mother.

763
00:49:25,106 --> 00:49:28,407
And then he dumped me
down in a tub of water.

764
00:49:28,478 --> 00:49:31,676
Oh, for heaven's sake! By
Godfrey, I'll sue them for this!

765
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:34,913
I always thought that what
you were showed in your face.

766
00:49:34,987 --> 00:49:37,548
Don't you believe it, Judge,
Myrtle Mae.

767
00:49:37,624 --> 00:49:41,584
That man grabbed hold of me as
though I was a woman of the streets.

768
00:49:41,662 --> 00:49:45,030
But I fought. I always said that
if a man jumped at me, I'd fight.

769
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,194
Haven't I always said that,
Myrtle Mae?

770
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:50,240
She's always said that. That's
what Mother's always told me to do.

771
00:49:50,307 --> 00:49:54,711
He hustled me into the sanitarium
and dumped me in that tub of water...

772
00:49:54,779 --> 00:49:57,078
and treated me as though I was a... A what?

773
00:49:57,149 --> 00:50:00,586
A crazy woman. But he
did that just for spite.

774
00:50:00,654 --> 00:50:03,385
Well, I'll be swizzled!
Then one of those doctors...

775
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,485
came upstairs and asked me
a lot of questions.

776
00:50:06,562 --> 00:50:09,930
All about sex urges
and all that filthy stuff.

777
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,265
That place ought to be
cleaned up, Judge.

778
00:50:12,336 --> 00:50:14,897
You ought to get the authorities
to clean it up.

779
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:17,909
Don't you ever go out there.
You hear me, Myrtle Mae?

780
00:50:17,977 --> 00:50:21,175
This stinks to high heaven.
By Godfrey, it stinks!

781
00:50:21,248 --> 00:50:26,415
Is that all those doctors do in
places like that, think about sex?

782
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:29,982
I don't know. Because if it is, they
ought to be ashamed of themselves.

783
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,085
It's all
in their heads anyway.

784
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:36,032
Why don't they take long
walks in the fresh air?

785
00:50:36,101 --> 00:50:39,697
Judge Gaffney walked everywhere
for years, didn't you, Judge?

786
00:50:39,773 --> 00:50:43,835
Did you? I better take some notes on this.

787
00:50:43,911 --> 00:50:47,177
You said one of the doctors
came up to talk to you?

788
00:50:47,249 --> 00:50:51,153
Yes. Dr. Sanderson. But don't pay
any attention to anything he says.

789
00:50:51,221 --> 00:50:54,851
He's a liar. Close-set
eyes. They're always liars.

790
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:59,455
Besides, I told him something in
strictest confidence and he blabbed it.

791
00:50:59,532 --> 00:51:01,558
You can't trust anyone!

792
00:51:01,635 --> 00:51:05,072
What did you tell him? What
difference does it make?

793
00:51:05,139 --> 00:51:10,579
I don't want to think about it.
I don't want to talk about it.

794
00:51:10,647 --> 00:51:13,947
Anything you told Dr. Sanderson,
you can tell us.

795
00:51:14,018 --> 00:51:17,580
This is your daughter, and I'm
your lawyer. I know which is which.

796
00:51:17,656 --> 00:51:20,217
I don't want to talk about
it. I want to sue them.

797
00:51:20,293 --> 00:51:24,595
And I want to get upstairs
to my own bed.

798
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:27,329
I should never have tried
to do anything about Elwood.

799
00:51:27,403 --> 00:51:30,532
Something protects him.
That awful pooka.

800
00:51:30,607 --> 00:51:34,510
Where is Uncle Elwood? How
should I know? They let him go!

801
00:51:34,579 --> 00:51:37,242
They're not interested
in men at places like that.

802
00:51:37,316 --> 00:51:40,650
You ought to know that,
Myrtle Mae. Don't be so naive.

803
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,851
Mother, no matter who jumped at you, we still
have to find Uncle Elwood and lock him up.

804
00:51:44,925 --> 00:51:47,087
The next time,
you take him, Judge.

805
00:51:47,162 --> 00:51:51,498
Oh, wait 'til Elwood hears what they
did to me. He won't stand for it.

806
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,763
You've got to sue them.

807
00:51:53,837 --> 00:51:57,605
Myrtle Mae, I hope that
never, as long as you live,

808
00:51:57,676 --> 00:52:02,307
a man tears the clothes off you
and sets you down in a tub of water.

809
00:52:02,382 --> 00:52:07,321
Oh, there he is now! He's
after me! Stay where you are!

810
00:52:07,389 --> 00:52:10,826
Knock him down, Judge. Kick
him! Don't let him get me!

811
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,989
Veta, please. I want you to
confront this man with your charges.

812
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:17,364
I don't want no part of that wacky dame.
I'm looking for that other screwball.

813
00:52:17,436 --> 00:52:19,962
He's gotta go back to
Chumley's Rest. Kick him, Judge!

814
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:22,201
Veta, did you hear that?

815
00:52:22,276 --> 00:52:26,407
Where is he? Where is
this guy, Elwood P. Dowd?

816
00:52:26,481 --> 00:52:29,144
That screwball
with a rabbit.

817
00:52:29,218 --> 00:52:32,313
What's the matter, you goofy too?
You a member of this cockeyed family?

818
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:35,621
I'm Mrs. Simmons' daughter.
Uncle Elwood is my uncle.

819
00:52:35,693 --> 00:52:39,562
Look, kid, I've been to four fires and
14 gin mills lookin' for that crackpot.

820
00:52:39,631 --> 00:52:42,294
A bartender give me a tip he
was here. Came with a bundle.

821
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:44,735
Now, where is he? What'd you
do with him? You hidin' him?

822
00:52:44,805 --> 00:52:47,536
No...
I'm not hiding him.

823
00:52:47,609 --> 00:52:50,579
Hey, my name's Marvin
Wilson, honey. What's yours?

824
00:52:50,646 --> 00:52:53,616
Myrtle Mae. And I'm not
afraid of you. Myrtle Mae, huh?

825
00:52:53,684 --> 00:52:57,553
If we grab your uncle, you'll be comin'
to the sanitarium on visitin' days.

826
00:52:57,622 --> 00:53:00,387
Really, I don't know.
If you do, I'll be there.

827
00:53:00,459 --> 00:53:04,921
You will? If you don't see me right
away, stick around. I'll show up.

828
00:53:04,999 --> 00:53:07,024
Won't you sit down?
I got no time, kid.

829
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:10,196
I gotta find that uncle of yours
and be on my way. Now, where is he?

830
00:53:10,272 --> 00:53:12,741
Where'd you put him? I
didn't put him anywhere.

831
00:53:12,809 --> 00:53:15,278
I want you to catch him just as
much as you want to catch him.

832
00:53:15,346 --> 00:53:17,679
I can't even have any callers
when he's around.

833
00:53:17,749 --> 00:53:21,618
You shouldn't have any trouble about
callers, honey. Thank you very much.

834
00:53:21,687 --> 00:53:23,451
I'll tell you something, Myrt. Yeah?

835
00:53:23,524 --> 00:53:26,358
You not only got a nice build,
but you got something else too.

836
00:53:26,427 --> 00:53:28,088
Really? What?

837
00:53:28,162 --> 00:53:31,861
You got the screwiest uncle that ever
stuck his puss inside our nuthouse.

838
00:53:31,935 --> 00:53:34,802
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

839
00:53:34,872 --> 00:53:37,534
I can't, kid. Dr. Chumley's
checking all the police stations.

840
00:53:37,608 --> 00:53:42,377
I better catch up with him. You look
awfully hungry. How about a sandwich?

841
00:53:42,448 --> 00:53:45,213
Yeah, but I don't want that crazy dame
on my neck. Don't worry about Mother.

842
00:53:45,286 --> 00:53:47,585
She won't come down.
She's too frightened.

843
00:53:47,656 --> 00:53:51,320
Would you like a ham and rye?
How about an egg and onion?

844
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:54,796
I'd love to make you one. The eggs
and onions are waiting in the kitchen.

845
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:58,029
Suppose we go in the kitchen.
You can relax and be yourself.

846
00:53:58,102 --> 00:54:00,867
Do you like your work?
Oh, I do now, Myrtle!

847
00:54:35,645 --> 00:54:38,946
Charlie's Place?
Oh, Mr. Cracker.

848
00:54:39,017 --> 00:54:42,681
Mr. Cracker, this is
Elwood P. Dowd speaking.

849
00:54:42,755 --> 00:54:46,749
Tell me,
have you seen Harvey?

850
00:54:46,827 --> 00:54:50,025
Uh-huh. Well, don't worry. I'll find him.

851
00:54:50,098 --> 00:54:54,298
Mr. Cracker, I'm entertaining some
friends there tonight at 10:00.

852
00:54:54,371 --> 00:54:57,273
May I have
my regular booth?

853
00:54:57,342 --> 00:55:00,312
Oh, fine. Thank you.
Good-bye.

854
00:55:36,226 --> 00:55:38,161
Harvey!

855
00:55:39,363 --> 00:55:41,025
Harvey?

856
00:55:43,503 --> 00:55:45,061
Hello?

857
00:55:45,138 --> 00:55:47,937
Come on. Don't you wanna come back
in the kitchen and get acquainted?

858
00:55:48,008 --> 00:55:50,978
I thought I heard voices.
What kind of voices?

859
00:55:51,046 --> 00:55:55,109
Come on, I wanna talk to you. It
sounded something like "Harvey."

860
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:59,020
Harvey? I'd better get goin'. You
haven't finished your egg and onion.

861
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:02,458
Business before pleasure, even
if it's a pleasure bein' with you.

862
00:56:02,528 --> 00:56:05,930
You make a great egg and
onion. Don't you want more?

863
00:56:05,999 --> 00:56:09,993
I'll see you tomorrow out at the
nuthouse. You didn't finish your sandwich.

864
00:56:10,071 --> 00:56:13,007
Wilson! What happened to
you? He's not here, Doctor.

865
00:56:13,075 --> 00:56:15,101
Then what are you doing
here? I was just having...

866
00:56:15,178 --> 00:56:17,409
What are you eating? An
egg and onion sandwich.

867
00:56:17,481 --> 00:56:20,542
How can you think of food at a time
like this? Get over to Union Station.

868
00:56:20,618 --> 00:56:23,884
I'm told Dowd goes down there to
watch trains. All right, Doctor.

869
00:56:23,956 --> 00:56:27,256
Why did you send him away? Some
people pick the best times...

870
00:56:27,327 --> 00:56:31,561
to keep other people from becoming
acquainted. My, dear... Judge Gaffney!

871
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:33,396
Chumley, just the man
I want to see.

872
00:56:33,469 --> 00:56:36,928
Mrs. Simmons has retained me to file
suit against you. I've been searching...

873
00:56:37,006 --> 00:56:40,101
File suit? I'm on my way to the
office to draw up the necessary papers.

874
00:56:40,177 --> 00:56:43,808
What happened this afternoon was an unfortunate
mistake, but I've dismissed my assistant...

875
00:56:43,883 --> 00:56:46,283
We shall see what we shall
see. There must be some way...

876
00:56:46,352 --> 00:56:50,290
You'll hear from me in the morning.
Good-bye. But surely, Judge...

877
00:56:50,358 --> 00:56:53,021
This is
most unfortunate.

878
00:56:53,095 --> 00:56:56,429
Most unfortunate.
Judge Gaffney?

879
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,629
Judge Gaffney, I want...
You're not Judge Gaffney.

880
00:56:59,704 --> 00:57:01,969
You have much more hair
than he has.

881
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,770
Besides, I never forget
a face. I'm Dr. Chumley.

882
00:57:04,843 --> 00:57:08,576
You're Mrs. Simmons. Yes, of course.
I'm glad to know you, Dr. Chumley.

883
00:57:08,649 --> 00:57:12,746
Would you mind asking Judge
Gaffney to come back? Certainly.

884
00:57:12,821 --> 00:57:18,090
I want to tell him to sue you for $
100,000. I don't think $50,000 is enough.

885
00:57:18,162 --> 00:57:20,757
Mrs. Simmons,
can't we talk this matter over?

886
00:57:20,832 --> 00:57:25,031
After what happened to me today in the
bathtub? I don't want to talk it over!

887
00:57:25,104 --> 00:57:27,039
Then will you please
just listen?

888
00:57:27,107 --> 00:57:29,542
I don't want to listen to you.
I'm suing you.

889
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:32,808
Please listen to me, I beg of
you. I'll listen, all right.

890
00:57:32,881 --> 00:57:36,841
But I'm warning you, it
won't do you any good. Hello.

891
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,689
No, I am not listening to my radio.
I am listening to Dr. Chumley.

892
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,730
Mrs. Simmons, that picture
over the mantle?

893
00:57:44,797 --> 00:57:49,235
That portrait of my mother happens
to be the pride of this house.

894
00:57:49,303 --> 00:57:52,569
Who painted it? Some
man. I forget his name.

895
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,804
He was around for the sittings.
Then we paid him and he went away.

896
00:57:55,878 --> 00:57:58,848
I suppose if you have the money, you
can persuade people to do anything.

897
00:57:58,915 --> 00:58:03,183
You brought this up. You might
as well learn something quickly.

898
00:58:03,255 --> 00:58:06,623
I took a course in art last winter.
I learned the difference between...

899
00:58:06,693 --> 00:58:10,994
a fine oil painting and a
mechanical thing, like a photograph.

900
00:58:11,065 --> 00:58:13,534
The photograph shows
only the reality.

901
00:58:13,602 --> 00:58:18,769
The painting shows not only the
reality, but the dream behind it.

902
00:58:18,842 --> 00:58:21,778
It's our dreams
that carry us on.

903
00:58:21,846 --> 00:58:24,441
They separate us
from the beasts.

904
00:58:24,517 --> 00:58:28,477
I wouldn't want to go on living if I
thought it was all just eating and sleeping.

905
00:58:28,555 --> 00:58:32,083
And taking my clothes off.
I mean, putting them on.

906
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:35,288
Ooh, ooh!
Oh, Doctor!

907
00:58:35,364 --> 00:58:37,925
Mrs. Simmons, steady now,
steady. Don't upset yourself.

908
00:58:38,001 --> 00:58:41,233
Everything's going to be
all right. What's the matter?

909
00:58:41,305 --> 00:58:44,036
Doctor, that is not
my mother!

910
00:58:44,109 --> 00:58:46,340
I'm very glad
to hear that.

911
00:58:46,412 --> 00:58:50,611
Elwood's been here. He's been here,
Doctor! Now, now, better be quiet.

912
00:58:50,684 --> 00:58:53,552
I'll take it.

913
00:58:53,621 --> 00:58:57,183
Hello? Yes?
Who's calling?

914
00:58:57,259 --> 00:58:59,854
He's here! It's your
brother! Let me talk to him.

915
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:03,025
Be careful. Don't let him
know that I'm here. Be casual.

916
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,626
Yes, I'll be casual.
Yes.

917
00:59:05,704 --> 00:59:08,572
Hello, Elwood.
Where are you, dear?

918
00:59:08,641 --> 00:59:12,134
I'm here, Veta.
l-ls Harvey there?

919
00:59:12,212 --> 00:59:16,548
He won't say where he is. He
wants to know if Harvey's here.

920
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:19,214
Tell him Harvey is here. But he isn't!

921
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:23,784
I know that, but pretend he
is. We've got to humor him.

922
00:59:23,861 --> 00:59:26,797
Hello, Elwood.
Yes, dear, Harvey's here.

923
00:59:26,865 --> 00:59:29,061
Why don't you come home?

924
00:59:30,503 --> 00:59:34,031
It won't work. He wants us
to call Harvey to the telephone.

925
00:59:34,109 --> 00:59:38,570
Well, say Harvey's here but he can't come
to the phone because he's in the bathtub.

926
00:59:38,648 --> 00:59:42,881
Oh, Doctor! You've got
to do it, Mrs. Simmons.

927
00:59:42,953 --> 00:59:48,359
Yes, dear, Harvey is here, but he can't
come to the telephone. He's in the bathtub.

928
00:59:48,427 --> 00:59:52,159
I'll send him over as soon as
he's dry. Where are you, dear?

929
00:59:52,232 --> 00:59:54,167
I-I-I'm...

930
00:59:54,235 --> 00:59:58,002
Never mind. Harvey just
walked in the door down here.

931
00:59:58,073 --> 01:00:02,205
Oh... Mr. Cracker,
two martinis.

932
01:00:02,279 --> 01:00:04,213
Good-bye, Veta.

933
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:08,219
You'd better look in the
bathtub. It must be a stranger.

934
01:00:08,287 --> 01:00:11,917
He says Harvey just walked through the
door. It must be a stranger in the bathtub.

935
01:00:11,992 --> 01:00:14,860
But I know where he is.
He's at Charlie's Place.

936
01:00:14,929 --> 01:00:19,060
That's a bar at 12th and Main.
That's two over and one down.

937
01:00:19,135 --> 01:00:22,196
Where are you going? I'm going to
get your brother and bring him back,

938
01:00:22,272 --> 01:00:24,241
take him to the sanitarium
where he belongs.

939
01:00:24,308 --> 01:00:26,675
I want to observe the expression on
his face when he talks to this rabbit.

940
01:00:26,745 --> 01:00:29,271
He does talk to the rabbit?
They tell each other everything.

941
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:32,979
What? Yes, he talks to
him, but don't go out there.

942
01:00:33,054 --> 01:00:36,582
You'll regret it if you do.
Nonsense. You underestimate me

943
01:00:36,658 --> 01:00:40,220
No, you underestimate my brother.
Don't worry. I can handle him.

944
01:00:40,296 --> 01:00:43,824
You can handle him?
That's what you think.

945
01:00:43,901 --> 01:00:48,670
Myrtle Mae, see who the
stranger is in the bathtub.

946
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,083
Sounds funny,
but I'll miss this place.

947
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:06,062
I guess I'll miss
a lot of things around here.

948
01:01:06,131 --> 01:01:08,099
You will?

949
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:11,136
You won't laugh?
Of course not.

950
01:01:11,204 --> 01:01:14,549
You know how it is working around people
day after day. You get attached to them.

951
01:01:14,684 --> 01:01:18,416
I know, Lyman. It may be
ridiculous, but I'm gonna miss...

952
01:01:18,489 --> 01:01:22,153
every one of the psychos and
neuros and schizos in the place.

953
01:01:22,227 --> 01:01:24,162
I guess I'll even miss
Dr. Chumley.

954
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:27,064
In spite of the fact that he fired me,
I have a genuine admiration for him.

955
01:01:27,134 --> 01:01:29,933
You can miss your psychos
and schizos, Dr. Sanderson!

956
01:01:30,004 --> 01:01:33,236
You can miss whomever you
please. But after you leave here,

957
01:01:33,309 --> 01:01:36,177
I won't miss a thing,
not a single, solitary thing!

958
01:01:36,246 --> 01:01:39,512
Now what's wrong? Nothing. I
came down to say good-bye to you.

959
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:41,847
So good-bye, good luck
and good riddance!

960
01:01:41,919 --> 01:01:44,787
You can't even say good-bye without
putting it on a personal basis.

961
01:01:44,856 --> 01:01:47,519
Don't flatter yourself. There's
nothing personal about this.

962
01:01:47,593 --> 01:01:49,824
I think you've been working too
hard. You're getting neurotic.

963
01:01:49,897 --> 01:01:53,265
Don't start analyzing me. Save
your psychiatry for your next job!

964
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:57,273
I'm not using psychiatry. And let
me give you a little friendly advice.

965
01:01:57,341 --> 01:02:01,278
That chip on your shoulder stems from a
persecution complex that goes back to childhood.

966
01:02:01,346 --> 01:02:03,645
Thanks so much for
the case history, Doctor.

967
01:02:03,716 --> 01:02:07,778
Could you tell me what an overinflated
ego stems from? Now, listen here!

968
01:02:07,854 --> 01:02:10,824
Hiya, Kelly.
Hiya, Doc.

969
01:02:10,891 --> 01:02:13,053
I'm glad I caught you
before you left.

970
01:02:13,128 --> 01:02:17,293
I'm sorry you got bounced. We're
all gonna miss ya. Thanks, Wilson.

971
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:20,201
Any of the patients been acting
up? Everything's just peachy!

972
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:22,762
That's good. When are
you takin' off? Right now.

973
01:02:22,841 --> 01:02:25,208
I was waiting
for Dr. Chumley to get back.

974
01:02:25,277 --> 01:02:29,112
Wait a second. Didn't Dr. Chumley
come back with that pyscho?

975
01:02:29,182 --> 01:02:32,812
We thought he was with you. No.
I left him with that Simmons dame.

976
01:02:32,887 --> 01:02:37,724
When I called back later to check with him,
she told me the Doctor went to bring her bro...

977
01:02:37,794 --> 01:02:40,787
That was four hours ago! Have
you any idea where he went?

978
01:02:40,865 --> 01:02:42,891
Yeah. No!
Come on, come on.

979
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:47,463
I don't know. I can't think. Poor Dr. Chumley
may be layin' in an alley in a pool of blood.

980
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,805
Mr. Dowd seemed harmless
this afternoon.

981
01:02:49,877 --> 01:02:53,006
I've been wrestling these guys for
years, and they're pretty tricky.

982
01:02:53,081 --> 01:02:55,744
One minute they're sweet, and the
next minute... they give you the knife.

983
01:02:55,818 --> 01:02:59,220
The name of the place? It was
a barroom and a guy's name.

984
01:02:59,289 --> 01:03:02,384
Charlie! Charlie's Place.
That's a lead. We'll start there.

985
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,157
Never mind. I'll go with
Wilson. You needn't bother.

986
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:08,029
Until Dr. Chumley comes back,
I'm still in charge here!

987
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:11,162
Let's get goin'. Let's not
stand and argue about it.

988
01:03:38,007 --> 01:03:40,168
Yeah,
this is the place.

989
01:03:46,218 --> 01:03:49,382
What'll it be, folks? We're
looking for someone, two men.

990
01:03:49,455 --> 01:03:53,791
A tall, short one and a thin, fat one. I'm
so nervous, I don't know what I'm sayin'.

991
01:03:53,862 --> 01:03:56,559
One man is short and middle-aged.
The other is much taller and younger.

992
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:59,431
They might have been here about
four hours ago. No, can't say I have.

993
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,562
We've been running
medium sizes all evenin'.

994
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:04,574
The tall man was soft-spoken and
sort of polite. His name is Dowd.

995
01:04:04,642 --> 01:04:07,976
Dowd? Why didn't you say so?
He's here now in the back booth.

996
01:04:11,084 --> 01:04:13,918
Is he alone? Well, there's
two schools of thought, sir.

997
01:04:13,988 --> 01:04:17,117
If that crackpot did anything to
Dr. Chumley, I'll knock his teeth...

998
01:04:17,192 --> 01:04:19,525
No rough stuff. Psychology.
I'll do the talking.

999
01:04:19,595 --> 01:04:22,394
Well, I've been expecting
you. Where's the Doctor?

1000
01:04:22,466 --> 01:04:26,632
Wilson! Why don't you
take a look around the place?

1001
01:04:26,705 --> 01:04:31,006
Why don't you do that? Although
I don't believe it's for sale.

1002
01:04:31,077 --> 01:04:34,775
Miss Kelly,
these are for you.

1003
01:04:34,849 --> 01:04:38,217
Why, thank you, Mr.
Dowd! A pleasure, my dear.

1004
01:04:38,287 --> 01:04:43,522
You know, after what happened this afternoon,
these flowers really should be from you.

1005
01:04:43,594 --> 01:04:46,894
Now, won't you join me? Mr.
Dowd, I'm afraid we can't do that.

1006
01:04:46,965 --> 01:04:50,402
The situation has changed since this
afternoon, but I urge you to have no resentment.

1007
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:53,907
Dr. Chumley is your friend and he only
wants to help you. Isn't that nice!

1008
01:04:53,975 --> 01:04:57,503
I'd be glad to help him. We all must
face reality, Dowd, sooner or later.

1009
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:02,314
Uh-huh. Well, I wrestled with
reality for 35 years, Doctor.

1010
01:05:02,385 --> 01:05:05,913
And I'm happy to state
I finally won out over it.

1011
01:05:05,991 --> 01:05:08,016
Mr. Dowd,
where is Dr. Chumley?

1012
01:05:08,093 --> 01:05:11,063
Not knowing, I cannot say. Wish I could.

1013
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:15,091
Miss Kelly, I don't like to see
you standing. Sit down, Kelly.

1014
01:05:16,938 --> 01:05:20,932
There we are. Now, let's all have a drink.

1015
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:23,309
Dr. Chumley did come in here
to get you earlier this evening?

1016
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:26,009
Yes, he did. And I was
delighted to see him.

1017
01:05:26,084 --> 01:05:28,679
What'll it be, Mr. Dowd? Martinis?

1018
01:05:28,754 --> 01:05:33,625
- But that was four hours ago.
- Where has the evening gone?

1019
01:05:33,694 --> 01:05:38,496
Four... Three martinis, Mr. Cracker.

1020
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:41,059
I've looked all over this joint. There's
no sign of the Doctor. What'd you do to him?

1021
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:43,129
We're trying to find out.
What happened then?

1022
01:05:43,207 --> 01:05:48,043
I introduced Harvey to the
Doctor, and he sat down with us.

1023
01:05:48,113 --> 01:05:50,139
Harvey was sitting here,

1024
01:05:50,216 --> 01:05:54,381
and the Doctor sat opposite
Harvey so he could look at him.

1025
01:05:54,454 --> 01:05:57,515
Who's Harvey? A white
rabbit, six feet tall.

1026
01:05:57,592 --> 01:06:01,655
- Six feet?
- Six feet, three and a half inches. Let's stick to facts.

1027
01:06:01,731 --> 01:06:04,200
What happened after you
introduced Dr. Chumley to Harvey?

1028
01:06:04,268 --> 01:06:07,067
Harvey suggested that
I buy him a drink.

1029
01:06:07,139 --> 01:06:10,906
Knowing that he doesn't like to drink alone,
I suggested to Dr. Chumley we join him.

1030
01:06:10,977 --> 01:06:12,672
We joined him.

1031
01:06:12,745 --> 01:06:14,407
Go on.
Wejoined him again.

1032
01:06:14,481 --> 01:06:18,043
- Then what?
- Then the other matter came up.

1033
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:20,418
Now we're gettin' somewhere.
What other matter?

1034
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:24,358
Eh... Mr. Wilson, I don't
like to see you standing.

1035
01:06:24,428 --> 01:06:26,624
Wouldn't you join us here? Who, me?

1036
01:06:26,698 --> 01:06:29,634
Sit down, will you, Wilson? Sit right down.

1037
01:06:29,702 --> 01:06:32,035
You say this other matter
came up, Mr. Dowd.

1038
01:06:32,105 --> 01:06:36,202
Yes. There was a beautiful blonde
woman name of Mrs. Smethills...

1039
01:06:36,277 --> 01:06:40,112
and her escort seated in the
booth directly across from us.

1040
01:06:40,182 --> 01:06:44,280
Dr. Chumley went over to sit
next to her, explaining to her...

1041
01:06:44,354 --> 01:06:48,587
that they had once met...
in Chicago.

1042
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:52,153
Then her escort
escorted Dr. Chumley...

1043
01:06:52,231 --> 01:06:54,792
back here
to Harvey and me,

1044
01:06:54,868 --> 01:06:57,997
and tried to point out that it
would be better for Dr. Chumley...

1045
01:06:58,072 --> 01:07:00,667
to mind
his own affairs.

1046
01:07:00,743 --> 01:07:02,712
Does he have any? Does he have any what?

1047
01:07:02,779 --> 01:07:05,715
Any affairs? How would I know? Shut up!

1048
01:07:05,783 --> 01:07:10,483
Go on, Mr. Dowd. Well...
Thank you, Mr. Cracker.

1049
01:07:10,555 --> 01:07:15,893
Mrs. Smethills' escort seemed to get more
depressed as he kept looking at Dr. Chumley.

1050
01:07:15,963 --> 01:07:19,229
So Harvey and I felt we should
take the Doctor somewhere else.

1051
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,270
Harvey suggested
Blondie's Chicken Inn,

1052
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:24,671
but the Doctor
wanted to go to Eddie's.

1053
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:28,723
And while they were arguing about it, I
went up to the bar to order another drink.

1054
01:07:28,857 --> 01:07:31,156
When I came back here,
they were gone.

1055
01:07:31,227 --> 01:07:35,130
You don't believe that story about the
Doctor talking to a big white rabbit, do you?

1056
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,566
Why not?
Harvey was here.

1057
01:07:37,635 --> 01:07:41,128
At first Dr. Chumley seemed
frightened of Harvey,

1058
01:07:41,207 --> 01:07:44,838
but that gave way to admiration
as the evening wore on.

1059
01:07:46,614 --> 01:07:48,776
"The evening wore on."

1060
01:07:48,851 --> 01:07:51,377
That's a very nice expression, isn't it?

1061
01:07:51,454 --> 01:07:54,982
With your permission,
I'll say it again.

1062
01:07:55,059 --> 01:07:57,187
"The evening wore on."

1063
01:07:57,262 --> 01:08:00,562
And with your permission
I'm gonna knock your brains out.

1064
01:08:00,633 --> 01:08:04,331
Look, you did something to Dr. Chumley,
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

1065
01:08:04,404 --> 01:08:08,102
Stop! Lyman! Wilson!
For heaven's sake!

1066
01:08:15,953 --> 01:08:17,888
Get outside!
Mr. Cracker?

1067
01:08:17,956 --> 01:08:21,984
Sure, Mr. Dowd. Mr. Cracker,
may I intercede for my friends?

1068
01:08:22,061 --> 01:08:26,328
Youth and high spirits. Time will
take care of that. Sure, Mr. Dowd.

1069
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,733
Okay, boys,
let 'em go.

1070
01:08:28,803 --> 01:08:33,208
If Mr. Dowd vouches for you, okay. One more
peep out of you and I'll butter your necktie.

1071
01:08:33,277 --> 01:08:35,142
Yeah, fine. Get back to your dancing.

1072
01:08:35,212 --> 01:08:38,478
Stimulating as all this is, I
think we all should have our drinks.

1073
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:40,348
Here, Miss Kelly,
sit down.

1074
01:08:40,419 --> 01:08:42,820
Here we are.
Dr. Sanderson.

1075
01:08:44,724 --> 01:08:48,662
You keep your eye on him. I'm gonna
check in those other two joints.

1076
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:51,666
And Dr. Chumley better
be there, pal... or else!

1077
01:08:51,734 --> 01:08:53,895
Mr. Wilson?
Yeah?

1078
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:57,931
Good-bye, Mr. Wilson. My regards to you
and anybody else you happen to run into.

1079
01:08:58,009 --> 01:09:01,446
Ah, you...

1080
01:09:01,514 --> 01:09:06,350
Mr. Dowd, can't you think of anything
else that might help us to find the Doctor?

1081
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:10,984
Miss Kelly, may I
take hold of your hand?

1082
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:14,155
Yes, Mr. Dowd,
if you want to.

1083
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:18,395
We're all so worried.
Please try to think. Please?

1084
01:09:18,469 --> 01:09:24,068
For you I'd do anything. I'd almost
be willing to live my life over again.

1085
01:09:24,143 --> 01:09:27,443
Almost.
But I've told it all.

1086
01:09:27,514 --> 01:09:30,075
You're sure?
I'm quite sure.

1087
01:09:30,151 --> 01:09:32,120
But ask me again anyway,
won't you?

1088
01:09:32,188 --> 01:09:36,957
I liked that warm tone you
had in your voice just then.

1089
01:09:37,028 --> 01:09:39,553
So did I.

1090
01:09:39,631 --> 01:09:43,569
Maybe we better go someplace else.
Miss Kelly seems to be unhappy.

1091
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:46,732
No, let's stay here.
Kelly's all right.

1092
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:49,743
Perhaps you'd like
to dance, Miss Kelly.

1093
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:53,441
All right, Mr. Dowd, if
you'd like to. Oh, not I! No.

1094
01:09:53,516 --> 01:09:56,884
I used to dance.
I haven't danced in years.

1095
01:09:56,954 --> 01:10:01,325
I'm sure Dr. Sanderson would love to
dance with somebody as lovely as you.

1096
01:10:01,394 --> 01:10:05,525
Hmm? Would you, Miss Kelly?

1097
01:10:05,599 --> 01:10:08,194
All right.
There we are.

1098
01:10:31,266 --> 01:10:34,703
It's been a long time
since we've danced together.

1099
01:10:34,771 --> 01:10:37,935
Yes, a long time.

1100
01:10:38,009 --> 01:10:40,500
I'd forgotten what
a wonderful dancer you were.

1101
01:10:40,578 --> 01:10:44,744
If we didn't have to humor Mr. Dowd,
you wouldn't have remembered at all.

1102
01:10:44,818 --> 01:10:48,277
I'm not dancing with you
to humor Mr. Dowd, Ruth.

1103
01:10:58,435 --> 01:11:00,199
We shouldn't
have left him alone!

1104
01:11:03,876 --> 01:11:06,402
Where are you goin',
Mr. Dowd?

1105
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,415
I was just looking
for someone.

1106
01:11:08,483 --> 01:11:13,319
Why don't you come back inside?
All right, if you want me to.

1107
01:11:13,388 --> 01:11:16,483
It seemed to be so pleasant
out here.

1108
01:11:16,559 --> 01:11:20,588
You know, you two look
very nice dancing together.

1109
01:11:20,665 --> 01:11:24,727
I used to know
a whole lot of dances.

1110
01:11:24,804 --> 01:11:27,569
The Flea Hop.

1111
01:11:27,641 --> 01:11:30,042
And what's the...

1112
01:11:30,111 --> 01:11:34,640
The Black Bottom.
The Varsity Drag.

1113
01:11:34,717 --> 01:11:40,089
I don't know. I just don't
seem to have any time anymore.

1114
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:43,253
I have so many things
to do.

1115
01:11:43,328 --> 01:11:46,765
What is it you do,
Mr. Dowd?

1116
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:49,962
Harvey and I
sit in the bars...

1117
01:11:50,037 --> 01:11:55,238
and have a drink or two,
play the jukebox.

1118
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:58,975
And soon the faces
of all the other people,

1119
01:11:59,049 --> 01:12:03,886
they turn toward mine
and they smile.

1120
01:12:03,956 --> 01:12:08,621
They're saying, "We don't know your name,
mister, but you're a very nice fellow."

1121
01:12:10,398 --> 01:12:12,390
Harvey and I...

1122
01:12:14,169 --> 01:12:17,901
warm ourselves
in all these golden moments.

1123
01:12:17,974 --> 01:12:22,936
We've entered as strangers.
Soon we have friends.

1124
01:12:23,014 --> 01:12:25,916
And they come over
and they sit with us,

1125
01:12:25,985 --> 01:12:28,511
they drink with us
they talk to us.

1126
01:12:28,589 --> 01:12:32,924
And they tell about the big,
terrible things they've done...

1127
01:12:32,994 --> 01:12:36,021
and the big, wonderful things
they'll do.

1128
01:12:36,098 --> 01:12:40,537
Their hopes
and their regrets,

1129
01:12:40,605 --> 01:12:45,270
and their loves and their
hates, all very large...

1130
01:12:45,344 --> 01:12:49,077
because nobody ever brings
anything small into a bar.

1131
01:12:51,318 --> 01:12:53,344
And then...

1132
01:12:54,957 --> 01:12:56,891
I introduce them
to Harvey.

1133
01:12:56,959 --> 01:13:01,455
And he's bigger and grander
than anything they offer me.

1134
01:13:03,101 --> 01:13:07,972
And...
and when they leave,

1135
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:10,237
they leave impressed.

1136
01:13:11,545 --> 01:13:14,982
The same people
seldom come back,

1137
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:18,384
but that's...
that's envy, my dear.

1138
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:24,394
There's a little bit of envy
in the best of us.

1139
01:13:24,462 --> 01:13:27,489
And that's too bad,
isn't it?

1140
01:13:30,003 --> 01:13:33,201
How did you happen
to call him Harvey?

1141
01:13:33,274 --> 01:13:35,334
Well, Harvey's
his name.

1142
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,437
How do you
know that?

1143
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:43,110
There was a rather interesting
coincidence on that, Doctor.

1144
01:13:43,187 --> 01:13:48,889
One night several years ago I was walking
early in the evening along Fairfax Street.

1145
01:13:48,962 --> 01:13:53,230
It was between 18th and 19th.
Do you know the block?

1146
01:13:53,301 --> 01:13:55,964
Yes, yes.

1147
01:13:56,005 --> 01:13:57,973
I'd just put Ed Hickey
into a taxi.

1148
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:02,706
Ed had been mixing his
rye with his gin, and he...

1149
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:05,272
I just felt that
he needed conveying.

1150
01:14:05,351 --> 01:14:10,346
Anyway, I was walking along the
street and I heard this voice saying,

1151
01:14:10,423 --> 01:14:12,551
"Good evening, Mr. Dowd."

1152
01:14:12,626 --> 01:14:15,528
Well, I turned around...

1153
01:14:15,597 --> 01:14:20,127
and here was this big six-foot
rabbit leaning up against a lamppost.

1154
01:14:20,204 --> 01:14:23,333
I thought nothing of that because
when you've lived in a town...

1155
01:14:23,408 --> 01:14:28,278
as long as I've lived in this one, you get
used to the fact that everybody knows your name.

1156
01:14:28,347 --> 01:14:31,521
Naturally, I went over
to chat with him.

1157
01:14:31,655 --> 01:14:34,921
And he said to me,
he said,

1158
01:14:34,993 --> 01:14:39,295
"Ed Hickey was a little spiffed this
evening. Or could I be mistaken?"

1159
01:14:39,366 --> 01:14:41,494
Of course
he was not mistaken.

1160
01:14:41,569 --> 01:14:46,667
I think the world and all
of Ed, but he was spiffed.

1161
01:14:46,742 --> 01:14:51,841
We talked like that for a
while and then I said to him,

1162
01:14:51,915 --> 01:14:54,316
"You have the advantage
on me.

1163
01:14:54,386 --> 01:14:57,914
You know my name
and I don't know yours."

1164
01:14:57,990 --> 01:15:01,222
And right back at me
he said,

1165
01:15:01,295 --> 01:15:03,321
"What name do you like?"

1166
01:15:03,398 --> 01:15:07,802
Well, I didn't even have
to think twice about that.

1167
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:10,431
Harvey's always been
my favorite name.

1168
01:15:10,507 --> 01:15:14,969
So I said to him,
I said, "Harvey."

1169
01:15:15,047 --> 01:15:18,540
And, uh...

1170
01:15:18,618 --> 01:15:23,784
Th-This is the interesting thing
about the whole thing.

1171
01:15:23,857 --> 01:15:28,262
He said,
"What a coincidence.

1172
01:15:28,331 --> 01:15:31,267
My name happens
to be Harvey."

1173
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,532
Dowd,

1174
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:42,172
what was
your father's name?

1175
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,618
John.
John Stuyvesant.

1176
01:15:50,693 --> 01:15:52,787
Tell me, Dowd,

1177
01:15:54,365 --> 01:15:58,497
when you were a child,
didn't you have a playmate?

1178
01:15:58,571 --> 01:16:01,040
Someone with whom
you spent many happy hours?

1179
01:16:01,108 --> 01:16:04,272
Yes. Yes,
I did, Doctor.

1180
01:16:04,345 --> 01:16:06,040
Didn't you?
Yes.

1181
01:16:06,114 --> 01:16:08,743
What was his name?

1182
01:16:10,987 --> 01:16:13,821
Vern.
Vern McElhinney.

1183
01:16:13,891 --> 01:16:16,156
You ever know the McElhinneys, Doctor? No.

1184
01:16:16,228 --> 01:16:19,596
That's too bad. There were a
lot of them and they circulated.

1185
01:16:19,665 --> 01:16:23,796
Very nice people.
Just wonderful people.

1186
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:26,363
Think carefully,
Dowd.

1187
01:16:26,441 --> 01:16:30,503
Didn't you know somebody sometime,
someplace by the name of Harvey?

1188
01:16:30,579 --> 01:16:33,515
Didn't you ever know anybody
by that name?

1189
01:16:35,686 --> 01:16:39,316
No. No,
not one, Doctor.

1190
01:16:39,391 --> 01:16:42,691
Maybe that's why I always
had such hopes for it.

1191
01:16:44,765 --> 01:16:48,827
We looked in both of those joints, and
Dr. Chumley ain't in either one of'em.

1192
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:52,535
I brought help.
What're you doin' out here?

1193
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:55,374
Come on. We're going back
to the sanitarium. Wh...

1194
01:16:55,447 --> 01:16:59,043
Come, Elwood. Very well, Lyman.

1195
01:16:59,118 --> 01:17:02,020
I'm afraid I won't be able to
stay very long. I must find Harvey.

1196
01:17:02,088 --> 01:17:05,581
Which one is Dowd? My
name's Dowd, Elwood P.

1197
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:09,461
Here, let me give you one of
my cards. Never mind the card!

1198
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:11,932
Wilson,
what did I tell you?

1199
01:17:17,108 --> 01:17:20,977
Coming, coming.

1200
01:17:22,816 --> 01:17:24,875
Who is it? It's me. Open the gates quickly.

1201
01:17:24,952 --> 01:17:27,922
Oh, it's you, Doctor!

1202
01:17:31,494 --> 01:17:34,259
I thought you'd gone for the
night. I thought you'd gone.

1203
01:17:34,331 --> 01:17:37,768
Close them, Herman.
Close the gates.

1204
01:17:37,835 --> 01:17:40,134
Are you all right,
Doctor? I'm being followed.

1205
01:17:40,205 --> 01:17:43,607
Who's following you? None of your business.

1206
01:18:09,645 --> 01:18:12,114
Ahh! Ahh!

1207
01:18:12,181 --> 01:18:14,514
You called me,
Doctor?

1208
01:18:14,585 --> 01:18:18,113
No. No, I didn't.
No.

1209
01:18:18,189 --> 01:18:21,023
Everything's fine.

1210
01:19:07,488 --> 01:19:10,322
What's wrong? What happened,
Herman? What's goin' on?

1211
01:19:10,392 --> 01:19:13,726
The alarm went off. Somebody
must've come through a window.

1212
01:19:23,643 --> 01:19:26,306
Yes, Doctor. Sanderson, he's after me.

1213
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:28,542
Who's after you, Doctor?
I don't see anyone.

1214
01:19:28,616 --> 01:19:31,347
I saw him. He came through
the window. Who was it?

1215
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:34,356
Who came through
the window, Doctor?

1216
01:19:34,424 --> 01:19:37,019
I won't tell you. What's he talkin' about?

1217
01:19:37,094 --> 01:19:38,618
Forget it.

1218
01:19:38,696 --> 01:19:41,723
I'm going to my office and
I don't wish to be disturbed.

1219
01:19:51,346 --> 01:19:53,440
Forget it, he says.
Not me.

1220
01:19:53,516 --> 01:19:56,714
I'm takin' a look around this
joint. I'm gonna see what's goin' on.

1221
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:15,336
It's locked.
Locked?

1222
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:17,209
Have you any
extra keys, Miss?

1223
01:20:17,281 --> 01:20:19,842
Yes, we have.
I'll get them.

1224
01:20:24,256 --> 01:20:27,090
Dr. Chumley, I went around the
house and climbed through the window.

1225
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:30,562
I didn't see anybody. Thank you,
Wilson. It's quite all right.

1226
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:33,999
Everything's in order,
thank you. I'll be all right.

1227
01:20:34,069 --> 01:20:36,265
Dr. Chumley,
if you need me, I'll...

1228
01:20:36,339 --> 01:20:39,434
Holy smoke! We forgot about that crackpot.
He's probably roamin' around loose.

1229
01:20:41,646 --> 01:20:43,842
Excuse me.

1230
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:52,151
I got 'im, Doctor.
Let's go upstairs.

1231
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:55,061
I wanna do your fingernails for
you. That's thoughtful of you.

1232
01:20:55,131 --> 01:20:57,396
Just a second. I'll take
him. Thank you, Doctor.

1233
01:20:57,467 --> 01:21:00,266
Oh, Miss Kelly.

1234
01:21:00,338 --> 01:21:05,141
Perhaps you'd like this flower. I
seem to have misplaced my buttonhole.

1235
01:21:05,211 --> 01:21:07,736
Thank you, Mr. Dowd. Okay, let's go.

1236
01:21:07,814 --> 01:21:10,215
One moment, please.

1237
01:21:10,284 --> 01:21:14,154
Ah, Dr. Chumley. How nice
to run into you again.

1238
01:21:14,223 --> 01:21:17,625
How are you getting along
with Harvey? Oh, well, uh...

1239
01:21:17,694 --> 01:21:20,926
Mr. Dowd, I'd like to speak to
you in my office alone, please.

1240
01:21:20,999 --> 01:21:25,300
I'd like that, too, but I just promised
this gentleman he could give me a manicure.

1241
01:21:25,371 --> 01:21:30,310
Of course, if you wouldn't mind waiting
a few minutes. Not at all, Mr. Dowd.

1242
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:37,916
Oh, excuse me.

1243
01:21:37,987 --> 01:21:40,684
You first. Go ahead. Oh...

1244
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:50,159
Mr. Dowd, won't you have a seat? Thank you.

1245
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:55,809
Will you have a cigar?
No, thank you, Doctor.

1246
01:21:55,878 --> 01:21:58,279
Is there anything
I can do for you?

1247
01:21:58,348 --> 01:22:00,749
What did you
have in mind?

1248
01:22:00,818 --> 01:22:04,414
Mr. Dowd, what kind
of a man are you?

1249
01:22:04,489 --> 01:22:06,515
Where do you
come from?

1250
01:22:06,593 --> 01:22:10,257
Why, didn't l... Didn't
I give you one of my cards?

1251
01:22:10,331 --> 01:22:14,860
And where on the face of this tired
old earth did you find a thing like him?

1252
01:22:14,936 --> 01:22:19,637
You mean, Harvey the Pooka? Yes, it's
true, the things you told me tonight.

1253
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:22,544
I know it now.
Yes, yes.

1254
01:22:22,614 --> 01:22:26,642
Yes, Harvey has several
very interesting facets.

1255
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:29,746
Did I tell you about Mrs. McElhinney? No.

1256
01:22:29,823 --> 01:22:32,884
She lives right next door
to us. Wonderful woman.

1257
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:37,535
Harvey told me last night that
Mrs. McElhinney's Aunt Rose...

1258
01:22:37,669 --> 01:22:40,537
was going to drop in
on her unexpectedly...

1259
01:22:40,606 --> 01:22:43,633
this morning from Cleveland. And did she?

1260
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:45,702
Did she what?

1261
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:50,582
Aunt Rose. Did she come,
just as Harvey said she would?

1262
01:22:50,653 --> 01:22:52,588
Oh, yes, yes.

1263
01:22:52,656 --> 01:22:55,956
These things always work out just
the way Harvey says they will.

1264
01:22:56,027 --> 01:22:58,496
He's very,
very versatile.

1265
01:22:58,563 --> 01:23:00,588
Did I tell you
he could stop clocks?

1266
01:23:00,667 --> 01:23:02,760
To what purpose?

1267
01:23:02,835 --> 01:23:06,328
You've heard the expression,
"His face would stop a clock."

1268
01:23:06,407 --> 01:23:09,970
Well, Harvey
can look at your clock...

1269
01:23:10,046 --> 01:23:12,173
and stop it.

1270
01:23:12,248 --> 01:23:15,412
And you can go anywhere you
like with anyone you like...

1271
01:23:15,485 --> 01:23:17,511
and stay as long
as you like.

1272
01:23:17,588 --> 01:23:22,527
And when you get back, not
one minute will have ticked by.

1273
01:23:23,863 --> 01:23:25,889
You mean that he...
You see...

1274
01:23:25,966 --> 01:23:30,563
He can... Science has
overcome time and space.

1275
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:35,476
Well, Harvey has overcome
not only time and space,

1276
01:23:35,546 --> 01:23:38,380
but any objections.

1277
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:42,182
Flyspecks!
Flyspecks!

1278
01:23:42,254 --> 01:23:44,780
I've been spending my life
among flyspects...

1279
01:23:44,858 --> 01:23:49,023
while miracles have been leaning
on lampposts at 18th and Fairfax.

1280
01:23:49,097 --> 01:23:52,363
Tell me, Mr. Dowd,
will he do this for you?

1281
01:23:52,435 --> 01:23:56,270
Oh, he'd be willing
at any time.

1282
01:23:56,340 --> 01:24:01,142
But so far I haven't been able to
think of anyplace I'd rather be.

1283
01:24:01,213 --> 01:24:06,653
I always have a wonderful time
wherever I am, whomever I'm with.

1284
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:09,212
I'm having a fine time
right here with you, Doctor.

1285
01:24:09,290 --> 01:24:11,452
Oh.

1286
01:24:11,527 --> 01:24:15,862
Oh, l...
I know where I'd go.

1287
01:24:15,932 --> 01:24:18,060
Where?

1288
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:21,937
I'd go to Akron. Akron! Oh, yes.

1289
01:24:22,007 --> 01:24:25,341
There's a cottage camp
just outside Akron...

1290
01:24:25,412 --> 01:24:29,009
in a grove
of maple trees.

1291
01:24:29,084 --> 01:24:33,613
Green, cool, beautiful.
That's my favorite tree.

1292
01:24:33,689 --> 01:24:36,750
And I'd go there with a pretty woman. Oh.

1293
01:24:36,827 --> 01:24:40,229
A strange woman,
a quiet woman.

1294
01:24:40,298 --> 01:24:44,737
Oh, under a tree. I wouldn't
even want to know her name,

1295
01:24:44,805 --> 01:24:48,902
while I would be just...
Mr. Smith.

1296
01:24:48,976 --> 01:24:52,606
Then I would send out
for cold beer.

1297
01:24:52,681 --> 01:24:55,242
No whiskey, huh?
No.

1298
01:24:55,318 --> 01:24:58,117
Then I would
tell her things.

1299
01:24:58,189 --> 01:25:01,785
Things that I've never told
to anyone.

1300
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:05,353
Things that are locked deep...
in here.

1301
01:25:07,334 --> 01:25:09,826
And as I talked
to her,

1302
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:14,673
I would want her to hold out
her soft white hand and say,

1303
01:25:14,744 --> 01:25:20,377
"Poor thing.
You poor, poor thing."

1304
01:25:20,451 --> 01:25:23,786
How long would you want
this to go on, Doctor?

1305
01:25:23,857 --> 01:25:27,055
Two weeks.
Two weeks?

1306
01:25:27,127 --> 01:25:29,527
Wouldn't that get
a little monotonous,

1307
01:25:29,597 --> 01:25:33,194
just Akron, cold beer and
"poor, poor thing" for two weeks?

1308
01:25:33,269 --> 01:25:35,499
No!

1309
01:25:35,571 --> 01:25:38,700
It would be wonderful.

1310
01:25:38,775 --> 01:25:42,406
Well, I can't help feeling,
Doctor,

1311
01:25:42,481 --> 01:25:46,543
that you're making a mistake
not allowing the woman to talk.

1312
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:51,355
If she'd been around at all, she might've
picked up some interesting news items.

1313
01:25:51,426 --> 01:25:54,294
And I'm sure you're making a mistake
about all that beer and no whiskey,

1314
01:25:54,364 --> 01:25:56,764
but it's
your two weeks.

1315
01:25:56,833 --> 01:26:01,499
Mr. Dowd, could he...
Would he do this for me?

1316
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:03,633
Oh, he could
and might.

1317
01:26:03,709 --> 01:26:07,612
I've never heard Harvey
say a word against Akron.

1318
01:26:07,681 --> 01:26:11,982
By the way, Doctor,
where is Harvey?

1319
01:26:12,053 --> 01:26:13,988
Don't you know?

1320
01:26:14,056 --> 01:26:17,288
The last time I saw him
he was with you.

1321
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:20,057
He's probably waiting for me
down at Charlie's.

1322
01:26:20,131 --> 01:26:23,124
Yes, that's it. He's
down at Charlie's. Uh-huh.

1323
01:26:23,201 --> 01:26:26,103
In that case, I'll go down
and join him for a nightcap.

1324
01:26:26,172 --> 01:26:29,142
Fortunately, Charlie's
stays open rather late.

1325
01:26:29,209 --> 01:26:32,008
Excuse me, Doctor. I want to say good-bye
to some of my friends before I leave.

1326
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,675
Mr. Dowd, none of those people
are your friends.

1327
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:38,243
But I want you to know that I am
your friend. Thank you. And I'm yours.

1328
01:26:38,322 --> 01:26:40,814
They underestimate you,
as I did.

1329
01:26:40,892 --> 01:26:44,351
This sister of yours is at the
bottom of a conspiracy against you.

1330
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:47,594
She's trying to persuade me to lock you up.
Today she had commitment papers drawn up.

1331
01:26:47,667 --> 01:26:50,228
She has your power of attorney
and the key to your safety box.

1332
01:26:50,304 --> 01:26:52,239
And she brought
you here!

1333
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:56,904
My sister did all that in one afternoon?
That Veta certainly is a whirlwind, isn't she?

1334
01:26:56,980 --> 01:27:00,075
Good heavens, man! Haven't
you any righteous indignation?

1335
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:02,415
Oh, Doctor, l...

1336
01:27:02,487 --> 01:27:06,447
Years ago my mother used
to say to me, she'd say,

1337
01:27:06,525 --> 01:27:09,154
"In this world, Elwood,
you must be..."

1338
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:11,255
She always
called me Elwood.

1339
01:27:11,332 --> 01:27:15,929
"In this world, Elwood,
you must be oh, so smart...

1340
01:27:16,005 --> 01:27:18,099
or oh, so pleasant."

1341
01:27:18,174 --> 01:27:20,871
Well, for years
I was smart.

1342
01:27:20,945 --> 01:27:23,278
I recommend pleasant.

1343
01:27:23,348 --> 01:27:26,750
And you may quote me.

1344
01:27:38,568 --> 01:27:41,766
This is it.
Here we are.

1345
01:27:41,839 --> 01:27:44,638
Okay, thank you.
Come on, Myrtle.

1346
01:27:44,710 --> 01:27:46,803
I'll come... You wait
right here, Veta girl.

1347
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,041
I will not wait here.
I'm going in with you.

1348
01:27:49,115 --> 01:27:51,482
You're a very high-strung girl.
This may be an ordeal.

1349
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,817
Then let Myrtle Mae
stay here too.

1350
01:27:53,889 --> 01:27:58,520
Mother, you know it isn't right to put Uncle
Elwood away without some blood relative present.

1351
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:02,092
Hey, you're not gonna leave
the lady here. I thought...

1352
01:28:02,167 --> 01:28:05,831
See, Omar? Even strangers
think I should go in with you.

1353
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:09,065
I wish to see
Dr. Chumley.

1354
01:28:09,142 --> 01:28:11,634
I'm sorry, sir. He's in
conference. You'll have to wait.

1355
01:28:11,713 --> 01:28:15,673
After dragging me out of bed at this
hour? Tell him Judge Omar Gaffney's here.

1356
01:28:15,751 --> 01:28:19,188
I telephoned you right after we
picked up Mr. Dowd. I'm Dr. Sanderson.

1357
01:28:19,255 --> 01:28:21,724
I demand that this matter
be settled right now!

1358
01:28:21,792 --> 01:28:24,591
Oh, good, nobody here
but people.

1359
01:28:24,663 --> 01:28:28,225
You promised to wait in the car.
You forgot Elwood's bathrobe.

1360
01:28:28,301 --> 01:28:31,669
Why are you all standing
around? I thought you'd be...

1361
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:36,041
How do you do, Doctor? Committing
Elwood. Hello, Mrs. Simmons.

1362
01:28:36,112 --> 01:28:39,105
He's the one
I told you about.

1363
01:28:39,182 --> 01:28:41,981
Girl. Doctor,
what's your opinion?

1364
01:28:42,053 --> 01:28:43,953
How are you feeling, Mrs.
Simmons? Better, thank you.

1365
01:28:44,021 --> 01:28:47,389
In my opinion, Elwood P. Dowd is suffering
from a third-degree hallucination.

1366
01:28:47,459 --> 01:28:49,928
I recommend formula
number 9-7-7.

1367
01:28:49,996 --> 01:28:52,522
That's a powerful serum which
will shock him back to reality.

1368
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,535
Nothing will do that.
Lock him up.

1369
01:28:54,603 --> 01:28:58,438
If this shock formula brings people back
to reality, that's where we want Elwood.

1370
01:28:58,508 --> 01:29:01,842
Yes. If he won't see the
rabbit anymore, give it to him.

1371
01:29:01,912 --> 01:29:04,711
Then when Harvey comes
to the door, I'll deal with him.

1372
01:29:04,783 --> 01:29:08,083
Please stop talking about Harvey
as if there were such a thing!

1373
01:29:08,154 --> 01:29:11,955
Myrtle Mae, you have a lot to
learn, and I hope you never learn it.

1374
01:29:12,025 --> 01:29:16,293
Oh, Mother... Marvin! Myrtle Mae, baby!

1375
01:29:16,365 --> 01:29:20,860
Myrtle Mae, come back here.
The idea of that terrible man...

1376
01:29:20,937 --> 01:29:24,135
Let's get on with this, Doctor. I'm sorry, but
you'll have to take that up with Dr. Chumley.

1377
01:29:24,208 --> 01:29:26,677
Then why waste my time?
Young lady,

1378
01:29:26,745 --> 01:29:29,408
will you inform Dr. Chumley
of my presence or must I do it?

1379
01:29:29,482 --> 01:29:31,673
I'll attend to it
immediately, sir.

1380
01:29:37,982 --> 01:29:39,610
Oh.
Oh, Miss Kelly.

1381
01:29:39,684 --> 01:29:42,118
Isn't Dr. Chumley there?
How nice to see you.

1382
01:29:42,187 --> 01:29:44,520
Where's the Doctor?
What'd you...

1383
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:48,550
Are you all right, Doctor? Yes,
thanks. I'm quite all right.

1384
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:51,725
Well, Veta and Myrtle Mae!
What a delightful surprise.

1385
01:29:51,801 --> 01:29:56,262
Good evening, Elwood. I brought
your bathrobe. Thank you, Veta.

1386
01:29:56,339 --> 01:30:00,743
Well, Dr. Chumley, are we gonna
settle this matter or are we not?

1387
01:30:00,813 --> 01:30:03,782
I, uh... I've turned
this case over...

1388
01:30:03,849 --> 01:30:08,151
to Dr. Sanderson. Oh, no. You forget
I don't work here anymore, Dr. Chumley.

1389
01:30:08,222 --> 01:30:10,817
Dr. Sanderson, please disregard
what I said this afternoon.

1390
01:30:10,892 --> 01:30:14,260
I want you to head my staff. I think
you're a very capable young man.

1391
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:17,095
Oh, Lyman,
did you hear that?

1392
01:30:17,167 --> 01:30:20,797
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some work to do.

1393
01:30:28,516 --> 01:30:30,746
Well, I think this calls
for a celebration.

1394
01:30:30,818 --> 01:30:34,152
Why don't we all go down to
Charlie's Place and have a drink?

1395
01:30:34,223 --> 01:30:37,661
You're not going anywhere,
Elwood. You're staying right there.

1396
01:30:37,728 --> 01:30:40,892
Yes, Uncle Elwood.
Stay here, son.

1397
01:30:40,966 --> 01:30:43,561
I plan to leave,
you want me to stay.

1398
01:30:43,636 --> 01:30:46,332
An element of conflict in any
discussion is a very good thing.

1399
01:30:46,405 --> 01:30:50,741
Shows everybody's taking part,
and nobody left out. I like that.

1400
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:53,441
Ah, Miss Kelly.

1401
01:30:53,516 --> 01:30:56,213
Miss Kelly, you know,
when you wear my flower...

1402
01:30:56,286 --> 01:30:58,220
you make it beautiful.

1403
01:30:58,288 --> 01:31:02,556
"A diviner grace has never
brightened this enchanting face."

1404
01:31:02,628 --> 01:31:06,690
Ovid's Fifth Elegy. Ovid's
always been my favorite poet.

1405
01:31:06,766 --> 01:31:09,065
My dear,
you'll never look lovelier.

1406
01:31:09,136 --> 01:31:11,935
I'll never be happier,
Mr. Dowd. I know it.

1407
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:16,704
Hey, this rabbit gag
must be a good one.

1408
01:31:16,779 --> 01:31:21,741
Mr. Dowd, I have a formula, 9-7-7, that
will be good for you. Will you take it?

1409
01:31:21,819 --> 01:31:23,879
9-7-7, huh? Yes.
It's a serum.

1410
01:31:23,956 --> 01:31:26,015
Oh. You won't see this rabbit anymore.

1411
01:31:26,092 --> 01:31:30,154
But you will see your responsibilities
and your duties. Uh-huh.

1412
01:31:30,231 --> 01:31:32,792
Well, Doctor,
if you thought of this,

1413
01:31:32,868 --> 01:31:35,235
I'm sure it must be
a very fine thing.

1414
01:31:35,305 --> 01:31:39,572
And if I happen to run into anybody who
needs it, I'd be glad to recommend it.

1415
01:31:39,643 --> 01:31:42,204
But as for myself, I don't
think I'd care for it.

1416
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,442
You hear that, Judge?
You hear that, Doctor?

1417
01:31:44,517 --> 01:31:47,749
That's what we put up with.
Veta, do you want me to take this?

1418
01:31:47,821 --> 01:31:50,518
Oh, Elwood, I'm only
thinking of you.

1419
01:31:50,592 --> 01:31:55,223
You're my brother and I've known you
for years. I'd do anything for you.

1420
01:31:55,297 --> 01:31:58,961
Harvey wouldn't do anything for
you. He's making a fool of you.

1421
01:31:59,035 --> 01:32:02,403
Elwood, don't be a fool. I won't.

1422
01:32:02,473 --> 01:32:04,999
Why, you could amount
to something.

1423
01:32:05,077 --> 01:32:08,570
You could be sitting on the Western
Slope Water Board right now...

1424
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:10,913
if you'd only go over
and ask them.

1425
01:32:10,985 --> 01:32:14,787
If that's what you want, Harvey and
I'll go over tomorrow and ask them.

1426
01:32:14,857 --> 01:32:18,055
Tomorrow! I wish there might
never be another tomorrow!

1427
01:32:18,128 --> 01:32:21,360
Not if Myrtle Mae and I have to
go on living with that rabbit!

1428
01:32:21,432 --> 01:32:25,733
Our friends never come to see us
anymore. We have no social life whatever!

1429
01:32:25,804 --> 01:32:27,932
We've no life
at all.

1430
01:32:28,008 --> 01:32:31,410
We're both
perfectly miserable.

1431
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:35,075
But perhaps you don't
care. All right, now, Veta.

1432
01:32:39,423 --> 01:32:42,051
Well, l...

1433
01:32:42,126 --> 01:32:47,395
I've always felt Veta should
have everything she wants, but...

1434
01:32:49,302 --> 01:32:51,236
Veta,
are you sure?

1435
01:32:51,305 --> 01:32:53,432
Yes.

1436
01:32:57,112 --> 01:33:01,278
I-I'll take it. Where do I go,
Doctor? In my office, Mr. Dowd.

1437
01:33:01,352 --> 01:33:04,345
This will only take a few
minutes. Why don't you wait?

1438
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:12,460
Veta, you tell Dr. Chumley to say good-bye
to the old fellow for me, will you?

1439
01:33:15,705 --> 01:33:18,071
Dr. Sanderson,
couldn't we...

1440
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:21,042
Yes, Kelly?
Nothing.

1441
01:33:21,111 --> 01:33:23,603
I'll need you
to give me a hand, Miss Kelly.

1442
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:29,621
Right in here. No, no. After you.

1443
01:33:29,689 --> 01:33:31,658
No, after you.

1444
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,623
Miss Kelly. No, after you. Here we go.

1445
01:33:46,345 --> 01:33:50,339
Dr. Sanderson said
it wouldn't take long.

1446
01:33:50,417 --> 01:33:53,444
Ooh, ooh!

1447
01:33:53,521 --> 01:33:57,219
Sit down, girl. Thank you, Judge.

1448
01:33:57,292 --> 01:34:00,751
He said it wouldn't take...
long.

1449
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:03,493
Relax, girl.
Take it easy.

1450
01:34:03,567 --> 01:34:05,729
Thank you.
I'll try to, but...

1451
01:34:10,744 --> 01:34:15,182
Oh, there you are. Lady jumped out
of my cab, left without payin' me.

1452
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:18,618
She didn't say anything, and a
fellow gets nervous after a while.

1453
01:34:18,687 --> 01:34:22,716
Well, there's no cause for
concern, man. How much is it?

1454
01:34:22,794 --> 01:34:26,231
All the way out there
from town? $2.75.

1455
01:34:26,298 --> 01:34:29,063
Why, I must've forgotten
my wallet.

1456
01:34:29,135 --> 01:34:34,039
I was dragged out of bed in such a hurry,
it's a wonder I didn't forget my pants.

1457
01:34:34,108 --> 01:34:36,043
Beg your pardon,
Veta.

1458
01:34:36,111 --> 01:34:39,377
Uh, would you take a
check? We don't take checks.

1459
01:34:39,448 --> 01:34:41,679
Yeah, I know, but...
Would you mind, Veta?

1460
01:34:41,752 --> 01:34:45,780
Oh, of course.
Yes, I, uh...

1461
01:34:45,857 --> 01:34:50,421
Well, I could've sworn
I brought my coin purse.

1462
01:34:50,497 --> 01:34:52,829
Where is it?

1463
01:34:52,899 --> 01:34:55,733
Oh, the idea!

1464
01:35:06,551 --> 01:35:09,180
Well, I never!

1465
01:35:12,025 --> 01:35:15,826
Oh, I know. I'll get it
for you from my brother.

1466
01:35:15,897 --> 01:35:19,698
But I can't go in just now. He's
in there getting an injection.

1467
01:35:19,768 --> 01:35:22,294
It won't take long.
You'll have to wait.

1468
01:35:22,372 --> 01:35:24,671
You're gonna get my money from
your brother who's in there...

1469
01:35:24,742 --> 01:35:26,802
getting some of that stuff
they shoot out here?

1470
01:35:26,879 --> 01:35:28,938
Yes. It'll only take
a few minutes.

1471
01:35:29,014 --> 01:35:33,350
Lady, I want my money now. I told
you it'll only take a few minutes.

1472
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:35,388
We want you to drive us
back to town.

1473
01:35:35,456 --> 01:35:39,622
I told you I want my money now or I'm nosin'
the cab back to town and you can wait for a bus.

1474
01:35:39,695 --> 01:35:43,427
Well, of all the pigheaded,
stubborn things!

1475
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,935
What's the matter with you?
Nothing that $2.75 won't fix.

1476
01:35:46,004 --> 01:35:49,168
You heard me.
Take it or leave it.

1477
01:35:49,241 --> 01:35:53,645
I never heard of anything so
unreasonable in all my life.

1478
01:36:00,690 --> 01:36:03,717
Would you please let my
brother step out here a moment?

1479
01:36:03,794 --> 01:36:07,026
This cab driver won't wait.
Oh, Elwood.

1480
01:36:07,098 --> 01:36:09,533
I'll be right back.

1481
01:36:09,602 --> 01:36:11,763
Elwood, I came off
without my coin purse.

1482
01:36:11,837 --> 01:36:15,171
Would you please give
this man $2.75?

1483
01:36:15,242 --> 01:36:18,269
But don't give him any more.
He's been very rude.

1484
01:36:18,347 --> 01:36:21,408
Howdy do. Dowd's my name, Elwood P.

1485
01:36:21,484 --> 01:36:24,579
Mine's Lofgren, E.J. Glad
to know you, Mr. Lofgren.

1486
01:36:24,655 --> 01:36:29,059
This is my sister Mrs. Simmons. My
good friend Judge Gaffney, back there.

1487
01:36:29,127 --> 01:36:31,221
Hi. Hi.
Hi.

1488
01:36:31,297 --> 01:36:34,028
Have you lived around
here long? All my life.

1489
01:36:34,101 --> 01:36:36,569
Enjoy your work?
It's okay.

1490
01:36:36,638 --> 01:36:38,799
I've been driving
for Apex Cabs for 15 years.

1491
01:36:38,873 --> 01:36:41,342
My brother Joe's been driving
for Brown Cabs for near 12.

1492
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:44,505
Is that so? You drive for Apex
and your brother Joe for Brown.

1493
01:36:44,581 --> 01:36:47,176
That's interesting, isn't it, Veta? Yes.

1494
01:36:47,251 --> 01:36:50,380
Mr. Lofgren, let me give you
one of my cards.

1495
01:36:50,456 --> 01:36:54,359
My sister and my charming niece
live at that address with me.

1496
01:36:54,427 --> 01:36:57,420
Wouldn't you and your brother like to
come and have dinner with us sometime?

1497
01:36:57,498 --> 01:36:59,592
Sure,
be glad to.

1498
01:36:59,668 --> 01:37:01,830
When? When would you
be glad to?

1499
01:37:01,904 --> 01:37:05,272
I couldn't come any night but tomorrow.
I'm on duty all the rest of the week.

1500
01:37:05,342 --> 01:37:08,471
Tomorrow would be perfect. We'll be
expecting you and delighted to see you.

1501
01:37:08,546 --> 01:37:12,244
Won't we, Veta? Elwood, I'm sure
this man has friends of his own.

1502
01:37:12,318 --> 01:37:14,253
Can't have
too many friends.

1503
01:37:14,321 --> 01:37:16,950
Don't keep the Doctor waiting.
It's rude.

1504
01:37:17,025 --> 01:37:20,427
There you are. Keep the change. I'm
glad to have met you, Mr. Lofgren.

1505
01:37:20,496 --> 01:37:25,025
I'll expect you and your brother tomorrow
night. Now, you'll have to excuse me. l...

1506
01:37:28,607 --> 01:37:31,235
A sweet guy.
Certainly.

1507
01:37:31,309 --> 01:37:34,678
You could just as well have waited. Ah, no.

1508
01:37:34,748 --> 01:37:37,946
Lady, I've been drivin'
this route for 15 years.

1509
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:41,979
I've brought 'em out here to get that stuff,
and I've drove 'em home after they had it.

1510
01:37:42,058 --> 01:37:44,823
It changes them.
I certainly hope so.

1511
01:37:44,895 --> 01:37:47,626
You ain't kiddin'.
On the way out here,

1512
01:37:47,698 --> 01:37:50,600
they sit back and enjoy
the ride, they talk to me.

1513
01:37:50,669 --> 01:37:53,969
Sometimes we stop and watch the
sunsets and look at the birds.

1514
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:56,805
Sometimes we stop and watch the
birds when there ain't no birds,

1515
01:37:56,877 --> 01:37:59,005
and look at the sunsets
when it's rainin'.

1516
01:37:59,081 --> 01:38:02,745
We have a swell time.
And I always get a big tip.

1517
01:38:02,819 --> 01:38:04,913
But afterwards...
ooh-ooh.

1518
01:38:04,988 --> 01:38:09,016
"Afterwards, ooh-ooh." What do
you mean, "Afterwards, ooh-ooh"?

1519
01:38:09,094 --> 01:38:11,825
They crab, crab, crab.
They yell at me,

1520
01:38:11,897 --> 01:38:14,526
"Watch the lights! Watch the
breaks! Watch the intersections!"

1521
01:38:14,601 --> 01:38:18,663
They scream at me to hurry. They
got no faith in me and my buggy.

1522
01:38:18,739 --> 01:38:23,006
Yet, it's the same cab, same driver, and
we're going back over the very same road.

1523
01:38:23,078 --> 01:38:25,013
It's no fun.
And, no tips.

1524
01:38:25,081 --> 01:38:28,415
My brother would've tipped
you anyway. He's very generous.

1525
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:32,116
He always has been. Not
after this he won't be.

1526
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:35,559
After this he'll be
a perfectly normal human being.

1527
01:38:35,629 --> 01:38:38,257
And you know what stinkers
they are.

1528
01:38:38,332 --> 01:38:40,563
Glad I met ya.
I'll wait.

1529
01:38:42,972 --> 01:38:46,602
Oh, no! No!
Elwood, come out.

1530
01:38:46,676 --> 01:38:50,808
Don't give it to him! Stop
it! Stop it! Elwood, come out.

1531
01:38:50,883 --> 01:38:53,374
Don't do that, girl. Dr.
Sanderson's giving the injection.

1532
01:38:53,452 --> 01:38:56,388
I don't want him to have it.
I don't like people like that.

1533
01:38:56,456 --> 01:38:59,483
I don't want my brother
to be like that. Elwood!

1534
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:03,430
Oh, you haven't given him the
injection already, have you?

1535
01:39:03,499 --> 01:39:07,266
No, but we're all ready,
Mrs. Simmons. Oh, Elwood!

1536
01:39:07,337 --> 01:39:09,467
What's the trouble?

1537
01:39:09,601 --> 01:39:11,900
What's goin' on?
What's wrong?

1538
01:39:11,971 --> 01:39:14,269
She wants to stop the
injection. She does, huh?

1539
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:17,105
Come on, you. Take your hands off me!

1540
01:39:17,177 --> 01:39:19,738
Don't you touch me,
you white slaver, you!

1541
01:39:19,814 --> 01:39:23,273
Marvin, please! All right,
honey. Anything you say.

1542
01:39:23,352 --> 01:39:25,719
You don't know what you want. You
didn't want that rabbit either.

1543
01:39:25,789 --> 01:39:27,724
What's wrong with Harvey?

1544
01:39:27,792 --> 01:39:31,456
If Elwood and Myrtle Mae and I want
to live with Harvey, what is it to you?

1545
01:39:31,530 --> 01:39:35,126
You don't even have to
come around. It's our house.

1546
01:39:35,201 --> 01:39:38,763
Elwood! Oh, Elwood. Veta, that's all right.

1547
01:39:38,839 --> 01:39:41,104
Veta's all tired out.
She's done a lot today.

1548
01:39:41,176 --> 01:39:43,975
Have it your own way, but I'm
gonna take that cab back to town.

1549
01:39:44,046 --> 01:39:47,676
I'm not giving up another night's sleep
again no matter how big the animal is!

1550
01:39:47,751 --> 01:39:50,084
Elwood,
let us go too.

1551
01:39:50,154 --> 01:39:53,386
I hate this place.
I wish I'd never seen it.

1552
01:39:53,459 --> 01:39:56,452
All right, Veta. Wait
'til I get my hat and coat.

1553
01:40:00,101 --> 01:40:04,199
Why...
Why look at that!

1554
01:40:04,274 --> 01:40:07,073
It's my coin purse.

1555
01:40:07,144 --> 01:40:10,012
It must've been in there
all the time.

1556
01:40:10,081 --> 01:40:15,042
I could've paid
that cab driver myself.

1557
01:40:15,121 --> 01:40:17,886
Harvey!

1558
01:40:22,765 --> 01:40:24,961
Thank you, Doctor.

1559
01:40:25,035 --> 01:40:27,094
Ooh!
Myrtle Mae and that man!

1560
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:29,196
They make a beautiful couple,
don't they?

1561
01:40:29,273 --> 01:40:32,539
Mr. Wilson has such a dynamic
personality. That man...

1562
01:40:32,611 --> 01:40:35,513
Myrtle Mae...
Mr. Wilson, may we have...

1563
01:40:35,581 --> 01:40:37,777
the pleasure of your company
tomorrow night for dinner?

1564
01:40:37,851 --> 01:40:40,412
We're having a few friends in.
Very informal.

1565
01:40:40,488 --> 01:40:43,686
Certainly, Mr. Dowd. I'd
be glad to. Thank you.

1566
01:40:43,759 --> 01:40:45,693
A very nice couple.

1567
01:40:45,761 --> 01:40:49,061
And you make
a very beautiful couple too.

1568
01:40:49,132 --> 01:40:52,034
Well,
I must find Harvey.

1569
01:40:52,103 --> 01:40:55,198
Good-bye, Mrs. Simmons.
I'll see you tomorrow night.

1570
01:40:55,274 --> 01:40:59,076
Yes. Good-bye,
Mr. Wilson.

1571
01:40:59,146 --> 01:41:01,980
Myrtle Mae!

1572
01:41:03,985 --> 01:41:08,856
Come, Myrtle Mae. Please try to forget
all about that dreadful Mr. Wilson.

1573
01:41:11,563 --> 01:41:16,058
Wha... Wha...
Well, there you are!

1574
01:41:17,537 --> 01:41:21,668
I've been looking
all over for you.

1575
01:41:21,743 --> 01:41:25,646
Oh. Wasn't it cold
out here?

1576
01:41:27,951 --> 01:41:32,686
Hmm? l...
I don't mind if I do.

1577
01:41:32,758 --> 01:41:36,126
That'd warm us up,
wouldn't it?

1578
01:41:36,195 --> 01:41:39,563
No, Charlie's would be
fine. Yeah, just fine.

1579
01:41:42,771 --> 01:41:45,172
Here.
Oh, Mr. Dowd?

1580
01:41:45,241 --> 01:41:49,576
Mr. Dowd, don't take him
away. Let him stay with me.

1581
01:41:49,646 --> 01:41:54,551
Doctor, whatever he wants to do
is perfectly all right with me.

1582
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:57,112
He knows that.
It's up to you.

1583
01:41:57,190 --> 01:42:00,456
Would you like to stay
with the doctor? Hmm?

1584
01:42:03,231 --> 01:42:06,998
No, I-I don't mind.

1585
01:42:12,844 --> 01:42:15,780
Have you ever been
to Akron?

1586
01:42:15,848 --> 01:42:19,182
Hmm? Akron.

1587
01:42:33,538 --> 01:42:37,703
Now, where is Elwood? Elwood,
we've been waiting for you.

1588
01:42:37,777 --> 01:42:40,679
I'm sorry, Veta. We've lost
the car. The Judge took it.

1589
01:42:40,747 --> 01:42:43,182
We'll have to go to the
corner and wait for a bus.

1590
01:42:43,251 --> 01:42:45,880
Hurry up, dear.

1591
01:42:45,955 --> 01:42:49,050
Good night, Mr. Shimelplatzer. Good night.

1592
01:42:54,967 --> 01:42:57,732
Was anything
the matter?

1593
01:42:57,804 --> 01:43:02,037
No, I, I thought you decided
to stay with Dr. Chumley.

1594
01:43:02,643 --> 01:43:05,272
You... Huh?

1595
01:43:05,347 --> 01:43:08,146
You...

1596
01:43:08,217 --> 01:43:10,778
Well, thank you,
Harvey.

1597
01:43:10,854 --> 01:43:13,756
I prefer you too.
