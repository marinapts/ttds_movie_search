1
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:11,157
We are currently on a family trip.

2
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:14,195
If you need to reach us,
please call tomorrow.

3
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:16,128
Be happy!

4
00:07:42,138 --> 00:07:43,628
Open the door.

5
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,199
You have the keys!

6
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:10,460
You wanted to go on a trip so badly.
What's wrong now?

7
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:13,133
You call that a trip?
It was hell.

8
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:18,968
Get rid of that right now!

9
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:28,250
Shoot me. Shoot me.
Please make my day.

10
00:09:58,341 --> 00:10:00,536
Why aren't you picking up?

11
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:02,406
Are you still angry at me?

12
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,578
I'm sorry.
Hurry and pick up.

13
00:10:09,018 --> 00:10:11,418
I've done everything for you!
What are you unsatisfied with?

14
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:13,146
You are driving me nuts!

15
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:15,852
Pick up the phone!

16
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:17,757
Damn it!

17
00:14:57,406 --> 00:14:59,067
Pick up the phone now!

18
00:15:00,843 --> 00:15:02,504
You want to see me
go crazy again?

19
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:06,404
I want to talk, so pick up!

20
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:12,079
If you don't answer the phone,
I will go home right now.

21
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:58,872
What are you doing
with all the doors open?

22
00:18:59,482 --> 00:19:02,542
And can't you answer the phone?

23
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:05,113
I couldn't get any work done
on my business trip!

24
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:08,789
Why are you ignoring me?
Do I look that foolish to you?

25
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:10,715
Am I your slave?

26
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:15,020
What do I need to do?

27
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:17,064
Think it's easy to live this well?

28
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:20,035
I told you not to wear this!

29
00:19:20,469 --> 00:19:22,801
Why do you keep doing
the things I hate?

30
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:32,612
I'm sorry.

31
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,815
I'm sorry.

32
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:38,251
I don't know why I act this way.

33
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:41,548
I love you.

34
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:45,559
Please make me happy.

35
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:55,737
Why? Why do you make
me feel so wretched?

36
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,005
For once let me do as I want to!

37
00:19:58,841 --> 00:20:02,038
Think I'll devour you?
Am I some insect?

38
00:20:02,178 --> 00:20:06,308
Just please hold still. Please.

39
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:29,995
What the hell?

40
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,834
Who's playing golf in my yard?

41
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:41,108
How'd you get in here?

42
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:47,146
Hello? Is this the police?

43
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,658
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

44
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:59,996
Hello? My house is...

45
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:46,427
Hi, this is Oak Jin-gon.

46
00:24:46,762 --> 00:24:48,889
I'm abroad right now
for a photo shoot.

47
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:53,023
If you need to reach me,
please call 011-342-3464.

48
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:54,627
Thanks.

49
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,148
Hi, you've reached the home
of Ji-eun and Hyun-soo.

50
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:53,051
We're in Hawaii now
for our three year anniversary

51
00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:57,985
If you have something to say,
please leave a message after the beep

52
00:35:44,052 --> 00:35:45,212
What the hell's this?

53
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:03,126
See if they've taken anything.

54
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:19,218
Honey! Honey!

55
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,049
Who the hell are you?

56
00:36:21,156 --> 00:36:23,624
What are you drunk idiots
doing in my home?

57
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,353
And why are you two
wearing our pajamas?

58
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:28,394
- Anything stolen?
- No.

59
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:31,190
If you're not thieves,
then what are you?

60
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:23,540
Mi-young, open your eyes!

61
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:25,841
Mi-young!

62
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:28,178
Mi-young, wake up!

63
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:29,743
Mi-young!

64
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:32,179
Mi-young, are you alright?

65
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:34,184
Mi-young!

66
00:38:35,423 --> 00:38:37,220
Mi-young, wake up!

67
00:38:37,325 --> 00:38:40,021
Wake up! Mi-young!

68
00:38:41,162 --> 00:38:43,289
Mi-young! Mi-young!

69
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:46,433
Mi-young, wake up!

70
00:38:46,935 --> 00:38:49,301
Please open your eyes!

71
00:44:45,226 --> 00:44:47,592
We are off to Jeju Island!

72
00:44:47,828 --> 00:44:50,490
If you need to contact us
please call back in three days!

73
00:44:50,598 --> 00:44:51,963
Be happy!

74
00:46:04,939 --> 00:46:07,134
Dad, did you call?

75
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:09,241
Are you okay, dad?

76
00:46:10,077 --> 00:46:11,339
Hello?

77
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:12,568
Hello...

78
00:47:01,629 --> 00:47:03,062
Dad!

79
00:47:05,933 --> 00:47:06,957
Father!

80
00:47:12,606 --> 00:47:13,834
Who are you people?

81
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:16,275
What are you doing
in my father's home?

82
00:47:16,544 --> 00:47:18,341
Where's father?

83
00:47:20,815 --> 00:47:22,749
- Father!
- Father!

84
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:25,576
- He's not here.
- What?

85
00:47:26,287 --> 00:47:28,346
You two.
Stay where you are.

86
00:47:28,756 --> 00:47:30,018
Come outside.

87
00:47:35,529 --> 00:47:37,588
Hello? This is the police, right?

88
00:47:37,798 --> 00:47:40,961
Yes, I have a situation here.
Please come quickly.

89
00:47:52,413 --> 00:47:53,641
What did you do to the old man?

90
00:47:54,949 --> 00:47:56,382
Sweetheart, you tell me.

91
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:58,111
You killed him, right?

92
00:48:01,222 --> 00:48:02,348
What's this?

93
00:48:06,393 --> 00:48:10,022
I see you've broken into
many other homes.

94
00:48:10,531 --> 00:48:12,999
So you took pictures
as if it was your own home.

95
00:48:15,936 --> 00:48:18,530
Officer Lee, see if their owners
reported a burglary.

96
00:48:18,606 --> 00:48:19,937
Yes, sir.

97
00:48:21,008 --> 00:48:24,034
You two. What did you steal
from all these homes?

98
00:48:28,215 --> 00:48:30,115
This punk needs to learn a lesson.

99
00:48:32,453 --> 00:48:33,750
Take the woman outside.

100
00:49:31,745 --> 00:49:33,474
Sorry to keep you waiting.

101
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:36,713
He buried him secretly
near his apartment.

102
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:38,446
What?

103
00:49:38,686 --> 00:49:40,051
- Officer Lee!
- Yes, sir!

104
00:49:40,754 --> 00:49:43,188
Take the CIS team
to his father's apartment.

105
00:49:55,636 --> 00:49:57,297
Open the lid.

106
00:50:06,513 --> 00:50:07,605
Father...

107
00:50:08,882 --> 00:50:10,110
Father!

108
00:50:10,784 --> 00:50:12,809
Doesn't look like
he was buried in secret

109
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,182
Father.

110
00:50:18,092 --> 00:50:23,621
Missing Person Report

111
00:50:26,433 --> 00:50:27,764
This is you, isn't it?

112
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:50,918
Yes?

113
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:53,616
Yes, I understand.

114
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,100
Illegal entry. Murder.

115
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:05,461
Abandoning a dead body.
Kidnapping.

116
00:51:07,508 --> 00:51:09,976
If you have any others,
tell me now.

117
00:51:11,078 --> 00:51:12,375
What did you do to that woman?

118
00:51:13,247 --> 00:51:14,874
What did you do to her
to keep her so silent?

119
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,710
Sir, he's clean.

120
00:51:23,524 --> 00:51:26,925
Also, I called some of the houses
he shot with the camera,

121
00:51:27,895 --> 00:51:29,624
and they said nothing was stolen

122
00:51:30,397 --> 00:51:31,523
Really?

123
00:51:32,933 --> 00:51:34,924
- Bring her husband when he comes.
- Yes, sir.

124
00:51:44,011 --> 00:51:46,809
You even have a college degree.
So why'd you break into their homes?

125
00:51:47,281 --> 00:51:48,407
Sir, he's here.

126
00:51:49,283 --> 00:51:50,545
Tell him to come in.

127
00:51:57,991 --> 00:51:59,856
Lee Min-kyu, right?

128
00:52:00,227 --> 00:52:01,353
Yes.

129
00:52:02,896 --> 00:52:04,158
She's all yours.

130
00:52:14,942 --> 00:52:16,432
Son of a bitch!

131
00:52:19,446 --> 00:52:20,504
Stop it!

132
00:52:20,614 --> 00:52:23,082
Let go!
I'm gonna kill that bastard!

133
00:52:24,284 --> 00:52:25,615
Let's go.

134
00:52:30,124 --> 00:52:31,284
Sir!

135
00:52:31,992 --> 00:52:33,721
The autopsy results
have come out.

136
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,322
It's not murder, it's lung cancer.

137
00:52:38,098 --> 00:52:40,259
What? Lung cancer?

138
00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:43,532
- Are they sure?
- Yes, I understand.

139
00:52:43,871 --> 00:52:48,308
He was delicately shrouded.
Apart from a real ceremony,

140
00:52:48,709 --> 00:52:51,371
he buried his body
better than any son could.

141
00:52:54,181 --> 00:52:57,082
He doesn't seem
like a bad person to me.

142
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,017
- Wait outside.
- Yes, sir.

143
00:53:14,201 --> 00:53:15,725
Well, you're free from
the homicide charge.

144
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,237
So how was she?

145
00:53:18,906 --> 00:53:20,498
You liked forcing her, right?

146
00:53:23,677 --> 00:53:24,905
What are you looking at?

147
00:53:29,516 --> 00:53:30,813
Don't smile.

148
00:53:49,336 --> 00:53:51,497
Your favorite plant over there...

149
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,831
I knew you'd come back
so I took good care of it.

150
00:53:55,709 --> 00:53:57,677
It looks healthy, doesn't it?

151
00:54:00,681 --> 00:54:03,514
I've thought things out
and I'd been too much.

152
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:07,384
I'll be good from now on.

153
00:54:10,757 --> 00:54:15,251
Okay, I won't if
you don't want me to.

154
00:54:16,897 --> 00:54:19,229
I've changed, you see?

155
00:54:20,534 --> 00:54:25,198
Oh yeah, while you were gone,
I sent plenty of money to your folks

156
00:54:58,739 --> 00:55:02,869
If it's that hard to withstand,
then do what you like.

157
00:56:00,033 --> 00:56:02,126
Isn't he being too harsh?

158
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,564
Smile again.

159
00:56:48,482 --> 00:56:50,074
Let go, you bastard!

160
00:56:54,087 --> 00:56:56,385
Son of a bitch!

161
00:57:45,772 --> 00:57:47,069
Sit down!

162
00:57:51,478 --> 00:57:53,241
Sit down!

163
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,531
Prisoner 2904!

164
00:59:31,378 --> 00:59:35,337
Playing games with me, you punk?
You scared me!

165
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:37,177
Try that again.

166
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:38,942
Today, you go hungry.

167
01:00:21,261 --> 01:00:23,195
Don't pretend you're sleeping.

168
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:28,832
I've been thinking about us,
and I feel like a real dumb ass.

169
01:00:29,002 --> 01:00:30,970
Was I that bad to you?

170
01:00:31,771 --> 01:00:33,398
Tell me!

171
01:00:36,676 --> 01:00:40,009
I never wanted to ask this,
but I have to.

172
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,605
What did he do to you?

173
01:00:44,618 --> 01:00:46,483
Did he do this?

174
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,755
He did this, but you stayed still?

175
01:00:49,923 --> 01:00:51,584
Like this?

176
01:00:52,525 --> 01:00:54,823
Like this? Like this?

177
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:18,909
Prisoner 2904!

178
01:01:19,419 --> 01:01:21,410
Prisoner 2904!

179
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,529
You son of a bitch!

180
01:01:38,471 --> 01:01:40,769
Why do you keep hiding?

181
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,170
Wanna disappear
from the world altogether?

182
01:01:44,611 --> 01:01:47,842
If you pull that again,
I'll kill you.

183
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:12,258
Can I help you?

184
01:04:15,261 --> 01:04:17,058
Excuse me!

185
01:04:57,036 --> 01:04:59,800
- You're cleaning it again?
- Hi, honey.

186
01:05:03,176 --> 01:05:05,110
Who is she?

187
01:05:06,613 --> 01:05:08,342
I don't know.

188
01:05:12,218 --> 01:05:14,049
Let her sleep.

189
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:59,098
Where have you been?

190
01:05:59,265 --> 01:06:01,460
I told you to call me
if you go out!

191
01:06:02,435 --> 01:06:04,369
Where have you been?

192
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:26,345
You're behind me, aren't you?

193
01:07:27,286 --> 01:07:29,880
The human eye sees
within the 180 degree angle.

194
01:07:30,223 --> 01:07:33,351
So you're hiding
in the other 180 degrees?

195
01:07:34,027 --> 01:07:36,086
But that's impossible!

196
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:39,996
You bastard!

197
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:47,933
You need more practice.
And take care of the shadow.

198
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:51,306
And you'll have to calculate
the human mind, idiot!

199
01:07:51,544 --> 01:07:53,512
You crazy bastard.

200
01:07:53,913 --> 01:07:57,610
Even if you cover all that
what are you gonna do?

201
01:09:05,184 --> 01:09:08,551
Let's move out of here.
First thing tomorrow.

202
01:09:09,856 --> 01:09:13,019
You're waiting for him
to finish his sentence, aren't you?

203
01:09:13,826 --> 01:09:15,657
I'm right, aren't I?

204
01:09:22,034 --> 01:09:24,764
A moving service please.
Hello?

205
01:09:25,238 --> 01:09:26,728
What's with you?

206
01:09:31,344 --> 01:09:33,369
Fine, then.

207
01:09:34,013 --> 01:09:36,106
Let's wait together for him.

208
01:09:36,449 --> 01:09:39,145
I dare you to come,
you son of a bitch.

209
01:09:40,653 --> 01:09:43,178
Prisoner 2904! Your meal!

210
01:09:46,025 --> 01:09:48,220
Prisoner 2904!

211
01:09:48,728 --> 01:09:52,391
When I go in this time,
I'll kill you for sure!

212
01:10:01,207 --> 01:10:05,109
You're behind me, aren't you?

213
01:10:05,645 --> 01:10:08,011
Trying to escape?

214
01:10:21,561 --> 01:10:23,256
Bastard...

215
01:10:23,396 --> 01:10:25,762
You think you can play with me now,
don't you?

216
01:10:35,474 --> 01:10:37,874
You fucking ghost.

217
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:51,783
Come out!

218
01:11:17,116 --> 01:11:20,051
We have a laundry machine.
Why go through the trouble?

219
01:12:28,154 --> 01:12:29,678
Hello?

220
01:12:30,489 --> 01:12:32,252
The police?

221
01:12:33,292 --> 01:12:35,055
Yes, I understand.

222
01:12:36,963 --> 01:12:38,760
That bastard is out now.

223
01:12:42,735 --> 01:12:45,829
Son of a bitch,
I dare you to show up.

224
01:12:47,573 --> 01:12:49,165
Tell me.

225
01:12:50,876 --> 01:12:52,605
Tell me!

226
01:12:53,612 --> 01:12:56,274
Why'd you turn off your phone?

227
01:12:56,549 --> 01:12:59,541
- Know how many times I've called you?
- I told you!

228
01:12:59,618 --> 01:13:01,142
I told you many times!

229
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:03,611
My battery ran out.

230
01:13:05,224 --> 01:13:06,851
Rotten bastard.

231
01:13:07,193 --> 01:13:09,127
Think I'm that stupid?

232
01:13:09,628 --> 01:13:11,323
Who did you meet?

233
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:14,497
What the hell's wrong with you?
Are you mentally sick?

234
01:13:14,633 --> 01:13:16,624
You made me this way.

235
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:21,133
Who's the girl who always
calls late at night?

236
01:13:21,307 --> 01:13:23,275
Let's stop this.

237
01:13:25,411 --> 01:13:26,844
Did you just hear something?

238
01:13:26,946 --> 01:13:29,244
- What are you talking about?
- Hold on.

239
01:13:29,382 --> 01:13:31,316
I think someone's in the house.

240
01:13:31,417 --> 01:13:33,715
Who cares whether
someone's here or not.

241
01:13:34,387 --> 01:13:37,686
- I'm the idiot for trusting...
- No, I'm certain someone's in here.

242
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:40,256
- Don't play the psycho act with me.
- Hold on.

243
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,019
Someone's here for sure.

244
01:13:53,639 --> 01:13:55,368
So who's here?

245
01:13:55,441 --> 01:13:57,068
I swear someone's here.

246
01:13:57,109 --> 01:13:59,737
I don't wanna hear it!
I don't trust you at all!

247
01:14:03,516 --> 01:14:05,381
You see?
I told you someone was here.

248
01:15:15,121 --> 01:15:17,681
Oh my goodness!
You scared me.

249
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:20,418
I did? So how was your day?

250
01:15:20,526 --> 01:15:21,720
Good.

251
01:15:23,729 --> 01:15:26,425
Why didn't you tidy up the sofa?

252
01:15:26,899 --> 01:15:28,730
I did this morning.

253
01:15:29,535 --> 01:15:31,560
But why is it so messy?

254
01:15:31,937 --> 01:15:33,131
That's strange.

255
01:15:44,216 --> 01:15:45,513
Can't sleep?

256
01:15:47,319 --> 01:15:48,809
Want me to sing you a lullaby?

257
01:15:51,857 --> 01:15:53,882
I miss you, too.

258
01:15:56,328 --> 01:15:57,522
Wanna come over?

259
01:16:12,077 --> 01:16:13,408
Hey, it's weird.

260
01:16:14,914 --> 01:16:16,711
It feels like someone's in my place.

261
01:16:17,316 --> 01:16:18,544
Yeah.

262
01:16:19,218 --> 01:16:20,378
Then hurry up.

263
01:16:49,114 --> 01:16:50,581
So who's in your place?

264
01:16:50,849 --> 01:16:53,317
I didn't see anyone.
I just felt it.

265
01:16:53,752 --> 01:16:55,185
That's impossible.

266
01:16:56,255 --> 01:16:57,984
Am I just being too sensitive?

267
01:17:01,961 --> 01:17:04,521
- Isn't this your work?
- You haven't seen it yet?

268
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:06,222
- Can I look at it?
- Yup.

269
01:17:11,804 --> 01:17:14,068
- Stop it.
- Come on.

270
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:27,451
- I thought someone was here?
- Let him watch.

271
01:17:38,297 --> 01:17:40,663
- What's wrong?
- I think someone's watching

272
01:17:41,133 --> 01:17:42,657
I'm scared.

273
01:17:43,102 --> 01:17:45,832
You see? What did I tell you?

274
01:17:56,215 --> 01:17:57,147
What is it?

275
01:17:57,249 --> 01:17:59,581
Why'd you hang up an empty frame?
It's creepy.

276
01:19:08,153 --> 01:19:10,178
I think someone's here.

277
01:19:10,756 --> 01:19:12,155
Could it be him?

278
01:19:21,467 --> 01:19:23,526
He's bad luck,
that son of a bitch.

279
01:19:25,904 --> 01:19:28,737
Honey, stay still.

280
01:20:44,183 --> 01:20:47,175
What are you doing up?

281
01:20:51,557 --> 01:20:52,922
I love you.

282
01:20:53,759 --> 01:20:54,885
What?

283
01:21:03,068 --> 01:21:04,558
Honey...

284
01:21:55,053 --> 01:21:56,680
Breakfast is ready!

285
01:22:23,081 --> 01:22:25,948
What's made you so happy?
Stop smiling and eat.

286
01:22:31,189 --> 01:22:32,315
It's strange.

287
01:22:32,925 --> 01:22:35,086
It feels like someone's been here
since last night.

288
01:22:56,315 --> 01:22:58,215
What are you laughing for?

289
01:22:58,417 --> 01:22:59,782
Are you that happy?

290
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,658
Don't open the door
to just anybody.
