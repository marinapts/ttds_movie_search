1
00:00:41,932 --> 00:00:46,811
- 7:45 on this beautiful, almost balmy
22nd of September in Schenectady.

2
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:48,562
And it's the first day of fall.

3
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,482
So in honor of that fact,
we have Elke Putzkammer...

4
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,734
...professor of literature
at Union college...

5
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:56,153
...to talk about autumn in poetry
and literature.

6
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:58,239
- Good morning, professor.
- Hi, Alex.

7
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:01,867
So, what about it? Why do
so many people write about the fall?

8
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:05,579
Well, I think it's seen
as the beginning of the end, really.

9
00:01:05,747 --> 00:01:09,542
If the year is a life, then September,
the beginning of fall...

10
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:12,962
...is when the bloom is off the rose
and things start to die.

11
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,049
It's a melancholy month and maybe
because of that, quite beautiful.

12
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:19,093
Is there something
you might read to us?

13
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:21,470
Oh, I'd love to.

14
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:25,516
Whoever has no house now
Will never have one.

15
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:29,061
Whoever is alone will stay alone

16
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:33,774
Will sit, read, write long letters
Through the evening

17
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:37,445
And wander the boulevards
Up and down, restlessly

18
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:39,864
While the dry leaves are blowing

19
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:42,324
Goodness, that harsh, isn't it?

20
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:46,662
Well, perhaps. But truthful.

21
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:51,125
Mommy, done.

22
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:53,252
Okay.

23
00:01:54,796 --> 00:01:56,088
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

24
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:58,340
- I tried not to wake you.
- Well, thanks.

25
00:01:58,508 --> 00:02:00,843
You didn't. I just...
You know, I couldn't get up.

26
00:02:07,642 --> 00:02:10,186
- Caden, can you get that?
- It's Maria, I don't want to.

27
00:02:10,353 --> 00:02:13,481
- Caden... Oh, that's weird.
- Hey, it's me. How are you?

28
00:02:13,648 --> 00:02:15,858
Mommy, is something wrong
with my poop?

29
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:19,820
No, honey, it's just green.
You probably ate something green.

30
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:23,407
I didn't. What's wrong with me?

31
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:26,744
I have to get that, Olive.
You're gonna be fine, okay?

32
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:29,205
- But, Mommy...
- Yeah, I'll be right back, Olive.

33
00:02:29,372 --> 00:02:33,042
Oh, nothing.
Just wiping Olive's ass. You?

34
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,754
- An earthquake in Kashmir...
- Oh, you're kidding. Holy fuck.

35
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:41,008
...has killed an estimated 73,000...
- I don't feel well.

36
00:02:41,718 --> 00:02:43,260
Oh, my goodness.

37
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:06,242
- March in Washington, D.c., today,
October 15th.

38
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:10,955
- Harold Pinter died.
- Well, he's old, right?

39
00:03:11,122 --> 00:03:13,332
- No, wait. He won the Nobel Prize.
- Mom.

40
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,793
- What, honey?
- Do you need to look at my poop?

41
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:20,589
- You sure it's all right?
- It's fine, Olive. Just flush.

42
00:03:20,757 --> 00:03:23,467
What if it's alive? What if I kill it?

43
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:25,844
- It's green like plants.
- It's not alive, honey.

44
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:29,765
Remember the production of
The Dumb Waiter I did at Albanyfest?

45
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,477
Have your oatmeal, honey.

46
00:03:34,354 --> 00:03:37,273
- I want peanut butter and jelly.
- You said oatmeal.

47
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,818
- This isn't a restaurant.
- I don't want oatmeal.

48
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:43,487
- Okay. Fine.
- Mommy, I'm sorry.

49
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:48,576
They found avian flu in Turkey.
In the country Turkey, not turkeys.

50
00:03:48,743 --> 00:03:52,538
- Can I watch TV till school?
- In some chickens. Yeah.

51
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,294
There is a secret something at play
under the surface...

52
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:01,338
...growing like an invisible virus
of thought.

53
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:03,591
But you're being changed by it...

54
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:05,467
- Milk's expired.
- Okay.

55
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:06,677
Jesus.

56
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:10,014
- You better eat this.
- I will.

57
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:12,641
Yeah.

58
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:15,102
How did I guess
you'd ask me that question?

59
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,813
Happy Halloween, Schenectady.

60
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:21,191
And how long have you been
in New York for?

61
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,195
The first black graduate
of the University of Alabama died.

62
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:27,281
Vivian Malone Jones.

63
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:32,036
Stroke, 63.

64
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:50,638
Fuck!

65
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:54,308
God! Somebody! Adele, help!

66
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,979
- Jesus, Caden, what the fuck?
- I was shaving and the thing flew off!

67
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:01,649
Oh, my God!
Jesus, look at your head.

68
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:03,901
Oh, shit.

69
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:06,070
Oh, God, I can't turn it.

70
00:05:06,738 --> 00:05:08,489
Oh, wait.

71
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:16,914
- Mommy, Daddy has blood.
- Yeah.

72
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:20,751
- Will there be a scar?
- Probably. It looks like a mud flap.

73
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,213
- I prefer there not to be a scar.
- Yeah.

74
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,173
That fellow is annoying.

75
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:28,884
He's in here every week,
like clockwork.

76
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:32,721
There. I think that should...
Let's see.

77
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:37,601
- What?
- Change in bowel movements?

78
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:40,854
It's a little more yellow than usual.
Why?

79
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:45,776
Yeah, I'd like you to see
an ophthalmologist.

80
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:48,278
- A neurologist?
- What? No.

81
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:51,240
An ophthalmologist.
I said, ophthalmologist.

82
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:53,492
Do you hear that?

83
00:05:53,827 --> 00:05:55,244
Yeah.

84
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:59,123
And today is Tuesday.
Mommy, is today Tuesday?

85
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,210
No, honey, today is Friday.
So, what exactly did he say?

86
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:12,678
That my pupils weren't properly
opening and closing.

87
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:14,138
Dilating.

88
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:16,640
- No.
- Yeah.

89
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:19,518
- I don't think that's what he said.
- Yes.

90
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:22,229
- That's not what he said.
- Is it the bump to your head?

91
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:24,022
He doesn't know. Maybe.

92
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,317
He said he doesn't think so,
but maybe. But he doesn't know.

93
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:30,988
- But maybe. Who knows?
- Okay, Jesus, Caden, I got it.

94
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:34,032
- He doesn't know...
- Sorry. I'm a little anxious.

95
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,660
- Did you have to get a shot, Daddy?
- No, honey.

96
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:39,705
- It's the start of something awful.
- Do I have to get a shot?

97
00:06:39,873 --> 00:06:42,499
- Course not.
- Did you tell him I have green poo?

98
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:44,918
- It's fucked timing.
- Call the plumber. Hey.

99
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:47,129
Sorry. I have rehearsal. Fuck.

100
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:51,341
- Hey, come on.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry. Everybody, sorry.

101
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:53,677
How many years
until I have to get more shots?

102
00:06:53,845 --> 00:07:00,184
- Not for a really long time, babe.
- A million years?

103
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:04,146
- Remember what Dr. Woodman said...
- Dad, what's a plumber?

104
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:06,231
- He's a man...
- Or a woman, Dad.

105
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:13,030
Right. He's a man or a woman
who fixes sinks and toilets and...

106
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:15,240
- Do you know what pipes are?
- No.

107
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:18,869
- Hey, Jim. I had an accident.
- Like to smoke out of?

108
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:22,164
A different kind of pipe, honey.
All right, bye.

109
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:28,378
Houses have pipes,
and they're made of...

110
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:31,298
They're like tubes,
and they're behind the walls...

111
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:34,593
...and they're under the floors
and everywhere.

112
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:36,220
- And...
- What's the matter?

113
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:38,680
- Every single where?
- It's okay, honey.

114
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:41,642
They just carry water
to and from sinks and toilets.

115
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,812
- It's like in your body. You have veins.
- Capillaries.

116
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:46,688
Capillaries filled with blood.

117
00:07:46,856 --> 00:07:50,400
I have blood? I don't want blood.
I don't want blood.

118
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,820
- What are you doing?
- Trying to explain plumbing.

119
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:54,446
- Stop.
- I can't do this now.

120
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:58,242
- Don't worry, you don't have blood.
- Don't tell her she doesn't have blood.

121
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:01,245
- Caden, stop it.
- I don't want blood.

122
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:10,754
Thanks for getting me in right away.

123
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:17,761
- Was it the bump to the head?
- No.

124
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:25,936
Could be, but I think we need
to get you to a neurologist.

125
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:28,689
- Neurologist?
- It's a brain expert.

126
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:30,190
I know what a neurologist is.

127
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:34,444
- I thought from the way you asked...
- I just thought you said "urologist. "

128
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:42,953
- Why do I need to see a neurologist?
- Just for a look-see.

129
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:46,790
The eyes are part of the brain,
after all.

130
00:08:48,084 --> 00:08:50,460
No, that's not true, is it?

131
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:58,010
- Why would I say it if it weren't true?
- It doesn't seem right.

132
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:01,430
Like morally correct,
or "right" as in accurate?

133
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,480
I don't know. Accurate, I guess?

134
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:13,984
Interesting.

135
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:17,070
Now, when you kick off, boy,
I want a 70-yard boot.

136
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:19,239
And get right down the field
under the ball.

137
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:23,327
And when you hit, hit low and hit hard,
because it's important, boy.

138
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:25,913
There's all kinds of important people
in the stands.

139
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,625
And the first thing you know... Ben?

140
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:32,336
Ben, where do I?

141
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:37,507
- Ben, how do I?
- Willy, you coming up?

142
00:09:38,301 --> 00:09:40,135
Willy?

143
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,180
Willy, answer me.

144
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:47,434
Willy! No!

145
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:49,853
- Oh, Jesus, come on.
- Oh, crap.

146
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:52,022
Claire, are you okay?
What's happening here?

147
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,441
It's too late in the game
to have these problems.

148
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:57,027
- I know, Caden. I'm sorry. We'll get it.
- Oh, my God.

149
00:09:57,195 --> 00:10:01,365
- You okay?
- Yeah, I think the wig saved my life.

150
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:04,368
- Yeah.
- It's okay, honestly.

151
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:06,078
That was good, Tom.

152
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:07,329
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

153
00:10:07,497 --> 00:10:10,749
I was trying something different.
I was crashing differently.

154
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:14,252
- Ambivalently.
- Yeah, I saw that. I liked it.

155
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:24,221
Try to keep in mind that
a young person playing Willy Loman...

156
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:28,517
...thinks he's only pretending
to be at the end of a life full of despair.

157
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:31,645
But the tragedy is that we know
that you, the young actor...

158
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:35,232
...will end up in this very place
of desolation.

159
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,067
Okay.

160
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:41,905
That's great.

161
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,410
- Let's try it again. How long, David?
- I think 15.

162
00:10:49,205 --> 00:10:50,831
Anything?

163
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,584
So now what?

164
00:10:58,423 --> 00:11:00,549
- Hey.
- Hey.

165
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:04,928
- In search of the elusive signal.
- The signal's good here, oddly.

166
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:08,140
- That is odd.
- I know. Cell phones, they're crazy.

167
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:10,726
- See you in a few.
- Yep.

168
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:18,108
Yeah, Dr. Heshborg said
I should see a Dr. Scoriano.

169
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:21,737
My pupils don't work.

170
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:31,413
I think I have blood in my stool.

171
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:37,127
That stool in your office?

172
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:42,466
- When I was pregnant with Olive.
- What was it like?

173
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:46,094
I don't know. Hopeful or something.
Like something was gonna change.

174
00:11:46,262 --> 00:11:48,305
- Yeah, something did. No?
- Yeah.

175
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:50,098
- Yeah, of course.
- I mean, bigtime.

176
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:53,101
I mean, maybe not as much
as I'd hoped.

177
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:55,687
I'm sorry.
That's a terrible thing to say.

178
00:11:55,855 --> 00:11:59,566
There are no terrible things to say
in here, only true and false.

179
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:04,154
- Can I say something awful?
- Yes, please do.

180
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:09,659
I've fantasized about Caden dying.

181
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:15,874
Being able to start again, guilt-free.

182
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:20,462
I know that's... That's bad.

183
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:24,174
- Caden, does that feel terrible?
- Yeah.

184
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:26,301
Okay, good.

185
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:46,363
It's a nightmare in there.

186
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:49,282
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:01,920
So, I'm reading The Trial.

188
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:03,547
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

189
00:13:05,174 --> 00:13:08,051
- You like?
- Love.

190
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:11,680
I'm such an idiot
for not knowing about this book.

191
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:14,808
- It's famous, as it turns out.
- Yeah.

192
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:17,602
You're not an idiot.

193
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:22,607
Then you say:

194
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:27,904
"In fact, Hazel, you're very bright,
and I love your eyes. "

195
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:35,912
- In fact, Hazel, you're very bright.
- Oh, am I?

196
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,042
- And I love your eyes.
- Do you? Oh, you're a darling.

197
00:13:47,216 --> 00:13:49,301
Then what do I say?

198
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:53,263
- I can't say what then you say.
- Why?

199
00:13:53,848 --> 00:13:56,099
Because it's dirty.

200
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,230
Could you step out for a second?

201
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:06,318
Go ahead. I've seen boy parts.

202
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:18,121
- Can I take a piss in your sink?
- Yeah, sure. I guess.

203
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:30,634
We're sold out.

204
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:32,594
Great.

205
00:14:40,228 --> 00:14:42,145
Gorgeous.

206
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:45,273
Thanks.

207
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:49,069
- How was rehearsal?
- Awful.

208
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:52,989
We have 560 lighting cues.

209
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,160
- I don't why I make it so complicated.
- Because that's what you do.

210
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,162
Yeah.

211
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:05,877
We got through it though.
That's really pretty.

212
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:10,131
Caden, I'm sorry, I...

213
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:15,095
I can't come tonight. I'm sorry.

214
00:15:15,263 --> 00:15:18,431
I have two canvasses I have
to get ready to ship for tomorrow.

215
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:20,433
- I know it sucks...
- It's opening night.

216
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:24,104
I know. I wish I could come.
I would if I could.

217
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:26,273
- I've gotta get ready.
- Tomorrow...

218
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,192
I have to get ready.
I don't know what I'm gonna wear.

219
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:31,861
I have to figure out
what I'm gonna wear.

220
00:15:51,757 --> 00:15:53,508
Hey.

221
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:10,859
- Oh, boy, oh boy.
- Willy?

222
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:13,903
It's all right, I came back.

223
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:18,950
I hated myself tonight.

224
00:16:20,036 --> 00:16:22,412
- Plus, I'm so... Excuse me.
- Hey, Tom.

225
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,997
I'm so bloated and enormous.

226
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:26,708
No, you look good. You were great.
I was very pleased.

227
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:29,753
- You okay?
- Sorry. A little bit of a headache.

228
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,588
Willy Loman.

229
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:37,218
I just wanted to say thank you
for everything.

230
00:16:37,386 --> 00:16:39,596
You've been absolutely brilliant.

231
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,766
It's gonna be miserable
going ahead without you.

232
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:46,436
- I'll be around. I'll check in.
- I'm such a baby.

233
00:16:47,063 --> 00:16:49,064
Okay. I'm gonna go get drunk,
that's what.

234
00:16:49,231 --> 00:16:53,443
Okay. Claire. Sweetheart.

235
00:16:57,406 --> 00:17:00,325
- Good. Good job.
- Oh, don't worry, I'll get better.

236
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:03,078
- Good work.
- Don't worry, it'll get better.

237
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:09,209
Hey. I figured I'd better get in fast.

238
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:13,296
- Hey, you wanna sit?
- Yeah, yeah.

239
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:23,807
- Where's el wife-o?
- Had to work.

240
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:26,976
Her show in Berlin is in two weeks.

241
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:29,145
We're gonna go there
for like a month.

242
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:33,108
- Why do I like you so much?
- I couldn't begin to guess.

243
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:35,110
Me neither.

244
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,114
Do you get high, my friend?

245
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:43,493
You know, sometimes.

246
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,497
Do you want to now?
With me, in my car?

247
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:50,208
I get kind of...

248
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:54,295
...something when I'm stoned.

249
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:57,048
What does "something" mean?

250
00:17:57,675 --> 00:17:59,509
You know...

251
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,012
...bothered.

252
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,182
- What does "bothered" mean?
- You know.

253
00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:10,228
Bothered. Horny.

254
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,276
And me with a station wagon and all.
Could be dangerous.

255
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:20,864
- Yeah, could be.
- You're absolutely zero fun.

256
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:37,213
When are the reviews
gonna get here?

257
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:42,302
Don't know.

258
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:50,894
His best friends finger two babies...

259
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:53,438
One this big, one this big.
- And two kittens.

260
00:18:53,606 --> 00:18:57,484
- Hey.
- Hi, Caden. How'd it go?

261
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:00,945
- Hi.
- Hi.

262
00:19:01,113 --> 00:19:02,780
It's late.

263
00:19:04,074 --> 00:19:06,743
Maria came over
to keep me company because...

264
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:09,037
And we just lost track.
I got everything done.

265
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:14,292
But I'm sorry I missed your play.
I'm sorry. But how'd it go?

266
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:17,045
Great. We're a hit.

267
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:19,756
Reviews are great.

268
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:24,427
Times said it was brilliant casting
young people as Willy and Linda.

269
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:28,598
- That's great, Caden. Good for you.
- Great.

270
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:32,352
I can't wait to see it tomorrow.
That's... Tonight.

271
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:34,604
That's great.

272
00:19:35,397 --> 00:19:38,775
Wow, it's really late... Early.

273
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,110
Early.

274
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,572
It's late.
Hey, I would love to see it too.

275
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,284
- Can we get Maria a ticket?
- You're stoned.

276
00:19:49,578 --> 00:19:52,580
I mean, a little. It's, you know...
I don't know.

277
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:55,583
But are you happy with it?

278
00:19:55,751 --> 00:20:00,004
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love for you to see...
To know what you think.

279
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:02,215
It doesn't matter what I think.

280
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:07,804
Absolutely. It's all about
your artistic satisfaction, Caden.

281
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:20,149
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

282
00:20:31,412 --> 00:20:36,416
- I've always loved this house.
- Yes, it's a wonderful place.

283
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,919
The truth is, I never really imagined
I could afford it.

284
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:42,088
Well, the sellers
are very motivated now.

285
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:52,348
It's a scary decision.
I never thought I'd buy a house alone.

286
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:56,352
But, you know, I'm 36,
and I wonder what it is I'm waiting for.

287
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,315
- Home buying is always scary.
- And with the fire and all especially.

288
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:02,734
Well, it's a good size though,
2200 square feet...

289
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:05,320
...not including
the partially finished basement.

290
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:07,614
Oh, I don't know.

291
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:12,785
- I'm thinking I should go.
- It's a perfect size for someone alone.

292
00:21:12,953 --> 00:21:19,500
I like it, I do. I'm just really concerned
about dying in the fire.

293
00:21:19,835 --> 00:21:23,129
It's a big decision
how one prefers to die.

294
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:26,215
Would you like to meet my son?
Derek.

295
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:30,970
Derek's living in the basement
since his divorce, if that's okay.

296
00:21:31,138 --> 00:21:32,847
Hey, Mom.

297
00:21:38,562 --> 00:21:41,439
- Let's go, Ma.
- I want just a minute.

298
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:51,741
I never...

299
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:57,246
Forgive me, dear. I can't cry.

300
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,751
I don't know what it is,
but I can't cry.

301
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:09,342
It seems to me
that you're just on another trip.

302
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,096
I keep expecting you.
Why did you do it?

303
00:22:13,263 --> 00:22:17,266
I search and I search
and I can't understand it.

304
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:21,896
I made the last payment
on the house today.

305
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:26,776
We're free and clear.
We're free. We're free.

306
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:35,201
- Well done.
- Bravo.

307
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:40,998
- Well done. It was very successful.
- I thought it was wonderful.

308
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,251
Why did the older people
look so young?

309
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:45,962
It was a choice, Dad.
I'll explain later.

310
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:51,384
I can't get excited about your restaging
someone else's old play, it just...

311
00:22:51,552 --> 00:22:53,094
There's nothing personal in it.

312
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:55,680
People are coming out of the theater
crying.

313
00:22:55,848 --> 00:22:58,266
Great. Be a fucking tool
of suburban, blue-haired...

314
00:22:58,434 --> 00:23:00,184
...regional-theater subscribers.

315
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,145
- You didn't you think it was long?
- No.

316
00:23:02,312 --> 00:23:03,771
But what are you leaving behind?

317
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:06,232
You act as if you have forever
to figure it out.

318
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,901
When you're dead, there's no time.
The world is...

319
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:12,405
I don't know.
I slept maybe three hours.

320
00:23:12,573 --> 00:23:14,782
So we're both tired.

321
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:19,495
No, I cuddled with Olive all night.
It was great.

322
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:27,503
Morning. Morning.

323
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:32,925
- Morning, Caden.
- I think I might have arthritis.

324
00:23:33,093 --> 00:23:34,635
Friends on fire.

325
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:38,806
I'm going to.

326
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:45,938
No, I know exactly.
Okay, I will. I'll call you later.

327
00:23:46,106 --> 00:23:47,356
I know. You're right. Bye.

328
00:23:50,277 --> 00:23:52,820
My joints are stiff.

329
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:57,450
Who was that?

330
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,829
- Maria.
- Right.

331
00:24:02,372 --> 00:24:05,041
Three hours since you spoke.

332
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:08,878
Caden, I think I wanna go to Berlin
with just Olive.

333
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:15,301
- I think it would be good for us.
- Oh, Christ.

334
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:17,386
Morning, kiddos.

335
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:21,724
Why don't you want me to go?

336
00:24:21,892 --> 00:24:27,230
You know, I think it would be a good
thing for the two of us to do alone.

337
00:24:27,397 --> 00:24:31,067
How do you think I'm supposed
to respond to something like that?

338
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:36,739
- Want me to zip your coat up?
- Yeah.

339
00:24:41,662 --> 00:24:44,539
What's wrong with your face,
Daddy?

340
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,959
It's pustules.

341
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,170
It's called sycosis.

342
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:55,424
Spelled differently than "psychosis,"
but it sounds the same.

343
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:57,218
I don't know what that means.

344
00:24:57,386 --> 00:24:58,928
Of course not.

345
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:03,140
Well, there are two kinds of psychosis.
They're spelled differently.

346
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:08,020
P- S-Y is like if you're crazy,
like Mama.

347
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:11,941
S- Y is like these ugly things
on my face.

348
00:25:12,317 --> 00:25:14,902
- You could have both, though.
- I could, but I don't.

349
00:25:24,454 --> 00:25:26,747
Can I ask you something, Ad?

350
00:25:30,794 --> 00:25:33,588
Have I disappointed you somehow?

351
00:25:34,673 --> 00:25:38,885
I don't know what I'm doing.
We're just spending a little time apart.

352
00:25:43,265 --> 00:25:45,474
We'll talk when I get back, okay?

353
00:25:49,062 --> 00:25:53,149
Everyone is disappointing.
The more you know someone, it just...

354
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:57,987
This whole romantic-love thing,
it's just a projection anyway, right?

355
00:25:58,363 --> 00:26:00,531
I mean, I don't know.

356
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:07,371
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

357
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:11,626
I love you.

358
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:21,844
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know.

359
00:26:29,144 --> 00:26:30,728
We'll talk when I get back.

360
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:36,150
Okay?

361
00:26:48,163 --> 00:26:50,957
Flurostatin TR
allows you to live life...

362
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:55,044
...when it's your turn to face
the challenges of chemotherapy.

363
00:27:10,102 --> 00:27:13,229
Ask your doctor
if Flurostatin TR is right for you.

364
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:33,499
- And I'm on the first train
out of Palookaville.

365
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:36,335
- The Miracle Brush
can scour everything from bottles...

366
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:39,255
- Rise and shine...
- Lift those legs...

367
00:27:59,693 --> 00:28:03,320
- I'm lonely.
- Yes. Anything else?

368
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:08,117
- I'm hurt.
- Yes. And?

369
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,708
I think Adele's right.
I'm not doing anything real...

370
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:17,752
What would be real?

371
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:20,337
I'm afraid I'm gonna die.

372
00:28:21,423 --> 00:28:23,674
I don't know what's wrong with me.

373
00:28:23,842 --> 00:28:26,260
I wanna do something important
while I'm still here.

374
00:28:26,428 --> 00:28:30,806
That would be the time to do it. I have
a book that might help you get better.

375
00:28:30,974 --> 00:28:34,810
- Better?
- It's called Getting Better.

376
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:39,106
- Who wrote it?
- I did. All of these.

377
00:28:39,274 --> 00:28:42,651
- Wow, I never knew that.
- Yes. Well, wow, indeed.

378
00:28:44,988 --> 00:28:46,822
In conclusion... Cats eat rats...

379
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,117
Within his own plumbing...
Me who am as a raw nerve...

380
00:28:50,285 --> 00:28:52,828
Synthetic vaginal juices...
Substantial crease...

381
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:54,663
That's $45.

382
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:11,138
Five. Five.

383
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:14,225
Five.

384
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:18,229
Some fives. That's not good.

385
00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:21,357
Keep with the flossing.
We'll see you in three months.

386
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:25,694
Six. Six. Six.

387
00:29:25,862 --> 00:29:28,531
I'm gonna recommend
you see a periodontist.

388
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:30,825
He'll probably recommend
gum surgery.

389
00:29:37,082 --> 00:29:40,459
- Hello?
- Hey, I'm so glad I finally got you.

390
00:29:40,627 --> 00:29:43,754
- Hello, who is this?
- It's Caden.

391
00:29:43,922 --> 00:29:45,756
Ellen?

392
00:29:46,258 --> 00:29:49,885
It's Caden. I can't wait to see you
and Olive on the 12th...

393
00:29:50,053 --> 00:29:54,974
No, I have to go.
I'm sorry, there's a party. I'm famous.

394
00:29:55,142 --> 00:29:56,517
Have fun...

395
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:14,034
911, state your emergency.

396
00:30:14,202 --> 00:30:16,245
- I'm sick! I'm sick!
- Ma'am?

397
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,021
Mr. Cotard?

398
00:30:58,914 --> 00:31:00,998
Mr. Cotard.

399
00:31:11,092 --> 00:31:13,552
You've had a seizure of sorts.

400
00:31:15,931 --> 00:31:16,972
What does that mean?

401
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,310
Seems to be some synaptic
degradation, fungal in origin.

402
00:31:21,478 --> 00:31:23,646
Autonomic functions
are going haywire.

403
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,649
You'll lose your ability
to salivate, cry, et cetera.

404
00:31:26,816 --> 00:31:31,070
- Is it serious?
- We don't know. But, yes.

405
00:31:31,738 --> 00:31:34,073
We'll get you enrolled
in some biofeedback program.

406
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:37,159
Maybe you can learn
some sort of manual override.

407
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:52,341
We should get a drink.
It would be fun.

408
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:58,347
- It would be weird.
- I like weird. I like you. See?

409
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:02,476
Anyway, I don't wanna
make you uncomfortable, I...

410
00:32:04,688 --> 00:32:08,274
Okay, so I do
wanna make you uncomfortable.

411
00:32:19,577 --> 00:32:21,620
And what do we do with all this?

412
00:32:24,624 --> 00:32:28,002
You wanna come over to my place,
Cotard?

413
00:32:31,756 --> 00:32:35,843
I won't let you off the hook this time
by saying, "Never mind. "

414
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:38,554
Adele is only on vacation.

415
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:43,225
She hasn't called since she left.
It's been a year.

416
00:32:43,768 --> 00:32:46,020
It's been a week.

417
00:32:47,897 --> 00:32:50,441
I'm gonna buy you a calendar.

418
00:32:58,908 --> 00:33:00,826
Okay.

419
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:05,456
Just for one drink.

420
00:33:09,127 --> 00:33:12,171
Come on. Scraps for my scrapbook.

421
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,763
I can't... I really can't drink very much
because of my condition.

422
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,107
Did you put something in it?

423
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:36,528
If that's what it takes,
consider it done.

424
00:33:38,573 --> 00:33:41,658
Love potion number 69.

425
00:33:44,746 --> 00:33:47,206
- It's good.
- Does it make you wanna kiss me?

426
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:51,919
- Kind of.
- Tell me why.

427
00:33:52,504 --> 00:33:55,631
Because I feel a lot of longing.

428
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,384
Beg a girl, why don't you?

429
00:33:58,635 --> 00:34:00,469
- Please, Hazel.
- On your knees.

430
00:34:02,097 --> 00:34:03,764
What?

431
00:34:03,932 --> 00:34:07,768
I want you to beg me
on your knees for a kiss.

432
00:34:07,936 --> 00:34:09,520
Just for fun.

433
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:14,316
Why am I doing this?

434
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:18,153
For fun, baby.

435
00:34:21,908 --> 00:34:24,701
Will you help me
forget my troubles?

436
00:34:25,203 --> 00:34:27,079
Oh, kiddo.

437
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:30,332
You don't even know.

438
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:37,089
- What?
- I don't know.

439
00:34:37,424 --> 00:34:40,467
- What is it?
- I don't know, I'm sorry.

440
00:34:42,345 --> 00:34:44,221
I'm sorry.

441
00:34:46,182 --> 00:34:48,851
- What?
- I don't know, I'm just...

442
00:34:51,104 --> 00:34:54,273
I'm just really confused.

443
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,775
I'm sorry.

444
00:34:57,694 --> 00:34:59,236
I...

445
00:35:03,116 --> 00:35:06,452
I'm really sick.

446
00:35:08,037 --> 00:35:10,539
And I think I'm dying.

447
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:16,170
I have a kid, and I'm married.

448
00:35:21,092 --> 00:35:26,180
I just thought
this might change things, you know?

449
00:35:26,347 --> 00:35:31,059
I had a good time,
and I think you're a very nice person.

450
00:35:32,395 --> 00:35:36,106
That is just the wrong thing
to say right now, Caden.

451
00:35:48,578 --> 00:35:50,537
You should go.

452
00:35:56,461 --> 00:35:59,588
Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

453
00:36:00,173 --> 00:36:02,633
Hi. You know,
I haven't heard from you in a while...

454
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,427
...and I just thought I'd call
and say hi.

455
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:07,429
Hi, Hazel.

456
00:36:13,436 --> 00:36:16,271
Now. Now. Be here now.

457
00:36:17,357 --> 00:36:19,650
Olive wanted me to ask you
not to read her diary.

458
00:36:19,817 --> 00:36:23,403
She left it under her pillow
by mistake.

459
00:36:41,047 --> 00:36:43,590
Dear Mr. Cotard,
it is my pleasure to inform you...

460
00:36:43,758 --> 00:36:46,593
...that you have been named
a 2009 MacArthur Fellow.

461
00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:50,055
It is our hope that you will use
your newly found financial freedom...

462
00:36:50,223 --> 00:36:53,308
...to create something unflinchingly
true, profoundly beautiful...

463
00:36:53,476 --> 00:36:56,353
...and of unremitting value
to your community and to the world.

464
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:58,355
- I got this MacArthur grant.
- Oh, Caden.

465
00:36:58,523 --> 00:37:01,191
- Yeah, a lot of money.
- Know what you're gonna do with it?

466
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:05,737
Theater piece.
Something big and true and tough.

467
00:37:05,905 --> 00:37:08,156
I'm gonna finally put my real self
into something.

468
00:37:08,658 --> 00:37:12,578
What is your real self, do you think?

469
00:37:13,454 --> 00:37:15,372
I don't know yet.

470
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:19,334
The MacArthur is called
"the genius grant"...

471
00:37:19,502 --> 00:37:21,503
...and I wanna earn it.

472
00:37:21,671 --> 00:37:24,298
That's wonderful. God bless.

473
00:37:24,465 --> 00:37:27,801
I guess you'll have to discover
your real self, right?

474
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:29,511
Yeah.

475
00:37:30,722 --> 00:37:33,640
I wanted to ask you, how old are kids
when they start to write?

476
00:37:33,808 --> 00:37:36,685
There's an absolutely brilliant novel
written by a 4-year-old.

477
00:37:36,853 --> 00:37:40,522
- Really?
- Little Winky by Horace Azpiazu.

478
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,316
- That's cute.
- Oh, hardly.

479
00:37:42,483 --> 00:37:44,901
Little Winky
is a virulent anti-Semite.

480
00:37:45,069 --> 00:37:48,280
The story follows his initiation
into the Klan...

481
00:37:48,448 --> 00:37:51,366
...his immersion
in the pornographic snuff industry...

482
00:37:51,534 --> 00:37:54,786
...and his ultimate degradation
at the hands of a black ex-convict...

483
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:58,665
...named Eric Washington Jackson
Jones Johnson...

484
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,792
- Written by a 4-year-old?
... Jefferson.

485
00:38:02,837 --> 00:38:04,087
Written by a 4-year-old?

486
00:38:04,255 --> 00:38:06,506
Well, Azpiazu killed himself
when he was 5.

487
00:38:06,674 --> 00:38:09,635
- Why did he kill himself?
- I don't know. Why did you?

488
00:38:09,802 --> 00:38:11,303
What?

489
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:13,305
I said, why would you?

490
00:38:14,724 --> 00:38:16,683
Oh, I don't know.

491
00:38:19,646 --> 00:38:23,231
Yeah, I wanna bring my production
to New York...

492
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:28,403
...to get it seen by people,
you know, who matter.

493
00:38:28,738 --> 00:38:31,365
- The sooner the better.
- This theater, centrally located.

494
00:38:31,532 --> 00:38:34,409
Heart of the theater district,
so, you know, great for plays.

495
00:38:34,577 --> 00:38:38,955
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely. There it is.

496
00:38:40,249 --> 00:38:43,085
- What was this used for?
- Plays.

497
00:38:45,004 --> 00:38:48,674
- Like, theater plays?
- Shakespeare.

498
00:38:50,426 --> 00:38:52,302
King Lear.

499
00:38:52,637 --> 00:38:54,554
The storm.

500
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:59,476
You see, the idea
is to do a massive theater piece.

501
00:38:59,686 --> 00:39:02,938
You know, uncompromising, honest.

502
00:39:05,024 --> 00:39:09,194
Here's what I think theater is.
It's the beginning of thought.

503
00:39:10,154 --> 00:39:12,572
It's the truth not yet spoken.

504
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,410
It's what a man feels like
after he's been clocked in the jaw.

505
00:39:17,161 --> 00:39:22,082
It's love in all its messiness.

506
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:26,378
You know, and I want all of us,
players and patrons alike...

507
00:39:26,546 --> 00:39:30,465
...to soak
in the communal bath of it...

508
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:34,469
...the mikvah, as the Jews call it.

509
00:39:34,637 --> 00:39:40,142
Because we're all in the same water,
after all.

510
00:39:40,518 --> 00:39:46,648
You know, soaking
in our very menstrual blood...

511
00:39:46,816 --> 00:39:48,650
...and nocturnal emissions.

512
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:51,945
This is what I wanna try
to give people.

513
00:39:52,405 --> 00:39:55,407
Okay, here you go.
Here's your salad.

514
00:39:57,785 --> 00:40:00,120
- Here's your soup.
- Thanks.

515
00:40:02,123 --> 00:40:04,541
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

516
00:40:10,673 --> 00:40:14,426
- What are you doing?
- Salivating.

517
00:40:15,178 --> 00:40:17,679
The biofeedback training.

518
00:40:20,975 --> 00:40:23,518
- So I was wondering if you'd help.
- In your box office?

519
00:40:23,686 --> 00:40:27,606
No, as my assistant.

520
00:40:27,815 --> 00:40:30,484
I'm not sure I can work with you,
Caden.

521
00:40:31,903 --> 00:40:33,195
I'm kind of angry.

522
00:40:34,113 --> 00:40:36,281
I just wanna normalize it.

523
00:40:39,035 --> 00:40:41,578
I think we'd have a lot of fun
together.

524
00:40:55,176 --> 00:40:57,260
I miss you.

525
00:40:58,554 --> 00:41:00,806
- Really disturbing.
- I know.

526
00:41:03,726 --> 00:41:07,062
Dear diary, thank you
for being my new best friend.

527
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:10,982
My name is Olive Cotard,
and I'm 4 years old.

528
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,527
I like chocolate,
and my favorite color is pink.

529
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:19,074
This is pink.

530
00:41:21,494 --> 00:41:23,829
Yeah, that's good.

531
00:41:23,996 --> 00:41:25,914
- Next.
- Hi.

532
00:41:33,506 --> 00:41:35,549
We'll start by talking honestly...

533
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:39,594
...and out of that,
a piece of theater will evolve.

534
00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:42,097
I'll begin.

535
00:41:44,517 --> 00:41:46,852
I've been thinking a lot
about dying lately.

536
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:51,064
- You're gonna be fine, sweetie.
- Well, I appreciate that, Claire, but...

537
00:41:51,232 --> 00:41:52,315
You are, you poor thing.

538
00:41:52,483 --> 00:41:56,987
Yeah, well, regardless of how
this particular thing works itself out...

539
00:41:57,613 --> 00:42:00,240
...I will be dying.

540
00:42:01,617 --> 00:42:03,743
And so will you.

541
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:07,414
And so will everyone here.

542
00:42:11,294 --> 00:42:13,920
And that's what I wanna explore.

543
00:42:14,088 --> 00:42:16,548
We're all hurtling towards death.

544
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:23,805
Yet here we are,
for the moment, alive...

545
00:42:24,515 --> 00:42:26,725
...each of us knowing
we're gonna die...

546
00:42:28,728 --> 00:42:31,438
...each of us
secretly believing we won't.

547
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:34,816
It's brilliant.

548
00:42:36,277 --> 00:42:38,987
It's everything.

549
00:42:40,406 --> 00:42:42,824
It's Karamazov.

550
00:42:47,538 --> 00:42:49,831
- Stop.
- I'm just asking.

551
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:52,667
- You're so obnoxious.
- You're so obnoxious.

552
00:42:53,336 --> 00:42:55,879
- You do not wanna cross me.
- Don't I?

553
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:03,178
Hi, Claire.

554
00:43:04,013 --> 00:43:06,932
- Hi.
- Hazel.

555
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:09,935
Yeah. No, no. I know, I know. Hazel.
You're the box office.

556
00:43:10,102 --> 00:43:12,604
- Yeah, I'm the box office.
- How are you?

557
00:43:12,813 --> 00:43:15,023
Wonderful. You?

558
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:17,108
Yeah, yeah. I'm good. I'm fine.
Thank you.

559
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:21,196
Actually, I'm meeting Caden here.
You know Mr. Cotard, right?

560
00:43:21,364 --> 00:43:24,115
Yes, I recall Mr. Cotard.

561
00:43:26,035 --> 00:43:27,243
Yeah. I'm waiting...

562
00:43:33,042 --> 00:43:35,502
- Hey.
- Hi, Caden.

563
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,588
- Hi, Caden.
- Hi, Hazel. Hi, Claire.

564
00:43:38,756 --> 00:43:40,590
Hi.

565
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,634
- This is Derek.
- Hi, Derek.

566
00:43:42,802 --> 00:43:45,553
- Hi, Derek.
- Hi, Derek.

567
00:43:45,721 --> 00:43:46,763
Hi.

568
00:43:50,726 --> 00:43:54,104
Well, we'll leave you be.
It's nice to see you again.

569
00:43:54,271 --> 00:43:58,066
- Take care.
- Why am I bowing? Okay, bye.

570
00:44:01,195 --> 00:44:04,739
- That was awkward.
- Yeah, I guess.

571
00:44:07,201 --> 00:44:08,243
Do you like beaver...?

572
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:11,413
So could you tell me maybe
what it is that you want from me?

573
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:15,750
You know, like, from my character.

574
00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:20,714
Well, we'll build it over time
together.

575
00:44:20,881 --> 00:44:23,925
You know, try to find a real person,
maybe, to model it after.

576
00:44:24,093 --> 00:44:26,428
That Hazel girl's
kind of interesting maybe.

577
00:44:26,595 --> 00:44:28,304
- You know, like, why...?
- Although...

578
00:44:28,472 --> 00:44:30,890
Why is she still working
at a box office at her age?

579
00:44:31,058 --> 00:44:33,101
I don't know.
Probably not that interesting.

580
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:36,271
Maybe she wanted to be an actress,
but she lacked the confidence.

581
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:38,690
- Yeah, we'll talk about it.
- I'm so excited.

582
00:44:38,858 --> 00:44:40,483
Really? Why?

583
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:45,780
Because I think that it's brave.

584
00:44:45,948 --> 00:44:50,535
And I just feel like
I'm gonna be part of a revolution.

585
00:44:50,703 --> 00:44:53,830
I keep thinking about Artaud,
Krapp's Last Tape...

586
00:44:53,998 --> 00:44:57,125
...you know, and Grotowski,
for chrissake.

587
00:44:57,293 --> 00:44:59,419
I don't know what I'm doing.

588
00:45:00,337 --> 00:45:01,963
But that's what so refreshing.

589
00:45:02,131 --> 00:45:04,382
Knowing that you don't know...

590
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:08,970
...is the first and the most essential
step to knowing, you know?

591
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,848
I don't know.

592
00:45:16,479 --> 00:45:19,105
- Well, I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

593
00:45:19,273 --> 00:45:21,232
- Don't say that, not to me.
- Oh, sorry.

594
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:26,237
My mother died last night.

595
00:45:27,323 --> 00:45:32,911
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
What are you doing out?

596
00:45:36,499 --> 00:45:39,667
- This is me.
- Well...

597
00:45:40,169 --> 00:45:43,755
Well, it was nice meeting you.
Oh, God, did I just say "meeting"?

598
00:45:43,923 --> 00:45:48,927
- I'm sorry. I'm so stupid.
- Slip of the tongue, is all.

599
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:51,846
Yeah, it's a Freudian slip, right?

600
00:45:53,015 --> 00:45:54,974
I don't know how it's Freudian.

601
00:45:55,142 --> 00:46:00,021
To meet, you know? Like, to meet.

602
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:08,071
There she met Ralph Keene.
They fell in love, married...

603
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:10,698
...and soon their first child,
Claire, was born.

604
00:46:11,242 --> 00:46:12,992
I used to be a baby.

605
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,995
Claire Elizabeth Keene
was a joyous child...

606
00:46:16,163 --> 00:46:18,873
- I'm sorry.
... the apple of her mother's eye.

607
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:23,586
She made her parents proud with her
politeness and gymnastic skills.

608
00:46:23,754 --> 00:46:25,922
God, you're beautiful.

609
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:30,093
When she was 7, little Claire
was bitten by the acting bug.

610
00:46:30,261 --> 00:46:33,012
She starred
in almost every school musical...

611
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,390
...playing Ado Annie in Oklahoma...

612
00:46:35,558 --> 00:46:40,395
...Adelaide in Guys And Dolls,
and Maria in The Sound Of Music.

613
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:44,149
I have to fuck you. I have to.

614
00:46:48,487 --> 00:46:51,364
There will be no other before you.

615
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,913
I'd like to buy a ticket, please.

616
00:46:59,081 --> 00:47:02,584
- Okay. Hold it.
- That'll be $40.

617
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:08,673
We're not really...
We need to investigate.

618
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:12,594
You know, to really discover
the essence of each being.

619
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:17,515
You know, I think I need to work
with both of you separately.

620
00:47:17,683 --> 00:47:19,851
Davis, I'll start with you.

621
00:47:21,437 --> 00:47:25,773
I liked the beginning.
I don't wanna see a good scene...

622
00:47:25,941 --> 00:47:27,609
"Davis, I'll start with you"?

623
00:47:27,776 --> 00:47:31,112
There's a difference between favoring
me and pretending we've never met.

624
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,157
I mean, we've had Ariel.
I think people know that we've fucked.

625
00:47:35,284 --> 00:47:38,953
We'll talk about your character
after we put Ariel to bed, okay?

626
00:47:39,663 --> 00:47:40,788
Okay.

627
00:47:48,505 --> 00:47:51,049
I think I made a breakthrough.

628
00:47:51,217 --> 00:47:54,886
- This character is so beautiful...
- Yeah, I have to go find my daughter.

629
00:47:55,262 --> 00:47:57,388
- Your daughter's right here.
- My real daughter.

630
00:47:57,556 --> 00:48:00,308
- Excuse me?
- I mean, my first daughter, Olive.

631
00:48:00,476 --> 00:48:03,478
- I have to go find her.
- Please don't do this to us.

632
00:48:03,646 --> 00:48:05,980
She's tattooed. She's tattooed.

633
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:08,816
Oh, everyone is tattooed.

634
00:48:09,068 --> 00:48:11,819
Oh, I've never seen that before.

635
00:48:12,196 --> 00:48:16,032
- You have responsibilities.
- Yeah, I'll be quick. I'll do it quick.

636
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,203
Redundancy is fluid.
Life moves to the south.

637
00:48:20,371 --> 00:48:23,998
There is only the now,
and I am always with you.

638
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:26,501
For example, look to your left.

639
00:48:27,962 --> 00:48:29,671
Hi.

640
00:48:30,422 --> 00:48:35,134
When you canceled, it freed me up,
so I'm traveling too.

641
00:48:39,181 --> 00:48:42,183
You know,
I'm not sure I'm getting the book.

642
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:57,865
Oh, but it's getting you.
You're almost non-recognizable now.

643
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,872
Thank you.

644
00:49:10,045 --> 00:49:15,425
I show you my leg. I stand close,
and you inhale my perfume.

645
00:49:15,592 --> 00:49:19,262
I offer my ripe flower to you
and you deny it.

646
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,806
This book is over.

647
00:49:36,196 --> 00:49:37,572
Hi.

648
00:49:38,073 --> 00:49:39,407
I don't speak German.

649
00:49:39,575 --> 00:49:41,826
Yeah, yeah. I may help you, mister?

650
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:45,413
I'm looking for Adele Cotard.
Adele Lack.

651
00:49:45,581 --> 00:49:48,583
We must not give addresses
or other personal informations.

652
00:49:49,126 --> 00:49:52,420
- I'm her husband.
- No, you are not her husbands...

653
00:49:52,588 --> 00:49:54,881
...which is named Gunther
und Heinz.

654
00:49:55,049 --> 00:49:57,550
I'm the father of her daughter, Olive.

655
00:49:57,968 --> 00:50:01,929
I see. I'm sorry, I cannot help you.

656
00:50:02,097 --> 00:50:07,018
Dear diary, Germany is wonderful.
So many friends here.

657
00:50:07,186 --> 00:50:09,437
My new dads are great
and handsome...

658
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:11,856
...and brilliant directors of theater.

659
00:50:12,024 --> 00:50:13,691
Hello.

660
00:50:18,322 --> 00:50:19,364
You're here?

661
00:50:19,531 --> 00:50:23,826
Yeah. I live with Adele and Olive
and Gunther and Heinz...

662
00:50:23,994 --> 00:50:28,206
...and Uschi and Britt.
I'm everyone's nanny.

663
00:50:28,374 --> 00:50:30,541
I wanna see my daughter.

664
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:34,253
- Yeah, they sent me.
- They?

665
00:50:35,881 --> 00:50:38,508
Who are they?
Who the fuck are Uschi and Britt?

666
00:50:38,675 --> 00:50:41,302
Yeah, they decided it's not time
to see you yet.

667
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:44,055
They decided? Who decided?
They had her tattooed.

668
00:50:44,473 --> 00:50:46,599
Oh, I did that. Olive is my project...

669
00:50:46,767 --> 00:50:49,060
She's a 4-year-old!

670
00:50:49,478 --> 00:50:52,980
She's a fucking 4-year-old!

671
00:50:56,485 --> 00:50:59,070
She's almost over 11 now.

672
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:03,741
She's my muse.

673
00:51:04,743 --> 00:51:06,285
I love her.

674
00:51:10,082 --> 00:51:12,250
You don't love her!

675
00:51:14,211 --> 00:51:16,003
Where is she?

676
00:51:17,172 --> 00:51:20,174
What did you do to my daughter?

677
00:52:18,066 --> 00:52:22,361
Death comes faster than you think.

678
00:52:24,406 --> 00:52:28,075
- That was your last patient for the day.
- Let's stop this charade.

679
00:52:28,243 --> 00:52:30,369
I don't know
what you're talking about, doctor.

680
00:52:30,537 --> 00:52:32,914
You're actually having an affair
off set.

681
00:52:33,081 --> 00:52:34,790
- Palpable, huh?
- Oh, okay.

682
00:52:34,958 --> 00:52:37,418
- Who told you?
- And it's not good.

683
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:40,087
- Not good, oh, okay.
- You're actors playing actors.

684
00:52:40,255 --> 00:52:43,758
You're in this scene, you're not
just filming it. You're in this scene.

685
00:52:43,926 --> 00:52:45,051
Just like that...

686
00:52:45,219 --> 00:52:48,137
As you're telling him this,
you realize you're attracted to him.

687
00:52:48,305 --> 00:52:49,764
How are you gonna let him know?

688
00:52:49,932 --> 00:52:53,184
And the guilt you feel about telling him
about somebody else knowing.

689
00:52:53,352 --> 00:52:55,269
Daddy, Daddy is mine.

690
00:52:55,437 --> 00:52:57,772
Daddy can't play now, honey.

691
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:01,442
Daddy doesn't live with us anymore,
baby. He had to go find himself.

692
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:04,111
They still feel a little tight in the toe.

693
00:53:04,279 --> 00:53:08,449
Have an argument.
You're having an argument. Have it.

694
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,536
- I don't buy it.
- You, sir, are a horse's ass.

695
00:53:11,703 --> 00:53:15,248
What? Just get the fucking shoe.
You gave me two sizes too big.

696
00:53:15,415 --> 00:53:19,252
Tom, don't turn into another person
just because I say change your action.

697
00:53:19,419 --> 00:53:24,924
And this started just today?
It never happened before?

698
00:53:25,384 --> 00:53:27,552
Okay. Good.

699
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:29,679
You can get dressed.

700
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:36,143
I mean, you're a doctor, right?
Am I dying? Can you tell me that?

701
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:38,938
- No.
- No, you can't tell me?

702
00:53:39,106 --> 00:53:42,400
- I can't tell you.
- You can't tell me if you can't tell me?

703
00:53:42,568 --> 00:53:44,360
- No.
- No, you can't tell me...

704
00:53:44,528 --> 00:53:48,281
...because you're not allowed to?
- No.

705
00:54:12,973 --> 00:54:16,100
- Caden.
- What are you doing here?

706
00:54:17,853 --> 00:54:20,563
I was wondering
if I was gonna bump into you.

707
00:54:20,731 --> 00:54:22,773
- You look great.
- Thanks.

708
00:54:22,941 --> 00:54:26,444
- Is that a new haircut?
- Yeah. For a while now.

709
00:54:27,321 --> 00:54:29,363
What are you doing in New York?

710
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:32,908
I'm here with Derek and the boys.
A mini vacation.

711
00:54:33,076 --> 00:54:36,454
- The boys?
- Yeah. I thought you knew.

712
00:54:37,372 --> 00:54:40,207
- How old?
- Five.

713
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:43,711
Twins. Robert and Daniel and Alan.

714
00:54:45,797 --> 00:54:47,465
Yes.

715
00:54:48,342 --> 00:54:51,427
They're nice names.
Where are they?

716
00:54:51,595 --> 00:54:56,057
Derek took them to the Natural History
so I could shop.

717
00:54:58,685 --> 00:55:02,480
It's so good to see you, Caden.
L... How are things?

718
00:55:02,648 --> 00:55:06,067
You know, I was with Claire.

719
00:55:06,401 --> 00:55:10,196
And we have a daughter.
But we're separated.

720
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:13,240
How about with you?

721
00:55:14,409 --> 00:55:17,912
Good. I have a great job
at Lens Shapers.

722
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,999
Shapers. Great. You wear a lab coat.

723
00:55:24,628 --> 00:55:28,089
- It's so good to see you.
- Oh, good to see you, Hazel.

724
00:55:58,954 --> 00:56:01,205
Hey! What are you doing?

725
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,750
- I got you.
- Let me go.

726
00:56:04,918 --> 00:56:06,043
How I love Maria.

727
00:56:06,211 --> 00:56:09,672
She is so much more of a father
than Caden ever was...

728
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:14,176
...with his drinking and unfortunate
body odor and rotting teeth.

729
00:56:14,344 --> 00:56:18,305
I could only loathe him,
and perhaps pity him.

730
00:56:18,473 --> 00:56:20,433
But Maria.

731
00:56:23,812 --> 00:56:25,813
I wanna come back.

732
00:56:25,981 --> 00:56:30,651
I wanna take care of you and Olive.
Ariel. Ariel. Fuck.

733
00:56:33,613 --> 00:56:35,322
Ariel.

734
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,668
No, no, no, it's so late. Please.

735
00:56:47,836 --> 00:56:49,044
No, no, no. Please.

736
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,340
Hello?

737
00:56:57,137 --> 00:56:58,179
Okay.

738
00:57:08,774 --> 00:57:10,983
My father died.

739
00:57:14,696 --> 00:57:16,530
Oh, baby.

740
00:57:21,036 --> 00:57:25,456
They said his body was riddled
with cancer and that he didn't know.

741
00:57:25,624 --> 00:57:27,875
That he went in
because his finger hurt.

742
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,879
They said he suffered horribly.

743
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,550
And that he...

744
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:42,181
That he called out for me
before he died.

745
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:48,103
They said that he said
he regretted his life.

746
00:57:50,273 --> 00:57:53,192
And they said he said a lot of things.

747
00:57:54,361 --> 00:57:56,237
Too many to recount.

748
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,740
They said it was the longest...

749
00:57:59,908 --> 00:58:04,119
...and saddest deathbed speech
any of them had ever heard.

750
00:58:04,746 --> 00:58:07,206
There was so little left of him...

751
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:11,085
...they had to fill the coffin
with cotton balls...

752
00:58:11,253 --> 00:58:13,712
...to keep him from rattling around.

753
00:58:20,011 --> 00:58:22,012
I'm really sorry for your loss.

754
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,348
Thank you.
Can you excuse me a moment?

755
00:58:24,516 --> 00:58:28,102
- Of course.
- I need to use the bathroom.

756
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,979
- All right.
- Okay.

757
00:58:31,106 --> 00:58:33,732
God bless you and your family.

758
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,193
God bless you. Will you excuse me?

759
00:58:38,697 --> 00:58:42,366
It's Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

760
00:58:48,248 --> 00:58:50,040
It's left five people dead.

761
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:51,834
Sorry.

762
00:58:53,628 --> 00:58:55,462
- Caden?
- Hi, Derek.

763
00:58:55,714 --> 00:58:57,923
Officials suspect arson.

764
00:58:58,091 --> 00:59:00,676
In other news,
German pharmaceutical giant...

765
00:59:00,844 --> 00:59:02,928
...has won its libel suit
against patients...

766
00:59:03,096 --> 00:59:06,390
...claiming chromosomal damage
from use of the arthritis medication...

767
00:59:06,558 --> 00:59:10,978
Will you just tell me what to do?

768
00:59:14,399 --> 00:59:17,026
In Pakistan today, the government...

769
00:59:26,202 --> 00:59:30,164
Caden, everyone has to figure out
their own life, you know.

770
00:59:30,916 --> 00:59:33,167
I just want you to look at me
the way you used to.

771
00:59:33,335 --> 00:59:36,754
Oh, honey, I can't anymore.

772
00:59:37,339 --> 00:59:39,298
You know I'm sorry.

773
00:59:40,467 --> 00:59:45,054
I screwed everything up,
and I don't have any courage.

774
00:59:45,597 --> 00:59:48,807
- And I'm sorry.
- Caden.

775
00:59:50,018 --> 00:59:54,021
- I'm okay.
- I don't want you to be okay.

776
00:59:54,189 --> 00:59:59,109
I mean, I do, but it just...

777
00:59:59,527 --> 01:00:01,654
It rips my guts out.

778
01:00:01,821 --> 01:00:03,864
I'll help you through any way I can.

779
01:00:04,574 --> 01:00:06,825
And I'll help you through too.

780
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:11,038
I'm fine.

781
01:00:12,082 --> 01:00:13,374
I have Derek.

782
01:00:20,882 --> 01:00:23,050
Okay, I'm going.

783
01:00:30,725 --> 01:00:31,976
Honey, I'm coming.

784
01:00:32,394 --> 01:00:36,230
Dear diary, today I felt a wetness
between my legs.

785
01:00:36,398 --> 01:00:39,483
Maria explained to me
now I am a woman.

786
01:00:39,651 --> 01:00:43,237
And being a woman is wonderful
with Maria to guide me.

787
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:37,875
Olive?

788
01:01:43,631 --> 01:01:45,424
Olive.

789
01:01:47,052 --> 01:01:55,309
Olive, it's Daddy.

790
01:01:56,811 --> 01:02:00,814
Olive, it's Daddy! Olive, it's Daddy!

791
01:02:00,982 --> 01:02:04,318
Don't fucking stare at me! Olive!

792
01:02:04,486 --> 01:02:09,156
Get off! It's my daughter!
That's my daughter!

793
01:02:09,991 --> 01:02:14,244
Get off! Get off!

794
01:02:17,999 --> 01:02:21,752
I won't settle for anything less
than the brutal truth.

795
01:02:22,712 --> 01:02:26,381
Brutal. Brutal.

796
01:02:27,634 --> 01:02:31,178
Each day I'll hand you a paper. It'll tell
you what happened to you that day.

797
01:02:31,346 --> 01:02:32,846
You felt a lump in your breast.

798
01:02:33,014 --> 01:02:35,641
You looked at your wife
and saw a stranger, et cetera.

799
01:02:35,809 --> 01:02:38,477
- Caden?
- What?

800
01:02:38,853 --> 01:02:41,522
When are we gonna
get an audience in here?

801
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:44,274
It's been 17 years.

802
01:02:47,946 --> 01:02:50,864
All right, I'm not excusing myself
from this either.

803
01:02:51,032 --> 01:02:53,200
I will have someone play me...

804
01:02:53,368 --> 01:02:56,036
...to delve into the murky,
cowardly depths...

805
01:02:56,204 --> 01:03:00,374
...of my lonely, fucked-up being.

806
01:03:01,751 --> 01:03:04,753
And he'll get notes too,
and those notes will correspond...

807
01:03:04,921 --> 01:03:10,300
...to the notes I truly receive
every day from my god.

808
01:03:16,224 --> 01:03:18,225
Get to work!

809
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,042
They fired me.

810
01:03:46,129 --> 01:03:49,464
- I caused an outbreak of conjunctivitis.
- Oh, God.

811
01:03:49,632 --> 01:03:52,092
I didn't wash my hands.
I had pinkeye hands.

812
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,887
- Oh, God.
- I'm a stupid cow.

813
01:03:55,054 --> 01:03:58,932
Fucking private Christian school
is killing us. You know, it's not cheap.

814
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,019
It's Derek's thing.
I don't believe in that shit, you know.

815
01:04:02,187 --> 01:04:04,855
You try to be a good person.
I mean, that's all there is.

816
01:04:07,192 --> 01:04:09,276
Do you have anything for me,
Caden?

817
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:15,657
I mean, I already have an assistant.

818
01:04:16,951 --> 01:04:20,454
- I don't have a box office yet, but...
- Please, caden.

819
01:04:20,622 --> 01:04:22,664
Please, Caden. I...

820
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:25,959
Please, Caden.

821
01:04:29,881 --> 01:04:32,674
Sammy Barnathan?

822
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,562
Sit. Sammy Barnathan.

823
01:04:55,865 --> 01:04:59,618
I don't have a rsum or a picture.

824
01:05:01,162 --> 01:05:05,165
- I've never worked as an actor.
- Good. Tell me why you're here.

825
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:07,417
Well, I've been...

826
01:05:08,628 --> 01:05:11,463
I've been following you for 20 years.

827
01:05:11,923 --> 01:05:15,008
So I knew about this audition
because I follow you.

828
01:05:15,385 --> 01:05:18,178
And I've learned everything about you
by following you.

829
01:05:18,596 --> 01:05:22,766
So hire me,
and you'll see who you truly are.

830
01:05:25,687 --> 01:05:26,937
Peekaboo.

831
01:05:30,817 --> 01:05:32,359
Okay.

832
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,074
Hazel, I don't think we need to talk to
anyone else. This guy has me down.

833
01:05:40,201 --> 01:05:43,370
I'm gonna cast him right now.
Then maybe you and I can get a drink.

834
01:05:43,538 --> 01:05:45,956
And we can try to figure out
this thing between us...

835
01:05:46,124 --> 01:05:48,000
...why I cried.

836
01:05:48,209 --> 01:05:54,548
Because I've never felt about anybody
the way I feel about you.

837
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:59,553
And I wanna fuck you
until we merge into a chimera...

838
01:06:00,722 --> 01:06:04,891
...a mythical beast with penis
and vagina eternally fused...

839
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,520
...two pairs of eyes
that look only at each other...

840
01:06:08,938 --> 01:06:12,941
...and lips ever touching.

841
01:06:13,901 --> 01:06:18,363
And one voice that whispers to itself.

842
01:06:31,044 --> 01:06:32,669
Okay.

843
01:06:33,546 --> 01:06:36,840
Yeah. You've got the part.

844
01:06:56,611 --> 01:06:59,446
I've never seen your shit gray.

845
01:07:00,448 --> 01:07:02,366
It's new.

846
01:07:06,662 --> 01:07:08,121
That's a good boy.

847
01:07:14,754 --> 01:07:18,131
- When is it opening?
- When it's ready.

848
01:07:18,299 --> 01:07:22,344
- We need to get in. It's bad out here.
- Sorry.

849
01:07:26,474 --> 01:07:29,518
You know, I was thinking
of calling it Simulacrum.

850
01:07:30,395 --> 01:07:33,438
I don't even know what it means.

851
01:07:33,731 --> 01:07:38,318
Can I have a nickel if I doesn't play
with my pee-pee no more?

852
01:07:38,903 --> 01:07:40,612
Yeah.

853
01:07:42,949 --> 01:07:45,492
How about
The Flawed Light of Love and Grief?

854
01:07:45,701 --> 01:07:47,160
I'm not sure.

855
01:07:49,163 --> 01:07:52,082
Claire, I want you to play yourself.

856
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:55,001
Sammy's gonna move
into your apartment set as me.

857
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,591
It would be my honor
to play your husband, Claire.

858
01:08:01,759 --> 01:08:03,677
You're an amazing actress.

859
01:08:03,845 --> 01:08:07,722
No, I saw you do Bernarda Alba
last year at the Roundabout.

860
01:08:08,307 --> 01:08:09,850
Yeah?

861
01:08:10,435 --> 01:08:12,018
That was a fun play.

862
01:08:12,186 --> 01:08:17,149
Emotionally, it was tough,
but fucking fulfilling.

863
01:08:17,358 --> 01:08:20,694
Plus, I loved working
with so many strong female actresses.

864
01:08:25,158 --> 01:08:27,826
I'm gonna start thinking
about myself.

865
01:08:31,038 --> 01:08:33,039
Start, huh?

866
01:08:34,542 --> 01:08:38,378
Who is Claire Keen?
Claire Keen. Claire Keen.

867
01:08:38,546 --> 01:08:42,549
- Why did we leave Adele, Caden?
- Claire Keen. Well...

868
01:08:44,427 --> 01:08:46,553
She left us.

869
01:08:48,347 --> 01:08:50,891
You know that better than anybody.

870
01:08:51,893 --> 01:08:53,685
Except me.

871
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:58,064
An amazing artist though.
The best living artist.

872
01:08:58,232 --> 01:09:01,902
I mean, there's no one who stares
the truth in the face like she does.

873
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:04,905
Sweet pussy too.

874
01:09:07,325 --> 01:09:09,326
How do you know that?

875
01:09:13,247 --> 01:09:14,998
I read it.

876
01:09:21,756 --> 01:09:23,423
Anyway...

877
01:09:25,593 --> 01:09:28,053
I mean, I don't know where she is.

878
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,932
Well, maybe she's got a sublet
in New York.

879
01:09:32,391 --> 01:09:37,604
Maybe she's got a retrospective
at the Met. Maybe, baby.

880
01:09:44,946 --> 01:09:46,196
Why are you giving me this?

881
01:09:46,364 --> 01:09:50,992
I wanna follow you there and see
how you lose even more of yourself.

882
01:09:53,329 --> 01:09:55,038
Research.

883
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:59,209
You know, for the part.

884
01:10:00,127 --> 01:10:01,795
Partner.

885
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:53,096
Hold it. Hold it, please.

886
01:10:53,264 --> 01:10:55,140
Hold it, please.

887
01:10:57,977 --> 01:11:00,854
I asked you to hold the door.

888
01:11:01,188 --> 01:11:04,024
I'm sorry. I pressed the button,
but I think it was too late.

889
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:06,026
You didn't press it.

890
01:11:08,988 --> 01:11:10,989
- Have a good night.
- Yeah, thanks.

891
01:11:13,326 --> 01:11:15,535
- Are you Ellen? Ellen?
- What?

892
01:11:15,703 --> 01:11:17,621
- Are you Ellen Bascomb?
- What?

893
01:11:17,788 --> 01:11:20,206
I'm to give the key to 31Y
to Ellen Bascomb.

894
01:11:22,293 --> 01:11:23,335
Yes, I'm Ellen.

895
01:11:23,502 --> 01:11:25,754
She said you should just go ahead
and get started.

896
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:29,215
- And don't forget to change the sheets.
- Okay, thanks.

897
01:11:30,801 --> 01:11:32,510
Oh, sweetheart.

898
01:11:44,357 --> 01:11:56,618
Adele?

899
01:12:01,374 --> 01:12:06,419
Hi, Ellen. Be a doll and do the sheets
and whatever's in the hamper.

900
01:12:06,921 --> 01:12:09,547
Your money's under the toaster.
Kisses, Adele.

901
01:12:09,715 --> 01:12:13,593
P.S. Bag of stuff in bedroom closet
for Goodwill. Take what you want.

902
01:12:37,618 --> 01:12:41,579
Went for a walk. I had to think.

903
01:12:50,589 --> 01:12:52,298
All night?

904
01:12:53,259 --> 01:12:58,138
You smell weird.
Are you wearing lipstick?

905
01:12:58,431 --> 01:12:59,931
No.

906
01:13:01,559 --> 01:13:03,893
What do I smell like?

907
01:13:05,646 --> 01:13:07,981
Like bad? Like an old person?

908
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:10,233
I don't know.
Like mold and cleaning products.

909
01:13:10,401 --> 01:13:12,318
Like you're menstruating.
I don't know.

910
01:13:12,486 --> 01:13:14,112
Menstruating?

911
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,739
You tell me.

912
01:13:16,323 --> 01:13:19,659
I don't menstruate. I don't know how
I could smell like I'm menstruating.

913
01:13:20,035 --> 01:13:21,453
I wouldn't know.

914
01:13:33,007 --> 01:13:34,883
I don't like the guy you got
to play you.

915
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:37,135
You don't like Sammy? Why?
I think he's good.

916
01:13:39,013 --> 01:13:42,515
Fuck you. I'm 45 years old.
I don't wanna do this shit anymore.

917
01:13:42,683 --> 01:13:44,684
He's the best thing in the play
except you.

918
01:13:44,852 --> 01:13:47,687
He's coming on to me.
He's grabbing my ass in rehearsal.

919
01:13:47,855 --> 01:13:49,481
- He's your husband.
- Good, Jimmy.

920
01:13:49,648 --> 01:13:51,357
He's not my goddamn husband.
You are.

921
01:13:51,525 --> 01:13:53,943
What the fuck is wrong with you?

922
01:13:55,696 --> 01:13:57,822
- I'm going to rehearsal.
- It's about the play.

923
01:13:57,990 --> 01:14:01,117
- We're getting at something real here.
- That's great, you guys.

924
01:14:01,285 --> 01:14:03,119
Beautiful, Sammy.

925
01:14:05,915 --> 01:14:09,584
- Caden? Time-out?
- Yeah.

926
01:14:09,752 --> 01:14:11,336
What's up?

927
01:14:12,046 --> 01:14:15,298
Well, I feel we need a Hazel in here.

928
01:14:15,925 --> 01:14:19,177
I mean, there's a whole side of Caden
I can't explore without a Hazel.

929
01:14:21,597 --> 01:14:23,807
- I guess, yeah.
- I get to be a character?

930
01:14:23,974 --> 01:14:25,391
Yeah.

931
01:14:30,689 --> 01:14:34,859
Hi, Ellen.
Crackerjack job last night.

932
01:14:35,736 --> 01:14:37,320
Would you do sheets again?

933
01:14:37,488 --> 01:14:41,699
We had quite a fuck,
and it's musky and gross. Kisses, A.

934
01:14:42,701 --> 01:14:45,578
Hi, Adele. Relined the cabinets.

935
01:14:45,746 --> 01:14:48,915
I just wanted to let you know
I won a MacArthur Grant.

936
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:52,919
And I'm mounting a play which
I think is gonna be pure and truthful.

937
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:56,089
Best, Ellen.

938
01:15:02,012 --> 01:15:04,931
I went for a walk. I had to think.

939
01:15:06,684 --> 01:15:10,812
Caden, what are you doing at night?

940
01:15:11,564 --> 01:15:14,065
I have a right to fucking know.

941
01:15:14,775 --> 01:15:17,277
I've been going to Adele's place.

942
01:15:18,779 --> 01:15:21,030
And cleaning it.

943
01:15:24,118 --> 01:15:27,203
Do you have any idea
what I've given up for you? For this?

944
01:15:27,371 --> 01:15:30,039
For you? For you?
Could you please get that?

945
01:15:38,924 --> 01:15:42,135
- This looks serious. Am I interrupting?
- What's going on, Hazel?

946
01:15:43,637 --> 01:15:46,222
I just wanted you to know
that the actress playing me...

947
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:47,974
...is ready to start today.

948
01:15:48,142 --> 01:15:51,311
That's great. That's all we need
around here, is two Hazels.

949
01:15:51,478 --> 01:15:53,980
Okay, I'll take that as my cue.

950
01:15:55,649 --> 01:15:57,984
- Maybe you could clean her toilet.
- Maybe I will.

951
01:16:00,738 --> 01:16:01,988
This is over.

952
01:16:02,823 --> 01:16:05,408
- No, Claire...
- I'm not talking to you.

953
01:16:05,576 --> 01:16:08,661
I didn't say I was gonna
clean Hazel's toilet. He did.

954
01:16:08,829 --> 01:16:11,581
- But you thought it!
- I thought it, but I didn't say it.

955
01:16:11,749 --> 01:16:15,668
I got an offer to do
Needleman in a Haystack.

956
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:19,422
And I'm gonna take it.
I want you out of the apartment.

957
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:22,342
The real one. You can keep this one.

958
01:16:22,509 --> 01:16:24,010
Claire.

959
01:16:24,178 --> 01:16:27,138
Jesus. Claire.

960
01:16:28,223 --> 01:16:30,892
Hi, yeah, we're gonna need
a Claire replacement.

961
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:34,479
Claire, I didn't say it.

962
01:16:39,944 --> 01:16:42,195
I already put out a call
for a Claire replacement.

963
01:16:44,782 --> 01:16:46,950
But I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to move on.

964
01:16:47,117 --> 01:16:50,161
Just like that?
You don't give a guy even a chance?

965
01:16:50,329 --> 01:16:54,874
I'm not a chance-giving girl.
I'm a fun-loving girl, remember?

966
01:16:55,042 --> 01:16:57,710
I try and be fun-loving, see?

967
01:16:58,629 --> 01:16:59,671
Sorry.

968
01:16:59,838 --> 01:17:01,631
My analyst says
you have complexes.

969
01:17:01,799 --> 01:17:04,217
Once you enjoyed
Needleman's complexes.

970
01:17:04,385 --> 01:17:07,512
- That's before my analyst taught me...
- This is the last of my stuff.

971
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,847
- Bye.
- Bye. From the top?

972
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,350
Oh, Needleman,
you had such potential.

973
01:17:12,518 --> 01:17:15,061
But I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to move on.

974
01:17:25,531 --> 01:17:27,907
I'm sorry. Okay.

975
01:17:40,254 --> 01:17:42,922
Oh, Needleman,
you had such potential.

976
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:45,842
But I'm afraid
I'm going to have to move on.

977
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:48,177
Just like that?
You don't give a guy a chance?

978
01:17:48,345 --> 01:17:51,723
I'm not a chance-giving girl.
I'm a fun-loving girl.

979
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:54,267
Once you enjoyed
Needleman's complexes.

980
01:17:54,435 --> 01:17:56,310
That's before my analyst taught me...

981
01:17:56,478 --> 01:17:57,729
This is a lie.

982
01:17:57,896 --> 01:18:01,065
Come here.
I try to be fun-loving, see?

983
01:18:01,233 --> 01:18:03,735
- She told me your hatred of...
- Will.

984
01:18:03,902 --> 01:18:06,904
Wall it up. All of it.

985
01:18:15,789 --> 01:18:17,373
Claire.

986
01:18:22,963 --> 01:18:24,630
Oh, Needleman.

987
01:18:25,299 --> 01:18:27,133
All right.

988
01:18:30,929 --> 01:18:32,889
Good for you with your grant.

989
01:18:33,057 --> 01:18:36,142
Listen, I fixed up the walk-in
as a sort of bedroom if you want.

990
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:37,435
We'd love to have you...

991
01:18:37,603 --> 01:18:40,396
...and you wouldn't have to schlep
all the way to Queens.

992
01:18:41,106 --> 01:18:44,692
It's just a thought. Kisses, A.

993
01:18:53,744 --> 01:18:56,788
Dear diary, I'm afraid I'm gravely ill.

994
01:18:58,332 --> 01:19:02,293
It is perhaps times like these
that one reflects on things past.

995
01:19:02,711 --> 01:19:05,004
An article of clothing
from when I was young.

996
01:19:05,172 --> 01:19:07,632
A green jacket.
A walk with my father.

997
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,676
A game we once played.
Pretend we're fairies.

998
01:19:10,844 --> 01:19:13,429
I'm a girl fairy,
and my name is Lauralee...

999
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:16,933
...and you're a boy fairy,
and your name is Teetery.

1000
01:19:17,101 --> 01:19:19,310
Pretend when we're fairies,
we fight each other.

1001
01:19:19,478 --> 01:19:23,940
And I say, "Stop hitting me or I'll die. "
And you hit me again, and I say:

1002
01:19:24,108 --> 01:19:27,819
"Now I have to die. "
And you say, "But I'll miss you. "

1003
01:19:27,986 --> 01:19:30,530
And I say, "But I have to.

1004
01:19:30,697 --> 01:19:34,033
And you'll have to wait a million years
to see me again.

1005
01:19:34,201 --> 01:19:35,660
And I'll be put in a box...

1006
01:19:35,828 --> 01:19:38,704
...and all I'll need
is a tiny glass of water...

1007
01:19:38,872 --> 01:19:40,832
...and lots of tiny pieces of pizza.

1008
01:19:40,999 --> 01:19:43,626
And the box will have wings
like an airplane. "

1009
01:19:43,794 --> 01:19:46,629
And you ask,
"Where will it take you?"

1010
01:19:46,797 --> 01:19:49,841
"Home," I say.

1011
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,442
This is to hear.

1012
01:20:08,986 --> 01:20:13,865
- So words... English here, yeah?
- Okay.

1013
01:20:20,164 --> 01:20:21,914
I'm dying...

1014
01:20:23,083 --> 01:20:24,667
...as I'm sure Maria told you.

1015
01:20:28,589 --> 01:20:32,466
The flower tattoos have become
infected and they're dying.

1016
01:20:33,385 --> 01:20:37,305
So I am as well. This is life.

1017
01:20:38,015 --> 01:20:40,766
It's Maria. She did this.

1018
01:20:42,019 --> 01:20:44,645
Maria gave me a reason to live
once you left.

1019
01:20:45,731 --> 01:20:46,772
The flowers defined me.

1020
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:49,192
Your mother and Maria
took you away.

1021
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:52,528
I've tried for years to find you.
I didn't leave you.

1022
01:20:53,363 --> 01:20:56,324
I want to talk to you
about your homosexuality.

1023
01:20:56,742 --> 01:20:59,952
- I'm not a homosexual.
- Maria said you would deny it.

1024
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,456
Well, she's a liar. She's lying to you.

1025
01:21:03,624 --> 01:21:08,169
I had the same struggle
when I first fell in love with Maria...

1026
01:21:08,337 --> 01:21:10,796
...and we began to have dirty,
aching sex.

1027
01:21:10,964 --> 01:21:13,216
Maria is your lover?

1028
01:21:13,383 --> 01:21:16,844
Of course.
She introduced me to myself...

1029
01:21:17,971 --> 01:21:19,305
...to my vagina and to hers.

1030
01:21:19,473 --> 01:21:22,808
You have no idea how evil she is.

1031
01:21:22,976 --> 01:21:25,478
I need to forgive you before I die...

1032
01:21:25,646 --> 01:21:29,315
...but I can't forgive someone
who has not asked for forgiveness.

1033
01:21:29,983 --> 01:21:33,069
- I just want...
- I have no time.

1034
01:21:33,362 --> 01:21:36,906
I need you to ask for forgiveness.

1035
01:21:38,659 --> 01:21:41,160
Can you ever forgive me?

1036
01:21:42,412 --> 01:21:44,497
- For what?
- For abandoning you.

1037
01:21:44,665 --> 01:21:49,669
For abandoning you
to have anal sex...

1038
01:21:49,836 --> 01:21:52,755
...with my homosexual lover, Eric.

1039
01:21:55,467 --> 01:21:57,843
I will, I'll say it.

1040
01:21:59,805 --> 01:22:02,139
For abandoning you...

1041
01:22:03,684 --> 01:22:09,146
...to have anal sex
with my homosexual lover, Eric.

1042
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,817
No.

1043
01:22:18,532 --> 01:22:20,658
No, I'm sorry.

1044
01:22:27,457 --> 01:22:29,125
I cannot.

1045
01:22:46,435 --> 01:22:49,979
I hope you are happy, faggot.

1046
01:22:50,147 --> 01:22:54,150
I'm not happy. I'm not happy.

1047
01:23:42,407 --> 01:23:45,951
I've talked to you before. This is not
a play about dating. It's about death.

1048
01:23:46,119 --> 01:23:48,287
Make it personal. Move along.

1049
01:23:49,623 --> 01:23:51,957
He doesn't need to yell at them.

1050
01:23:55,295 --> 01:23:59,840
It is a play about dating.
It's not a play just about death.

1051
01:24:00,008 --> 01:24:02,009
It's about everything.

1052
01:24:02,386 --> 01:24:06,639
Dating, birth, death, life, family...

1053
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:08,391
...all that.

1054
01:24:09,017 --> 01:24:10,768
- This doesn't look real.
- What?

1055
01:24:10,936 --> 01:24:13,396
- It's not real.
- I can't hear you.

1056
01:24:44,261 --> 01:24:49,181
- Morning, Haze.
- Hi, Caden. How was your night?

1057
01:24:49,349 --> 01:24:51,267
It was okay. Yours?

1058
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:54,520
Phillip was colicky.
I was up all night.

1059
01:24:55,772 --> 01:24:57,440
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

1060
01:24:57,607 --> 01:25:00,192
- Everybody here?
- Sammy's not here.

1061
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:04,363
Jimmy called and said
there's some subway problem.

1062
01:25:04,531 --> 01:25:07,032
Sorry. Sorry.

1063
01:25:07,242 --> 01:25:10,077
- Hi, Hazel.
- Hi, Sammy.

1064
01:25:14,416 --> 01:25:16,542
Sammy likes you.

1065
01:25:27,471 --> 01:25:30,514
I need you to build this.
This is just the faade.

1066
01:25:30,682 --> 01:25:32,766
It's Adele's place.
We'll be casting an Ellen.

1067
01:25:32,934 --> 01:25:35,728
I can give you the interiors later.

1068
01:25:38,148 --> 01:25:40,065
A few days?

1069
01:25:43,904 --> 01:25:47,740
- Can I look again?
- A slight shift in perspective on this.

1070
01:25:50,452 --> 01:25:53,329
Millicent Weems?

1071
01:26:00,587 --> 01:26:05,174
- Caden, this is...
- Hazel, what do you think of this title?

1072
01:26:06,134 --> 01:26:09,428
Unknown, Unkissed and Lost?

1073
01:26:14,476 --> 01:26:17,978
Anyway, this is Millicent Weems.

1074
01:26:18,146 --> 01:26:19,230
Have a seat.

1075
01:26:21,775 --> 01:26:23,901
How are you at cleaning?

1076
01:26:25,362 --> 01:26:27,947
- Very, very good at it.
- This part requires a lot of it.

1077
01:26:28,114 --> 01:26:30,699
You'd be playing a cleaning lady.

1078
01:26:31,368 --> 01:26:35,621
I played Egga, the cleaning lady,
in Hedda Gabler at the Roundabout.

1079
01:26:35,789 --> 01:26:38,040
Great. Okay.

1080
01:26:39,459 --> 01:26:42,878
And Mrs. Dobson in Scrub-A-Dub
at the Pantages.

1081
01:26:44,673 --> 01:26:47,925
You're weirdly close
to what I visualize for this character.

1082
01:26:51,346 --> 01:26:53,973
Glad to be weirdly close.

1083
01:27:00,063 --> 01:27:02,481
Sorry, everybody.

1084
01:27:03,817 --> 01:27:06,151
- Maurice, what's going on?
- I'm sorry.

1085
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:09,280
We have a couple of new guys on.
We're not in sync yet.

1086
01:27:09,447 --> 01:27:11,907
- We good to go?
- Yes, sir.

1087
01:27:14,911 --> 01:27:16,537
I'm sorry.

1088
01:27:17,706 --> 01:27:18,747
Fuck.

1089
01:27:19,791 --> 01:27:24,169
Are you Ellen?
Are you Ellen Bascomb?

1090
01:27:24,337 --> 01:27:25,838
Shit.

1091
01:27:26,631 --> 01:27:27,673
Line, please?

1092
01:27:29,634 --> 01:27:31,844
Ellen... "What?"

1093
01:27:32,012 --> 01:27:34,138
Right, right. What?

1094
01:27:34,306 --> 01:27:38,767
I'm to give the key to 31Y
to Ellen Bascomb.

1095
01:27:38,935 --> 01:27:40,811
Yes, I'm Ellen.

1096
01:27:44,357 --> 01:27:47,109
Oh, dear. It's the wrong key.

1097
01:27:47,277 --> 01:27:48,694
I'll be in, in a second.

1098
01:27:48,862 --> 01:27:50,529
- Did you hear that?
- What?

1099
01:27:52,616 --> 01:27:55,618
- You're breaking the fourth wall.
- This is the wrong key.

1100
01:27:55,785 --> 01:27:57,870
- I'm supposed to open the door.
- Hold on.

1101
01:27:59,539 --> 01:28:02,291
- Are you in there?
- There's no one in there.

1102
01:28:03,084 --> 01:28:04,543
- Adele?
- Caden.

1103
01:28:04,711 --> 01:28:07,004
I don't think it's... It's not quite...

1104
01:28:07,172 --> 01:28:10,466
I'm jumping in the shower.
I'll be out in a second.

1105
01:28:12,177 --> 01:28:15,054
Do you want some coffee?
I can make a fresh pot.

1106
01:28:15,597 --> 01:28:20,184
Did you look at the new painting
on my easel? What do you think?

1107
01:28:20,518 --> 01:28:22,853
Hey, thanks for the fuck
this morning.

1108
01:28:23,229 --> 01:28:26,607
- People don't walk like that.
- What? Is it too?

1109
01:28:26,775 --> 01:28:29,234
No, just walk like yourself.

1110
01:28:29,861 --> 01:28:31,945
Watch. Watch this.

1111
01:28:33,657 --> 01:28:35,574
I gotta go.

1112
01:28:36,326 --> 01:28:38,035
Watch this.

1113
01:28:56,096 --> 01:28:59,390
Where's Hazel and Sammy?

1114
01:29:06,439 --> 01:29:08,023
Sammy.

1115
01:29:08,441 --> 01:29:12,111
Sammy. Sammy.

1116
01:29:12,278 --> 01:29:14,196
- Hi, Caden.
- What are you doing?

1117
01:29:16,074 --> 01:29:18,117
I was being you.

1118
01:29:19,119 --> 01:29:20,911
You know, you like Hazel,
I like Hazel.

1119
01:29:21,079 --> 01:29:24,623
This Hazel doesn't exist for you. If you
wanna like a Hazel, like that one.

1120
01:29:24,791 --> 01:29:26,250
That's what I tried to tell him.

1121
01:29:26,418 --> 01:29:29,044
No harm, no foul, Caden.
It's equity break anyway.

1122
01:29:29,212 --> 01:29:31,422
Ten minutes, everybody!

1123
01:29:32,924 --> 01:29:34,216
- Hazel.
- What?

1124
01:29:34,968 --> 01:29:38,595
- You don't like him, do you?
- Yeah, he reminds me of you.

1125
01:29:40,306 --> 01:29:43,517
I'm me. You don't need someone
to remind you of me.

1126
01:29:43,685 --> 01:29:46,895
Oh, don't worry, Caden.
I like you more.

1127
01:29:47,063 --> 01:29:50,315
I do. It's just, Sammy's fun.

1128
01:29:50,734 --> 01:29:54,820
- I'm fun.
- Oh, sweetie, no, you're not.

1129
01:29:54,988 --> 01:29:56,655
Hold on a sec. Yes?

1130
01:29:56,823 --> 01:29:58,615
- Is this Caden cotard?
- Yes.

1131
01:29:58,783 --> 01:30:01,076
This is Officer Melnin
of Schenectady P.D.

1132
01:30:01,244 --> 01:30:04,663
I'm sorry to inform you your mother's
been the victim of a home invasion.

1133
01:30:04,831 --> 01:30:07,666
- What does that mean?
- She is dead.

1134
01:30:15,717 --> 01:30:18,594
Was my father standing with us?

1135
01:30:19,471 --> 01:30:21,889
I don't know what he looks like.

1136
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,391
He's dead.

1137
01:30:24,851 --> 01:30:29,313
- So he looks dead, I guess.
- Probably wasn't him, then.

1138
01:30:30,064 --> 01:30:32,065
He was a big guy.

1139
01:30:35,695 --> 01:30:37,488
Anyway...

1140
01:30:41,826 --> 01:30:43,202
Thanks for coming with me.

1141
01:30:45,622 --> 01:30:47,372
That's okay.

1142
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:50,375
I asked Hazel...

1143
01:30:50,543 --> 01:30:53,921
...but she was busy tonight,
and you're the next best thing.

1144
01:30:54,297 --> 01:30:59,510
I mean, it's not
that you're the next best thing...

1145
01:30:59,677 --> 01:31:03,096
...but because you play her,
it feels comforting.

1146
01:31:04,474 --> 01:31:06,391
Does that make sense?

1147
01:31:09,312 --> 01:31:13,649
Although the thing is,
off-stage you're nothing like her.

1148
01:31:13,858 --> 01:31:17,069
But you play her very well, though.

1149
01:31:26,746 --> 01:31:29,331
Did Hazel mention
what she was doing tonight?

1150
01:31:29,499 --> 01:31:31,500
Because I called her house
before we left...

1151
01:31:31,668 --> 01:31:35,254
...and her husband told me
she wasn't gonna be back till late.

1152
01:31:35,421 --> 01:31:40,217
And I just thought that was weird
because she said Phillip was sick.

1153
01:31:40,927 --> 01:31:42,928
She's having dinner with Sammy.

1154
01:31:43,096 --> 01:31:45,514
- That's interesting.
- He's supposed to like me.

1155
01:31:45,682 --> 01:31:47,975
I'll have another talk with him.

1156
01:31:52,689 --> 01:31:56,191
Will you excuse me?
I need to go to the bathroom.

1157
01:31:59,696 --> 01:32:01,947
Don't forget your phone.

1158
01:32:04,117 --> 01:32:06,118
Thanks, Yammy.

1159
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:15,085
It's Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

1160
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:26,597
You can stay in my parents' room.

1161
01:32:34,063 --> 01:32:36,565
I thought someone
would have cleaned it up.

1162
01:32:37,483 --> 01:32:39,151
Who?

1163
01:32:39,986 --> 01:32:41,653
I don't know. Someone.

1164
01:32:45,992 --> 01:32:49,536
This is my room.
You can sleep here.

1165
01:32:49,704 --> 01:32:51,830
Where are you going to sleep?

1166
01:32:53,041 --> 01:32:57,085
- The living-room couch.
- Don't you want to sleep with me?

1167
01:32:59,297 --> 01:33:02,674
- It's just sex.
- Okay.

1168
01:33:03,009 --> 01:33:05,010
If you think it's okay.

1169
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:12,017
- How can you be like that?
- I get undressed every day.

1170
01:33:12,352 --> 01:33:15,187
In front of someone is different.

1171
01:33:16,105 --> 01:33:17,940
I don't see why.

1172
01:33:18,107 --> 01:33:20,108
Maybe because
you have a beautiful body.

1173
01:33:20,276 --> 01:33:24,029
- Maybe that makes it easier.
- Yeah, I suppose it might.

1174
01:33:25,156 --> 01:33:27,240
Do you want to fuck?

1175
01:33:27,533 --> 01:33:30,535
I do. Do you?

1176
01:33:31,204 --> 01:33:33,956
- Take your clothes off.
- I'm sorry.

1177
01:33:34,374 --> 01:33:37,960
I'm very, very lonely.

1178
01:33:39,921 --> 01:33:42,005
I don't...

1179
01:33:43,299 --> 01:33:46,176
...know what's wrong. I just...

1180
01:33:48,346 --> 01:33:50,097
I'm sorry.

1181
01:33:52,934 --> 01:33:55,143
Do you understand?

1182
01:33:55,311 --> 01:33:59,064
I mean,
can you understand loneliness?

1183
01:34:00,733 --> 01:34:03,568
Yeah. I mean...

1184
01:34:04,404 --> 01:34:08,615
I don't know, I feel okay, mostly.

1185
01:34:10,076 --> 01:34:12,285
Fucking might help.

1186
01:34:14,872 --> 01:34:16,498
I'm sorry.

1187
01:34:16,916 --> 01:34:21,253
It's okay, I don't mind.
Take your clothes off.

1188
01:34:22,547 --> 01:34:25,966
- You're very pretty.
- Thanks.

1189
01:34:26,134 --> 01:34:30,804
Sometimes I wish
I could be pretty like that.

1190
01:34:31,431 --> 01:34:33,056
What, you wish you were a girl?

1191
01:34:33,224 --> 01:34:35,517
Sometimes I think
I might have been better at it.

1192
01:34:35,685 --> 01:34:40,272
Interesting.
It's kind of a drag in a lot of ways.

1193
01:34:41,607 --> 01:34:45,777
- Do you like guys?
- No. I only love women.

1194
01:34:45,945 --> 01:34:49,114
Well, I'm getting cold.

1195
01:35:00,752 --> 01:35:02,961
You're pretty, Caden.

1196
01:35:05,298 --> 01:35:08,550
Thanks for saying that.

1197
01:35:10,470 --> 01:35:13,096
Come to bed, pretty Caden.

1198
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:21,188
I shouldn't have drunk
so much fucking beer last night.

1199
01:35:24,817 --> 01:35:28,028
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Get lunch. What are you going to do?

1200
01:35:28,196 --> 01:35:29,821
- For chrissake.
- Good, Roland.

1201
01:35:29,989 --> 01:35:31,364
Thanks, Caden.

1202
01:35:31,532 --> 01:35:33,742
We need to fire him.

1203
01:35:35,828 --> 01:35:37,579
We don't need to fire him.

1204
01:35:38,998 --> 01:35:40,707
Jeremy's playing to us.

1205
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:43,418
Tell him to talk to Donna
and we'll hear what we hear.

1206
01:35:43,586 --> 01:35:46,671
Sammy's explaining too much.
It feels expository.

1207
01:35:46,839 --> 01:35:49,925
It needs to be shorthand, like,
"Jeremy, big. "

1208
01:35:51,094 --> 01:35:53,553
Caden, can we stop a second?

1209
01:35:54,013 --> 01:35:55,597
Sure.

1210
01:35:55,848 --> 01:35:59,142
If Hazel's in love with Sammy,
and Caden's in love with Hazel...

1211
01:35:59,310 --> 01:36:02,604
...there would be a big confrontation
where Caden turns to me and says:

1212
01:36:02,772 --> 01:36:05,190
"It's obvious he's a substitute
for me. "

1213
01:36:05,358 --> 01:36:08,318
Then I think Hazel would have
a good moment where she cries...

1214
01:36:08,486 --> 01:36:13,198
...or gets angry, I'm not sure which yet,
but I think it's dramatically sound...

1215
01:36:13,366 --> 01:36:15,951
- That didn't happen.
- I think Hazel would do that.

1216
01:36:16,119 --> 01:36:20,205
- But Hazel hasn't done that, Tammy.
- Caden, what do you think?

1217
01:36:26,379 --> 01:36:29,506
I feel like we could try it.

1218
01:36:30,424 --> 01:36:32,467
- Great.
- Fuck.

1219
01:36:37,765 --> 01:36:43,353
Let's try it. Maybe it could happen
at the director's table.

1220
01:36:47,525 --> 01:36:49,401
Fuck.

1221
01:36:51,737 --> 01:36:52,821
You know, Tammy's right.

1222
01:36:52,989 --> 01:36:55,490
I don't understand
why you're with Sammy.

1223
01:36:56,200 --> 01:37:00,203
He's nice, he's available,
he fucks me without crying.

1224
01:37:00,371 --> 01:37:02,372
Since when are you available?

1225
01:37:03,457 --> 01:37:07,169
Derek left because of you.

1226
01:37:09,505 --> 01:37:12,465
When?
How come you never told me?

1227
01:37:12,633 --> 01:37:15,969
I don't know, Caden.
How come a lot of things, huh?

1228
01:37:16,429 --> 01:37:20,432
Fuck. I gotta let go of the actor
who played Derek. What's his name?

1229
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:24,436
What?
That is such a romantic response.

1230
01:37:24,604 --> 01:37:26,313
- I am touched.
- It's not my response.

1231
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:27,606
Derek is played by...

1232
01:37:27,773 --> 01:37:31,109
We have enormous
budgetary concerns here.

1233
01:37:33,779 --> 01:37:36,740
...Joe.
- Stop. Okay? No, just stop.

1234
01:37:36,908 --> 01:37:41,161
I do not like Tammy,
and she's nothing like me.

1235
01:37:41,412 --> 01:37:43,747
- How can you like her, anyway?
- She looks like you.

1236
01:37:43,915 --> 01:37:47,042
- Joe Abernathy. No, she does not.
- She offered to have sex with me.

1237
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:49,502
- Abernathy?
- Yeah.

1238
01:37:50,296 --> 01:37:52,297
- Was it good?
- It was nice.

1239
01:37:52,465 --> 01:37:56,301
I'm just being honest. It was nice.
It wasn't earth-shattering.

1240
01:37:58,804 --> 01:38:00,305
- Did you cry?
- No.

1241
01:38:00,973 --> 01:38:03,183
You're making progress.

1242
01:38:04,518 --> 01:38:07,562
Okay, I cried a little before.

1243
01:38:15,154 --> 01:38:18,740
Hazel, you've been a part of me
forever. Don't you know that?

1244
01:38:22,662 --> 01:38:25,830
I breathe your name
in every exhalation.

1245
01:38:29,794 --> 01:38:32,921
- What are we doing?
- I don't know.

1246
01:38:52,942 --> 01:38:57,445
Oh, this is the place
I stayed with Derek and the kids.

1247
01:38:57,613 --> 01:39:00,115
- Yeah, we're almost...
- Caden.

1248
01:39:01,826 --> 01:39:03,493
Caden.

1249
01:39:03,911 --> 01:39:07,122
- Caden. Caden, look at me.
- What are you doing?

1250
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:09,416
Sammy, stay right where you are.
I'm coming up.

1251
01:39:09,583 --> 01:39:12,377
There's nothing to talk about, Hazel.
It's not your fault.

1252
01:39:12,545 --> 01:39:15,380
- What are you doing?
- I've watched you forever, Caden.

1253
01:39:15,548 --> 01:39:18,842
But you've never really looked
at anyone other than yourself.

1254
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:20,385
So watch me.

1255
01:39:21,637 --> 01:39:25,056
Watch my heart break.
Watch me jump.

1256
01:39:26,559 --> 01:39:28,768
Watch me learn
that after death there's nothing.

1257
01:39:28,936 --> 01:39:31,521
No more watching,
no more following, no love.

1258
01:39:31,689 --> 01:39:36,693
Say goodbye to Hazel for me.
And say it for yourself too.

1259
01:39:37,069 --> 01:39:40,030
- None of us has much time.
- Sammy! Come down!

1260
01:39:40,197 --> 01:39:44,242
Hazel, I love you!

1261
01:39:44,410 --> 01:39:46,161
Sammy!

1262
01:39:46,412 --> 01:39:49,080
I didn't jump, Sammy.

1263
01:39:49,707 --> 01:39:52,375
A man stopped me before I jumped.
Get up!

1264
01:39:54,879 --> 01:39:56,588
I didn't jump.

1265
01:40:03,012 --> 01:40:05,513
I know how to do it now.

1266
01:40:05,848 --> 01:40:09,059
There are nearly 13 million people
in the world.

1267
01:40:09,226 --> 01:40:11,102
I mean, can you imagine
that many people?

1268
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:14,439
And none of those people
is an extra.

1269
01:40:15,274 --> 01:40:21,363
They're all leads in their own stories.
They have to be given their due.

1270
01:40:21,947 --> 01:40:23,448
I know how to do it now.

1271
01:40:23,616 --> 01:40:25,784
There are 13 million people
in this world.

1272
01:40:25,951 --> 01:40:28,661
Can you imagine
how many people that is?

1273
01:40:28,829 --> 01:40:32,874
None of those people are an extra.
They're all a lead in their own story.

1274
01:40:33,042 --> 01:40:35,168
They have got to be given their due.

1275
01:40:35,336 --> 01:40:37,712
Do you see what I'm saying?

1276
01:40:38,422 --> 01:40:40,423
Come over tonight.

1277
01:40:43,469 --> 01:40:45,470
Please.

1278
01:40:46,931 --> 01:40:48,932
You know,
we could get a place together.

1279
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:53,812
- We could get a loft.
- God, Caden, that sounds nice.

1280
01:40:53,979 --> 01:40:56,481
I miss my daughter.
Maybe she could come live with us.

1281
01:40:56,649 --> 01:40:58,775
I miss Olive.

1282
01:40:59,402 --> 01:41:00,985
And the other one.

1283
01:41:01,612 --> 01:41:04,114
- I'm a bad person.
- Oh, no, you're not.

1284
01:41:04,281 --> 01:41:07,992
I am. I should never have gone out
with Sammy.

1285
01:41:08,369 --> 01:41:10,703
I was just trying to get to you.

1286
01:41:10,871 --> 01:41:13,498
You can't cause someone
to kill himself.

1287
01:41:14,458 --> 01:41:16,751
He was very troubled.

1288
01:41:17,044 --> 01:41:19,003
God, Caden.

1289
01:41:21,841 --> 01:41:24,884
I wish we had this
when we were young.

1290
01:41:27,847 --> 01:41:30,014
And all those years in between.

1291
01:41:30,182 --> 01:41:32,684
My heart aches so much for you.

1292
01:41:32,852 --> 01:41:35,353
We're here, Caden.

1293
01:41:36,188 --> 01:41:40,942
- I'm here.
- I'm aching for it being over.

1294
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:47,031
Yeah. The end is built
into the beginning.

1295
01:41:47,783 --> 01:41:49,868
What can you do?

1296
01:41:50,035 --> 01:41:53,872
- God, you're just perfect.
- I'm a mess.

1297
01:41:54,498 --> 01:41:58,209
- But we fit, don't we?
- Yeah.

1298
01:42:08,637 --> 01:42:10,555
It doesn't always happen
for me now...

1299
01:42:10,723 --> 01:42:13,516
...because of the medication
and everything.

1300
01:42:13,684 --> 01:42:17,437
- I take a lot of pills.
- It's okay.

1301
01:42:18,564 --> 01:42:23,193
I'm embarrassed. I don't want you
to think it's about you or me.

1302
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,111
It's okay.

1303
01:43:09,698 --> 01:43:11,783
I have a title.

1304
01:43:13,619 --> 01:43:19,249
The Obscure Moon
Lighting an Obscure World.

1305
01:43:22,795 --> 01:43:25,964
I think it might be too much.

1306
01:43:27,383 --> 01:43:29,842
Yeah, probably.

1307
01:43:41,939 --> 01:43:44,566
Sir, could you come up here,
please?

1308
01:44:02,626 --> 01:44:05,128
Might be smoke inhalation.

1309
01:44:10,467 --> 01:44:13,553
It's Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

1310
01:44:13,721 --> 01:44:16,556
I know how to do the play now.

1311
01:44:19,518 --> 01:44:23,104
It'll all take place
over the course of one day...

1312
01:44:24,356 --> 01:44:27,692
...and that day
will be the day before you died.

1313
01:44:29,111 --> 01:44:32,071
It was the happiest day of my life.

1314
01:44:34,867 --> 01:44:37,827
And I'll be able to relive it forever.

1315
01:44:38,245 --> 01:44:40,204
See you soon.

1316
01:44:45,044 --> 01:44:50,340
So have you got any thoughts
for today's rehearsal?

1317
01:44:51,425 --> 01:44:53,635
I have a new title, maybe.

1318
01:44:53,802 --> 01:44:56,804
Infectious Diseases in Cattle.

1319
01:45:00,684 --> 01:45:04,854
The title means a lot of things.
You'll see, it means a lot.

1320
01:45:16,325 --> 01:45:18,910
I need a Caden for my Hazel.

1321
01:45:19,912 --> 01:45:22,038
I'd very much like to play Caden.

1322
01:45:23,749 --> 01:45:26,376
I know that...

1323
01:45:26,752 --> 01:45:30,213
I know that it would be
nontraditional casting...

1324
01:45:30,881 --> 01:45:34,634
...but I think I could do it.
I think I understand him.

1325
01:45:34,802 --> 01:45:36,427
I don't understand him.

1326
01:45:36,595 --> 01:45:43,101
Well, Caden Cotard
is a man already dead.

1327
01:45:43,268 --> 01:45:50,108
He lives in a half world
between stasis and antistasis...

1328
01:45:50,275 --> 01:45:53,986
...and time is concentrated,
chronology confused.

1329
01:45:54,154 --> 01:46:00,284
Yet up until recently,
he's strived valiantly...

1330
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:04,580
...to make sense of his situation.

1331
01:46:05,708 --> 01:46:08,209
But now he's turned to stone.

1332
01:46:09,169 --> 01:46:12,964
- Okay. Sounds good.
- Okay.

1333
01:46:14,466 --> 01:46:16,634
- Thanks.
- She's right?

1334
01:46:16,802 --> 01:46:20,722
I didn't see that at all.
I saw it as much more hopeful.

1335
01:46:22,307 --> 01:46:25,518
None of those people is extras.

1336
01:46:25,686 --> 01:46:28,146
They're all leads in their own stories.

1337
01:46:32,151 --> 01:46:35,820
No, this is tedious. This is nothing.

1338
01:46:39,992 --> 01:46:42,744
Hi, your scene's over.
Would you leave the stage?

1339
01:46:42,911 --> 01:46:45,788
- What is she doing?
- He's directing.

1340
01:46:45,956 --> 01:46:48,791
Can I get you down
at the coffin there?

1341
01:46:48,959 --> 01:46:51,627
She not getting the feel of you,
Caden.

1342
01:46:51,795 --> 01:46:55,506
You don't move around like that.
You don't talk to people.

1343
01:46:59,052 --> 01:47:02,764
Sit on the ground there.
Okay, everybody, let's run it.

1344
01:47:04,725 --> 01:47:07,685
Everything is more complicated
than you think.

1345
01:47:07,853 --> 01:47:10,605
You only see a tenth of what is true.

1346
01:47:10,773 --> 01:47:15,985
There are a million little strings
attached to every choice you make.

1347
01:47:16,153 --> 01:47:18,780
You can destroy your life
every time you choose.

1348
01:47:18,947 --> 01:47:22,366
But maybe you won't know
for 20 years...

1349
01:47:22,701 --> 01:47:25,203
...and you may never, ever trace it
to its source.

1350
01:47:25,370 --> 01:47:27,872
And you only get one chance
to play it out.

1351
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:30,875
Just try and figure out
your own divorce.

1352
01:47:31,585 --> 01:47:36,839
And they say there is no fate,
but there is, it's what you create.

1353
01:47:37,549 --> 01:47:40,259
And even though the world goes on
for eons and eons...

1354
01:47:40,427 --> 01:47:44,972
...you are only here for a fraction
of a fraction of a second.

1355
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:48,351
Most of your time is spent being dead
or not yet born.

1356
01:47:48,519 --> 01:47:51,979
But while alive, you wait in vain...

1357
01:47:52,147 --> 01:47:56,067
...wasting years for a phone call
or a letter or a look...

1358
01:47:56,235 --> 01:47:58,569
...from someone or something
to make it all right.

1359
01:47:58,737 --> 01:48:03,199
And it never comes, or it seems to,
but it doesn't really.

1360
01:48:03,826 --> 01:48:06,202
So you spend your time
in vague regret...

1361
01:48:06,370 --> 01:48:10,039
...or vaguer hope
that something good will come along.

1362
01:48:10,207 --> 01:48:11,916
Something
to make you feel connected.

1363
01:48:12,084 --> 01:48:14,418
Something
to make you feel whole.

1364
01:48:14,586 --> 01:48:17,588
Something
to make you feel loved.

1365
01:48:18,799 --> 01:48:20,675
And the truth is...

1366
01:48:21,844 --> 01:48:24,220
...I feel so angry.

1367
01:48:25,389 --> 01:48:27,265
And the truth is...

1368
01:48:27,975 --> 01:48:31,269
...I feel so fucking sad.

1369
01:48:32,437 --> 01:48:38,192
And the truth is, I've felt
so fucking hurt for so fucking long.

1370
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:41,195
And for just as long,
I've been pretending I'm okay...

1371
01:48:41,363 --> 01:48:44,824
...just to get along, just for...

1372
01:48:45,951 --> 01:48:47,577
I don't know why.

1373
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:52,540
Maybe because no one wants to hear
about my misery...

1374
01:48:53,125 --> 01:48:55,459
...because they have their own.

1375
01:48:58,964 --> 01:49:00,631
Well, fuck everybody.

1376
01:49:03,302 --> 01:49:05,136
- Amen.
- Amen.

1377
01:49:21,778 --> 01:49:23,821
- Delightful.
- Thanks.

1378
01:49:23,989 --> 01:49:25,114
I'm out of ideas.

1379
01:49:29,036 --> 01:49:30,953
I'm dead.

1380
01:49:32,331 --> 01:49:38,085
Well, I could take over as you for a bit
until you feel refreshed.

1381
01:49:38,253 --> 01:49:42,131
I think you're tired, Caden.
All these years of creative work.

1382
01:49:42,674 --> 01:49:48,971
I think you just need some time
to regroup.

1383
01:49:49,806 --> 01:49:53,351
- I need to keep my hand in.
- Well, Ellen needs to be filled.

1384
01:49:53,518 --> 01:49:56,562
- What do you mean?
- Her role. Just for a bit.

1385
01:49:56,730 --> 01:49:59,023
It's a choice role.

1386
01:50:00,901 --> 01:50:03,235
I do like to clean.

1387
01:50:17,834 --> 01:50:19,710
Ellen?

1388
01:50:23,924 --> 01:50:27,885
- Yes?
- Caden asked me to give you this.

1389
01:50:28,053 --> 01:50:31,180
You're to keep it in all the time.

1390
01:50:35,769 --> 01:50:41,065
So touched by the sadness
of Adele's neighbor so close to death.

1391
01:50:42,401 --> 01:50:44,568
Say, "Thank you,"
to Adele's neighbor.

1392
01:50:45,153 --> 01:50:46,362
Thank you.

1393
01:50:46,530 --> 01:50:49,031
You're very welcome, young lady.

1394
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:52,576
- Now say, "Have a very good day. "
- Have a very good day.

1395
01:50:52,744 --> 01:50:55,079
I will indeed.

1396
01:50:59,001 --> 01:51:01,585
Reach for the toilet paper.

1397
01:51:02,295 --> 01:51:05,047
Wrap some around your hand.

1398
01:51:05,424 --> 01:51:07,508
Wipe yourself.

1399
01:51:12,597 --> 01:51:14,932
There was supposed to be
something else.

1400
01:51:16,393 --> 01:51:20,938
You were supposed
to have something, a calm.

1401
01:51:21,106 --> 01:51:22,982
Love.

1402
01:51:23,150 --> 01:51:25,026
Children.

1403
01:51:25,193 --> 01:51:28,112
A child, at least.

1404
01:51:28,655 --> 01:51:30,781
Children.

1405
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:33,576
Meaning.

1406
01:51:40,709 --> 01:51:43,377
Everything okay, Eric?

1407
01:51:45,338 --> 01:51:49,050
- Everything is everything.
- He hates me.

1408
01:51:51,053 --> 01:51:54,597
I disappointed him,
and he hates me.

1409
01:51:56,016 --> 01:52:00,102
Everyone is disappointing
when you know someone.

1410
01:52:04,983 --> 01:52:10,237
I remember having that picnic
with my mother. Look at me.

1411
01:52:10,405 --> 01:52:12,198
Ellen, what is it?

1412
01:52:12,365 --> 01:52:14,492
I was so young.

1413
01:52:14,659 --> 01:52:17,828
I'm going to remember this moment
for the rest of my life, Mama...

1414
01:52:18,246 --> 01:52:22,249
...and in exactly 20 years,
come here with my daughter...

1415
01:52:22,417 --> 01:52:24,168
...and have exactly the same picnic.

1416
01:52:24,336 --> 01:52:25,419
There was so much hope.

1417
01:52:25,587 --> 01:52:28,839
Baby, that the loveliest thing
I've ever heard.

1418
01:52:31,009 --> 01:52:36,472
Oh, God. Sorry, Mommy. I'm sorry.

1419
01:52:55,867 --> 01:52:58,202
Where is my little girl?

1420
01:52:58,370 --> 01:53:02,748
Where is my little girl?
Where is my little girl?

1421
01:53:13,135 --> 01:53:16,345
Look at the night table
for a note from Adele.

1422
01:53:24,312 --> 01:53:26,897
Stare out the window.

1423
01:53:28,275 --> 01:53:32,027
Remember the time she got you
to pose for one of her paintings?

1424
01:53:32,195 --> 01:53:34,780
How she told you
how beautiful you were?

1425
01:53:34,948 --> 01:53:38,909
How she made you feel pretty again
for a little while?

1426
01:53:39,077 --> 01:53:41,412
Think how you'll miss her.

1427
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:43,956
Stand up.

1428
01:53:52,424 --> 01:53:56,093
Now it is waiting, and nobody cares.

1429
01:53:56,261 --> 01:54:00,431
And when your wait is over,
this room will still exist...

1430
01:54:00,599 --> 01:54:05,144
...and it will continue to hold shoes
and dresses and boxes...

1431
01:54:05,312 --> 01:54:08,522
...and maybe someday
another waiting person.

1432
01:54:08,690 --> 01:54:10,608
And maybe not.

1433
01:54:10,942 --> 01:54:13,485
The room doesn't care either.

1434
01:54:29,878 --> 01:54:31,754
Hello?

1435
01:54:51,942 --> 01:54:56,070
There's nobody running the elevator
anymore.

1436
01:55:30,939 --> 01:55:35,109
What was once before you,
an exciting and mysterious future...

1437
01:55:35,277 --> 01:55:40,364
...is now behind you,
lived, understood, disappointing.

1438
01:55:40,865 --> 01:55:43,367
You realize you are not special.

1439
01:55:43,535 --> 01:55:48,914
You have struggled into existence
and are now slipping silently out of it.

1440
01:55:49,082 --> 01:55:53,168
This is everyone's experience.
Every single one.

1441
01:55:53,336 --> 01:55:58,215
The specifics hardly matter.
Everyone is everyone.

1442
01:55:58,383 --> 01:56:00,301
So you are Adele...

1443
01:56:00,468 --> 01:56:04,930
...Hazel, claire, Olive.

1444
01:56:05,890 --> 01:56:10,644
You are Ellen.
All her meager sadnesses are yours.

1445
01:56:10,812 --> 01:56:15,357
All her loneliness.
The gray, straw-like hair.

1446
01:56:15,525 --> 01:56:19,486
Her red, raw hands. It's yours.

1447
01:56:19,654 --> 01:56:22,865
It is time for you to understand this.

1448
01:56:33,585 --> 01:56:35,377
Walk.

1449
01:56:41,718 --> 01:56:44,928
As the people who adore you
stop adoring you...

1450
01:56:45,096 --> 01:56:48,098
...as they die, as they move on...

1451
01:56:48,266 --> 01:56:52,770
...as you shed them, as you shed
your beauty, your youth...

1452
01:56:52,937 --> 01:56:56,273
...as the world forgets you,
as you recognize your transience...

1453
01:56:56,816 --> 01:57:00,819
...as you begin to lose
your characteristics one by one...

1454
01:57:00,987 --> 01:57:03,197
...as you learn
there is no one watching you...

1455
01:57:03,365 --> 01:57:07,326
...and there never was,
you think only about driving.

1456
01:57:07,494 --> 01:57:11,622
Not coming from anyplace,
not arriving anyplace...

1457
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:15,667
...just driving, counting off time.

1458
01:57:15,835 --> 01:57:19,296
Now you are here. It's 7:43.

1459
01:57:19,464 --> 01:57:22,424
Now you are here. It's 7:44.

1460
01:57:22,592 --> 01:57:25,928
Now you are gone.

1461
01:57:32,852 --> 01:57:34,978
Where is everybody?

1462
01:57:36,189 --> 01:57:41,318
Mostly dead. Some have left.

1463
01:57:47,575 --> 01:57:53,914
Would you sit with me for a moment?
Because I'm very tired and lonely.

1464
01:58:13,852 --> 01:58:16,019
I feel like I know you.

1465
01:58:16,563 --> 01:58:21,108
Well, I was the mother
in Ellen's dream.

1466
01:58:21,276 --> 01:58:22,776
Yes.

1467
01:58:25,738 --> 01:58:28,532
You seem a bit older
than I remember.

1468
01:58:28,700 --> 01:58:31,034
That dream was quite a while ago.

1469
01:58:31,953 --> 01:58:34,121
Apologize.

1470
01:58:34,289 --> 01:58:36,123
I didn't mean to say you looked old.

1471
01:58:46,676 --> 01:58:49,470
There's everyone's dreams
in all those apartments.

1472
01:58:52,932 --> 01:58:58,020
All those thoughts I'll never know.
That's the truth of it.

1473
01:59:03,610 --> 01:59:07,237
I wanted to do that picnic
with my daughter.

1474
01:59:11,034 --> 01:59:13,327
I feel like
I've disappointed you terribly.

1475
01:59:13,495 --> 01:59:17,706
Oh, no. I am so proud of you.

1476
01:59:18,708 --> 01:59:21,251
Ask her if you can put your head
on her shoulder.

1477
01:59:21,419 --> 01:59:24,588
Can I lay my head
on your shoulder?

1478
01:59:24,839 --> 01:59:26,381
Yes.

1479
01:59:35,808 --> 01:59:37,809
I love you.

1480
01:59:41,064 --> 01:59:43,106
I love you too.

1481
02:00:05,296 --> 02:00:08,298
I know how to do this play now.

1482
02:00:10,301 --> 02:00:12,636
I have an idea.

1483
02:00:13,137 --> 02:00:15,681
I think if everyone...

1484
02:00:15,848 --> 02:00:18,348
Die.
