1
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:51,675
It's the sense of touch.

2
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:55,253
What?

3
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,490
Any real city, you walk, you know?

4
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:04,360
You brush past people.
People bump into you.

5
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:07,523
In L.A., nobody touches you.

6
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,535
We're always behind
this metal and glass.

7
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:17,909
I think we miss
that touch so much

8
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:21,970
that we crash into each other
just so we can feel something.

9
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:26,178
You guys okay?

10
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,378
I think he hit his head.

11
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:31,289
You don't think that's true?

12
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,391
Stay in your car.

13
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:36,191
Graham, I think
we got rear-ended.

14
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:38,355
I think we spun around twice.

15
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:43,425
And somewhere in there,
one of us lost our frame of reference.

16
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:45,937
And I'm gonna go look for it.

17
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:50,772
- Calm down, ma'am.
- I am calm!

18
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:52,970
I need to see your registration
and insurance.

19
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,014
Why? It's not my fault!
It's her fault! She do this!

20
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:57,049
My fault?

21
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,018
Ma'am, you really need
to wait in your vehicle.

22
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:00,052
My fault?

23
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:02,521
Stop in middle of street!
Mexicans no know how to drive.

24
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:04,656
She "blake" too fast.

25
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:07,420
I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.

26
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:10,587
- I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights.
- Ma'am.

27
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:14,133
See, I stop when I see a long line of cars
stopped in front of me.

28
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:17,203
Maybe you see over
steering wheel, you "blake" too!

29
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:18,404
Ma'am!

30
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:20,669
I call immigration on you.
Look what you do my car.

31
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:24,505
Officer, can you please write in your report how
shocked I am to be hit by an Asian driver!

32
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:27,705
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am, no. See, Detective...

33
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:36,119
All right. You've got to calm down.

34
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:46,027
Hey, Detective! Nice entrance.

35
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:48,132
Fuck you.

36
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:52,971
Hey, you okay?

37
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:55,374
I'm freezin'.

38
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,139
Shit. I heard it might snow.

39
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:00,542
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

40
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:03,343
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

41
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:06,145
Yeah, me too.

42
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:08,754
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

43
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:21,065
Hey, Bob.

44
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:05,242
You get one free box of ammunition.
What kind do you want?

45
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:21,116
Yo, Osama! Plan a jihad
on your own time.

46
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:23,821
What do you want?

47
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,167
Are you making insult at me?

48
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:31,069
Am I making insult "at" you?
Is that the closest you can come to English?

49
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:34,106
- Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen.
- Oh, God, here we go.

50
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:36,573
I have right like you.
I have right to buy gun.

51
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:38,803
Not in my store, you don't!
Andy, get him outta here now!

52
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:41,073
- Go wait in the car.
- Now. Get out!

53
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:44,216
You're an ignorant man!

54
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:45,951
Yeah, I'm ignorant?
You're liberating my country.

55
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:48,978
And I'm flying 747 s into your mud huts
and incinerating your friends?

56
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:52,114
- Get the fuck out!
- No, you get the fuck out!

57
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:53,992
No, don't touch me!
He cheat me!

58
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:55,993
- Andy, now!
- Let's go.

59
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:57,995
Okay.

60
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,865
You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.

61
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,031
And I am really hoping
for the money.

62
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:14,405
- What kind of ammunition do you want?
- Whatever fits.

63
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:16,514
We got a lot of kinds.

64
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:19,015
We got long colts,
short colts, bull heads,

65
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:21,644
flat nose, hollow points,
wide cutters,

66
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:25,224
and a dozen more that'll fit
any size hole.

67
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:29,091
Just depends upon how
much bang you can handle.

68
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,396
I'll take the ones
in the red box.

69
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,069
- You know what those are?
- Can I have them?

70
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:53,379
Did you see any white people waitin' an hour
and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?

71
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,053
And how many cups of coffee
did we get?

72
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:57,989
You don't drink coffee
and I didn't want any.

73
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:01,788
Man, that woman poured cup after cup
to every single white person around us.

74
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:04,955
But did she even ask you
if you wanted any?

75
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:07,064
We didn't get any coffee that you didn't want
and I didn't order,

76
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:09,363
and that's evidence
of racial discrimination?

77
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:11,469
Did you notice
that our waitress was black?

78
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,039
And black women don't think
in stereotypes?

79
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,574
You tell me.
When was the last time you met one

80
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:18,940
who didn't think she knew
everything about your lazy ass

81
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:21,013
before you even opened
your mouth, huh?

82
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:23,278
That waitress sized us up
in two seconds.

83
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:27,182
We're black, and black people don't tip.
She wasn't gonna waste her time.

84
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:30,256
Somebody like that? Nothing you can do
to change their mind.

85
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,824
How much did you leave?

86
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,926
You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?

87
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:39,322
What? What the fuck
is you laughin' at, man?

88
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:42,458
I'm seriously starting to think
that you're jealous of Karen.

89
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:46,767
Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through
a meal without calling her or anyone else.

90
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:51,401
Okay, no more phone calls.
As a matter of fact, you can hold the battery.

91
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:53,511
Okay?

92
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:57,146
Ten bucks says
she calls you in the car.

93
00:08:57,283 --> 00:08:59,945
Wait, wait, wait.
See what that woman just did?

94
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:02,086
- You see that?
- She's cold.

95
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:05,488
She got colder
as soon as she saw us.

96
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:08,720
- Ah, come on, don't start.
- Man, look around you, man.

97
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:12,286
You couldn't find a whiter, safer
or better-lit part of this city right now.

98
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,398
But yet this white woman
sees two black guys

99
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,096
who look like UCLA students
strolling down the sidewalk,

100
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:19,637
and her reaction
is blind fear?

101
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:22,230
Look at us, dawg.
Are we dressed like gangbangers?

102
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:25,675
Huh? No.
Do we look threatening? No.

103
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:29,680
Fact. If anybody should be
scared around here, it's us!

104
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:33,752
We're the only two black faces surrounded by
a sea of over-caffeinated white people

105
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:36,583
patrolled by
the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.

106
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:40,250
So you tell me.
Why aren't we scared?

107
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,555
'Cause we got guns?

108
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:44,662
You could be right.

109
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:49,763
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- Gimme the keys!

110
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:52,599
- Hurry up! Get down!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

111
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:56,937
- No, no! Please!
- Don't look at me! Turn around!

112
00:09:57,043 --> 00:10:00,570
- Come on! Go!
- We're fine! Just keep moving!

113
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:10,222
No, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing
off of there right now.

114
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,654
I know you just didn't call
Saint Christopher voodoo.

115
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,726
Man's the patron saint
of travelers, dawg.

116
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:17,594
You had a conversation
with God, huh? What did God say?

117
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:22,191
"Go forth, my son, and leave big slobbery
suction rings on every dashboard you find"?

118
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:23,502
Why the hell do you do that?

119
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:26,370
Look at the way your crazy ass drive,
then ask me again.

120
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:36,638
Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on Balboa.

121
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:39,445
Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes
gets pissed, pulls a gun.

122
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:42,247
Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup
is a cop coming off shift.

123
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:44,356
This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?

124
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,791
Yeah. Name's Conklin.
He's a narc out of Wilshire.

125
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:48,893
I got the Mercedes.

126
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:53,291
Mercedes takes a shot at him.
Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.

127
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,960
Mercedes rolls to a stop. Driver opens the
door, falls out dead.

128
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,868
He looks very relaxed
for just having shot somebody.

129
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:01,873
He says he kept tryin'
to drive away.

130
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:03,933
The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,
screaming, waving a gun.

131
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:06,637
Shot back in self-defense.

132
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:10,944
- Anybody actually see who shot first?
- They just heard two bangs.

133
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:13,084
Find me a witness.

134
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,864
That is a nice gun.

135
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:34,531
The car's registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

136
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,608
And that's not Cindy.

137
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:39,407
That is a William Lewis.

138
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:42,481
Found under the front seat.
Hollywood Division.

139
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:50,922
Looks like Detective Conklin
shot himself the wrong nigger.

140
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:05,596
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- This is the last one.

141
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:07,705
Thank you.

142
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:18,748
You don't think reporters listen to police calls?

143
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:20,851
I need to talk to you
for a second.

144
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:24,990
You just give me a minute,
all right?

145
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,957
- Find Flanagan, will you? Now.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:30,896
Yes, honey?

147
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:32,831
I want the locks changed again in the morning.

148
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:36,563
You want... Why don't you just go lie down?
Have you checked on James?

149
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:39,604
Of course. I've checked on him every five
minutes since we've been home.

150
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:43,937
Do not patronize me. I want the locks
changed again in the morning.

151
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:47,338
It's okay.
Just go to bed.

152
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:50,939
You know, didn't I just ask you
not to treat me like a child?

153
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:55,145
I'm sorry, Miss Jean.
Is okay I go home now?

154
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,922
It's fine. Thank you
very much for staying.

155
00:12:56,923 --> 00:12:58,657
You're welcome. No problem.
Good night.

156
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:01,422
- Good night.
- We'll see you tomorrow.

157
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:05,623
I would like the locks
changed again in the morning.

158
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:08,063
And you might mention
that we'd appreciate it

159
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,362
if next time they didn't send
a gang member.

160
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,768
- A gang member? You mean that kid in there?
- Yes, yes.

161
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:16,569
Yes. The guy with the shaved head,
the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.

162
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:18,009
- Those are not prison tattoos.
- Oh, really?

163
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,308
And he's not gonna sell our key
to one of his gangbanger friends

164
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:22,779
- the moment he is out our door?
- We've had a tough night.

165
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:26,578
- It'd be best if you went upstairs...
- And wait for them to break in?

166
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:30,155
I just had a gun pointed in my face.

167
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:31,389
You lower your voice!

168
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,257
And it was my fault
because I knew it was gonna happen.

169
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,851
But if a white person sees two black men
walking towards her,

170
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:40,524
and she turns and walks in the other direction,
she's a racist, right?

171
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:43,227
Well, I got scared
and I didn't say anything.

172
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:45,600
And ten seconds later
I had a gun in my face!

173
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:49,903
I am telling you. Your amigo in there is gonna
sell our key to one of his homies.

174
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:54,503
And this time it'd be really fucking great
if you acted like you actually gave a shit!

175
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:24,636
All right, what have we got?
Talk to me, Karen.

176
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:26,744
Flanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.

177
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:29,179
I'm the goddamn
District Attorney of Los Angeles.

178
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:32,478
If my car gets jacked,
it's gonna make news.

179
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:34,618
Fuck!

180
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:37,885
Why did these guys
have to be black?

181
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,758
I mean, why?

182
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,526
No matter how we spin this,

183
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:44,587
I'm either gonna lose the black vote
or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.

184
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:48,258
You're worrying too much. You have
a lot of support in the black community.

185
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:52,494
All right. If we can't duck this thing,
we're gonna have to neutralize it.

186
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:57,167
What we need is a picture of me
pinning a medal on a black man.

187
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:59,276
Bruce?

188
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,147
The firefighter.

189
00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:05,083
The one who saved the camp or something.
Northridge. What's his name?

190
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:07,184
He's Iraqi.

191
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,517
He's Iraqi?
Well, he looks black.

192
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:14,423
He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.
His name's Saddam Khahum.

193
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:17,519
Saddam?
His-His name's Saddam?

194
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,726
That's real good, Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medal
on an Iraqi named Saddam.

195
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:24,029
Give yourself a raise, will you?

196
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,769
It's been good
doing business with you.

197
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:34,010
- How soon can I have them?
- I'm picking them up right now.

198
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:37,742
Look, you're not listening to me.
This is an emergency.

199
00:15:37,883 --> 00:15:40,750
I keep telling you he's in pain.
He can't sleep.

200
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:44,755
Mr. Ryan, your father has been to the clinic
three times in the last month.

201
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:50,159
He is being treated for a urinary tract infection.
That is by no means an emergency.

202
00:15:50,263 --> 00:15:54,393
If you have any more questions
about your HMO plan, why don't you

203
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,061
make an appointment to come in between
10:00 and 4:00, Monday through Friday.

204
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,229
What does my father do
about sleeping tonight?

205
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,207
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

206
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,041
- I wanna talk to your supervisor.
- I am my supervisor!

207
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:07,144
- What is your name?
- Shaniqua Johnson.

208
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:09,842
Shaniqua.
Big fucking surprise that is.

209
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:28,531
Bronson Avenue, Westwood.

210
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:31,330
Vehicle is described as a black
late-model Lincoln Navigator.

211
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:35,965
California plate
4 Peter Charles Ida 315.

212
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:39,511
Suspects are two black males,
approximately 20 years of age.

213
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
That's not it.

214
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:52,189
That's not the vehicle, John.
The plates don't match.

215
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:55,955
The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car
and takes it to Studio City.

216
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:03,331
They were doin' something.

217
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:49,646
Enthusiastic.

218
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:52,409
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, please.

219
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:56,783
I'm gonna need to see
your driver's license and registration.

220
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:59,050
No problem.

221
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:03,026
I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove
compartment to get the registration.

222
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:05,495
- Is that okay?
- Nice and slow, please.

223
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:07,598
Okay.

224
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,298
How are you tonight, Officer?

225
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:15,406
Excellent.

226
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:19,109
Here you go.

227
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:24,207
Stay inside the vehicle, please.

228
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:35,685
Let's do it again right now.

229
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:38,554
Step outta the car, please, sir.

230
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:42,361
Wait a minute, Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.

231
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:44,698
Then we shouldn't have a problem.

232
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:47,398
He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.

233
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:49,506
No, it's okay.

234
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:51,508
It's fine.

235
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:58,081
Step onto the sidewalk, sir.

236
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:01,880
That's good. Right there.

237
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:05,622
Look at me.

238
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:08,058
I want you to stand
on your right foot.

239
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:12,257
Touch your nose
with the index finger of your left hand.

240
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:18,660
I told you he doesn't drink.

241
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:21,968
Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you
one time to stay in the vehicle.

242
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:24,668
- Ma'am?
- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.

243
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:28,144
Don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

244
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:31,444
Look, Officer, my wife
has had a couple of drinks...

245
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:34,553
Both of you, turn around. Put your hands on
top of your head and interlock your fingers.

246
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,554
Wait. We're only a block away from our house.

247
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:38,955
Hands on your head.
Interlock your fingers.

248
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:42,118
- Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.
- I'm a television director.

249
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:44,992
Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.

250
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:47,429
Take your hands off him.
He's done nothing wrong.

251
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,626
Put your hands on top
of your head, ma'am.

252
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:51,336
- Do what he says.
- Fuck you!

253
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:52,403
Put your hands...

254
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:55,202
And you keep
your filthy fucking hands off me!

255
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:57,041
You motherfucking pig!

256
00:19:57,042 --> 00:20:00,569
- Just stop talking!
- That's quite a mouth you have.

257
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:02,547
Of course you know that.

258
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:06,348
Fuck you! That's what
this is all about, isn't it?

259
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:09,250
You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a
black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.

260
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:11,189
Will you just shut
your fucking mouth!

261
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,250
I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.

262
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,658
Put your legs open.

263
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,890
Do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?

264
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:25,493
I'm wearing a cocktail dress.
What do you think?

265
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:27,731
You'd be surprised some of the places
I've found weapons.

266
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,840
He's clean.

267
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:34,144
What do you think we should do about this,
Mr. Thayer?

268
00:20:35,014 --> 00:20:38,347
My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing fellatio on you

269
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,611
while you were operating
a motor vehicle.

270
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:44,849
That's reckless endangerment,
which incidentally is a felony.

271
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:51,455
We could charge your wife with lewd conduct
and performing a sexual act in public.

272
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:56,429
You say you're a block from home.

273
00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:58,901
We could use our discretion

274
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:01,029
and let you go with a warning,

275
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:04,408
or we could cuff you and put you
in the back of the car.

276
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:10,114
What do you think
we should do, sir?

277
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:20,854
Look, we're sorry, and

278
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,489
we would appreciate if you would just
let us go with a warning, please.

279
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:33,799
The man's apologizing, Tommy.

280
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:37,000
I think we can let him go.
Don't you?

281
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,379
Yeah.

282
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,644
All right.

283
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:46,817
You can go.

284
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:58,126
You folks
drive safe now, huh?

285
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:34,730
Let's go, Tommy.

286
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,875
It won't close.

287
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:47,178
I can do that.

288
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:49,179
Dad, you couldn't even get it open.

289
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:51,181
Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun!

290
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:55,613
Here. Now you can shoot
anybody you want.

291
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:58,518
Dorri, that man
could've killed your mother.

292
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:01,991
You think I should let crazy people
do what they want to us?

293
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:04,094
Farhad, it won't close.

294
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,634
Dorri, you should be at work.

295
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:24,181
Who are you calling?

296
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:26,910
I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.

297
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:31,011
You actually believe they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriously?

298
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:35,490
Do you have any idea how that felt?
To have that pig's hands all over me?

299
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:37,594
And you just stood there!

300
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:41,332
And then you apologized to him?

301
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,234
What did you want me to do?
Get us both shot?

302
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:47,772
They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.

303
00:23:47,873 --> 00:23:51,639
Well, maybe you would've been satisfied
with just being arrested.

304
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:55,612
Oh, I get it. Much better to let him
shove his hand up my crotch

305
00:23:55,748 --> 00:23:58,512
than get your name in the paper.

306
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,743
You finally got me
figured out, 'cause see,

307
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:03,650
that's exactly
what I was worried about right there.

308
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:06,816
Oh? You weren't afraid that
all your good friends at the studio

309
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:10,793
were gonna read about you in the morning
and realize he's actually black?

310
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:14,456
You need to calm down right now.

311
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:19,401
What I need is a husband who will not just
stand there while I am being molested!

312
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:22,474
They were cops for God sakes!
They had guns!

313
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,873
Maybe I should've let them
arrest your ass.

314
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:30,710
Sooner or later you gotta find out
what it is really like to be black.

315
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,718
Fuck you, man.
Like you know.

316
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:37,416
The closest you ever came to being black,
Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.

317
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:40,617
At least I wasn't watching it
with the rest of the equestrian team.

318
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:42,887
You're right, Cameron.
I got a lot to learn

319
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:46,089
'cause I haven't quite learned
how to shuck and jive.

320
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:49,065
Let me hear it again.
Thank you, mister policeman.

321
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:51,898
You sure is mighty kind
to us poor black folk.

322
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:56,532
You be sure to let me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife.

323
00:24:58,076 --> 00:25:00,977
How the fuck do you say
something like that to me?

324
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:04,114
You know, fuck you!

325
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,045
That's good. A little anger.
It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!

326
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:00,071
How's it goin'?

327
00:26:00,072 --> 00:26:01,839
Okay.

328
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,967
You didn't get scared
or something, did you?

329
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:06,840
There's no monsters in the closet, right?
'Cause I hate monsters.

330
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:09,937
There's no such thing
as monsters.

331
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,048
Ah, that's a good thing.

332
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:13,751
I heard a bang.

333
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:15,486
Like a truck bang?

334
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:17,546
Like a gun.

335
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,664
That's funny, 'cause we moved
outta that bad neighborhood.

336
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:31,565
And there's not
too many guns around here.

337
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:35,337
How far can bullets go?

338
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
They go pretty far.

339
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:40,307
But they usually get stuck
in something and stop.

340
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:42,179
What if they don't?

341
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,946
You thinking about that bullet
that came through your window?

342
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:51,028
'cause we never did find it, did we?

343
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:54,036
I think it didn't see me
'cause I was under the covers.

344
00:26:55,932 --> 00:26:57,932
Hmm. And you think it's that
same bullet that you heard tonight.

345
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:05,773
You think we should move again?

346
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,416
I like it here.

347
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,417
Me too. But if that bullet
found out where we lived...

348
00:27:11,054 --> 00:27:12,154
Oh, hold on.

349
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:13,756
What?

350
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,782
So stupid!
How can I forget this?

351
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:19,194
What?

352
00:27:20,364 --> 00:27:22,131
Nah. Forget it.
You ain't gonna believe me.

353
00:27:22,132 --> 00:27:24,132
Tell me.

354
00:27:24,568 --> 00:27:27,002
Okay.

355
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,767
When I was five, this fairy
came into my room one night.

356
00:27:30,874 --> 00:27:33,502
- Right.
- See, I told you you weren't gonna believe me.

357
00:27:33,643 --> 00:27:36,077
- Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.
- No, tell me.

358
00:27:38,215 --> 00:27:40,479
Okay.

359
00:27:40,584 --> 00:27:45,851
So this fairy comes into my room and I'm like,
"Yeah, right, you're a fairy."

360
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,981
Anyway, we're talking, you know.

361
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:51,185
And she's flying all around the room,
knocking down all my posters and stuff.

362
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,660
She was flying?

363
00:27:53,764 --> 00:27:56,392
She had these little stubby wings.
She could've glued 'em on, you know?

364
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,128
Like I'm gonna believe
she's a fairy.

365
00:27:59,236 --> 00:28:01,236
So she said, "I'll prove it."

366
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,898
So she reaches
into her backpack.

367
00:28:04,007 --> 00:28:06,271
And she pulls out
this invisible cloak.

368
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:10,972
She ties it around my neck, and she tells me
that it's impenetrable.

369
00:28:11,114 --> 00:28:13,344
You know what
impenetrable means?

370
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,351
It means that nothing
can go through it.

371
00:28:15,352 --> 00:28:17,616
No bullets. Nothing.

372
00:28:17,721 --> 00:28:21,589
She told me that if I wore it,
nothing would hurt me.

373
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:26,651
So I did. And my whole life,
I never got shot, stabbed.

374
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:29,698
Nothing.
I mean, how weird is that?

375
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,759
Only she told me that I was supposed to give it
to my daughter on her fifth birthday.

376
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,738
And I forgot.

377
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:37,373
Can I touch it?

378
00:28:37,374 --> 00:28:39,399
Sure, go ahead.

379
00:28:41,812 --> 00:28:44,804
- I don't feel it.
- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

380
00:28:44,948 --> 00:28:48,816
I can take it off and tie it around your
shoulders. She told me how to do it.

381
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:52,548
- Unless you think it's stupid.
- Don't you need it?

382
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:55,454
No, not anymore.

383
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,494
So what do you think?
You want it?

384
00:29:04,768 --> 00:29:06,768
Okay, let's get outta here.

385
00:29:12,242 --> 00:29:14,242
Okay.

386
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,852
Put your head up.

387
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:37,527
Okay. Is that too tight?

388
00:29:37,634 --> 00:29:40,102
Do you feel anything at all?

389
00:29:40,203 --> 00:29:42,603
Good. Then it's just right.

390
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,380
Do I take it off
when I have a bath?

391
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:54,279
No, you leave it on
all the time.

392
00:29:54,384 --> 00:29:59,754
Until you have a daughter when she turns five,
then you give it to her.

393
00:29:59,856 --> 00:30:01,856
Okay?

394
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:04,025
Okay.

395
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:08,864
Okay. Good night, sweetie.

396
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:12,591
Good night.

397
00:30:51,942 --> 00:30:55,343
Nah, nah. You wanna listen to music
of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.

398
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:59,510
How in the lunacy of your mind
is hip-hop music of the oppressor?

399
00:30:59,616 --> 00:31:02,881
Listen to it, man!
"Nigger this, nigger that."

400
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,444
You think white people go around calling
each other honkies all day, man?

401
00:31:06,556 --> 00:31:08,090
"Hey, honky, how's business?"

402
00:31:08,091 --> 00:31:10,091
"Going great, cracker.
We're diversifying."

403
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,961
How 'bout this, huh? Listen. You like that?
Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.

404
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:16,899
And you think
there's a difference, don't you? Huh?

405
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,996
Gonna buy me a rope
and lynch me a nigger

406
00:31:21,104 --> 00:31:24,301
You have absolutely no idea where hip-hop
music comes from, do you?

407
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:26,967
I'd shoot 'em dead first
but I done broke my trigger

408
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,340
See, back in the '60s we had
smart, articulate black men.

409
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:31,777
Gonna get out my sheet
Put my hood on my head

410
00:31:31,881 --> 00:31:34,782
Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,
Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.

411
00:31:34,884 --> 00:31:36,352
Gonna string 'em up good

412
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,254
These brothers were speaking out,
and people were listening!

413
00:31:38,255 --> 00:31:40,055
Then they'll be dead

414
00:31:40,056 --> 00:31:42,056
Then the FBI said,
"No, we can't have that."

415
00:31:42,158 --> 00:31:44,956
Home of the brave
and the land of the free

416
00:31:45,061 --> 00:31:47,120
"Let's give the niggers
this music by a bunch of mumbling idiots

417
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,960
and sooner or later,
they'll all copy it, and nobody

418
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:52,066
will be able to understand
a fucking word they say.

419
00:31:52,168 --> 00:31:54,329
End of problem."

420
00:32:01,311 --> 00:32:03,311
What the fuck was that, dawg?

421
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,190
- Holy shit!
- What?

422
00:32:19,296 --> 00:32:21,296
Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.

423
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:23,932
You're sayin' there's a Chinaman
under this truck?

424
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:25,134
What part don't you understand?

425
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:27,968
There's a Chinaman stuck
underneath the fucking truck.

426
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:31,507
Help me.

427
00:32:31,508 --> 00:32:34,170
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

428
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:37,974
Ah, God. What the hell did he do,
just leap out in front of the truck?

429
00:32:38,882 --> 00:32:41,146
Man! This is so
completely fucked up.

430
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,218
Oh, really? No shit!

431
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:46,279
Okay, hold up.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

432
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:48,389
- Get back in the truck.
- What?

433
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:50,653
- Yes, get back in the truck.
- You think we didn't drag him far enough?

434
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,627
No, we gonna drive away.
And he gonna let go.

435
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,531
He's not gonna let go, Anthony.

436
00:32:55,532 --> 00:32:58,626
You know why? Because he's stuck
underneath the fucking truck!

437
00:32:58,735 --> 00:33:03,968
Now, if he could've let go, he probably would've
considered that option half a block back.

438
00:33:04,074 --> 00:33:07,532
What you and I gotta do, just grab his arms
and pull him from underneath.

439
00:33:07,677 --> 00:33:09,411
You grab his arm,
it's gonna fall off.

440
00:33:09,412 --> 00:33:12,176
Then you gonna be standing in the street
holding a Chinaman's arm.

441
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,282
Then what your ass gonna do, huh?

442
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,645
If we leave this man here, he dies.
Then we're up for murder charges.

443
00:33:19,656 --> 00:33:22,716
Just grab his arm.
We'll just pull him out.

444
00:33:27,897 --> 00:33:31,196
I don't wanna cause any problems, Lieutenant.
I just want a new partner.

445
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,360
I understand. Your partner's a racist prick.

446
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,904
But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feelings with him.

447
00:33:36,005 --> 00:33:37,906
He's been on the force for a long time.

448
00:33:37,907 --> 00:33:40,068
Seventeen years.

449
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,405
And I do have to work here, sir.

450
00:33:42,545 --> 00:33:44,945
So you don't mind
that there's a racist prick on the force.

451
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:48,017
You just don't want him
to ride in your car.

452
00:33:48,118 --> 00:33:50,916
If you need me to go on record
about this, sir, I will.

453
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,921
That'd be great.
Write a full report.

454
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:55,720
Because I'm anxious to
understand how an obvious bigot

455
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,760
could've gone undetected
in this department for 17 years.

456
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:01,023
Eleven of which he was under
my personal supervision.

457
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:03,531
Which doesn't speak very highly
of my managerial skills.

458
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:07,330
But that's not your concern.
I can't wait to read it.

459
00:34:07,437 --> 00:34:11,339
What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personal reasons?

460
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:14,706
So now you're saying he's not a racist prick,
you just don't like him.

461
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,711
- Yes, sir.
- That's not a good enough reason.

462
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:20,715
Then I guess I should think of a better one
and get back to you.

463
00:34:20,817 --> 00:34:23,752
So you think I'm asking you
to make one up.

464
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:28,620
Uh, no, sir. I just can't
think of one... right now.

465
00:34:28,725 --> 00:34:30,818
You wanna know what I heard?

466
00:34:32,262 --> 00:34:34,321
I heard it was a case
of uncontrollable flatulence.

467
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:36,558
You want me to say
he has flatulence?

468
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:39,430
Not him. You.
You have uncontrollable flatulence.

469
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,994
You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody
else so you're requesting a one-man car.

470
00:34:43,106 --> 00:34:46,041
I'm not... comfortable with that,
Lieutenant.

471
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:49,077
I wouldn't be either. Which is why
I understand your need for privacy.

472
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:52,945
Just like I'm sure you understand how hard
a black man has to work to get to,

473
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,177
say, where I am, in a racist fucking
organization like the L.A.P.D.

474
00:34:56,286 --> 00:34:59,312
and how easily
that can be taken away.

475
00:34:59,422 --> 00:35:02,516
Now, that being said,
it's your decision.

476
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:07,426
You can put your career and mine on the line
in pursuit of a just cause,

477
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,432
or you can admit to having
an embarrassing problem

478
00:35:11,534 --> 00:35:13,832
of a personal nature.

479
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,140
Fuck.

480
00:35:49,506 --> 00:35:51,506
Excuse me.

481
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,435
Excuse me. Sir?

482
00:35:54,577 --> 00:35:55,944
You finished?

483
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,711
I replaced the lock.
But you got a real problem with that door.

484
00:35:59,816 --> 00:36:02,284
You fix the lock?

485
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:06,548
Nah, I replaced the lock.
But you gotta fix that door.

486
00:36:06,656 --> 00:36:10,057
- Just fix the lock!
- Sir, sir, sir. Listen to me.

487
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,322
What you need
is a new door.

488
00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:15,863
- I need new door?
- Yeah.

489
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,433
Okay. How much?

490
00:36:18,535 --> 00:36:22,471
I don't... Sir, you're gonna have to call
somebody that sells doors.

491
00:36:22,572 --> 00:36:26,668
You try to cheat me, right?
You have a friend that fix door?

492
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,936
Nah, I don't have a friend
that fix doors, bro.

493
00:36:29,078 --> 00:36:31,410
Then go and fix the fucking lock, you cheater.

494
00:36:31,514 --> 00:36:34,278
You... You know what?

495
00:36:34,384 --> 00:36:37,842
Why don't you just pay for the lock
and I won't charge you for the time.

496
00:36:37,954 --> 00:36:40,354
You don't fix the lock!
I pay! You think I'm stupid?

497
00:36:40,456 --> 00:36:43,619
You fix the fucking lock,
you cheater!

498
00:36:43,726 --> 00:36:46,217
- I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.
- Then fix the fucking lock!

499
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,765
I replaced the lock!
You gotta fix the fucking door!

500
00:36:49,866 --> 00:36:53,097
You cheat!
You fucking cheater!

501
00:36:53,202 --> 00:36:55,898
- Fine. Don't pay.
- What?

502
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,735
- Have a good night.
- What? No. Wait!

503
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,844
Wait! You come back here!
You fix the lock!

504
00:37:01,978 --> 00:37:04,105
Come here! You fix my lock!

505
00:37:04,247 --> 00:37:06,247
Fix the fucking lock!

506
00:37:11,955 --> 00:37:15,914
I understand. You run over a Chinaman.
Stuff him in the back.

507
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,892
Then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.

508
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:21,828
Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.
It'll wash right off.

509
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:24,229
- Georgie, burn this thing.
- Burn it?

510
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:26,564
It's a brand-new Navigator.
All you need is a little piece of carpet.

511
00:37:26,669 --> 00:37:28,669
You watch the Discovery Channel?

512
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:32,172
- Not a lot.
- They got some good shit on that channel.

513
00:37:32,308 --> 00:37:35,869
Every night there is a show
with somebody shining a blue light

514
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:40,210
and finding tiny specks of blood splattered
on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,

515
00:37:40,316 --> 00:37:44,844
bathroom fixtures and special-edition plastic
Burger King tray cups.

516
00:37:44,954 --> 00:37:48,446
The next thing they show is some stupid
redneck in handcuffs

517
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:52,756
who looks absolutely stunned
that this is happening to him.

518
00:37:52,862 --> 00:37:55,888
Sometimes the redneck is actually watching
the Discovery Channel

519
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:57,999
when they break in to arrest him.

520
00:37:58,101 --> 00:38:03,334
And he still can't figure out how on earth
they could've caught him!

521
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,182
Do I look like I wanna be
on the Discovery Channel?

522
00:38:15,284 --> 00:38:16,585
No.

523
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:19,146
Then get the fuck
outta my shop.

524
00:38:21,658 --> 00:38:23,785
Oh, yeah, make sure
you get that.

525
00:38:23,893 --> 00:38:27,294
Without him, things could've gone really
fucking wrong tonight.

526
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:33,165
- Fuck!
- Don't! Don't you dare.

527
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,237
Don't.

528
00:38:35,238 --> 00:38:38,332
Graham Waters.

529
00:38:38,474 --> 00:38:42,706
No. No, he's not here, Mom.

530
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,149
I'm not gonna go looking for him.

531
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,582
Look, he'll be home when...
Just leave it alone.

532
00:38:50,687 --> 00:38:55,351
Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?
I'm having sex with a white woman.

533
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,892
Okay, where were we?

534
00:38:57,994 --> 00:39:00,462
I was white, and you were
about to jerk off in the shower.

535
00:39:00,563 --> 00:39:03,430
Oh, shit!

536
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:05,592
Come on.

537
00:39:05,702 --> 00:39:10,662
I would've said you were Mexican, but I don't
think it would've pissed her off as much.

538
00:39:10,773 --> 00:39:13,071
Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance, huh?

539
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:16,838
- What, you start to feel something and panic?
- Come on, Maria.

540
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,415
You're just pissed
'cause I answered the phone.

541
00:39:20,516 --> 00:39:22,882
That's just where
I begin to get pissed.

542
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:26,318
I mean, really, what kind of man
speaks to his mother that way?

543
00:39:26,422 --> 00:39:30,483
Oh, this is about my mother.
What do you know about my mother?

544
00:39:30,593 --> 00:39:33,528
If I was your father,
I'd kick your fucking ass.

545
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,997
Okay. I was raised badly.

546
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,536
Why don't you take your clothes off,
get back into bed and teach me a lesson?

547
00:39:40,636 --> 00:39:44,595
You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.
How 'bout a geography lesson?

548
00:39:44,707 --> 00:39:48,837
My father's from Puerto Rico.
My mother's from El Salvador.

549
00:39:48,978 --> 00:39:52,004
Neither one of those is Mexico.

550
00:39:52,148 --> 00:39:54,582
Ah. Then I guess the big mystery is

551
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:58,142
who gathered all those
remarkably different cultures together

552
00:39:58,254 --> 00:40:01,314
and taught them all how
to park their cars on their lawns?

553
00:40:29,118 --> 00:40:31,484
Pop, you okay?

554
00:40:31,587 --> 00:40:34,613
If I could piss, I'd be okay.

555
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:38,889
I'm... Jesus.

556
00:40:38,995 --> 00:40:41,486
I'm done now.

557
00:40:41,597 --> 00:40:43,622
Give me a hand.

558
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:48,135
Wait a goddamn minute!

559
00:40:48,171 --> 00:40:50,833
- Wait a minute.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

560
00:40:52,842 --> 00:40:56,278
All right. Okay. Okay.

561
00:41:03,686 --> 00:41:06,280
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop!

562
00:41:06,389 --> 00:41:09,051
- I gotta go back.
- Okay.

563
00:41:21,337 --> 00:41:24,431
What, are you gonna
stand there and stare at me?

564
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:36,037
- So Conklin just shot him?
- Mm-hmm.

565
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,979
- They know each other?
- Sir.

566
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,214
It's a grudge thing?

567
00:42:39,215 --> 00:42:41,215
Not as far as we can tell.

568
00:42:42,451 --> 00:42:44,352
You think this is
racially motivated?

569
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,686
Well, a dozen people heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.

570
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,790
- Who do we have on it?
- Graham Waters.

571
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:53,852
Waters. All right. Well, tell him
he speaks to no one but me.

572
00:42:53,963 --> 00:42:57,126
Call a press conference for 4:00,
and I want Waters here at 3:30.

573
00:42:57,233 --> 00:42:59,233
And would someone
please find Flanagan.

574
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:03,170
Oh! What up, Mo Phat?

575
00:43:04,507 --> 00:43:08,807
Man robs purses from old ladies and you,
"Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat?"

576
00:43:08,945 --> 00:43:11,937
That nigger will steal teeth
from a cripple, man.

577
00:43:12,081 --> 00:43:14,572
You callin' him a thief?
And we do what?

578
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,717
The man steals
from black people.

579
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,951
Only reason black people steal from their own
is 'cause they terrified of white people.

580
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,424
Oh, man, please.

581
00:43:22,425 --> 00:43:25,792
Think about it. Sherman Oaks.
Burbank. Santa Monica.

582
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,455
All scary-ass places
for a brother to find himself.

583
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,964
Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks
in Toluca Lake,

584
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:35,197
that nigger will run like a rabbit soon
as somebody say "decaf latte."

585
00:43:35,304 --> 00:43:38,535
What the fuck did you do to my car?

586
00:43:45,948 --> 00:43:49,384
Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.

587
00:43:49,485 --> 00:43:52,454
I turn key to my car, but nothing.

588
00:43:52,555 --> 00:43:54,555
James wanted to take this to school.

589
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,286
But I don't want the kids to fight over it.

590
00:43:57,393 --> 00:44:01,124
- Are these clean or dirty?
- All clean, senora!

591
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:06,133
You know, Maria, just once I would like to
wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.

592
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:10,030
Si, senora.
No problem.

593
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,508
I'm startin' to understand now.

594
00:44:13,509 --> 00:44:16,410
By your work, you're settin' an example
for our neighborhood.

595
00:44:16,512 --> 00:44:18,980
Sort of like a big brother
kind of thing, right?

596
00:44:20,016 --> 00:44:21,616
Yeah, you laugh, man.

597
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,747
But you have never seen me steal
from a black person ever in your life.

598
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,917
What the hell do you think
you doin' right now, man?

599
00:44:30,026 --> 00:44:31,593
Wavin' down the bus.

600
00:44:31,594 --> 00:44:34,085
Put your hand down, dawg!
Are you outta your mind?

601
00:44:34,196 --> 00:44:36,596
You actually expect me
to get on a bus?

602
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:38,963
No. I was hopin' we could
push your car across town.

603
00:44:39,068 --> 00:44:41,068
You know why? 'Cause we just don't
do stuff like that no more.

604
00:44:41,103 --> 00:44:43,731
You have no idea, do you?

605
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,331
You have no idea why they put them great big
windows on the sides of buses, do you?

606
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,967
- Why?
- One reason only.

607
00:44:50,112 --> 00:44:54,446
To humiliate the people of color
who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.

608
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,017
I didn't know that.

609
00:44:56,018 --> 00:44:58,987
You could fill the Staples Center
with what you don't know.

610
00:44:59,088 --> 00:45:01,088
You know the Kings
are playin' tonight.

611
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:04,524
You don't like hockey! The only reason
you say you do is to piss me off!

612
00:45:04,627 --> 00:45:06,925
I love hockey.

613
00:45:07,029 --> 00:45:08,696
Cut! Print. Moving on.

614
00:45:08,697 --> 00:45:09,898
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

615
00:45:09,899 --> 00:45:11,899
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

616
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,028
Jamal, that's what
I'm talking about.

617
00:45:16,138 --> 00:45:18,138
Right on.

618
00:45:19,408 --> 00:45:22,844
- Cam, you got a second?
- Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.

619
00:45:22,945 --> 00:45:25,709
Yeah. Listen. I think
we need another take, buddy.

620
00:45:25,815 --> 00:45:28,545
That looked
pretty terrific, man.

621
00:45:28,651 --> 00:45:32,815
This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal
seeing a speech coach or something?

622
00:45:32,922 --> 00:45:34,922
What do you mean?

623
00:45:34,957 --> 00:45:38,415
Have you noticed, uh...
This is weird for a white guy to say,

624
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:42,293
but have you noticed
he's talking a lot less black lately?

625
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,967
No, I haven't noticed that.

626
00:45:45,968 --> 00:45:49,961
Really? Like in this scene, he was supposed to
say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that."

627
00:45:50,072 --> 00:45:52,404
And he changed it to,
"Don't talk to me about that."

628
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,942
Wait a minute.

629
00:45:53,943 --> 00:45:58,471
You think because of that, the audience
won't recognize him as being a black man?

630
00:45:58,614 --> 00:45:59,714
Come on!

631
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,774
Is there a problem, Cam?

632
00:46:01,917 --> 00:46:03,618
Excuse me?

633
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:05,917
Is there a problem, Cam?

634
00:46:10,826 --> 00:46:13,351
No, we don't have a problem.

635
00:46:13,462 --> 00:46:16,659
I mean, 'cause all I'm saying
is it's not his character.

636
00:46:16,765 --> 00:46:19,359
Eddie's supposed to be
the smart one, not Jamal, right?

637
00:46:19,468 --> 00:46:23,268
You're the expert here.
But to me, it rings false.

638
00:46:26,642 --> 00:46:30,442
- We're gonna do it one more time.
- Thanks, buddy.

639
00:46:30,546 --> 00:46:34,482
Everybody back.
Let's do it one more time.

640
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:39,112
Jamal, um...

641
00:46:43,325 --> 00:46:45,059
Morning, Carol.
Who do I have?

642
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,494
Hold for a minute, please.

643
00:46:46,495 --> 00:46:50,693
Mr. Trujillo called and cancelled,
but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.

644
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,666
Send him in.

645
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,070
- Mr. Ryan.
- Yeah.

646
00:46:59,175 --> 00:47:01,336
My name is Shaniqua Johnson.

647
00:47:01,477 --> 00:47:04,037
I believe we spoke last night.

648
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,616
Oh, yeah. I wanted
to apologize about that.

649
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:10,742
I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.
My father's in a lot of pain.

650
00:47:10,853 --> 00:47:13,344
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.

651
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:17,551
This doctor he's been seein'
says he's got a urinary tract infection.

652
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,152
But he's been takin' this medicine for a month,
and he keeps gettin' worse.

653
00:47:21,263 --> 00:47:23,288
And he's been back to see
Dr. Robertson?

654
00:47:23,399 --> 00:47:26,095
Yeah. Between you and me,
the man's an idiot.

655
00:47:26,202 --> 00:47:28,202
- Really?
- No offense.

656
00:47:28,237 --> 00:47:31,673
But the guy sees 100 patients an hour.
I think his nurses are doing most of the work.

657
00:47:31,774 --> 00:47:36,837
Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's welcome
to see a doctor outside the network.

658
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:41,416
And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection,

659
00:47:41,517 --> 00:47:44,645
says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on, is that gonna be covered?

660
00:47:44,753 --> 00:47:48,348
- Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...
- What good is that gonna do?

661
00:47:48,457 --> 00:47:51,153
I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.

662
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,626
All right.
You know what I can't do?

663
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,524
I can't look at you without
thinking about the five or six

664
00:47:57,633 --> 00:47:59,999
more qualified white men
who didn't get your job.

665
00:48:00,102 --> 00:48:01,936
It's time for you to go.

666
00:48:01,937 --> 00:48:05,065
I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping
that I'm wrong about you.

667
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,941
I'm hoping that someone like yourself,

668
00:48:06,942 --> 00:48:09,172
someone who may have been
given a helping hand,

669
00:48:09,311 --> 00:48:12,075
might have a little compassion
for someone in a similar situation.

670
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,240
Carol, I need security in my office!

671
00:48:14,383 --> 00:48:17,409
You don't like me, that's fine.
I'm a prick.

672
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,079
My father doesn't deserve
to suffer like this.

673
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,214
He was a janitor.
He struggled his whole life.

674
00:48:22,324 --> 00:48:24,259
Saved enough to start
his own company.

675
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,260
Twenty-three employees,
all of them black.

676
00:48:26,328 --> 00:48:29,024
Paid 'em equal wages
when no one else was doing that.

677
00:48:29,131 --> 00:48:34,000
For 30 years he worked side by side with
those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.

678
00:48:34,103 --> 00:48:36,070
Then the city council decides to give

679
00:48:36,071 --> 00:48:39,336
minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.

680
00:48:39,475 --> 00:48:42,205
And overnight,
my father loses everything.

681
00:48:42,344 --> 00:48:45,745
His business, his home, his wife.
Everything!

682
00:48:45,848 --> 00:48:49,511
Not once does he blame your people.

683
00:48:49,618 --> 00:48:53,110
I'm not asking you to help me.

684
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:57,556
I'm asking that you do this small thing
for a man who lost everything

685
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,992
so people like yourself
could reap the benefits.

686
00:49:00,095 --> 00:49:02,393
And do you know
what it's gonna cost you?

687
00:49:02,498 --> 00:49:04,498
Nothing.

688
00:49:04,533 --> 00:49:06,533
Just a flick of your pen.

689
00:49:08,037 --> 00:49:10,972
Your father sounds
like a good man.

690
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:15,203
And if he'd come in here today, I probably
would've approved this request.

691
00:49:15,344 --> 00:49:19,781
But he didn't come in. You did.
And for his sake, it's a real shame.

692
00:49:19,848 --> 00:49:22,817
Get him the hell outta my office.

693
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,823
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

694
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:34,555
Sir, I spoke to our employee, and he told you
you needed to replace or repair the door.

695
00:49:34,663 --> 00:49:36,431
He say he fix the lock.

696
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:39,026
- You come here, see how "fix-ed" it is!
- You're yelling again.

697
00:49:39,134 --> 00:49:41,134
I am not yelling! I'm upset!

698
00:49:41,136 --> 00:49:43,502
Yes... Yes, I am.

699
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,373
Mom, are you all right?

700
00:49:45,374 --> 00:49:49,606
Stop washing.
Insurance must take picture.

701
00:49:49,745 --> 00:49:51,745
Okay?

702
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,980
Look what they wrote.

703
00:49:55,084 --> 00:49:57,084
They think we're Arab.

704
00:49:57,186 --> 00:49:59,245
When did Persian become Arab?

705
00:49:59,355 --> 00:50:02,188
I want his name. Yes.

706
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,991
Oh, my God.

707
00:50:03,992 --> 00:50:07,052
- I want his name! Give me his name!
- Dad?

708
00:50:07,162 --> 00:50:08,629
I'm not giving you his name, sir.

709
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,430
- Dad, did they take the gun?
- Not fix my lock! I want his name!

710
00:50:12,534 --> 00:50:14,559
I'm gonna hang up now, sir.

711
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:18,436
Don't hang up! Shit!

712
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,540
Oh, thank God.

713
00:51:06,321 --> 00:51:08,321
Mom?

714
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:11,588
Mom, it's cold. Come on.

715
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:36,147
Did you find your brother?

716
00:51:38,287 --> 00:51:40,414
No, Mom.

717
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,423
I was doin' good.

718
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:57,193
I was... I was doin' real good.

719
00:51:59,007 --> 00:52:01,305
- I know, Mom.
- I was doin'...

720
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,248
It's okay.

721
00:52:19,561 --> 00:52:21,722
Did you find your brother?

722
00:52:24,066 --> 00:52:26,466
No, Mom.

723
00:52:27,803 --> 00:52:30,328
Tell him to come home.

724
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:37,007
Tell him I'm not mad, okay?
Okay, baby?

725
00:52:37,145 --> 00:52:39,705
Okay, Mom.

726
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:42,316
Okay, baby.

727
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,451
Okay.

728
00:52:45,087 --> 00:52:47,112
Okay.

729
00:53:22,724 --> 00:53:25,659
- Did you apologize to your mother?
- She wasn't there.

730
00:53:27,629 --> 00:53:31,258
Internal Affairs called.
Found something in the Mercedes.

731
00:53:34,036 --> 00:53:36,266
That's lunch. One hour.

732
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:07,401
I tried to call.

733
00:54:07,402 --> 00:54:09,529
Sounded like you're havin'
a bad day, huh?

734
00:54:09,638 --> 00:54:11,638
Yeah.

735
00:54:15,444 --> 00:54:17,444
What?

736
00:54:18,246 --> 00:54:20,246
I got scared, Cam.

737
00:54:20,315 --> 00:54:25,776
It's not like I haven't been
pulled over before. You know?

738
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,887
But not like that.

739
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,224
And, yes, I was a little drunk.

740
00:54:31,326 --> 00:54:35,262
And I was mouthing off.

741
00:54:35,364 --> 00:54:37,559
I'm sorry.

742
00:54:39,701 --> 00:54:41,535
But when that man was
putting his hands on me...

743
00:54:41,536 --> 00:54:43,337
I don't wanna talk about it.

744
00:54:43,338 --> 00:54:46,671
I can't believe
you let him do that, baby.

745
00:54:48,043 --> 00:54:51,638
Look, I know what you did
was the right thing. Okay?

746
00:54:53,215 --> 00:54:55,911
But I was humiliated!

747
00:54:56,018 --> 00:54:58,179
For you.

748
00:54:58,286 --> 00:55:02,746
I just couldn't stand to see
that man take away your dignity.

749
00:55:02,858 --> 00:55:05,884
Yeah. That's what happened.

750
00:55:05,994 --> 00:55:09,020
- Oh, baby, don't do this.
- No. No, you're right.

751
00:55:09,131 --> 00:55:10,998
I ain't doin' it.

752
00:55:10,999 --> 00:55:13,524
You gonna walk away from me?

753
00:55:13,635 --> 00:55:16,798
- Cameron!
- Just go home.

754
00:55:22,844 --> 00:55:24,844
Mm-hmm.

755
00:55:25,714 --> 00:55:27,714
I understand.

756
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,750
Thanks.

757
00:55:33,355 --> 00:55:36,756
- Has your father read his policy?
- He doesn't read English.

758
00:55:40,595 --> 00:55:42,859
Mr. Golzari, you said
you called the locksmith?

759
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,700
Yes. I tell him, fix it.

760
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:53,105
They said their man told you to fix the door,
and you didn't do so.

761
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,143
Are you saying it's his fault?

762
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,883
Insurance company is calling it negligence.
They're not covering any of this.

763
00:56:10,592 --> 00:56:15,689
No. This store is all we have.

764
00:56:32,881 --> 00:56:34,906
I really am sorry.

765
00:56:57,472 --> 00:56:59,633
What time
you must go to work?

766
00:56:59,775 --> 00:57:01,775
Not until tonight.

767
00:57:02,778 --> 00:57:04,778
Go home and sleep.

768
00:57:07,482 --> 00:57:10,076
It's okay. It's okay.
Go home and sleep.

769
00:57:33,341 --> 00:57:35,341
Hey.

770
00:57:36,211 --> 00:57:39,612
Maybe they didn't tell you,
but I've been reassigned.

771
00:57:39,714 --> 00:57:41,909
Yeah, they told me.

772
00:57:42,017 --> 00:57:44,815
I just wanted to say, good luck

773
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,854
and it was good ridin' with you.

774
00:57:46,855 --> 00:57:48,855
You too.

775
00:57:51,526 --> 00:57:54,791
Wait till you've been
on the job a few more years.

776
00:57:54,896 --> 00:57:58,093
- Yeah.
- Look at me, look at me.

777
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,830
Wait till you've been doin' it
a little longer.

778
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:06,840
You think you know
who you are, hmm?

779
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:09,739
You have no idea.

780
00:58:13,248 --> 00:58:16,274
Yo, Gomez,
you ready to roll, homie?

781
00:58:16,384 --> 00:58:18,384
Ready, amigo.

782
00:58:28,029 --> 00:58:31,055
Radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.

783
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:35,830
2-1-L-23, picking up screams and noises
from your car.

784
00:58:35,937 --> 00:58:39,737
21-L, is your mike open
by any chance?

785
01:00:51,805 --> 01:00:53,805
Call it in.

786
01:01:31,177 --> 01:01:32,044
Ma'am?

787
01:01:32,045 --> 01:01:34,045
Can you hear me?

788
01:01:34,047 --> 01:01:36,607
Paramedics are rolling.
They'll be here in two minutes.

789
01:01:36,716 --> 01:01:39,776
- Get an extinguisher, and get that fire out.
- Jesus.

790
01:01:43,456 --> 01:01:46,857
Ma'am, are you hurt?

791
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,020
- Can you move?
- l... I can't breathe.

792
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:56,125
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

793
01:02:02,942 --> 01:02:04,942
It's okay.

794
01:02:08,615 --> 01:02:11,106
Okay. Okay.

795
01:02:11,217 --> 01:02:13,217
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

796
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:19,483
No!

797
01:02:19,592 --> 01:02:22,527
- It's okay.
- Get away from me!

798
01:02:22,696 --> 01:02:25,722
Get away.
Stay away from me!

799
01:02:25,832 --> 01:02:29,131
Not you! Not you!

800
01:02:29,235 --> 01:02:32,033
- It's okay.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

801
01:02:32,138 --> 01:02:35,733
- Keep away from me!
- Lady, I'm tryin'... I'm tryin' to help you.

802
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:38,366
Fuck you! Not you!

803
01:02:38,511 --> 01:02:41,480
Somebody! Anybody else!

804
01:02:41,581 --> 01:02:45,244
- Please, somebody! Not you!
- Stop moving!

805
01:02:45,351 --> 01:02:48,843
No! Get your filthy
fucking hands off me!

806
01:02:48,955 --> 01:02:53,119
Stop moving. Lady, I'm not
gonna fucking hurt you!

807
01:02:58,098 --> 01:03:01,192
Okay. Okay.

808
01:03:01,301 --> 01:03:03,268
Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.

809
01:03:03,269 --> 01:03:07,035
I'm not gonna touch you.
But there's nobody else here yet

810
01:03:07,173 --> 01:03:09,173
and that's gasoline there.

811
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:14,075
We need to get you
outta here right away. Okay?

812
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:16,375
Oh, my... Oh, my...
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

813
01:03:16,483 --> 01:03:22,183
Okay. I need to reach across your lap.
Can I do that, please?

814
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:27,458
Yeah. Yeah.

815
01:03:28,828 --> 01:03:30,828
Thanks.

816
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:38,233
Is anything broken?

817
01:03:38,338 --> 01:03:40,772
I-I don't think so.

818
01:03:40,907 --> 01:03:43,808
Okay. Then that's good.

819
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:46,401
Are you... Are you
gonna get me out?

820
01:03:46,546 --> 01:03:49,811
Yeah, I'm gonna get you out. Okay?

821
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:53,249
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna get you out.

822
01:03:59,459 --> 01:04:01,026
Oh, fuck!

823
01:04:01,027 --> 01:04:04,019
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

824
01:04:06,132 --> 01:04:08,930
I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?

825
01:04:09,035 --> 01:04:11,128
I'm gonna have to cut the belt.

826
01:04:12,272 --> 01:04:13,872
It's okay, it's okay.

827
01:04:13,873 --> 01:04:16,467
It's okay.
Okay, we're gonna get you out.

828
01:04:16,609 --> 01:04:18,907
Everything's gonna be fine.
Look at me!

829
01:04:19,012 --> 01:04:21,480
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you outta here.

830
01:04:21,614 --> 01:04:23,614
Everything's gonna be fine.

831
01:04:39,966 --> 01:04:42,434
Ryan!

832
01:05:17,704 --> 01:05:19,704
Pull!

833
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:36,420
It's okay.

834
01:05:45,198 --> 01:05:47,198
It's okay.

835
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:51,229
All right.
It's okay, it's okay.

836
01:05:51,337 --> 01:05:53,805
It's all right.
I got it. I got it.

837
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,940
Ma'am? Ma'am,
can you walk with me?

838
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:58,408
It's cool, it's cool.

839
01:05:59,812 --> 01:06:02,804
Here we go.
All right, you're doin' great.

840
01:06:34,013 --> 01:06:37,210
The D.A. wanted me to apologize.
He really wanted to be here himself.

841
01:06:37,317 --> 01:06:40,047
No, he didn't! If he did his own dirty work
none of us would have jobs.

842
01:06:40,153 --> 01:06:42,417
- Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.
- Graham Waters.

843
01:06:42,522 --> 01:06:45,355
- Thanks for coming in.
- He just pulled into the garage.

844
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:48,586
Great. Press conference is in ten minutes,
so we'll make this short.

845
01:06:48,695 --> 01:06:52,062
Internal Affairs says this Conklin
has two suspicious shootings on his record.

846
01:06:52,165 --> 01:06:55,430
Both black men.
Both times he was cleared, but only just.

847
01:06:55,535 --> 01:06:58,333
Detective Lewis
makes black man number three.

848
01:06:58,438 --> 01:07:01,896
You know any reason why
we shouldn't hang Conklin for this?

849
01:07:02,041 --> 01:07:07,035
Well, it's more complicated
than we originally thought.

850
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:13,050
We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car
that Detective Lewis was driving.

851
01:07:13,152 --> 01:07:15,211
Shit!

852
01:07:15,321 --> 01:07:19,815
Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him
to stay in the car until he hears from me.

853
01:07:19,926 --> 01:07:23,828
You found the money in the Mercedes.
I thought that wasn't his car.

854
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:28,128
The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley.
We haven't been able to get in touch with her.

855
01:07:28,234 --> 01:07:31,362
Apparently she, uh,
left town this morning.

856
01:07:31,471 --> 01:07:35,271
So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not have
known the money was in it.

857
01:07:41,681 --> 01:07:44,946
You really think you're gonna
be able to make that fly?

858
01:07:47,585 --> 01:07:49,585
Latasha Harlins, Rodney King.

859
01:07:50,421 --> 01:07:51,799
These names ring a bell, detective?

860
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,259
Yeah, vaguely.

861
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:55,260
We have attorneys for this slain
police officer camping in our offices.

862
01:07:58,554 --> 01:08:00,554
We have his mother and half a
dozen men of the cloth, who swear

863
01:08:02,073 --> 01:08:04,073
that Louis was one of
the 12 apostles of Christ.

864
01:08:04,603 --> 01:08:06,603
We have two black city
coucilmen and a congresswoman

865
01:08:07,578 --> 01:08:09,578
who call on the hour every
hour, demanding to know

866
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,100
what the district attorney
intends to do about this,

867
01:08:12,587 --> 01:08:14,587
and you want them to walk into
that press room and tell them all,

868
01:08:15,063 --> 01:08:17,063
that the situation is "complicated"?

869
01:08:24,792 --> 01:08:26,792
Give us a minute.

870
01:08:27,495 --> 01:08:29,656
No problem.

871
01:08:37,172 --> 01:08:39,367
Who knows about the money?

872
01:08:39,474 --> 01:08:41,499
You gotta be kiddin' me.

873
01:08:41,609 --> 01:08:45,477
There are only two people
in this room.

874
01:08:45,613 --> 01:08:48,946
Myself, my partner,
Ferguson and Internal Affairs.

875
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:51,518
- Jim Ferguson?
- Yeah.

876
01:08:56,057 --> 01:08:58,491
Okay. I guess
I don't see a problem.

877
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:01,118
As it wasn't Lewis's car, the money isn't
clear evidence of any wrongdoing.

878
01:09:01,229 --> 01:09:04,198
And even if it was, we aren't
going to prosecute a dead man.

879
01:09:04,299 --> 01:09:08,702
Which means the money Internal Affairs
is holding can't be considered evidence.

880
01:09:08,803 --> 01:09:11,101
You can do this dance if you want to,

881
01:09:11,206 --> 01:09:14,664
but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report
comes back tomorrow

882
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:17,745
it's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.

883
01:09:19,214 --> 01:09:20,781
Fucking black people, huh?

884
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,807
What did you just say?

885
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:24,951
I mean,

886
01:09:25,019 --> 01:09:27,510
I know all the sociological
reasons why per capita

887
01:09:27,655 --> 01:09:30,715
eight times more black men
are incarcerated than white men.

888
01:09:30,825 --> 01:09:34,693
Schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity.
Bias in the judicial system.

889
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:36,796
All that stuff.
All that stuff!

890
01:09:36,864 --> 01:09:40,925
But still, it's gotta get to you,
on a gut level as a black man,

891
01:09:41,035 --> 01:09:43,970
they just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.

892
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:51,303
Of course, you and I
know that's not the truth.

893
01:09:51,412 --> 01:09:53,412
But that's the way
it always plays, doesn't it?

894
01:09:53,548 --> 01:09:56,984
And assholes like Lewis keep
feeding the flames. It's gotta get to you.

895
01:09:58,253 --> 01:10:00,551
What did you say
you did for the D.A. again?

896
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:02,655
You coach ball down in Compton.
Am I right?

897
01:10:02,724 --> 01:10:04,724
Oh, please, don't do that.

898
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:07,587
Don't act like you know
something about me, okay?

899
01:10:07,695 --> 01:10:12,098
What do you think those kids need...
to make them believe, to give them hope?

900
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,361
You think they need another
drug-dealing cop

901
01:10:14,469 --> 01:10:17,404
or do you think they need
a fallen black hero?

902
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:22,101
Why don't you cut through the bullshit
and just tell me what it is you want.

903
01:10:24,112 --> 01:10:26,910
The D.A.'s squad loses
its lead investigator next month.

904
01:10:27,048 --> 01:10:30,916
Rick is quite adamant
that his replacement be a person of color.

905
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:35,183
It's a high-profile position, and he wants
to send the right message to the community.

906
01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:38,953
And the right message is,
"Look at this black boy I just bought?"

907
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:42,655
Well, fuck you very much.
But thanks for thinking of me.

908
01:10:44,032 --> 01:10:46,432
Actually we were thinking of you.

909
01:10:47,802 --> 01:10:49,802
Until we saw that.

910
01:10:50,738 --> 01:10:52,738
It's your brother's file.

911
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:55,170
Twenty-something years old
and already three felonies.

912
01:10:55,276 --> 01:10:57,972
Three strikes law. Kid's going away
for life for stealing a car.

913
01:10:58,112 --> 01:11:00,774
Christ, that's a shitty law.

914
01:11:00,915 --> 01:11:02,915
There's a warrant in there.

915
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:07,284
But still, hey, he had
every opportunity you had.

916
01:11:10,124 --> 01:11:12,124
Fucking black people, huh?

917
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:20,834
So all, uh... all I need to do
to make this disappear

918
01:11:20,935 --> 01:11:23,233
is to frame
a potentially innocent man?

919
01:11:23,338 --> 01:11:26,637
What are you? The fucking defender
of all things white?

920
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:30,472
We're talking about a white man
who shot three black men.

921
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:35,311
And you're arguing with me that maybe
we're not being fair to him?

922
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:38,419
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe Lewis did provoke this.

923
01:11:38,519 --> 01:11:40,680
And maybe he got exactly
what was coming to him.

924
01:11:40,788 --> 01:11:43,780
Or maybe stoned or not,
just being a black man in the Valley

925
01:11:43,891 --> 01:11:46,223
was enough to get him killed.

926
01:11:46,327 --> 01:11:50,388
There was no one there to see who shot first,
so there is no way to know.

927
01:11:50,498 --> 01:11:53,865
Which means we
could get this wrong.

928
01:11:55,737 --> 01:11:58,797
Maybe that's what happened with
your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.

929
01:11:58,906 --> 01:12:03,366
Maybe Lewis isn't the only one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

930
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,179
You're the one closest to all this.

931
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:08,180
You need to tell us.

932
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:14,220
What does your gut tell you?

933
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:30,164
So? Graham?

934
01:12:30,271 --> 01:12:32,398
What do I tell 'em?

935
01:12:32,507 --> 01:12:36,409
You tell me, and I'll tell them.

936
01:12:43,084 --> 01:12:47,248
Well, I think given
Detective Conklin's history,

937
01:12:47,355 --> 01:12:50,415
it's pretty clear
what happened last night.

938
01:12:50,525 --> 01:12:53,085
Okay.

939
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:11,974
Before I get to why we're here,

940
01:13:12,113 --> 01:13:16,049
I know that many of you have heard
we had our car stolen last night.

941
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:20,519
And as you could imagine, my wife and I
are both pretty shaken up.

942
01:13:20,621 --> 01:13:22,556
But we're okay.

943
01:13:22,557 --> 01:13:27,187
And Jean and I truly appreciate all your calls
and your concern. Thank you.

944
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:32,892
Now, just after 9:00 p.m. last night,
Detective William Lewis,

945
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,163
an eight-year veteran of the force
and an active member of the black community,

946
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,500
was gunned down
by a fellow officer.

947
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,300
Get outta the car!

948
01:14:40,301 --> 01:14:42,301
Gimme the keys!
Get out... What the fuck?

949
01:14:44,171 --> 01:14:46,196
Whoa! What the fuck
are you doing, man?

950
01:14:46,307 --> 01:14:48,275
Shit! You wanna get killed, nigger?

951
01:14:48,276 --> 01:14:50,276
Say that again!

952
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:53,474
- Say that again!
- You stupid motherfucker!

953
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:56,913
Say it again, huh!
Call me a nigger again!

954
01:14:57,018 --> 01:14:59,384
- Man, what the fuck? Get off!
- Fuck you!

955
01:14:59,487 --> 01:15:02,320
- Shoot him!
- I'll blow your head off!

956
01:15:02,423 --> 01:15:05,483
- Shoot this motherfucker!
- I swear to God, I'm gonna blow your head off!

957
01:15:05,593 --> 01:15:07,593
Stop talkin' and shoot!

958
01:15:08,095 --> 01:15:10,962
- Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.
- Get off of me!

959
01:15:13,067 --> 01:15:15,831
Hey, hey! Where you goin', man? Hell, no!

960
01:15:15,937 --> 01:15:17,937
- Oh, shit.
- Anthony! Anthony!

961
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:21,841
Get the fuck outta my car!

962
01:15:21,842 --> 01:15:24,106
Shit! Damn!

963
01:15:24,211 --> 01:15:26,406
- What are you doin', man? Get outta the car!
- Fuck you!

964
01:15:30,418 --> 01:15:33,751
Car 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.
West bound.

965
01:15:34,522 --> 01:15:36,717
I will blow you away!
Get the fuck out of the car!

966
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:38,824
Go on! Shoot me then!

967
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:44,328
Oh, Christ!

968
01:15:49,904 --> 01:15:52,099
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- You get the fuck outta the car!

969
01:15:52,206 --> 01:15:54,572
- Get outta the fucking car!
- It's my fucking car!

970
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:57,041
- It's my fucking gun!
- Fuck, it's my gun now!

971
01:15:57,144 --> 01:15:59,339
Gimme my fucking gun!

972
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,687
Fuck!

973
01:16:10,224 --> 01:16:14,126
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

974
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:21,024
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

975
01:16:24,305 --> 01:16:26,865
Slowly step out of the vehicle.

976
01:16:26,974 --> 01:16:30,671
- Get out of my car.
- You so brave, you get outta the car, man.

977
01:16:33,781 --> 01:16:37,581
Turn off the engine.
Throw the keys out the window.

978
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:53,564
You fucking want me?
Here I am, you pig fuck!

979
01:16:53,668 --> 01:16:55,135
Lie face down on the ground.

980
01:16:55,136 --> 01:16:57,798
- Spread your arms and legs.
- No, you lie face down!

981
01:16:57,905 --> 01:16:59,998
Don't come any closer!
Down on your knees!

982
01:17:00,107 --> 01:17:02,575
Fuck you! What are you gonna do?
Pull the fucking trigger!

983
01:17:02,677 --> 01:17:03,710
On your knees now!

984
01:17:03,711 --> 01:17:06,441
You get on your knees
and suck my fucking dick!

985
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,276
Do I look like
I'm fucking joking with you?

986
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:11,084
That's what you look like,
a fucking joke to me.

987
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:13,280
- This man is making threatening gestures.
- Threatening gestures?

988
01:17:13,387 --> 01:17:15,719
You wanna see a threatening gesture?
I got a threatening gesture.

989
01:17:15,823 --> 01:17:19,520
- I know this man! I know this man!
- Get back.

990
01:17:19,627 --> 01:17:22,152
- Give me some space. I know this guy.
- Get outta the way.

991
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:23,463
Step away.

992
01:17:23,464 --> 01:17:25,489
Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.

993
01:17:27,368 --> 01:17:29,928
- Man, don't walk up on me!
- See what's happening here?

994
01:17:30,037 --> 01:17:32,232
Do you wanna die here, huh?
Is that what you want?

995
01:17:32,339 --> 01:17:34,339
'Cause these guys
really wanna shoot you.

996
01:17:34,408 --> 01:17:36,968
And the way you're acting,
they'll be completely fucking justified.

997
01:17:37,078 --> 01:17:38,411
Fuck you!

998
01:17:38,412 --> 01:17:41,711
Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.
You're the one.

999
01:17:41,849 --> 01:17:44,716
'Cause you're the one
whose head's gonna be blown off!

1000
01:17:44,819 --> 01:17:46,186
Officer Hanson, step away.

1001
01:17:46,187 --> 01:17:49,645
He's a friend of mine, okay? He's a fucking
friend! This man is not armed!

1002
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,691
He's not gonna shoot you, me,
or anybody else, all right?

1003
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:54,818
So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?

1004
01:17:54,929 --> 01:17:58,194
Lower your firearm.
Lower your firearm!

1005
01:18:03,404 --> 01:18:06,669
You startin' to understand
the situation?

1006
01:18:06,774 --> 01:18:09,436
What do you want from me?

1007
01:18:09,543 --> 01:18:14,071
Unless you think your wife is better off with
a husband who has a bloody stump for a head,

1008
01:18:14,215 --> 01:18:16,215
I want you to sit on that curb,
put your hands on your head

1009
01:18:16,217 --> 01:18:18,447
and do nothing until I speak with these officers.

1010
01:18:18,552 --> 01:18:21,521
I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin'
my hands on my head for nobody.

1011
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:25,648
Then stand where you are and keep your
hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?

1012
01:18:28,729 --> 01:18:30,890
Yeah, I can do that.

1013
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:33,228
Good.

1014
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:37,134
I told this man to stay where he is and keep his
hands in plain sight.

1015
01:18:37,238 --> 01:18:42,005
This man better be related to you by blood
because this is fucking nuts.

1016
01:18:42,109 --> 01:18:44,202
I need this favor.

1017
01:18:44,311 --> 01:18:48,338
You can check the guy's name, his license.
He's got no priors, no warrants.

1018
01:18:48,482 --> 01:18:51,007
I need to let him go
with a warning.

1019
01:18:51,152 --> 01:18:56,021
- What kind of fucking warning?
- A harsh warning.

1020
01:18:58,592 --> 01:19:00,592
Thank you.

1021
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:07,357
You've been warned. Do you understand me?
Do you understand me!

1022
01:19:07,468 --> 01:19:10,733
You want something from me?
'Cause I'm right here.

1023
01:19:10,838 --> 01:19:14,865
- I'm trying to help you.
- I didn't ask for your help, did I?

1024
01:19:17,011 --> 01:19:19,206
Go home.

1025
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:25,215
Yeah, that I can do.

1026
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:45,797
Look at me.

1027
01:20:47,167 --> 01:20:49,829
You embarrass me.

1028
01:20:49,937 --> 01:20:52,030
You embarrass yourself.

1029
01:21:35,215 --> 01:21:37,215
Daddy's home!

1030
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:58,204
- What's up?
- Give me my money!

1031
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:00,639
- What? What money?
- Daddy!

1032
01:22:00,741 --> 01:22:04,006
- To pay for my store. Give me my money!
- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!

1033
01:22:04,111 --> 01:22:06,111
Give me my money!

1034
01:22:07,181 --> 01:22:10,241
- I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!
- That's not my truck!

1035
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:12,716
- Daddy?
- Elizabeth!

1036
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:17,086
Hey, you know what?
Hey, I got $50. Here.

1037
01:22:17,191 --> 01:22:19,250
Fifty dollars?
You took everything!

1038
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,360
Mommy?

1039
01:22:21,795 --> 01:22:23,496
I'm coming, I'm coming!

1040
01:22:23,497 --> 01:22:27,695
- He doesn't have it.
- Hasn't got what?

1041
01:22:27,801 --> 01:22:32,033
I have it. He doesn't
have the impenetrable cloak!

1042
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,240
Lara, stay outta the street!

1043
01:23:02,503 --> 01:23:06,166
- It's okay, Daddy.
- What... What?

1044
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,273
I'll protect you.

1045
01:23:35,002 --> 01:23:37,664
It's okay. Daddy's okay.

1046
01:23:37,771 --> 01:23:40,797
It's a really good cloak.

1047
01:25:01,989 --> 01:25:03,989
How's it going?

1048
01:25:29,149 --> 01:25:34,109
I sent her out for groceries,
and that was two hours ago, Carol.

1049
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:36,221
Well, you are one to talk.

1050
01:25:36,222 --> 01:25:40,090
You go through, like,
six housekeepers a year?

1051
01:25:40,193 --> 01:25:43,594
I'm not snapping at you!
I am angry.

1052
01:25:44,864 --> 01:25:46,923
Yes! At them! Yes!

1053
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:51,367
At them, the police,
at Rick, at Maria,

1054
01:25:51,471 --> 01:25:55,168
at the dry cleaners who destroyed
another blouse today,

1055
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:59,234
at the gardener who keeps
overwatering the lawn.

1056
01:25:59,345 --> 01:26:01,345
I...

1057
01:26:01,748 --> 01:26:04,273
I just thought that...

1058
01:26:04,384 --> 01:26:07,911
Carol, I just thought that
I would wake up today

1059
01:26:08,054 --> 01:26:11,023
and I would feel better, you know?

1060
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:15,083
But I was still mad.
And I realized...

1061
01:26:15,228 --> 01:26:19,130
I realized that it had nothing
to do with my car being stolen.

1062
01:26:21,167 --> 01:26:24,933
I wake up like this
every morning!

1063
01:26:25,038 --> 01:26:28,997
I am angry all the time,
and I don't know why.

1064
01:26:29,108 --> 01:26:32,441
Carol, I don't know why! And I...

1065
01:26:34,113 --> 01:26:37,173
Yeah, yeah, call me back.

1066
01:26:37,283 --> 01:26:39,283
Bye.

1067
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:32,330
Really appreciate this.

1068
01:28:32,398 --> 01:28:34,593
You're welcome.

1069
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,440
So how long you been out there tonight?
It's cold.

1070
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:44,569
Hour maybe.

1071
01:28:44,677 --> 01:28:46,578
Big surprise, huh?

1072
01:28:46,579 --> 01:28:49,844
Yeah, this ain't exactly
"pick up a brother" territory.

1073
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:51,817
True.

1074
01:28:51,818 --> 01:28:53,818
So where you headed?

1075
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,047
Anywhere the other side
of the hill.

1076
01:28:57,118 --> 01:28:58,732
I'm going to El Segundo.

1077
01:28:58,733 --> 01:29:00,706
El Segundo is cool.

1078
01:29:00,707 --> 01:29:02,707
You've been there?

1079
01:29:10,779 --> 01:29:13,043
That's some good music.

1080
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:15,148
Mm-hmm.

1081
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:18,551
No, really.
I'm startin' to understand it.

1082
01:29:18,654 --> 01:29:21,714
Wrote me a country song
myself just yesterday.

1083
01:29:21,823 --> 01:29:24,018
I'll bet you did.

1084
01:29:41,708 --> 01:29:43,938
So what was goin' on
in the Valley tonight?

1085
01:29:44,077 --> 01:29:46,077
Ice-skatin'.

1086
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,047
Ice-skatin'.

1087
01:29:48,048 --> 01:29:50,608
Love the ice-skatin'.

1088
01:29:50,717 --> 01:29:54,346
When I was a kid,
I always wanted to be a goalie.

1089
01:29:54,454 --> 01:29:56,155
Come on!

1090
01:29:56,156 --> 01:29:59,421
What, you... you think
that's funny or somethin'?

1091
01:29:59,526 --> 01:30:01,551
I think you're having fun.

1092
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:03,662
Yeah. Whatever.

1093
01:30:13,473 --> 01:30:14,573
Something else funny?

1094
01:30:14,574 --> 01:30:16,838
Oh, yeah.

1095
01:30:19,179 --> 01:30:21,080
Yeah? What's that?

1096
01:30:21,081 --> 01:30:23,081
People, man. People.

1097
01:30:24,017 --> 01:30:26,017
People like me.

1098
01:30:27,554 --> 01:30:30,045
No, no, no, no.
I'm not laughin' at you, man.

1099
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:32,124
I can see that.

1100
01:30:32,125 --> 01:30:35,822
- Why don't you laugh outside?
- Why are you gettin' all bent outta shape?

1101
01:30:35,929 --> 01:30:38,659
I'm not gettin' bent, man.
Just pulling over.

1102
01:30:41,168 --> 01:30:45,264
Come on, man, keep drivin'.
I said I'm not laughing at you.

1103
01:30:45,372 --> 01:30:47,772
And I'm not telling you
to get the fuck out of my car.

1104
01:30:47,874 --> 01:30:50,434
Why you bein' a fucking jerk?
Just drive the car.

1105
01:30:50,577 --> 01:30:52,545
I've got a better idea.
Get out now.

1106
01:30:52,546 --> 01:30:54,280
Fine. You want me
to show you? I'll show you.

1107
01:30:54,281 --> 01:30:56,909
Get your hands out of your pocket.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

1108
01:30:57,017 --> 01:30:59,017
- Who the fuck you think you're talkin' to?
- Put your hands where I can see!

1109
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:02,020
You wanna see what's in my hands?
I'll show you what's in my fuckin' hands!

1110
01:31:38,258 --> 01:31:40,954
Oh, God.

1111
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:19,832
Thank you, Brother Merle.
That was Merle Haggard on KYHA.

1112
01:32:19,933 --> 01:32:22,026
The scene of country music
here in L.A.

1113
01:32:22,135 --> 01:32:24,330
It's a cold night,
and it's getting colder.

1114
01:32:24,438 --> 01:32:28,431
We're giving out tickets to the rodeo coming
to the Fairplex in Pomona.

1115
01:32:32,012 --> 01:32:36,244
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm freezin'.

1116
01:32:36,349 --> 01:32:39,318
Shit. I heard it might snow.

1117
01:32:39,419 --> 01:32:41,751
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

1118
01:32:41,855 --> 01:32:45,120
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

1119
01:32:45,225 --> 01:32:47,386
Yeah, me too.

1120
01:32:47,494 --> 01:32:52,693
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

1121
01:32:52,799 --> 01:32:55,290
Hey, Bob.

1122
01:34:22,389 --> 01:34:25,415
Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!

1123
01:34:25,525 --> 01:34:28,426
- Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!
- Do you speak English?

1124
01:34:28,528 --> 01:34:32,521
I am speaking English, you stupid cow!
My husband name Choi Jin Gui!

1125
01:34:34,768 --> 01:34:36,435
- Jin Gui!
- Ma'am!

1126
01:34:36,436 --> 01:34:39,633
Kim Lee.

1127
01:34:45,579 --> 01:34:49,709
I thought you were dead.
I called every hospital.

1128
01:34:49,816 --> 01:34:51,816
It's okay. I'm okay.

1129
01:34:52,082 --> 01:34:54,082
I went crazy speeding,
I drove into a car.

1130
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,800
Oh my god, are you ok?

1131
01:34:58,252 --> 01:35:00,252
Got into big fight with poor
woman. I called her names.

1132
01:35:03,179 --> 01:35:05,179
Oh, fine. I die from
worry and you laugh.

1133
01:35:10,541 --> 01:35:13,339
Thank you for finding me.

1134
01:35:16,046 --> 01:35:19,538
- Will you do something for me?
- Anything.

1135
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:21,650
Go to the locker.

1136
01:35:25,622 --> 01:35:27,622
No, next one.

1137
01:35:30,627 --> 01:35:33,391
In my wallet, there's a check.

1138
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:35,657
Bring it here.

1139
01:35:43,674 --> 01:35:46,905
Oh, I get it. When I said get me
a black Lincoln Navigator,

1140
01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:50,377
you thought I said get me
a white piece of shit panel van.

1141
01:35:50,481 --> 01:35:55,509
- Fine, fine. Just give me whatever for it.
- You should see this.

1142
01:36:11,568 --> 01:36:13,568
I'll take the van.

1143
01:36:14,638 --> 01:36:16,038
They're chained to the van.

1144
01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:18,039
So I'll take them too.

1145
01:36:19,076 --> 01:36:21,076
You wanna buy these Chinamen?

1146
01:36:21,178 --> 01:36:23,703
Don't be ignorant.
They're Thai or Cambodian.

1147
01:36:23,814 --> 01:36:25,648
Entirely different kind of chinks.

1148
01:36:25,649 --> 01:36:28,743
- What the hell are you gonna do with 'em?
- Sell 'em. What you think?

1149
01:36:28,852 --> 01:36:33,186
I'll give you 500 apiece,
and you can keep the van.

1150
01:36:51,341 --> 01:36:54,310
Oh, no!

1151
01:36:58,048 --> 01:37:00,312
No! No!

1152
01:37:16,433 --> 01:37:18,433
This is Dorri.

1153
01:37:26,109 --> 01:37:28,304
Oh.

1154
01:37:28,412 --> 01:37:30,744
Oh. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1155
01:37:30,847 --> 01:37:35,045
My baby. My poor baby!

1156
01:37:37,321 --> 01:37:39,321
Mom.

1157
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:44,554
I promise you... I promise I'm gonna
find out who did this, Mom.

1158
01:37:46,463 --> 01:37:49,227
Oh, I already know.

1159
01:37:51,234 --> 01:37:53,234
You did.

1160
01:37:55,305 --> 01:37:59,935
I asked you to find your brother,
but you were busy.

1161
01:38:00,043 --> 01:38:03,843
We weren't much good
to you anymore, were we?

1162
01:38:08,218 --> 01:38:11,187
You got things to do. You go ahead.
I'll sign the papers.

1163
01:38:11,288 --> 01:38:13,288
I wanna stay.

1164
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:16,953
I just wanna wait
with my baby.

1165
01:38:27,671 --> 01:38:29,671
He came home.

1166
01:38:29,706 --> 01:38:31,706
Did you know that?

1167
01:38:31,742 --> 01:38:34,575
My little boy.

1168
01:38:34,678 --> 01:38:36,579
When I was sleepin',

1169
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:39,640
he brought me groceries.

1170
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:41,750
It's the last thing he did.

1171
01:39:21,058 --> 01:39:23,058
What happened?

1172
01:39:29,599 --> 01:39:31,599
What did you do?

1173
01:39:32,569 --> 01:39:35,094
What did you do?

1174
01:39:37,307 --> 01:39:39,307
I shoot a little girl.

1175
01:39:39,342 --> 01:39:41,572
What?

1176
01:39:41,678 --> 01:39:44,476
No, she's okay. She's...

1177
01:39:46,116 --> 01:39:48,346
She's... Here.

1178
01:39:48,452 --> 01:39:53,583
The gun shoot her,
but she's okay, Dorri.

1179
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:56,682
Nothing happened.

1180
01:39:58,395 --> 01:40:00,395
She's my...

1181
01:40:01,298 --> 01:40:03,298
What are you
talking about, Daddy?

1182
01:40:06,837 --> 01:40:08,837
My angel.

1183
01:40:10,774 --> 01:40:12,774
My angel!

1184
01:40:14,511 --> 01:40:17,207
She came to protect me.

1185
01:40:18,515 --> 01:40:20,915
To protect us!

1186
01:40:22,652 --> 01:40:24,652
You understand?

1187
01:40:28,792 --> 01:40:30,817
Take this. Please.

1188
01:40:32,395 --> 01:40:34,395
Take it.

1189
01:40:38,702 --> 01:40:41,170
Hey! Hey!

1190
01:40:41,304 --> 01:40:44,933
Everything is okay, Dorri.

1191
01:40:45,041 --> 01:40:47,041
It's okay.

1192
01:40:51,815 --> 01:40:53,549
Okay, Daddy.

1193
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:55,550
Okay.

1194
01:41:18,608 --> 01:41:19,675
Jean?

1195
01:41:19,676 --> 01:41:21,701
- Rick?
- Yeah. What's wrong.

1196
01:41:21,812 --> 01:41:24,440
I fell down the stairs.

1197
01:41:24,548 --> 01:41:27,881
- Are you all right?
- I tried calling you.

1198
01:41:27,984 --> 01:41:31,181
I couldn't get through
to anyone. Not...

1199
01:41:31,288 --> 01:41:34,724
Not Kath, not Marge, not Julie.

1200
01:41:34,825 --> 01:41:37,555
I'm getting in the elevator. I'll be in my car.
I'll be home in 20 minutes.

1201
01:41:37,661 --> 01:41:40,653
It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.
It's just a bad sprain.

1202
01:41:40,797 --> 01:41:43,231
Carol was the only one
that was home and

1203
01:41:43,333 --> 01:41:46,962
she said she couldn't come get me because
she was getting a massage.

1204
01:41:47,103 --> 01:41:49,469
That's because she's a bitch.

1205
01:41:49,573 --> 01:41:52,440
She's been my friend for ten years.

1206
01:41:53,610 --> 01:41:55,610
All right, honey.
Feel better.

1207
01:41:55,612 --> 01:41:57,876
I'll be there soon.

1208
01:42:00,083 --> 01:42:02,083
I love you.

1209
01:42:02,085 --> 01:42:04,315
I love you too.

1210
01:42:36,395 --> 01:42:38,488
Miss Jean.

1211
01:42:40,533 --> 01:42:43,161
Would you like to sit up?

1212
01:42:48,841 --> 01:42:52,038
Here. Good!

1213
01:43:00,686 --> 01:43:02,847
Do you wanna hear
something funny?

1214
01:43:02,988 --> 01:43:04,988
What, Mrs. Jean?

1215
01:43:06,481 --> 01:43:09,211
You're the best friend I've got.

1216
01:46:22,343 --> 01:46:24,343
