1
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,569
-Here's some for 37 cents.
- Here's some for 32.

2
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,737
31.

3
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:20,409
- That's it. Don't they have any generics?
- I think this is the generic.

4
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,995
I never heard of that brand.
Maybe we should get this.

5
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,372
You're paying for advertising.

6
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,834
- Tuna. We should get tuna.
- Please, no more tuna.

7
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,962
- It's got protein. We need protein.
- Beans are protein.

8
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,923
- Beans make you fart.
- We got a convertible.

9
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,343
I'm gettin' it for myself.

10
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,812
One burrito and one large Slush.

11
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,945
- 21 dollars and 67 cents.
- Can you fill this up?

12
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,617
21.67

13
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,486
Jesus. Look, I forgot to pay for this.

14
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,989
You could have gotten caught.
What if somebody saw?

15
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,077
You know what the minimum age
for execution is in Alabama?

16
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,663
- About sixteen?
- Ten.

17
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,256
- There's a cop behind us.
- A cop?

18
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:01,176
- There's nothing to worry about, all right?
- There might be.

19
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,345
Just relax. Please.

20
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,643
- Is he still there?
- Yeah.

21
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,229
- Goddamn it.
- Calm down, all right?

22
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:16,191
There's a cop behind us, that's all.
There's no problem.

23
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,278
- What?
- His light's on.

24
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,989
Fuck. Fuck. Goddamn it.

25
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:26,243
- What are we gonna do?
- It's probably nothing. It might be a taillight.

26
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:30,706
- We don't have any money for bail.
- Bail? Nothing's happened.

27
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,710
- Nothing? You stole something, didn't you?
- Shut up. All right?

28
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,801
All right. Here he comes.

29
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,932
- Show me your hands.
- Jesus.

30
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,143
Show me your hands. Get 'em up.

31
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,979
Get 'em up. Up.

32
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,816
Now put your hands on top of your head
and get outta the car.

33
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,112
- Outta the car.
- Go.

34
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,158
Yeah, I'm sure of it. It's number three and five.

35
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,660
Ridiculous. All this over a can of tuna.

36
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,079
Keep quiet.

37
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,584
Yeah. You sure about that?

38
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,545
Yeah. He's standing right here.

39
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,714
All right. Bye.

40
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,592
I think we may get a confession.

41
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,642
- I just heard someone shot Jimmy Willis.
- He's dead.

42
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:35,437
Oh, my God. Who would do such a thing?

43
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,280
- Hello, Bill. I'm Sheriff Farley.
- Hi.

44
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,956
- Do you know why you're here?
- Yeah, I do. I'm sorry.

45
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,542
It was a stupid thing to do.

46
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,419
- Have you been made aware of your rights?
- Yes.

47
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,840
- You're willing to waive that right?
- I'll cooperate fully.

48
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:07,261
I'll sign a statement, or whatever
makes this whole thing easier.

49
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:11,265
Good. Good. That's good.

50
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,935
But I want you to know,
Stan, he had nothing to do with it.

51
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,479
Did he help you plan it?

52
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,107
No. I mean... I mean, it wasn't planned out.

53
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,484
You know, it just happened.

54
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,404
Did Stan try to stop you at any time?

55
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,283
No. I mean, he was...

56
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,791
- Is that a big deal?
- Aidin' and abettin'.

57
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:42,129
- Aiding and abetting? Is that a major thing?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

58
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,843
An accessory?
Are you guys kiddin'? An accessory?

59
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,220
I didn't help. I didn't plan it.

60
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,016
You didn't try to stop it.

61
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,394
I didn't know it was happening.
I found out later in the car.

62
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,481
Why didn't you get out,
call the police then?

63
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,484
He's my friend.

64
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,653
Well.

65
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,407
Your friend has put you in a lot of trouble.

66
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,203
What's gonna happen to Bill?

67
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,705
Nothing. Unless he's convicted.

68
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:25,589
If he is, we're gonna run enough electricity
through him to light up Birmingham.

69
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,385
We were friends at NYU, and we both
applied and we got scholarships to UCLA.

70
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,931
So we figured the scenery would be
nicer going through the South.

71
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:37,059
- What about the tuna fish?
- I forgot about the tuna fish.

72
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,144
And then we left.

73
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:43,315
Did he catch you with the tuna fish?
Is that how it started?

74
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,528
- No, he didn't say anything.
- But he knew about it.

75
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:51,406
I don't know.

76
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,327
Let's talk about that for a moment.

77
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,541
You paid for the groceries.

78
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,587
- And then what?
- We went out to the car, and that's it.

79
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,799
When'd you shoot him?

80
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,427
- What?
- At what point did you shoot the clerk?

81
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,557
- I shot the clerk?
- Yes. When did you shoot him?

82
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:20,435
- I shot the clerk?
- We need ya out here.

83
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,313
I'm in the middle of a damn confession here.

84
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,528
Whoa. Wait a minute.

85
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,750
- What's the matter?
- Do you know what this is all about?

86
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,795
- Yeah, they're fucking with us.
- You don't believe them?

87
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,966
- They don't execute for shoplifting.
- You think we're booked for shoplifting?

88
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:55,429
No. You're being booked for shoplifting.
I'm booked for accessory to shoplifting.

89
00:09:55,554 --> 00:10:01,059
No, Stan. I'm being booked for murder and
you're being booked for accessory to murder.

90
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,606
It's time to make your phone calls.

91
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,192
- Goddamn it.
- Could you contact your parents?

92
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,986
How? Call the Chilean consulate?
What can they do?

93
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,614
Send a guide into the mountains
looking for them?

94
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:16,408
We need to call an attorney. A great attorney.

95
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,535
Do you know any great attorneys?

96
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,913
No. I'm calling my mother.

97
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:26,126
Hello, Ma. We're in Wazoo.

98
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,254
It's in Beechum County, Alabama, Ma.

99
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:34,092
Not too good, Ma. We... we've been arrested.

100
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:39,640
Ma. Ma, please. Ma, please.
First of all, we didn't do it, all right?

101
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,352
Murder.

102
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,230
Ma. Ma, ple... Ma, it's a mistake.

103
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,398
We must look like the guys who did it.

104
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:51,485
- Tell her what we think is happening...
- Shut up.

105
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,240
We think they're trying to set us up as
patsies. You know how corrupt it is here.

106
00:10:56,365 --> 00:11:00,035
The Klan's here, they're inbred,
they sleep with their sisters.

107
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,789
- Some of them do.
- All right, Ma, listen.

108
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:07,918
We gotta get an attorney,
and it's gonna cost a lot of money.

109
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,840
- How much would an attorney cost?
- A decent one? $50,000. $100,000.

110
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:16,134
50,000. 100,000... I know, Ma. I know.

111
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,055
- Can we use any attorney?
- I think so.

112
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,474
He says he thinks so.

113
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,352
He is?

114
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,564
Well, that's a great idea.
You think he'll do it?

115
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,607
- We got an attorney in the family.
- Who?

116
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,942
My cousin Vinny.

117
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,665
What is that?

118
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,519
Where's he from?

119
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:01,990
- What?
- You stick out like a sore thumb around here.

120
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:05,452
- Me? What about you?
- I fit in better than you.

121
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:09,414
- At least I'm wearin' cowboy boots.
- Oh, yeah. You blend.

122
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,045
I bet the Chinese food here is terrible.

123
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,716
- I don't see anything.
- The wheels went out of balance

124
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,678
- right after we hit that mud.
- No, that's not it.

125
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,472
I think you should put it
on a rack and take a look.

126
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,641
What's wrong?

127
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,685
- What?
- What's the problem?

128
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,854
The car was shimmying on the highway.

129
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:36,024
- You got mud in your tyres.
- I got mud in my tyres?

130
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,652
Let me ask you, how do you
get mud into the tyres?

131
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:42,489
That's a figure of speech.
The mud gets around the inside of the wheel.

132
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:46,660
- Throws the balance off.
- Did you ever hear that? Mud in the tyres?

133
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,120
No.

134
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:51,790
She never heard it.
She knows everything about cars.

135
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,754
See, down here, everybody gets stuck
in the mud every now and then.

136
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,842
- Yeah. We're famous for our mud.
- Famous for your mud?

137
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:05,137
How's your Chinese food?

138
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:09,683
You keep on askin' about that. Can't you
tell they don't have Chinese restaurants?

139
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,853
Gotta let everybody know
you're a tourist. Come on.

140
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:15,022
And you're a fuckin' world traveller?

141
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:35,125
Our jail was condemned this morning.

142
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:39,922
That's why we bringin' you all
out to the state corrections facility.

143
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,602
Unlock the gate.

144
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,857
Go on through.

145
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,910
- Do you know what happens in these places?
- Yeah, I know what happens.

146
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:55,080
There's often a big guy named
Bubba no one will tangle with.

147
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,876
He'll protect you - if you become
his sex slave and do whatever he wants.

148
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,670
There's only the two of us here.

149
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:06,175
What about those cots?
What if they put somebody else in here?

150
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,510
Stan.

151
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,555
- Shut up.
- OK.

152
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,692
I can't believe my luck.

153
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,706
Here.

154
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,834
We got somebody for you.

155
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,757
You must be Stan. How you doin'?

156
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,510
Why'd they bring you in here?

157
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:52,846
I just got in. I asked for the new guys
and they brought me here.

158
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,516
He's sleepin', huh? Cute little guy.

159
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:59,937
You know, maybe I'll just start with you.
Let him sleep a little bit.

160
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:03,315
- Look, I don't wanna do this.
- I don't blame you.

161
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,777
If I was in your situation,
I'd wanna get through this whole thing

162
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:10,322
as quickly and with as little pain as possible.

163
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:14,785
So let's try our best to make it
a simple in-and-out procedure.

164
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:18,580
What's the matter?

165
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,833
Relax, relax. Relax.

166
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,919
Maybe we should spend
a couple of minutes together.

167
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:29,258
You know, to get acquainted before we,
you know, before we get to it.

168
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:33,762
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't wanna do this.

169
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:38,600
I understand, but what are your alternatives?

170
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,937
My alternatives? To what? To you?

171
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,398
I dunno. Suicide. Death.

172
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:50,028
Look, it's either me or them.
You're gettin' fucked, one way or the other.

173
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:56,368
Lighten up, OK?
Don't worry, I'm gonna help you.

174
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,494
Gee, thanks.

175
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:02,332
Excuse me, but I think a modicum of
gratitude would not be outta line here.

176
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:07,045
- You think I should be grateful?
- Yeah. I mean it's your ass, not mine.

177
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:12,009
I think you should be grateful. I think
you should be down on your fuckin' knees.

178
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:14,386
I didn't know your visit was such an honour.

179
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:18,223
I'm doin' a favour.
You're gettin' me for nothin', you little fuck.

180
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,642
Boy, that's one hell of an ego you've got.

181
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,270
What the fuck is your problem?

182
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:27,232
- I did not come here just to get jerked off.
- No. No, no.

183
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:31,320
I'm not jerking you off.
I'm not doing anything.

184
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:34,615
You're on your own. I'm just
takin' care of Sleeping Beauty.

185
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,034
- Billy.
- Back off.

186
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,703
- Vinny. Hey, Vinny.
- Vinny?

187
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:42,831
- Vinny Bag o' Donuts. How are you?
- This is Vinny?

188
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,792
I don't know where to start.

189
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,587
Have you had any murder cases before?

190
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:52,007
- None. This'll be my first.
- Your first?

191
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,176
Yeah.

192
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:59,806
What kind of cases have you had?
Assault and battery? Armed robbery?

193
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,936
No.

194
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:10,234
Well, I expect he's done burglary,
grand theft auto, drugs.

195
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:13,529
No. Nothin' like that either.

196
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,908
What kind... what kind of law
do you practise?

197
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:21,203
Well, up till now, personal injury.

198
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:29,002
Well, you're a trial attorney, right?
I mean, personal injury trials.

199
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:34,258
Well, actually, this'll be my first
foray into the trial process.

200
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:38,679
I haven't had to go to court yet.
Knock on wood.

201
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,558
You haven't had to go to court yet.

202
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:46,061
- How long you been practising?
- Almost six weeks.

203
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,067
But...

204
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,987
You graduated six years ago.
What have you been doin'?

205
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,239
Studyin', for the bar.

206
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,742
Six years?

207
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:05,038
- That's a lot of studying.
- Well, to be honest with you,

208
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,710
l... I didn't pass my first time out.

209
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:15,507
- That's OK. You passed the second time?
- I'm afraid not.

210
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:19,553
- Three times a charm?
- Not for me it isn't.

211
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,472
No. For me, six times was a charm.

212
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:28,437
Six times.

213
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,968
- A little informal, aren't we?
- I was resting...

214
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:03,222
- Not wearing a coat or tie.
- Sorry.

215
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:10,354
Well, approving an attorney from
out of state is a pretty informal matter.

216
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:13,774
- I just have a few questions.
- OK. Fire away, Judge.

217
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:17,736
- Where'd you go to law school?
- Brooklyn Academy of Law.

218
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:20,239
Is that an accredited law school?

219
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,830
Yes.

220
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:33,627
- How long you been practising?
- About six...

221
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,713
Almost sixteen years.

222
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:41,218
- Any murder cases?
- Quite a few. Yes.

223
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:45,597
- What was the outcome?
- You know. Win some, lose some.

224
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:51,645
This is not the forum to be cavalier.

225
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,189
Of course. Now, let me see.

226
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,608
Most recently, I had a axe murder,

227
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,486
which I won, on the grounds
of temporary insanity.

228
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,947
- Wanna hear the facts of the case?
- No.

229
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,408
- What else?
- Let me see. What else?

230
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,660
You ever heard of the Son of Sam?

231
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,663
The fella who received
orders to kill from a dog?

232
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:13,417
- That one.
- You defended him?

233
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:17,379
Well, no, not exactly.
I defended the first guy they arrested.

234
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:24,678
And he was found innocent and set free
and they caught the real guy.

235
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:29,600
Well.

236
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:32,978
We don't have any serial killers
in Beechum County.

237
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:38,859
What we do have is as sophisticated a justice
system as they do in the rest of the country.

238
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:41,278
- I'm sure.
- You being from New York an' all

239
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:47,242
might have the impression that law is
practised with a degree of informality here.

240
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,245
- It isn't.
- Right.

241
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:55,709
I tell you this because I want you
to know that when it comes to procedure,

242
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:58,045
I'm not a patient man.

243
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:03,175
Sir, when you come into my courtroom,
you ought to know the letter of the law.

244
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,136
- I'll react harshly when you don't.
- You should.

245
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,931
Being from New York
won't get you special treatment.

246
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,099
It shouldn't.

247
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:16,188
You won't. You'll be given
no leeway whatsoever.

248
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:25,072
I expect you to know this information
when you come into my courtroom.

249
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:26,198
Right.

250
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:30,369
- You willing to accept those terms?
- Right. No problem.

251
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:35,040
Just this?

252
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,172
This is gonna be great. Vinny's first case.

253
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:27,009
So? What can I do to help?

254
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:34,016
- Nothin'?
- No.

255
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,202
What the fuck is that?

256
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,177
Wanna sit at the counter?

257
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,723
Hey. How ya doin'?

258
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:20,979
Listen, what's the story with this
incredibly, remarkably loud whistle

259
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,023
at 5.30 in the morning?

260
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:25,859
It's the steam whistle.

261
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,945
Over at the sawmill.

262
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,280
Tell folks it's time to get up.

263
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:33,158
You can hear it for miles.

264
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,786
- Y'all want somethin'?
- Yeah.

265
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:46,338
- Breakfast?
- You think?

266
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,884
Good choice. Two.

267
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,979
Excuse me.

268
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:07,317
You guys down here hear about the ongoing
cholesterol problem in the country?

269
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,914
- What's this over here?
- You never heard of grits?

270
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:23,959
Sure. Sure, I heard of grits.

271
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:27,713
I just actually never seen a grit before.

272
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:32,509
- Honey, you gonna try it?
- You first.

273
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:39,933
- What is a grit, anyways?
- It's made out of corn.

274
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,728
- Them hominy grits.
- Hominy.

275
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:52,946
- How d'you cook it?
- Simmer it in water for 15 or 20 minutes,

276
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,157
put it on the plate and add butter.

277
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,242
So? You gonna eat it or not?

278
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,941
Here?

279
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:48,919
- Is your attorney here?
- I am the attorney.

280
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:52,756
Jim Trotter the Third.
District attorney of Beechum County.

281
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:56,844
Vincent La Guardia Gambini. First. Brooklyn.

282
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:00,264
Nice to see you.

283
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,338
Yeah.

284
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:39,344
- Vinny.
- Hey.

285
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:47,561
All rise for His Honour
Judge Chamberlain Haller.

286
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:51,273
The court of Beechum County
  
is now in session.

287
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,694
Be seated.

288
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:03,243
First case. The people of the State
of Alabama versus William Robert Gambini

289
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,621
and Stanley Marcus Rothenstein,

290
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:08,165
- "Steen." She called me "Stine".
- Just...

291
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:13,337
Counsellor, your clients are charged with
first-degree murder. How do they plead?

292
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:17,883
- Your Honour, my clients...
- Don't talk to me sitting in that chair.

293
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:25,307
- But he told me to sit here.
- When you address this court, you will rise

294
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,560
and speak to me in a clear, intelligible voice.

295
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:34,066
- Sorry. My clients...
- What are you wearin'?

296
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,110
Huh?

297
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:41,698
- What are you wearin'?
- I'm wearin' clothes.

298
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,578
I don't get the question.

299
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:50,457
When you come into my court
looking like you do,

300
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:55,254
you not only insult me,
but you insult the integrity of this court.

301
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:02,511
I apologise, sir, but this is how I dress.

302
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:06,849
Next time you come into my courtroom,
you will look lawyer-ly.

303
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:10,352
I mean, you comb your hair
and wear a suit and tie.

304
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:16,024
And that suit better be made
outta some kind of cloth.

305
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:20,320
- You understand me?
- Yes. Fine, Judge. Fine.

306
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:23,824
Good. You may continue.
How do your clients plead?

307
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:27,578
My clients are caught completely by surprise.

308
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,833
They thought they were getting
arrested for shoplifting a can of tuna.

309
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,794
What are you telling me?
That they plead not guilty?

310
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,299
- No. I'm just trying to explain.
- I don't wanna hear explanations.

311
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:43,510
The State of Alabama has its procedure.

312
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:48,932
And that procedure, at this point in time, is
to have an arraignment. Are we clear on this?

313
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:53,061
Yes. But there seems to be
a great deal of confusion here.

314
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:55,939
- Mr Gambini.
- You see, my clients...

315
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,279
All the way?

316
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:08,952
All I ask from you is a very simple
answer to a very simple question.

317
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:12,664
There are only two ways to answer.
"guilty" or "not guilty".

318
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,043
But my clients didn't do anything.

319
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:21,215
Once again, the communication
process has broken down.

320
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:26,136
It appears to me that you want
to skip the arraignment process,

321
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,557
go directly to trial, skip that,
and get a dismissal.

322
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:38,649
Well, I'm not about to revamp
the entire judicial process

323
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:42,778
just because you find yourself
in the unique position

324
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:46,406
of defending clients
who say they didn't do it.

325
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:51,537
Now, the next words out of your mouth
are either gonna be "guilty" or "not guilty".

326
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:55,082
I don't wanna hear commentary,
argument or opinion.

327
00:31:56,083 --> 00:32:00,003
If I hear anything other than
"guilty" or "not guilty",

328
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:02,047
you'll be in contempt.

329
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:05,175
I don't even wanna hear you clear your throat.

330
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:08,971
I hope I've been clear.

331
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:14,685
Now, how do your clients plead?

332
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,312
I think I get the point.

333
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:19,982
No. I don't think you do.

334
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:22,985
You're now in contempt of court.

335
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:27,739
- Will you go for two counts of contempt?
- Not guilty.

336
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:30,367
Thank you.

337
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:33,829
Bail will be set at $200,000.

338
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:38,333
Preliminary hearing will be set
for 9.30am tomorrow morning.

339
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:44,381
Bailiff, please take Mr Gambini into custody.
His bail will be set at $200.

340
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:47,551
Come with me, please.

341
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:51,346
All rise as the judge leaves.

342
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,477
You have to bail me out.
You know that, right?

343
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:17,039
Let's go.

344
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:36,225
They're gonna nuke
this guy Norton this weekend.

345
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,477
Looks like it.

346
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:42,105
You got one huge responsibility,
taking on this murder case.

347
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:44,608
You screw up and those boys get fried.

348
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:46,652
I know.

349
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:51,365
- So you think you know what you're doin'?
- Yeah, I think I know what I'm doin'.

350
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:56,578
You didn't look like you knew what you were
doin' today in that courtroom. Why is that?

351
00:33:56,703 --> 00:34:00,624
Well, it's a lot of procedure,
that's all. I'll learn it as I go.

352
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:02,709
- Learn as you go?
- Yeah, yeah.

353
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:06,171
- Didn't they teach that in law school?
- No, they didn't.

354
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:10,509
They teach you contracts,
precedence, interpretations.

355
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:13,887
Then the firm that hires you,
they teach you procedures.

356
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:19,476
- Or you can go to court and watch.
- So why don't you go to court and watch?

357
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:24,273
Because, between your father's garage and
working nights, when was I supposed to go?

358
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:27,943
I thought this summer I would
take off a couple of months.

359
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:30,654
But it ain't no big deal.

360
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:33,782
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

361
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:39,705
How can you be so sure when you don't
know what it is you're supposed to know?

362
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:44,042
It's a procedure. Like rebuilding
a carburettor has a procedure.

363
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:49,089
You know how the first thing you do is
you take the carburettor off the manifold?

364
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:54,720
Suppose you skip the first step, and as you're
replacing one of the jets, you drop the jet.

365
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:58,682
It goes down, rolls along the manifold
and into the head. You're fucked.

366
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:02,561
You've learned the hard way that
you gotta remove the carburettor first.

367
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:05,606
That's what happened to me today.
I learned the hard way.

368
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:08,734
Actually, it was a good
learning experience for me.

369
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:13,155
All right. Well, is there any way I could
help out in this procedure situation?

370
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,324
Yeah. Keep bailing me out.

371
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,662
We can't afford to keep bailing you out.
I've cashed in half the traveller's cheques.

372
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:23,999
I didn't wanna cash 'em in,
but I didn't wanna bounce a cheque.

373
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:27,252
I tried hustling the money,
but I got stiffed, so I cashed...

374
00:35:27,377 --> 00:35:31,590
Whoa, whoa. What do you mean, you got
stiffed? Did you say you got stiffed?

375
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:25,519
Hey. Vincent La Guardia Gambini.

376
00:36:27,563 --> 00:36:29,898
- His name's JT.
- JT.

377
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:34,653
I believe you and Lisa played
a game of pool for $200, which she won.

378
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:37,114
I'm here to collect.

379
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:40,701
- How about if I just kick your ass?
- A counteroffer?

380
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:45,497
That's what we lawyers - I'm a lawyer -
we lawyers call that a "counteroffer".

381
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:48,584
Let me see. This is a tough decision.

382
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:51,336
Get my ass kicked or collect $200?

383
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:53,422
What do you think?

384
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:58,051
I could use a good ass kicking,
I'll be very honest with you.

385
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,306
Nah, I think I'll just go with the 200.

386
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:09,688
Over my dead body.

387
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:12,608
You like to renegotiate as you go along, huh?

388
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:15,569
OK, then. Here's my counteroffer.

389
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:21,074
Do I have to kill you? What if I was just
to kick the everlovin' shit outta you?

390
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:25,162
- In your dreams.
- No, no, no. In reality.

391
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:28,790
If I was to kick the shit outta you,
do I get the money?

392
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:36,048
- If you kicked the shit outta me?
- Yeah.

393
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:38,717
Yeah, then you get the money.

394
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:44,473
- What happened? Rear-ended?
- No, I fell.

395
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:49,520
OK. Let's see if we agree on the terms.

396
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:52,773
The choice now is I get my ass kicked

397
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:57,653
or, option B, I kick your ass
and collect the 200.

398
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:04,618
I'm going with option B.
Kicking your ass and collecting $200.

399
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:10,040
- Are we gonna fight now?
- Yeah. First, let me see the money.

400
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:13,335
- I have the money.
- All right. Let me see it. Show it to me.

401
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:17,589
- I can get it.
- You can get it?

402
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,675
All right. Get it.

403
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,802
And then we'll fight.

404
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:29,518
You fell in your place or somebody else's?

405
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:32,104
- My place.
- Shit.

406
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:38,777
He blew the arraignment.
It's a simple procedure.

407
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:42,781
You heard the judge. All he had
to do was say "guilty" or "not guilty".

408
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,033
So? What are you saying?

409
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:50,789
What am I saying? You saw what happened
in there. You wanna stay with him after that?

410
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:53,292
Shit, Stan. I don't wanna fire him.

411
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:56,962
He's family. And my mother,
the way her health is right now...

412
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:01,592
I appreciate that. But should you die for that?

413
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:04,970
Wouldn't your mother
be more upset if you die?

414
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:08,473
The thing is, given the chance,
I think he could do a good job.

415
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:12,561
- No, you're wrong.
- Come on, fellas, knock it off. Let's go.

416
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:17,524
Stan, listen.
You have to see the Gambinis in action.

417
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:20,944
These people, they love to argue.
I mean, they live to argue.

418
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:23,739
My parents argue, too -
that doesn't make them lawyers.

419
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:27,659
Stan, I've seen your parents argue.
Trust me, they're amateurs.

420
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:40,297
Is that a drip I hear?

421
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:43,509
Yeah.

422
00:39:44,593 --> 00:39:47,346
Weren't you the last one
to use the bathroom?

423
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,056
So?

424
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:51,975
- Did you use the faucet?
- Yeah.

425
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:55,979
- Then why didn't you turn it off?
- I did turn it off.

426
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,650
Well, if you turned it off,
why am I listening to it?

427
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:03,403
Did it occur to you it could be
turned off and drip at the same time?

428
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:05,823
No. If you turned it off, it wouldn't drip.

429
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:09,827
- Maybe it's broken.
- Is that what you're saying? It's broken?

430
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:12,246
Yeah, that's it. It's broken.

431
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:18,752
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

432
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:25,133
- Maybe you didn't twist it hard enough?
- I twisted it just right.

433
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:28,011
How could you be so sure?

434
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:34,685
If you will look in the manual, you will
see that this particular model faucet

435
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,355
requires a range of 10 to 16
foot-pounds of torque.

436
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,567
I routinely twist to
maximum-allowable torquage.

437
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:45,154
How could you be sure
you used 16 foot-pounds of torque?

438
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:50,284
Because I used a Craftsman model 1019
laboratory edition

439
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:52,828
Signature Series torque wrench.

440
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:56,331
The kind used by Caltech
high-energy physicists

441
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:58,876
and NASA engineers.

442
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:03,714
Well, in that case, how could
you be sure that's accurate?

443
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,510
Because a split second before the torque
wrench was applied to the faucet handle,

444
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,305
it had been calibrated by top members

445
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:15,767
of the state and federal
department of weights and measures

446
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:18,312
to be dead-on balls accurate.

447
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:22,357
Here's a certificate of validation.

448
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:28,989
Dead-on balls accurate?

449
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:31,408
It's an industry term.

450
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:39,708
I guess the fucking thing is broken.

451
00:41:56,308 --> 00:41:58,435
We gotta move.

452
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:03,273
Then I heard two loud bangs,
like firecrackers.

453
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:08,445
I looked up and saw two young men
run out from the Sac-o-Suds

454
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:13,742
and jump into a green car
with a white convertible top,

455
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:16,286
and drive off like the dickens.

456
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,165
Miss Riley, are those two young men
present in the courtroom?

457
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:24,169
- Yes, sir. They are.
- Could you point 'em out for me, please?

458
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:26,547
They sittin' right there.

459
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:32,427
Now, Mrs Riley, is this the car?

460
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:37,015
- Yes, sir. It is.
- Thank you, ma'am.

461
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:42,980
Let the records show Mrs Constance Riley
identified the defendants' car.

462
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:46,859
I was makin' my breakfast.

463
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:50,779
I saw them two boys go into the store.

464
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:54,366
Then later I heard a gunshot.

465
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,662
Looked out the window.

466
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:02,541
They were running out.
Got into the car and drove off.

467
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:04,960
Is this the car?

468
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:10,757
Yes. It is.

469
00:43:10,883 --> 00:43:13,218
Thank you, sir.

470
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:25,063
Then you saw those two boys run out o' the
Sac-o-Suds, jump in this car and take off?

471
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:28,192
Yeah. They peeled away.
Car was all over the road.

472
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:30,360
Thank you, sir.

473
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:35,491
I asked him if he did it,
and he said "l shot the clerk."

474
00:43:36,492 --> 00:43:41,371
I asked him again, and again
he said "l shot the clerk."

475
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:45,000
Your Honour, no further questions.

476
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:49,171
- Mr Gambini.
- Yes.

477
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:52,966
- Do you have anything to add?
- Thing? What thing?

478
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,428
Not for me to say.

479
00:43:56,553 --> 00:43:59,014
No, sir.

480
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:03,477
You can stand down.

481
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:08,023
- Do you have any other witnesses?
- No, Your Honour.

482
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:12,569
The court finds sufficient evidence
exists for this matter to go to trial.

483
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:17,324
I'm setting this matter for trial
this Monday, February 2, 10am.

484
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:23,664
Mr Gambini.

485
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:25,916
Stand up.

486
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:36,844
Now, didn't I tell you next time you appear in
my courtroom that you dress appropriately?

487
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:39,346
You were serious about that?

488
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:49,398
- Why didn't you ask them any questions?
- Questions? Ask who questions?

489
00:44:50,649 --> 00:44:53,318
You knew you could ask questions.
Didn't you, Vin?

490
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:56,822
If you'd put up a fight, you could have
gotten the case thrown out.

491
00:44:56,947 --> 00:45:00,659
Hey, Stan. You're in Ala-fuckin'-bama.

492
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:05,581
You come from New York.
You killed a good old boy.

493
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:08,917
There is no way this is not going to trial.

494
00:45:12,254 --> 00:45:16,466
What the fuck is goin' on here, Vinny?
You fuckin' up this case or what?

495
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:19,845
I told you. It's just procedure.
I'm bound to fuck up a little.

496
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,806
A little? You got thrown in jail. Twice.

497
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:28,103
I know I was in jail. I don't need you
to point it out to me, OK?

498
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:31,315
You're my fiancee.
You're supposed to stand by your man.

499
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,027
You know, encourage me a little bit.
A little encouragement.

500
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:39,656
Is that what you want? I'm sorry.
You were wonderful in there.

501
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:44,995
The way you handled that judge...
You're a smooth talker. You are.

502
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,956
All right, knock it off. Knock it off.

503
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:50,292
Do you think I like fuckin' up? Is that it?

504
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:54,838
You raggin' on me is not gonna give me
any great spontaneous knowledge.

505
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:57,799
- Yeah?
- So shut it.

506
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:25,452
- You done readin'?
- Yeah.

507
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:29,748
Do you wanna go to bed?

508
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:34,878
I don't know. I don't feel good.

509
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:39,132
You shouldn't feel good.
You haven't slept much in three days.

510
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:44,763
That's part of it. You know what it is?

511
00:46:52,271 --> 00:46:56,400
I'm... I'm really scared.

512
00:46:58,193 --> 00:47:00,237
You should be.

513
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:04,658
How the fuck did I get into this shit?

514
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:08,120
"Sure. No problem. I could win the case."

515
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:11,623
I already got myself sent to jail twice.

516
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:15,502
I could win this thing, though.
I know I could.

517
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:19,131
If I could keep my ass awake and outta jail
long enough, betcha I could, huh?

518
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:21,508
You know what I think? Honestly?

519
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:26,597
I think that once you're out there
and you're doin' your thing,

520
00:47:26,722 --> 00:47:29,224
I think you're gonna be really great.

521
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:33,103
Really great.

522
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:42,112
If you don't fuck up.

523
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:27,866
If this was a conspiracy,
they'd have to get all those people to lie.

524
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:32,120
Do you think that's what's happening?

525
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:38,669
Look, I think we should meet with
the public defender. See what he's like.

526
00:48:38,794 --> 00:48:41,797
If he's honest, then we should go with him.

527
00:48:45,676 --> 00:48:47,719
All right.

528
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:57,563
- That's death row in there.
- It is?

529
00:48:57,688 --> 00:48:59,773
The chair ain't working like it used to.

530
00:48:59,898 --> 00:49:05,154
The guy we fried last week - took us
three attempts and his head caught fire.

531
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,948
See, there's no money in the budget
to get it looked at.

532
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:12,744
I say it'd be cheaper to get it fixed than
keeping running up them extra electric bills.

533
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:26,425
Hi, Stanley.

534
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,886
My name is John Gibbons

535
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:32,264
and I'm an attorney
in the public defender's office.

536
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:34,433
- Hi, John.
- Hey.

537
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:40,189
Now, the evidence against you
is pretty strong, so

538
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:45,027
why don't you just tell me
your side of the story?

539
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:58,749
- Hey, Vin.
- Hey, Billy.

540
00:49:58,874 --> 00:50:00,501
How are ya?

541
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:02,503
- How do you feel? OK?
- All right.

542
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:05,964
- Where's Stan?
- Stan, he's not comin'.

543
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:11,220
He's...

544
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:14,515
Well, he wants to go with the public defender.

545
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:22,147
Listen, Vin...

546
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:26,735
I'm going with the public defender, too.

547
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:32,199
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I just didn't know
what little experience you have with this.

548
00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:38,121
- What, are you scared?
- Yeah, I'm scared.

549
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:41,792
Maybe I could have handled
the preliminary a little better.

550
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:44,461
But what's most important
is winning the case.

551
00:50:44,586 --> 00:50:47,005
I could do it. I really could.

552
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:49,883
Let me tell you how, OK?

553
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:54,346
The DA's gotta build a case.
Building a case is like building a house.

554
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:57,057
Each piece of evidence is a building block.

555
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:59,560
He wants to make
a brick bunker of a building.

556
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:04,606
He wants to use serious,
solid-looking bricks, like these, right?

557
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:07,317
- Right.
- Let me show you something.

558
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:16,410
He's gonna show you the bricks.
He'll show you they got straight sides.

559
00:51:16,535 --> 00:51:18,871
He'll show you how they got the right shape.

560
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:21,915
He'll show them to you
in a very special way

561
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,210
so that they appear to have
everything a brick should have.

562
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:27,796
But there's one thing
he's not gonna show you.

563
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:32,301
When you look at the bricks at the right
angle, they're as thin as this playing card.

564
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:36,471
His whole case is an illusion, a magic trick.

565
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:40,225
It has to be an illusion, cos you're innocent.

566
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:48,400
Nobody, I mean nobody, pulls the wool over
the eyes of a Gambini. Especially this one.

567
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:52,988
Give me the chance. One chance.

568
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:55,157
Let me question the first witness.

569
00:51:55,282 --> 00:52:00,370
lf, after that point, you don't think that I'm the
best man for the job, fire me then and there.

570
00:52:00,496 --> 00:52:02,956
I'll leave quietly. No grudges.

571
00:52:03,165 --> 00:52:05,542
All I ask is for that one chance.

572
00:52:07,336 --> 00:52:10,214
I think you should give it to me.

573
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:16,970
You should give it to him? What was he
before he was a lawyer? A fuckin' comedian?

574
00:52:17,095 --> 00:52:20,224
If he doesn't ask the right questions,
your lawyer will.

575
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:22,559
No, he can still fuck things up.

576
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:26,772
Cross-examination is about knowing
what to say and what not to say.

577
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:31,235
Let's say he asks all the possible questions,
and the witness has all the answers.

578
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,446
He ends up proving the prosecution's case.

579
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:38,200
How did he ever talk you into it?

580
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:46,667
At my cousin Ruthie's wedding,
the groom's brother was that guy Ali Kazam.

581
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:50,671
- You know who I'm talkin' about?
- The magician with the ponytail?

582
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:55,425
Right. He did his act, and every time he made
something disappear, Vinny jumped on him.

583
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:59,137
He nailed him. It was like
"It's in his pocket" or "He's palming it."

584
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,348
Or "There's a mirror under the table."

585
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:05,853
He was like "Wait. It's joined in the middle
and there's a spring around it."

586
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:08,647
"lt pops it open when it's inside the tube."

587
00:53:08,772 --> 00:53:12,025
It was like Ali Kazam's worst nightmare.

588
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:14,820
But he was just being Vinny.

589
00:53:14,945 --> 00:53:18,157
He was just being
the quintessential Gambini.

590
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:31,628
There goes the quintessential Norton.

591
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:37,467
Lookee here, JT.

592
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:48,520
Hey, hey, little Yankee boy.
Look here what I got.

593
00:53:49,688 --> 00:53:53,400
- What is it?
- $200.

594
00:53:54,902 --> 00:53:57,279
Bring it here. Let me see it.

595
00:54:06,914 --> 00:54:11,084
How do I know that's not a bunch
of ones with a 20 wrapped around it?

596
00:54:12,294 --> 00:54:15,881
- It's 200 bucks.
- Fan it out. Show it to me.

597
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:22,971
Yeah, right.

598
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:49,683
Does that freight train come through
at 5am every morning?

599
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:52,144
No, sir. It's very unusual.

600
00:55:53,729 --> 00:55:55,481
OK.

601
00:55:55,856 --> 00:55:59,109
I was making a lot of money,
winning most of my cases.

602
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:00,736
Thank you, Shirley.

603
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:03,071
But my clients were guilty as hell.

604
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:07,618
Finally, after getting this fella off some
serious charges for the fourth time,

605
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:10,162
I tell you the truth, my conscience got to me.

606
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:13,457
I'd be serving justice more
by putting the guilty in jail.

607
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:17,753
That's what I've been doing and
I'm a happier man for it.

608
00:56:17,878 --> 00:56:22,007
- How about you?
- Well, I got a bullshit traffic ticket.

609
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:24,760
In court, I got the cop on the stand

610
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:27,888
and argued with him until
he admitted he was wrong.

611
00:56:28,013 --> 00:56:35,103
And the judge, this Judge Malloy,
all the while, he's laughing and smiling,

612
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:39,817
and then, afterwards,
he asked me to go to lunch with him.

613
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:43,320
Then he says to me "You know what?
You'd be a good litigator."

614
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:48,492
I don't know what the hell he was talking
about. I don't know what a litigator is.

615
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:52,746
I never thought of becoming a lawyer.
But Judge Malloy was from Brooklyn, too.

616
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:56,416
I mean, he did it.
So all of a sudden it seemed possible.

617
00:56:57,209 --> 00:56:59,253
So I went to law school.

618
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:04,967
Then from time to time, he would come by,
see how I was doin', if I needed anything.

619
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:08,554
He was a nice man.

620
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:12,140
I mean, to go out of his way
like that for me, you know?

621
00:57:12,891 --> 00:57:18,063
He wanted his son to follow in his footsteps,
but he became a musician or something.

622
00:57:18,188 --> 00:57:21,275
I remember when I graduated,
he was so proud of me.

623
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:24,027
That's quite a story.

624
00:57:24,153 --> 00:57:25,737
Yeah.

625
00:57:25,863 --> 00:57:29,199
- We got some case ahead of us here, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

626
00:57:29,658 --> 00:57:33,370
- How do you feel about it?
- Well, l...

627
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:35,831
I'd like to have a murder weapon.

628
00:57:35,956 --> 00:57:39,293
But, other than that, I feel pretty good.

629
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:41,336
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.

630
00:57:43,255 --> 00:57:45,257
What you doin' this afternoon?

631
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:49,261
- You're goin' hunting?
- That's right.

632
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:52,764
Why are you goin' hunting?
Shouldn't you be preparing for court?

633
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:57,394
I was thinkin' last night "lf only
I knew what he knows." You know?

634
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:00,063
If he'd let me look at his files. Oh, boy.

635
00:58:00,772 --> 00:58:05,527
I don't get it. What does getting to
Trotter's files have to do with hunting?

636
00:58:05,652 --> 00:58:10,240
Well, you know. Two guys
out in the woods, guns, on the hunt.

637
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:13,827
It's a bonding thing, you know.
Show him I'm one of the boys.

638
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:18,207
He won't let me see his files, but maybe
he'll relax enough to drop his guard

639
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:21,543
so that I can finesse
a little information out of him.

640
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:25,964
- What am I gonna wear?
- What are you gonna hunt?

641
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:29,801
I don't know. He's got a lot
of stuffed heads in his office.

642
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:33,347
Heads? What kind of heads?

643
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:36,141
I don't know. He's got a boar,
a bear, a couple of deer.

644
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:38,519
Whoa. You're gonna shoot a deer?

645
00:58:40,103 --> 00:58:44,608
I don't know. I suppose. I mean, I'm
a man's man. I could go deer hunting.

646
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:50,280
A sweet, innocent, harmless,
leaf-eating, doe-eyed little deer.

647
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:54,034
Hey, Lisa. I'm not gonna go out
there just to wimp out, you know?

648
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:58,539
I mean, the guy'll lose respect for me.
Would you rather have that?

649
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:07,589
What about these pants I got on?
You think they're OK?

650
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:15,055
lmagine you're a deer.

651
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:20,018
You're prancing along. You get thirsty.
You spot a little brook.

652
00:59:20,144 --> 00:59:24,064
You put your little deer lips
down to the cool, clear water.

653
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:27,484
Bam. A fuckin' bullet rips off
part of your head.

654
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:30,988
Your brains are layin'
on the ground in little bloody pieces.

655
00:59:31,113 --> 00:59:33,699
Would you give a fuck what kind of pants

656
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:36,577
the son of a bitch
who shot you was wearing?

657
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:51,800
I'd sure like to get a look at your files.

658
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:54,428
- You would?
- Sure.

659
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:56,597
You got a Xerox machine over there?

660
00:59:56,722 --> 00:59:58,932
No.

661
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:02,060
That's OK. I'll have my secretary do it.

662
01:00:02,186 --> 01:00:08,817
Shirley, can you Xerox all the files on the
Gambini/Rothenstein case for Mr Gambini?

663
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:12,362
Yeah. Thanks, sweetheart.

664
01:00:20,746 --> 01:00:24,583
- What's all that?
- Trotter's files. All of 'em.

665
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:27,920
- You stole his files?
- I didn't steal his files.

666
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:32,841
Listen to this. I'm just ready to finesse him.
I'm starting to finesse him. I got him goin'.

667
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:36,678
He offers to have his secretary
copy everything for me.

668
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:41,683
- That's very impressive finessing.
- That's not all.

669
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:44,728
He's letting us use his hunting cabin
when he gets back.

670
01:00:44,853 --> 01:00:48,398
It's in the woods. It's quiet.
He sleeps like a baby when he's there.

671
01:00:48,524 --> 01:00:51,443
Terrific. You're a helluva bonder.

672
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:55,072
What's this? Are you reading this book?

673
01:00:56,073 --> 01:00:59,201
- Yeah.
- Do me a favour, OK? Don't read this book.

674
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:02,162
OK? Thank you very much.

675
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,873
All right.

676
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:08,377
Don't you wanna know
why Trotter gave you his files?

677
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,337
I told you why already.

678
01:01:10,462 --> 01:01:15,384
He has to by law. You're entitled.
It's called disclosure, you dickhead.

679
01:01:16,134 --> 01:01:19,471
He has to show you everything,
otherwise it could be a mistrial.

680
01:01:19,596 --> 01:01:23,892
He has to give you a list of all his witnesses.
You can talk to all his witnesses.

681
01:01:24,017 --> 01:01:26,353
He's not allowed any surprises.

682
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:31,567
They didn't teach you that
in law school either?

683
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:39,992
Now let me ask you this.

684
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:43,036
How many levels of thickness
have you gone through?

685
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:46,456
- What'd you have for breakfast?
- Well...

686
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:49,042
What's that brown stuff?

687
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:21,950
Yesterday you told me that freight train
hardly ever comes through here at 5am.

688
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:26,038
I know. She's supposed
to come through at ten after four.

689
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:33,545
Can you participate in this - in which the
final decision may be death by electrocution?

690
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:37,007
Ma'am?

691
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:42,054
I think it should be left up to the victims'
families, rather than the courts.

692
01:02:43,931 --> 01:02:47,935
The defendants in this case are charged
with robbing a convenience store.

693
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:52,356
And then, in a most cowardly fashion,
shooting the clerk in the back.

694
01:02:52,898 --> 01:02:57,820
Now, if sufficient evidence is offered
to prove these facts, you think you could...

695
01:02:57,945 --> 01:02:59,988
Fry 'em.

696
01:03:01,031 --> 01:03:02,366
She'll do.

697
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:24,513
Mr Gambini. Come in. Come in.

698
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:37,901
I just got a fax from the New York
State Office of Judicial Records.

699
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:43,115
They have no records

700
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:48,203
of any Vincent Gambini ever trying
any case in the entire state of New York.

701
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:55,127
You're not gonna find any records of Vincent
La Guardia Gambini practising in any courts.

702
01:03:55,252 --> 01:03:57,754
- I just told you that.
- You don't understand.

703
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,924
See, 20 years ago, I became a actor.

704
01:04:01,049 --> 01:04:05,387
There was this prominent stage actor
in New York. His name was Vincent Gambini.

705
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:07,639
- Maybe you heard of him.
- No.

706
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:13,020
Never heard of him? Doesn't matter. Anyway,
I had to change my name, which I did legally.

707
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:16,648
So now I practise law under
my legally changed stage name.

708
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:19,318
- What name is that?
- Jerry Ga...

709
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:25,491
Jerry Gallo.

710
01:04:29,578 --> 01:04:31,580
You can still call me Gambini.

711
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:37,920
Sorry.

712
01:04:38,629 --> 01:04:41,632
- What name did you tell him?
- Jerry Gallo.

713
01:04:41,757 --> 01:04:45,719
- Jerry Gallo? The big attorney?
- Yeah.

714
01:04:45,844 --> 01:04:50,015
- Think that was a smart move?
- Yeah. He's a seriously accomplished lawyer.

715
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,601
His name'll show up all over the place.

716
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:55,521
- His name was in the papers all last week.
- I saw that.

717
01:04:55,646 --> 01:04:58,315
- You didn't actually read the articles?
- No.

718
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,109
- That's too bad.
- Why is that?

719
01:05:01,193 --> 01:05:03,237
Cos he's dead.

720
01:05:21,672 --> 01:05:24,174
What's the matter with you?

721
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:26,343
I dunno.

722
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:32,724
- You're acting like you're nervous.
- Well, yeah. I am.

723
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:36,603
Why? I'm the one that's under the gun.
The trial starts tomorrow.

724
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:39,857
You wanna know what
I'm nervous about? I'll tell you.

725
01:05:39,982 --> 01:05:43,819
I am in the dark here with this legal crap.
I have no idea what's goin' on.

726
01:05:43,944 --> 01:05:47,281
All's I know is you're screwin' up
and I can't help.

727
01:05:47,656 --> 01:05:50,659
- You lent me your little camera, didn't ya?
- Oh, Vinny.

728
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:56,748
I'm watchin' you go down in flames, bringin'
me with you, and I can't do anything about it.

729
01:05:56,874 --> 01:05:58,208
And?

730
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:01,545
I hate to bring it up - I know
you got enough pressure on you -

731
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:04,798
but we agreed to get married
when you won your first case.

732
01:06:04,923 --> 01:06:09,845
Meanwhile, ten years later, my niece, the
daughter of my sister, is gettin' married.

733
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:12,514
My biological clock is tickin' like this,

734
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:16,518
and the way this case is goin',
I ain't never gettin' married.

735
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:23,150
Lisa, I don't need this. I swear to God,
I do not need this right now, OK?

736
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:26,487
I got a judge that's just aching
to throw me in jail.

737
01:06:27,237 --> 01:06:30,199
An idiot who wants to fight me for $200.

738
01:06:30,324 --> 01:06:33,452
Slaughtered pigs. Giant loud whistles.

739
01:06:34,244 --> 01:06:36,288
I ain't slept in five days.

740
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:38,999
I got no money. A dress-code problem.

741
01:06:39,124 --> 01:06:44,254
And a little murder case which, in the
balance, holds the lives of two innocent kids.

742
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:49,885
Not to mention your
biological clock, my career,

743
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:54,264
your life, our marriage,
and let me see, what else can we pile on?

744
01:06:54,389 --> 01:06:59,102
Is there any more shit we can pile on
to the top of the outcome of this case?

745
01:06:59,895 --> 01:07:01,980
Is it possible?

746
01:07:04,942 --> 01:07:07,194
Maybe it was a bad time to bring it up.

747
01:07:26,922 --> 01:07:28,549
What the fuck is that?

748
01:07:56,702 --> 01:07:58,620
This is very romantic.

749
01:08:00,414 --> 01:08:06,253
Out here in this field,
under the stars, quiet.

750
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:10,507
No one around for miles.

751
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:14,428
It's very romantic.

752
01:08:18,682 --> 01:08:20,392
I don't see no stars.

753
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:41,371
Honey, move. My back.

754
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:45,125
I have to get up.

755
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,420
Wait. Let me...

756
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:52,591
This fuckin' jacket.

757
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,819
Fuck.

758
01:10:02,119 --> 01:10:05,831
- You OK?
- What was in that plastic thing in the trunk?

759
01:10:05,956 --> 01:10:08,125
It's your suit.

760
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:11,003
- What is my suit doing in the trunk?
- I had it cleaned.

761
01:10:11,128 --> 01:10:14,381
I thought it'd be a nice surprise -
go in there with a clean suit.

762
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:28,437
I have 30 fuckin' minutes to take a shower,
get a new suit and get to the courthouse.

763
01:10:28,562 --> 01:10:32,858
- You fuckin' shower, I'll get your fuckin' suit.
- Little Yankee wuss.

764
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:35,319
Look here. Got your $200.

765
01:10:36,528 --> 01:10:38,822
You gonna kick the shit out of me now?

766
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:52,229
Mr Gambini,
are you mockin' me with that outfit?

767
01:11:53,856 --> 01:11:56,024
Mockin' you? I'm not mockin' you, Judge.

768
01:11:56,358 --> 01:11:58,652
Then explain that outfit.

769
01:12:02,281 --> 01:12:06,243
I bought a suit. You seen it.
Now it's covered in mud.

770
01:12:06,702 --> 01:12:10,581
This town doesn't have a one-hour cleaners,
so I had to buy a new suit.

771
01:12:10,706 --> 01:12:15,127
Except that the only store you could
buy a new suit in has got the flu.

772
01:12:15,252 --> 01:12:17,921
You get that? The whole store got the flu.

773
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:21,258
So I had to get this in a second-hand store.

774
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:28,682
So, it's either wear the leather jacket -
which I know you hate - or this.

775
01:12:29,683 --> 01:12:34,646
So I wore this ridiculous thing for you.

776
01:12:39,234 --> 01:12:41,570
Are you on drugs?

777
01:12:41,695 --> 01:12:43,947
Drugs? No. I don't take drugs.

778
01:12:44,406 --> 01:12:47,618
- I don't like your attitude.
- What else is new?

779
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:51,747
- I'm holding you in contempt of court.
- There's a fuckin' surprise.

780
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:54,625
- What'd you say?
- What?

781
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:57,377
What'd you just say?

782
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:00,589
What'd I say? What?

783
01:13:05,344 --> 01:13:09,223
Your Honour, counsel, members of the jury.

784
01:13:10,307 --> 01:13:16,063
The evidence in this case is gonna show
that at 9.30 in the morning of January 4th,

785
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:20,400
both defendants, Stanley Rothenstein
and William Gambini,

786
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:22,694
were seen gettin' out of their

787
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:28,450
metallic green 1964 Buick Skylark
convertible with a white top.

788
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:35,290
It's gonna show they were seen entering the
Sac-o-Suds convenience store in Wazoo City.

789
01:13:35,415 --> 01:13:39,753
The evidence is gonna show that,
minutes after they entered the Sac-o-Suds,

790
01:13:39,878 --> 01:13:43,131
a gunshot was heard by three eyewitnesses.

791
01:13:43,757 --> 01:13:48,011
You will then hear the testimony
of the three eyewitnesses

792
01:13:48,137 --> 01:13:53,183
who saw the defendants runnin' out of the
Sac-o-Suds just after the shots were heard,

793
01:13:53,308 --> 01:13:59,606
gettin' into their faded metallic green 1964
Buick Skylark and drivin' off in great haste.

794
01:14:00,566 --> 01:14:06,738
Finally, the state is gonna prove that
the defendants, Gambini and Rothenstein,

795
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:12,202
admitted then recanted their testimony
to the sheriff of Beechum County.

796
01:14:12,494 --> 01:14:14,454
Now let's get down to it.

797
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:19,918
Your verdict is gonna depend on
what you think of the sworn testimony.

798
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:23,797
Not what I think. What I think don't count.

799
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:27,426
You're the jury. It's your job
to decide who's tellin' the truth.

800
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:31,013
Truth. That's what "verdict" means.

801
01:14:31,805 --> 01:14:36,602
It's a word that comes down from ol'
England, and all our little ol' ancestors.

802
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:40,606
Now, we're gonna be asking
you to return a verdict

803
01:14:40,731 --> 01:14:45,569
of murder in the first degree
for William Gambini

804
01:14:46,195 --> 01:14:52,159
and a verdict of accessory to murder in the
first degree for Stanley Rothenstein,

805
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:59,041
for helping Gambini
commit this heinous crime.

806
01:15:08,926 --> 01:15:12,429
Counsellor, you wish to make
an opening statement?

807
01:15:15,057 --> 01:15:17,351
Counsellor?

808
01:15:23,398 --> 01:15:25,067
- Vinny.
- What?

809
01:15:25,192 --> 01:15:27,861
Come on, it's time to make
your opening statement.

810
01:15:27,986 --> 01:15:29,196
Come on, Vin.

811
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:38,872
Everything that guy said is bullshit.

812
01:15:38,997 --> 01:15:40,290
Thank you.

813
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:44,545
Objection, Your Honour. Counsel's
entire opening statement is argument.

814
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:47,881
Objection sustained.
The entire opening statement,

815
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:53,470
with the exception of "thank you",
will be stricken from the record.

816
01:15:53,595 --> 01:15:58,767
The jury will please disregard
counsel's entire opening statement.

817
01:15:59,184 --> 01:16:05,607
And you, Mr Gambini, will not use that kinda
language in my court. Understand?

818
01:16:05,941 --> 01:16:07,985
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

819
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:13,157
Putz.

820
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:17,578
Counsellor. Your statement, sir.

821
01:16:36,847 --> 01:16:39,516
Well, now.

822
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,645
Ladies and gentlemen of the j-j-j...

823
01:16:44,521 --> 01:16:47,191
of-of the j-j-j...

824
01:16:49,526 --> 01:16:51,653
jury.

825
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:55,532
On-on...

826
01:16:55,657 --> 01:17:01,330
On January ffffffff....

827
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:08,462
fourth of this year, my client did indeed
visit the Sac-o-Suds c... co...

828
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:14,676
convenience store.

829
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:16,887
But-but

830
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:20,265
he didn't

831
01:17:21,975 --> 01:17:25,020
kill anyone. He...

832
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:35,572
We intend to prove that the ppppp...

833
01:17:36,615 --> 01:17:41,328
prosecution's case
is circumstantial and-and-and

834
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:48,043
coincidental. Thank you.

835
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:04,101
That's it? What about
everything we talked about?

836
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:06,145
- I get a little nervous...
- A little?

837
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:07,938
I'm gettin' better.

838
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:11,817
I heard a gunshot, so I looked out the window

839
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:16,572
and I seen them two boys
run out, get into their car,

840
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:21,785
and drive off like maniacs, their tyres
screechin', smokin', goin' up on the kerb.

841
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:23,954
Is this the car?

842
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:27,249
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

843
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:29,543
No further questions, Your Honour.

844
01:18:29,668 --> 01:18:31,712
Your witness.

845
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:40,304
All right. Mr T-T-T...

846
01:18:43,682 --> 01:18:45,350
Tipton.

847
01:18:45,976 --> 01:18:48,228
Now, when you viewed my clients,

848
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,899
- how-how far away were you?
- About 50 feet.

849
01:18:52,024 --> 01:19:02,576
Now, do you think that that's close enough
to make an accurate i-i-i-identification?

850
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:05,037
Yes.

851
01:19:07,331 --> 01:19:11,126
- Mr Tipton, I see you wear eyeglasses.
- Sometimes.

852
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:16,381
Would you care to show those eyeglasses
to the jury, please? Thank you.

853
01:19:18,258 --> 01:19:22,262
Thank you. Mr Tipton,
were you wearing them that day?

854
01:19:22,387 --> 01:19:24,515
- No.
- You see.

855
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:29,353
You were 50 feet away, you made
a positive eyewitness identification,

856
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,773
and-and-and yet

857
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:37,319
you were not wearing your
necessary prescription eyeglasses.

858
01:19:38,487 --> 01:19:41,156
They're reading glasses.

859
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,586
Well, Mr...

860
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:03,762
Could you tell the court
what colour eyes the defendants have?

861
01:20:06,974 --> 01:20:10,018
Brown. Hazel green.

862
01:20:14,356 --> 01:20:16,567
No more questions.

863
01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:22,906
Mr Gambini. Your witness.

864
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:27,077
- He's a tough one.
- Yes.

865
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:31,165
Mr Tipton.

866
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:33,542
When you viewed the defendants

867
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:38,297
walkin' from their car into the Sac-o-Suds,
what angle was your point of view?

868
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:42,259
They was kind of walking toward me
when they entered the store.

869
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:46,096
And when they left,
what angle was your point of view?

870
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:49,224
They was kind of walkin' away from me.

871
01:20:49,349 --> 01:20:53,645
So would you say you got a better shot of
them goin' in, and not so much comin' out?

872
01:20:54,146 --> 01:20:57,441
- You could say that.
- I did say that. Would you say that?

873
01:20:58,025 --> 01:20:58,984
Yeah.

874
01:20:59,985 --> 01:21:02,654
Is it possible the two youths...

875
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:05,824
Two what?

876
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:09,661
What was that word?

877
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:12,789
- What word?
- Two what?

878
01:21:12,915 --> 01:21:15,626
- What?
- Did you say "yoots"?

879
01:21:15,959 --> 01:21:18,545
- Yeah. "Two youths."
- What is a yoot?

880
01:21:19,588 --> 01:21:22,925
Excuse me, Your Honour. Two youths.

881
01:21:30,224 --> 01:21:32,893
Is it possible the two defendants

882
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:37,940
entered the store, picked 22
specific items off of the shelves,

883
01:21:38,398 --> 01:21:42,694
had the clerk take money,
make change, then leave.

884
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:46,740
Then, two different men
drive up in a similar...

885
01:21:46,865 --> 01:21:51,036
Don't shake your head. Wait till you hear
the whole thing so you can understand.

886
01:21:51,161 --> 01:21:54,289
Two different men drive up
in a similar-looking car,

887
01:21:54,414 --> 01:21:58,961
go in, shoot the clerk,
rob him and then leave?

888
01:21:59,294 --> 01:22:01,588
No. They didn't have enough time.

889
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:04,591
- How much time was they in the store?
- Five minutes.

890
01:22:04,716 --> 01:22:07,845
- Five minutes? Did you look at your watch?
- No.

891
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:13,642
Oh, I'm sorry. You testified earlier
that the boys went into the store

892
01:22:13,767 --> 01:22:16,019
and you had just begun to make breakfast.

893
01:22:16,145 --> 01:22:18,856
You were just ready to eat
and you heard a gunshot.

894
01:22:19,064 --> 01:22:24,111
So obviously it takes you five minutes
to make breakfast, so you knew that.

895
01:22:24,236 --> 01:22:26,905
- Do you remember what you had?
- Eggs and grits.

896
01:22:27,114 --> 01:22:29,032
Eggs and grits. I like grits, too.

897
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:34,746
How do you cook your grits?
You like 'em regular, creamy or al dente?

898
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:40,836
- Just regular, I guess.
- Regular. lnstant grits?

899
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:45,799
No self-respectin' Southerner uses
instant grits. I take pride in my grits.

900
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:49,094
So, Mr Tipton.

901
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:54,099
How could it take you
five minutes to cook your grits

902
01:22:54,433 --> 01:22:59,813
when it takes the entire
grit-eating world 20 minutes?

903
01:23:05,736 --> 01:23:08,489
I dunno. I'm a fast cook, I guess.

904
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:14,661
I'm sorry, I was over here. I couldn't hear.
Did you say you're a fast cook? That's it?

905
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:21,460
Are we to believe that boiling water
soaks into a grit faster in your kitchen

906
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:24,546
than on any place on the face of the earth?

907
01:23:25,506 --> 01:23:26,673
I don't know.

908
01:23:26,799 --> 01:23:30,594
Perhaps the laws of physics
cease to exist on your stove.

909
01:23:31,762 --> 01:23:34,348
Were these magic grits?

910
01:23:34,473 --> 01:23:39,269
Did you buy them from the same guy
who sold Jack his beanstalk beans?

911
01:23:39,394 --> 01:23:41,688
- Objection, Your Honour.
- Sustained.

912
01:23:41,814 --> 01:23:45,901
- Are you sure about that five minutes?
- I don't know.

913
01:23:46,151 --> 01:23:50,489
- I think you made your point.
- Are you sure about that five minutes?

914
01:23:53,534 --> 01:23:56,036
I may have been mistaken.

915
01:23:57,996 --> 01:24:00,499
I got no more use for this guy.

916
01:24:09,133 --> 01:24:11,009
You're fired.

917
01:24:11,135 --> 01:24:13,178
I want him.

918
01:24:14,513 --> 01:24:16,557
Come on, now. Move it.

919
01:24:17,558 --> 01:24:21,687
- Don't worry. I'll bail you out.
- Don't. I'm gonna stay in prison tonight.

920
01:24:21,812 --> 01:24:25,607
Maybe I can finally get some sleep.
I'm doin' good, huh?

921
01:24:43,876 --> 01:24:46,086
Hey, how ya doin'?

922
01:24:46,837 --> 01:24:50,215
Hey, Mr Crane. What are these pictures of?

923
01:24:52,176 --> 01:24:55,596
- My house and stuff.
- House and stuff.

924
01:24:55,721 --> 01:25:00,225
And what is this brown stuff
on the windows?

925
01:25:01,185 --> 01:25:03,395
- Dirt.
- Dirt.

926
01:25:04,605 --> 01:25:09,860
What is this rusty, dusty,
dirty-lookin' thing over your window?

927
01:25:11,987 --> 01:25:14,531
- It's a screen.
- A screen.

928
01:25:14,656 --> 01:25:16,492
It's a screen.

929
01:25:17,117 --> 01:25:22,206
What are these really big things
right in the middle of your view

930
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:25,501
from the window of your kitchen
to the Sac-o-Suds?

931
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:28,795
What do we call these big things?

932
01:25:31,048 --> 01:25:33,175
- Trees?
- Trees, that's right.

933
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,969
Don't be afraid.
Just shout 'em out when you know.

934
01:25:36,094 --> 01:25:40,599
Now, what are these thousands
of little things that are on trees?

935
01:25:42,726 --> 01:25:44,770
- Leaves.
- Leaves.

936
01:25:46,897 --> 01:25:49,983
And these bushy things between the trees?

937
01:25:50,567 --> 01:25:52,069
- Bushes.
- Bushes.

938
01:25:52,194 --> 01:25:54,488
So, Mr Crane.

939
01:25:54,613 --> 01:26:00,410
You could positively identify the defendants
for a moment of two seconds

940
01:26:00,911 --> 01:26:06,708
looking through this dirty window,
this crud-covered screen,

941
01:26:07,376 --> 01:26:13,423
these trees with all these leaves on them,
and I don't know how many bushes.

942
01:26:18,762 --> 01:26:22,516
- Looks like five.
- Don't forget this one and this one.

943
01:26:22,766 --> 01:26:26,145
- Seven bushes.
- Seven bushes. So, what do you think?

944
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:29,982
Is it possible you just saw
two guys in a green convertible,

945
01:26:30,107 --> 01:26:34,194
and not necessarily
these two particular guys?

946
01:26:35,988 --> 01:26:39,366
- I suppose.
- I'm finished with this guy.

947
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:52,004
Mrs Riley, when you saw the defendants,
were you wearing your glasses?

948
01:26:52,129 --> 01:26:54,673
Yes, I was.

949
01:26:54,798 --> 01:26:56,967
Over here, dear.

950
01:26:58,677 --> 01:27:02,514
Would you mind puttin'
your glasses on for us, please?

951
01:27:07,436 --> 01:27:11,940
- Whoa. How long you been wearin' glasses?
- Since I was six.

952
01:27:12,316 --> 01:27:17,279
- Have they always been that thick?
- Oh, no. They got thicker over the years.

953
01:27:17,404 --> 01:27:22,367
So as your eyes have gotten more and more
outta whack as you've gotten older,

954
01:27:22,493 --> 01:27:25,871
how many different levels
of thickness have you gone through?

955
01:27:25,996 --> 01:27:31,376
I don't know.
Over sixty years, maybe ten times.

956
01:27:31,793 --> 01:27:37,299
- Maybe you're ready for a thicker set.
- Oh, no. No, I think they OK.

957
01:27:37,424 --> 01:27:40,219
Maybe we should make sure.
Let's check it out.

958
01:27:45,557 --> 01:27:51,688
Now, how far were the defendants from you
when you saw them entering the Sac-o-Suds?

959
01:27:51,814 --> 01:27:55,067
- About 100 feet.
- 100 feet.

960
01:27:55,192 --> 01:27:57,694
Would you hold this, please? Thank you.

961
01:28:01,114 --> 01:28:04,660
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.

962
01:28:07,996 --> 01:28:13,335
OK. This is 50 feet. That's half the distance.

963
01:28:13,961 --> 01:28:17,131
How many fingers am I holding up?

964
01:28:17,965 --> 01:28:22,094
Let the records show that
counsel is holding up two fingers.

965
01:28:22,219 --> 01:28:24,429
Your Honour, please, huh?

966
01:28:26,431 --> 01:28:28,142
Sorry.

967
01:28:28,267 --> 01:28:32,980
Now, Mrs Riley, and only Mrs Riley,

968
01:28:34,898 --> 01:28:37,776
how many fingers am I holding up now?

969
01:28:43,532 --> 01:28:45,576
Four.

970
01:28:50,414 --> 01:28:52,708
What do you think now, dear?

971
01:28:54,334 --> 01:28:57,504
I'm thinkin' of gettin' thicker glasses.

972
01:28:57,629 --> 01:28:59,673
Thank you.

973
01:29:08,765 --> 01:29:11,185
- Hello.
- You did good out there today, Yankee.

974
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:15,939
I like the competition. You like competition,
too? Makes things kinda fun, doesn't it?

975
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:20,194
- I'm enjoying myself so far.
- I got a little surprise for you tomorrow.

976
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:24,156
What's that? You know you have
to disclose all your evidence to me.

977
01:29:24,281 --> 01:29:29,703
I just got it myself. I'll disclose it first thing
in the morning. Judge gonna have to admit it.

978
01:29:30,579 --> 01:29:34,041
- Should I be worried?
- I sure would be if I were you.

979
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:45,803
Honey, where did you read
about all that disclosure shit?

980
01:29:45,928 --> 01:29:48,388
Let me show you. Why?

981
01:29:48,972 --> 01:29:53,769
I'm a special automotive instructor
of forensic studies for the FBl.

982
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:57,064
- How long you been in that position?
- 18 years.

983
01:29:57,189 --> 01:30:00,651
Your Honour.
May we approach the bench, please?

984
01:30:00,776 --> 01:30:02,820
If you wish.

985
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:12,704
I object to this witness
being called at this time.

986
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:18,502
We've been given no prior notice he'd testify,
no discovery of any tests he's conducted,

987
01:30:18,627 --> 01:30:23,590
and the defence is entitled to advance
notice of any witness who will testify,

988
01:30:23,715 --> 01:30:29,221
particularly those giving scientific evidence,
so we can prepare for cross-examination,

989
01:30:29,346 --> 01:30:34,101
and to give the defence an opportunity to
have reports reviewed by a defence expert

990
01:30:34,226 --> 01:30:39,356
who might then be in a position to
contradict the veracity of his conclusions.

991
01:30:40,816 --> 01:30:42,734
- Mr Gambini.
- Yes, sir.

992
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:46,530
That is a lucid, intelligent,
well thought-out objection.

993
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:50,117
- Thank you, Your Honour.
- Overruled.

994
01:30:58,625 --> 01:31:00,669
Now, Mr Wilbur.

995
01:31:02,504 --> 01:31:07,426
These are photos of tyres
belonging to the defendants' car.

996
01:31:07,551 --> 01:31:13,223
And these are photos of the tyre marks left
by the assailants' car as it fled the store.

997
01:31:13,348 --> 01:31:16,602
- Now, are you familiar with these?
- Yes, I am.

998
01:31:16,727 --> 01:31:19,271
Could you elaborate, please, sir?

999
01:31:19,396 --> 01:31:23,025
We compared the tyre marks
outside the convenience store

1000
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:26,278
with the rear tyres of the defendants' car.

1001
01:31:26,403 --> 01:31:29,698
They're the same model and size tyre.

1002
01:31:29,823 --> 01:31:33,827
Michelin model XGV,
size 75R, 14-inch wheel.

1003
01:31:34,161 --> 01:31:36,997
They're the same size and model tyre.

1004
01:31:38,165 --> 01:31:40,167
- Anything else, sir?
- Yes, indeed.

1005
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:44,755
The car, leaving the convenience store,
spun its rear tyres dramatically

1006
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,090
and left a residue of rubber on the asphalt.

1007
01:31:47,216 --> 01:31:50,511
Now, I took a sample of that rubber
and analysed it.

1008
01:31:50,636 --> 01:31:52,679
I also took a sample of the rubber

1009
01:31:52,805 --> 01:31:56,767
from the rear tyres of the defendants'
Buick and analysed that, too.

1010
01:31:56,892 --> 01:32:00,187
What kind of equipment
did you use to find this out?

1011
01:32:00,521 --> 01:32:02,564
I used a Hewlett-Packard 57-10A

1012
01:32:02,773 --> 01:32:07,402
dual-column gas chromatograph
with flame analysation detectors.

1013
01:32:07,528 --> 01:32:10,072
Is that thing turbocharged?

1014
01:32:10,447 --> 01:32:13,200
Only on the floor models.

1015
01:32:13,325 --> 01:32:17,329
Now, Mr Wilbur.
What was the result of your analysis?

1016
01:32:17,454 --> 01:32:22,292
The chemical composition between
the two samples was found to be identical.

1017
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:25,087
ldentical.

1018
01:32:29,967 --> 01:32:32,261
No further questions, Your Honour.

1019
01:32:33,178 --> 01:32:36,098
- Your Honour.
- Thank you, Mr Wilbur.

1020
01:32:38,225 --> 01:32:40,936
Court'll take a 60-minute recess for lunch.

1021
01:32:41,353 --> 01:32:46,608
Your Honour, I respectfully request a full
day's continuance to go over this sh... stuff.

1022
01:32:46,817 --> 01:32:49,486
- Request denied.
- Thanks a lot.

1023
01:32:49,611 --> 01:32:51,947
- And, Mr Gambini.
- Yes, sir?

1024
01:32:52,823 --> 01:32:55,659
I'd like to speak to you in my chambers.

1025
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:58,370
- You're a dead man.
- I'm a dead man?

1026
01:32:58,495 --> 01:33:02,416
I faxed the clerk of New York and asked
him what he knew about Jerry Gallo.

1027
01:33:02,541 --> 01:33:04,585
You wanna know what he replied?

1028
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:07,212
- Did you say "Jerry Gallo"?
- Yes, I did.

1029
01:33:07,337 --> 01:33:09,381
- Gallo with a G?
- That's right.

1030
01:33:09,506 --> 01:33:11,842
Jerry Gallo's dead.

1031
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:15,554
- I'm aware of that.
- Well, I'm not Jerry Gallo.

1032
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:19,558
I'm Jerry Callo. C-A-L-L-O.

1033
01:33:25,856 --> 01:33:27,900
All right.

1034
01:33:29,026 --> 01:33:31,069
All right.

1035
01:33:36,116 --> 01:33:39,244
Let's get this cleared up right now.

1036
01:33:47,503 --> 01:33:49,922
Hello. This is Judge Chamberlain Haller.

1037
01:33:50,047 --> 01:33:52,424
Can I speak to the clerk?

1038
01:33:53,926 --> 01:33:56,053
OK. I'll be here.

1039
01:33:57,471 --> 01:34:00,224
He's gonna call back after three.

1040
01:34:00,349 --> 01:34:03,018
That gives you a stay of execution.

1041
01:34:03,894 --> 01:34:08,649
Unless by some miracle you happen
to win this case in the next 90 minutes.

1042
01:34:11,819 --> 01:34:14,112
Why don't you go to lunch?

1043
01:34:27,543 --> 01:34:29,795
Thanks.

1044
01:34:37,803 --> 01:34:40,514
- I got my pictures back.
- Good.

1045
01:34:41,682 --> 01:34:44,017
What'd the judge say?

1046
01:34:44,143 --> 01:34:47,479
He said he found out that Gallo is dead.

1047
01:34:48,438 --> 01:34:50,983
He found out. What'd he say?

1048
01:34:52,442 --> 01:34:57,030
Lisa, I'm tryin' to think about
the case now, OK? I'm sorry.

1049
01:35:00,033 --> 01:35:02,369
- Can I help?
- "Can I help?"

1050
01:35:02,494 --> 01:35:05,706
No, you can't help.
I wish you could, but you can't.

1051
01:35:09,168 --> 01:35:12,421
OK, you're lookin' at me.
What is that look supposed to mean?

1052
01:35:12,546 --> 01:35:16,842
I'm a piece of shit cos I can't
figure out a way for you to help?

1053
01:35:19,261 --> 01:35:22,347
OK, you're helpin'. I'll use your pictures.

1054
01:35:23,474 --> 01:35:26,059
These are gonna...
I'm sorry. These are gonna be a help.

1055
01:35:26,185 --> 01:35:28,854
I should have looked
at these pictures before.

1056
01:35:28,979 --> 01:35:34,067
I like this. This is our first hotel room, right?
That'll intimidate Trotter.

1057
01:35:34,193 --> 01:35:36,153
Here's one of me from behind.

1058
01:35:36,278 --> 01:35:39,865
I didn't think I could feel worse
than I did a second ago. Thank you.

1059
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:44,203
Here's a good one of the tyre marks.
Could we get any farther away?

1060
01:35:44,328 --> 01:35:46,747
Where'd you shoot this from? Up in a tree?

1061
01:35:46,872 --> 01:35:49,166
What's this over here?

1062
01:35:51,043 --> 01:35:54,046
It's dog shit. Dog shit. That's great.

1063
01:35:54,171 --> 01:35:56,924
Dog shit. What a clue.
Why didn't I think of that?

1064
01:35:57,049 --> 01:36:01,762
Here's one of me reading. I should've asked
you a long time ago for these pictures.

1065
01:36:01,887 --> 01:36:04,556
Holy shit. You got it, honey.

1066
01:36:04,681 --> 01:36:08,977
You did it. The case cracker.
Me in the shower.

1067
01:36:09,228 --> 01:36:11,480
I love this. That's it.

1068
01:36:11,605 --> 01:36:14,733
That is it. I'm outta here.

1069
01:36:17,611 --> 01:36:19,655
Lisa.

1070
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:26,620
I'm sorry.

1071
01:36:26,995 --> 01:36:28,580
Fuck.

1072
01:36:43,178 --> 01:36:45,305
I know I'm missin' somethin'.

1073
01:37:04,783 --> 01:37:06,952
Did you find anything?

1074
01:37:07,077 --> 01:37:09,121
Very, very little.

1075
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,291
- Something?
- Nothin'.

1076
01:37:16,128 --> 01:37:24,803
Is it possible that two separate cars could
be driving on Michelin model XGV 75R-14s?

1077
01:37:25,554 --> 01:37:28,390
- Of course.
- Let me ask you this.

1078
01:37:28,515 --> 01:37:33,562
What's the best-selling single model tyre
being sold in the United States today?

1079
01:37:34,771 --> 01:37:36,648
The Michelin XGV.

1080
01:37:36,773 --> 01:37:40,277
- And what's the most popular size?
- 75R-14.

1081
01:37:40,777 --> 01:37:43,739
The same size as on the defendants' car.

1082
01:37:44,406 --> 01:37:48,410
But two faded green
1964 Buick Skylark convertibles?

1083
01:37:48,535 --> 01:37:51,872
Excuse me. What I'm askin' you

1084
01:37:51,997 --> 01:37:59,087
is if the most popular size of the most
popular tyre is on the defendants' car?

1085
01:37:59,588 --> 01:38:02,591
Well, yeah.

1086
01:38:04,927 --> 01:38:06,553
Yes.

1087
01:38:07,179 --> 01:38:09,223
Thank you.

1088
01:38:10,182 --> 01:38:12,559
No further questions.

1089
01:38:14,019 --> 01:38:16,563
The witness can stand down.

1090
01:38:17,356 --> 01:38:19,107
Counsel.

1091
01:38:19,942 --> 01:38:22,778
Yeah. Prosecution rests.

1092
01:38:26,615 --> 01:38:29,827
Mr Gambini. Your first witness.

1093
01:38:43,882 --> 01:38:47,136
I will ask you one more time,
and one more time only.

1094
01:38:47,261 --> 01:38:50,514
- If I ask you again...
- Your Honour...

1095
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:53,725
Please, can I have a five-minute recess?

1096
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:59,189
- My next witness is not in the courtroom.
- Three minutes. No more.

1097
01:39:11,994 --> 01:39:15,080
Sheriff, do me a favour. Please trace this.

1098
01:39:15,205 --> 01:39:20,752
- It's not my job. Do your own investigating.
- Please. I only have three minutes.

1099
01:39:26,383 --> 01:39:30,053
Lisa. Lisa, please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, OK?

1100
01:39:30,179 --> 01:39:33,140
I need you in the courtroom,
and I need the phone.

1101
01:39:33,265 --> 01:39:37,519
Honey, come on. Stop it. I need the phone.
We have to make up. Let's make up.

1102
01:39:37,644 --> 01:39:40,564
We gotta go back inside.
Everybody's waitin' for us.

1103
01:39:40,689 --> 01:39:42,733
- We don't have a lot of time.
- Shut up.

1104
01:39:42,858 --> 01:39:45,110
- Gimme this.
- Fuck you.

1105
01:39:45,235 --> 01:39:47,446
What is it with you with that mouth?

1106
01:39:47,571 --> 01:39:51,825
Mr Gambini. Tell me why.

1107
01:39:53,702 --> 01:39:57,831
- Lisa, I need your help.
- I don't give a shit. Leave me alone.

1108
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:00,793
Come on, I found it.

1109
01:40:06,256 --> 01:40:10,427
Your Honour, the defence calls as
its first witness Miss Mona Lisa Vito.

1110
01:40:10,552 --> 01:40:14,014
I object, Your Honour.
This person is not on the witness list.

1111
01:40:14,264 --> 01:40:16,683
This witness is a automobile expert

1112
01:40:16,809 --> 01:40:20,646
and is being called to rebut
the testimony of George Wilbur.

1113
01:40:21,814 --> 01:40:26,777
Your Honour, would you instruct the bailiff
to escort Miss Vito to the witness stand?

1114
01:40:40,415 --> 01:40:43,418
Hold up your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth,

1115
01:40:43,627 --> 01:40:46,839
- the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
- Yeah.

1116
01:40:52,219 --> 01:40:59,143
Miss Vito. You're supposed to be some kinda
expert in automobiles. Is that correct?

1117
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:04,690
Is that correct?

1118
01:41:06,483 --> 01:41:10,571
- Will you please answer the counsel?
- No. I hate him.

1119
01:41:10,696 --> 01:41:14,241
Your Honour, may I treat Miss Vito
as a hostile witness?

1120
01:41:14,366 --> 01:41:17,870
You think I'm hostile now,
wait till you see me tonight.

1121
01:41:17,995 --> 01:41:21,540
- Do you two know each other?
- Yeah, she's my fiancee.

1122
01:41:21,665 --> 01:41:24,501
Well, that would certainly
explain the hostility.

1123
01:41:24,626 --> 01:41:27,379
I object to this witness. lmproper foundation.

1124
01:41:27,504 --> 01:41:30,215
I'm not aware of this person's qualifications.

1125
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:36,138
I'd like to voir dire this witness
as to the extent of her expertise.

1126
01:41:37,181 --> 01:41:39,349
Granted.

1127
01:41:39,475 --> 01:41:41,935
Mr Trotter, you may proceed.

1128
01:41:44,313 --> 01:41:47,524
Miss Vito, what's your current profession?

1129
01:41:47,649 --> 01:41:51,361
- I'm an out-of-work hairdresser.
- Out-of-work hairdresser.

1130
01:41:51,487 --> 01:41:55,407
Now, in what way does that qualify
you as an expert in automobiles?

1131
01:41:55,532 --> 01:41:59,036
- It doesn't.
- Well, in what way are you qualified?

1132
01:41:59,786 --> 01:42:02,498
Well, my father was a mechanic.

1133
01:42:02,623 --> 01:42:06,668
His father was a mechanic.
My mother's father was a mechanic.

1134
01:42:06,794 --> 01:42:10,380
My three brothers are mechanics.
Four uncles on my father's side...

1135
01:42:10,506 --> 01:42:13,592
Miss Vito, your family's obviously qualified.

1136
01:42:13,717 --> 01:42:17,304
But, have you
ever worked as a mechanic?

1137
01:42:17,429 --> 01:42:21,266
- Yeah. In my father's garage, yeah.
- As a mechanic?

1138
01:42:24,895 --> 01:42:27,856
What'd you do in your father's garage?

1139
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:34,404
Tune-ups, oil changes, brake relining,
engine rebuilds, rebuilds on trannies...

1140
01:42:34,530 --> 01:42:40,911
OK. OK. But does being an ex-mechanic
qualify you as being expert on tyre marks?

1141
01:42:41,036 --> 01:42:43,831
No. Thank you. Goodbye.

1142
01:42:43,956 --> 01:42:47,417
Sit down and stay there
until you're told to leave.

1143
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:54,925
Your Honour. Miss Vito's expertise
is in general automotive knowledge.

1144
01:42:55,425 --> 01:42:58,679
It is in this area
that her testimony will be applicable.

1145
01:42:58,804 --> 01:43:02,141
Now, if Mr Trotter wishes
to voir dire the witness

1146
01:43:02,432 --> 01:43:05,269
as to the extent of her expertise in this area,

1147
01:43:05,519 --> 01:43:09,857
I'm sure he's gonna be more than satisfied.

1148
01:43:11,275 --> 01:43:12,276
OK.

1149
01:43:14,444 --> 01:43:16,864
All right. All right.

1150
01:43:16,989 --> 01:43:19,658
Now, Miss Vito.

1151
01:43:20,367 --> 01:43:23,912
Being an expert on
general automotive knowledge,

1152
01:43:25,455 --> 01:43:28,000
can you tell me

1153
01:43:28,125 --> 01:43:33,672
what would the correct ignition
timing be on a 1955 Bel Air Chevrolet,

1154
01:43:33,797 --> 01:43:39,136
with a 327 cubic-inch engine,
and a four-barrel carburettor?

1155
01:43:39,261 --> 01:43:43,098
- That's a bullshit question.
- Does that mean that you can't answer it?

1156
01:43:43,223 --> 01:43:45,434
It's impossible to answer.

1157
01:43:45,559 --> 01:43:49,563
- Because you don't know the answer.
- Nobody could answer that question.

1158
01:43:49,688 --> 01:43:54,735
Your Honour, I move to disqualify
Miss Vito as a expert witness.

1159
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:58,530
- Can you answer the question?
- No. It is a trick question.

1160
01:43:58,947 --> 01:44:00,991
Why is it a trick question?

1161
01:44:01,575 --> 01:44:04,995
- Watch this.
- Cos Chevy didn't make a 327 in '55.

1162
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:07,331
The 327 didn't come out till '62.

1163
01:44:07,456 --> 01:44:11,084
And it wasn't offered in the Bel Air
with a four-barrel carb till '64.

1164
01:44:11,210 --> 01:44:14,713
However, in 1964 the correct ignition timing

1165
01:44:14,838 --> 01:44:17,508
would be four degrees
before top, dead centre.

1166
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:21,470
Well...

1167
01:44:25,474 --> 01:44:27,935
She's acceptable, Your Honour.

1168
01:44:30,813 --> 01:44:36,693
Your Honour, this is a picture taken
by my fiancee outside the Sac-o-Suds.

1169
01:44:36,819 --> 01:44:39,154
Can we agree on this?

1170
01:44:39,947 --> 01:44:42,199
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1171
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:47,246
I'd like to submit this picture
of the tyre tracks as evidence.

1172
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:50,124
Mr Trotter.

1173
01:44:51,333 --> 01:44:53,794
No objection, Your Honour.

1174
01:44:59,591 --> 01:45:03,220
- Miss Vito. Did you take this picture?
- You know I did.

1175
01:45:03,345 --> 01:45:06,932
- And what is this picture of?
- You know what it's of.

1176
01:45:07,057 --> 01:45:11,937
Miss Vito, it has been
argued by me, the defence,

1177
01:45:12,062 --> 01:45:17,025
that two sets of guys met up
at the Sac-o-Suds, at the same time,

1178
01:45:17,151 --> 01:45:23,949
driving identical metallic mint-green
1964 Buick Skylark convertibles.

1179
01:45:24,533 --> 01:45:28,036
Now, can you tell us,
by what you see in this picture,

1180
01:45:28,162 --> 01:45:30,873
if the defence's case holds water?

1181
01:45:39,339 --> 01:45:42,676
Miss Vito. Please answer the question.

1182
01:45:42,801 --> 01:45:45,888
Does the defence's case hold water?

1183
01:45:51,226 --> 01:45:53,187
No.

1184
01:45:53,312 --> 01:45:56,190
The defence is wrong.

1185
01:45:58,859 --> 01:46:03,155
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

1186
01:46:03,489 --> 01:46:05,616
How could you be so sure?

1187
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:11,163
Because there is no way that these
tyre marks were made by a '64 Buick Skylark.

1188
01:46:11,288 --> 01:46:15,584
These marks were made
by a 1963 Pontiac Tempest.

1189
01:46:15,709 --> 01:46:19,963
Objection. Can we clarify whether
the witness is stating opinion or fact?

1190
01:46:20,088 --> 01:46:22,758
- This is your opinion?
- It's a fact.

1191
01:46:22,883 --> 01:46:27,513
I find it hard to believe
that this kind of information

1192
01:46:27,638 --> 01:46:31,099
could be ascertained
simply by looking at a picture.

1193
01:46:31,558 --> 01:46:33,477
Would you like me to explain?

1194
01:46:33,602 --> 01:46:37,481
- I would love to hear this.
- So would l.

1195
01:46:37,856 --> 01:46:42,778
The car that made these two equal-length
tyre marks had positraction.

1196
01:46:42,903 --> 01:46:49,117
Can't make those marks without positraction,
which was not available on the '64 Skylark.

1197
01:46:49,243 --> 01:46:54,123
- And why not? What is positraction?
- It's a limited slip differential

1198
01:46:54,248 --> 01:46:58,210
which distributes power equally
to both the right and left tyres.

1199
01:46:58,335 --> 01:47:01,213
The '64 Skylark had a regular differential

1200
01:47:01,338 --> 01:47:04,049
which, anyone who's been
stuck in the mud knows,

1201
01:47:04,174 --> 01:47:08,095
you step on the gas, one tyre spins,
the other does nothin'.

1202
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:10,180
That's right.

1203
01:47:10,305 --> 01:47:12,099
- Is that it?
- No. There's more.

1204
01:47:12,224 --> 01:47:17,312
When the left tyre mark goes up on the kerb
and the right tyre stays flat and even...

1205
01:47:17,437 --> 01:47:20,732
Well, the '64 Skylark had a solid rear axle,

1206
01:47:20,941 --> 01:47:26,363
so, when the left tyre goes up on the kerb,
the right tyre tilts and rides along its edge.

1207
01:47:26,488 --> 01:47:29,741
But that didn't happen here.
The tyre mark stayed flat and even.

1208
01:47:29,867 --> 01:47:32,578
This car had an independent rear suspension.

1209
01:47:33,245 --> 01:47:38,917
Now, in the '60s there were only two other
cars made in America that had positraction

1210
01:47:39,042 --> 01:47:42,921
and independent rear suspension,
and enough power to make these marks.

1211
01:47:43,046 --> 01:47:47,885
One was the Corvette, which could never
be confused with the Buick Skylark.

1212
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:52,306
The other had the same body length,
height, width, weight,

1213
01:47:52,431 --> 01:47:55,767
wheel base and wheel track
as the '64 Skylark,

1214
01:47:55,893 --> 01:47:59,563
and that was the 1963 Pontiac Tempest.

1215
01:47:59,688 --> 01:48:04,234
And because both cars were made by GM,

1216
01:48:04,359 --> 01:48:09,573
were both cars available
in metallic mint-green paint?

1217
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:12,993
- They were.
- Thank you, Miss Vito.

1218
01:48:13,118 --> 01:48:16,622
No more questions.
Thank you very, very much.

1219
01:48:16,747 --> 01:48:21,460
You've been a lovely, lovely witness.

1220
01:48:33,639 --> 01:48:37,184
Mr Trotter, would you like
to question Miss Vito?

1221
01:48:40,187 --> 01:48:42,356
Mr Trotter.

1222
01:48:51,532 --> 01:48:54,451
No. No, Your Honour. No further questions.

1223
01:48:54,576 --> 01:48:58,580
In that case, Your Honour,
I'd like to recall George Wilbur.

1224
01:49:00,833 --> 01:49:03,502
Miss Vito, you can stand down.

1225
01:49:11,593 --> 01:49:14,346
You realise you're still under oath.

1226
01:49:14,471 --> 01:49:16,932
Yes, Your Honour.

1227
01:49:17,057 --> 01:49:21,436
Mr Wilbur, how'd you like
Miss Vito's testimony?

1228
01:49:22,271 --> 01:49:24,356
Very impressive.

1229
01:49:24,481 --> 01:49:26,525
She's cute too, huh?

1230
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:29,236
Yes, very.

1231
01:49:29,361 --> 01:49:32,990
- Mr Gambini.
- Sorry, Your Honour.

1232
01:49:33,115 --> 01:49:36,201
Mr Wilbur, in your expert opinion,

1233
01:49:36,577 --> 01:49:43,000
would you say that everything Miss Vito
said on the stand was 100% accurate?

1234
01:49:45,127 --> 01:49:49,339
- I'd have to say that.
- And is there any way in the world

1235
01:49:49,465 --> 01:49:53,719
the Buick that the defendants
were driving made those tyre tracks?

1236
01:49:58,223 --> 01:50:00,976
Come on. You can say. It's OK, they know.

1237
01:50:01,935 --> 01:50:04,021
Actually,

1238
01:50:04,146 --> 01:50:06,148
- no.
- No.

1239
01:50:06,273 --> 01:50:08,692
Thank you. No more questions.

1240
01:50:11,987 --> 01:50:14,656
Your Honour, I call Sheriff Farley.

1241
01:50:16,241 --> 01:50:18,994
You may stand down now, Mr Wilbur.

1242
01:50:25,083 --> 01:50:28,837
- Sheriff, you realise you're still under oath?
- Yes, sir.

1243
01:50:29,755 --> 01:50:31,799
Sheriff Farley.

1244
01:50:34,134 --> 01:50:38,055
- What'd you find out?
- On a hunch,

1245
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:43,769
I took it upon myself to check if there was
any information on a '63 Pontiac Tempest

1246
01:50:44,019 --> 01:50:46,146
stolen or abandoned recently.

1247
01:50:47,189 --> 01:50:50,025
This computer read-out
confirms that two boys,

1248
01:50:50,150 --> 01:50:53,821
who fit the defendants' description,
were arrested two days ago

1249
01:50:53,946 --> 01:50:56,615
by Sheriff Tilman in Jasper County, Georgia,

1250
01:50:56,740 --> 01:51:01,954
for driving a stolen metallic
mint-green 1963 Pontiac Tempest

1251
01:51:02,496 --> 01:51:09,795
with a white convertible top,
Michelin model XGV tyres, size 75R-14.

1252
01:51:11,964 --> 01:51:14,216
- Is that it?
- No.

1253
01:51:16,051 --> 01:51:19,972
A.357 Magnum revolver
was found in their possession.

1254
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:24,101
Sheriff Farley, just to refresh
the court's memory,

1255
01:51:24,226 --> 01:51:28,147
what calibre bullet
was used to murder Jimmy Willis?

1256
01:51:28,605 --> 01:51:32,568
- A.357 Magnum.
- The defence rests.

1257
01:51:38,866 --> 01:51:41,118
Mr Trotter.

1258
01:51:50,085 --> 01:51:54,798
Your Honour, in light of Miss Vito's
and Mr Wilbur's testimony,

1259
01:51:56,467 --> 01:51:58,969
the State'd like to dismiss all charges.

1260
01:52:05,601 --> 01:52:07,811
Order in the court.

1261
01:52:18,572 --> 01:52:20,574
Order here.

1262
01:52:33,796 --> 01:52:37,633
I have to get out of here by three.
Make sure all the bags are in the car.

1263
01:52:37,758 --> 01:52:42,763
Vinny, I'm sorry to have ever doubted you
at any time, and for this I apologise.

1264
01:52:42,888 --> 01:52:48,519
Under the circumstances... You were
great. I just want to say thank you.

1265
01:52:48,644 --> 01:52:50,771
You're welcome. I hope we can do it again.

1266
01:52:50,896 --> 01:52:53,065
- Fine job, Mr Gambini.
- Thanks.

1267
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:56,485
- Y'all come back and see us any time now.
- I'll see.

1268
01:52:56,610 --> 01:52:58,862
- Vin.
- Bill.

1269
01:53:00,864 --> 01:53:02,908
- You're welcome.
- Vin, l....

1270
01:53:04,743 --> 01:53:09,998
Listen. Take your time, pick the right words,
get back to New York, gimme a call.

1271
01:53:14,086 --> 01:53:16,588
- Vinny, you did a terrific job.
- Thanks.

1272
01:53:16,713 --> 01:53:19,424
You got an open invitation
any time you come here.

1273
01:53:19,550 --> 01:53:22,219
- We can get us a deer next time.
- OK. Thanks a lot.

1274
01:53:22,344 --> 01:53:26,473
I feel like if I don't get outta here
now, I might never be able to leave.

1275
01:53:26,598 --> 01:53:28,976
Mr Gambini.

1276
01:53:29,101 --> 01:53:32,104
I have a fax here from the clerk of New York.

1277
01:53:35,399 --> 01:53:37,484
I owe you an apology, sir.

1278
01:53:37,609 --> 01:53:40,320
I'm honoured to shake your hand.

1279
01:53:40,445 --> 01:53:42,906
"Win some, lose some."

1280
01:53:43,031 --> 01:53:47,619
Your courtroom manner may be rather
unconventional, but I gotta tell you,

1281
01:53:47,744 --> 01:53:50,205
you're one helluva trial lawyer.

1282
01:53:50,873 --> 01:53:53,667
Thank you. And you're one helluva judge.

1283
01:53:53,792 --> 01:53:55,836
Sorry.

1284
01:53:59,590 --> 01:54:01,175
Bye, now.

1285
01:54:08,474 --> 01:54:11,435
What the hell was that all about back there?

1286
01:54:12,311 --> 01:54:14,813
I had a friend send a fax to the judge,

1287
01:54:14,938 --> 01:54:20,068
confirming the very impressive
legal stature of Jerry Callo.

1288
01:54:21,195 --> 01:54:23,780
What friends you got in the clerk's office?

1289
01:54:23,906 --> 01:54:26,950
- Your friend.
- My friend?

1290
01:54:27,075 --> 01:54:29,119
Judge Malloy.

1291
01:54:31,413 --> 01:54:33,582
So what's your problem?

1292
01:54:33,707 --> 01:54:38,629
My problem is I wanted to win my first case
without any help from anybody.

1293
01:54:38,754 --> 01:54:40,881
Well, I guess that plan's moot.

1294
01:54:41,006 --> 01:54:43,050
Yeah.

1295
01:54:43,801 --> 01:54:46,094
This could be a sign of things to come.

1296
01:54:46,386 --> 01:54:50,140
You win all your cases,
but with somebody else's help, right?

1297
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:53,101
You win case after case,
and then afterwards,

1298
01:54:53,227 --> 01:54:57,815
you have to go up to somebody
and you have to say "Thank you."

1299
01:54:57,940 --> 01:55:01,193
Oh, my God. What a fuckin' nightmare.

1300
01:55:07,783 --> 01:55:10,285
I won my first case.
You know what this means.

1301
01:55:10,661 --> 01:55:15,457
- Yeah. You think I'm gonna marry you.
- You're not gonna marry me now?

1302
01:55:15,582 --> 01:55:19,461
No way. You can't win a case by
yourself. You're fuckin' useless.

1303
01:55:22,381 --> 01:55:24,716
I thought we'd get married this weekend.

1304
01:55:24,842 --> 01:55:29,555
You don't get it, do you? That is not
romantic. I want a wedding in church

1305
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:31,849
with bridesmaids and flowers.

1306
01:55:31,974 --> 01:55:35,978
How many times did you
say that spontaneous is romantic?

1307
01:55:36,103 --> 01:55:39,898
Hey, a burp is spontaneous.
A burp is not romantic.
