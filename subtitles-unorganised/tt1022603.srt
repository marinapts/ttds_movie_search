1
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,985
This is a story of boy meets girl.

2
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,743
The boy, Tom Hansen
of Margate, New Jersey,

3
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,662
grew up believing that
he'd never truly be happy...

4
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,873
until the day he met "the one."

5
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:27,007
This belief stemmed from early
exposure to sad British pop music...

6
00:01:27,196 --> 00:01:29,672
and a total misreading
of the movie The Graduate.

7
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,091
Elaine! Elaine!

8
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:35,178
The girl, Summer Finn
of Shinnecock, Michigan

9
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,513
did not share this belief.

10
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:41,142
Since the disintegration
of her parents marriage

11
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,478
she'd only loved two things.

12
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,689
The first was her long dark hair.

13
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,859
The second was how easily
she could cut it off...

14
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,903
and feel nothing.

15
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:56,282
Tom meets Summer on January 8.

16
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:00,620
He knows almost immediately
she's who he's been searching for.

17
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:05,166
This is a story of boy meets girl.

18
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,294
But you should know up front

19
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,379
this is not a love story.

20
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,514
# They made a statue of us #

21
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,936
# And put it on a mountaintop #

22
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:30,566
# Now tourists come and stare at us #

23
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,403
# Blow bubbles with their gum #

24
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,739
# Take photographs of fun #

25
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,783
# Have fun #

26
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,624
# They'll name a city after us #

27
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,380
# And later say it's all our fault #

28
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:59,387
# Then they'll give us a talking to #

29
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:03,558
# 'Cause they've got years of experience #

30
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,731
# Living in a den of thieves #

31
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:16,153
# Rummaging for answers in the pages #

32
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,201
# Living in a den of thieves #

33
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:30,710
# And it's contagious #

34
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,588
# And it's contagious ##

35
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,261
We didn't know
who else to call.

36
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,472
It's Amanda Heller
all over again.

37
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,515
You did the right thing.

38
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:31,520
Now where is he?

39
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,278
Thomas.

40
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,282
Rachel.
What are you doing here?

41
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,868
I'm here to help you.
- Help me how?

42
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,204
First' put down the plate.

43
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,666
Drink this.

44
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,127
- What is that?
- Vodka.

45
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,421
Um' does Mom know
that you're here?

46
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,008
'Cause it's probably past 10:00.
- Don't worry about it.

47
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:05,763
Just start from the beginning,
and tell us what happened.

48
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,516
Things were going so well.

49
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,613
Then what?

50
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,824
I think we should
stop seeing each other.

51
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,076
Just like that?
- Just like that.

52
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,997
- Did she say why?
- I mean' this thing- what are we doing?

53
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,165
I mean, is this normal?

54
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,210
Norm- I- I don't know. I don't care.
I'm happy. Aren't you happy?

55
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,004
You're happy?
- You're not?

56
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,923
All we do is argue.
- That is bullshit.

57
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,591
Maybe she was just
in a bad mood.

58
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,677
Yeah, maybe like
a- a hormonal thing.

59
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,388
- P.M.S?
- What do you know about P.M.S?

60
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,808
- More than you' Tom.
- Then what happened?

61
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,893
This can't come as
a total surprise to you.

62
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,396
I mean, we've been
like Sid and Nancy
for months now.

63
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,358
Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy...
seven times with a kitchen knife.

64
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:04,739
I- I mean, we have some disagreements,
but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious.

65
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,908
No. I'm Sid.

66
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,244
Oh, so I'm Nancy?

67
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,877
Let's just eat,
and we'll talk about it later.

68
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,713
Mmm. That is good.

69
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,382
I'm really glad we did this.

70
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,593
I love these pancakes.

71
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,430
What?

72
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,142
Tom, don't go.
You're still my best friend!

73
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,896
- Jesus.
- You've broken up with girls before.

74
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,564
Yes.

75
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,399
And girls have broken up
with you before.

76
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,692
This is different.
- Why?

77
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:42,818
'Cause it's Summer.

78
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,696
So you'll-you'll
meet somebody new.

79
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,783
Point is, you're
the best guy I know.
You'll get over her.

80
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,535
I think it's kind of like how they say.
There's, uh-

81
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,537
There's plenty of other
fish in the sea.

82
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,082
No.
- They- They say that.

83
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,167
Well, they're lying.

84
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,837
I don't want to get over her.

85
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,341
I want to get her back.

86
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,928
Maybe playing it safe
is the wrong approach.

87
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,930
The nuclear family is dead'

88
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,724
and we need a new holiday
that recognizes that.

89
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,810
May 21 st.

90
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,397
Other Mother's Day.

91
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,984
Thank you.

92
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,446
I'd say we've got
some potential here.
What do you think, Hansen?

93
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,366
Could you write up some
prototypes for these?

94
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,119
Uh' Mr. Vance,
there's a telephone call
for you on line three.

95
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:37,832
Oh. Thank you.
Uh' everyone, this is Summer,
my new assistant.

96
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,167
Summer just moved here from-

97
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,753
Michigan.
- Right. Michigan. Right.

98
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:45,131
Uh, Summer, everyone.

99
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,300
Everyone, Summer.
Excuse me. I have to take this.

100
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,179
It's nice to meet you all.

101
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:56,142
There's only two kinds
of people in the world.

102
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,352
There's women, and there's men.

103
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,648
Summer Finn was a woman.

104
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,402
Height, average. Weight, average.

105
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,488
Shoe size, slightly above average.

106
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,574
For all intents and purposes,

107
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,702
Summer Finn, just another girl.

108
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,704
Except she wasn't.

109
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,248
To wit, in 1998,

110
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,251
Summer quoted a song
by the Scottish band
Belle and Sebastian...

111
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,253
in her high school yearbook.

112
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,964
"Color my life
with the chaos of trouble."

113
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,924
This spike in Michigan
sales of their album...

114
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,177
The Boy with the Arab Strap...

115
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,679
continues to puzzle industry analysts.

116
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,683
Summer's employment
at the Daily Freeze
during her sophomore year...

117
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,687
coincided with an inexplicable
212% increase in revenue.

118
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,024
Every apartment Summer rented...

119
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:49,904
was offered at an average rate
of 9.2% below market value.

120
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,489
And her round-trip commute to work...

121
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:56,076
averaged 18.4 double takes per day.

122
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,913
It was a rare quality,
this "Summer effect."

123
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:03,000
Rare, and yet something
every postadoles cent male
has encountered...

124
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,002
at least once in their lives.

125
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:09,173
For Tom Hans en to find it now
in a city of 400,000 offices,

126
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:13,719
91,000 commercial buildings
and 3.8 million people-

127
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,056
Well, that could only
be explained by one thing:

128
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,099
fate.

129
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,855
Dude, I hear she's a bitch.

130
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,690
Really?

131
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,818
Yeah. Patel tried to talk
to her in the copy room.
She's totally not having it.

132
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,528
Maybe she was just in a hurry.

133
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,365
And maybe she's an uppity,
"better than everyone" superskank.

134
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,703
Damn.
I know.
She's pretty hot.

135
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,830
That sucks.
Why is it pretty girls...

136
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,333
think they can treat people like crap
and get away with it?

137
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,502
Centuries of reinforcement.

138
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,089
You know what? Screw her.
I don't care.

139
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,591
If she wants to be that way, fine.

140
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,943
# Driving in your car#

141
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,613
# Oh, please don't drop me home #

142
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,740
Smiths?

143
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,826
Hi.

144
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,831
I love the Smiths.
Sorry?

145
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,874
I said I love the Smiths.

146
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,547
You have- You have
good taste in music.

147
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,632
You like the Smiths?
- Yeah.

148
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:37,720
# To die by your side is
such a heavenly way to die #

149
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,431
I love 'em.

150
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,602
Holy shit.

151
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,361
There you go.
Have another piece.

152
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,863
Ah.
Drinks?

153
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,906
Arthur, did you get a piece?
- Thanks.

154
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,242
Want one? Yeah.

155
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,620
Want one?
- Mmm.

156
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,792
Summer, right?
- Oh. Yeah.

157
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,503
Smiths fan.
- Yeah. Tom.

158
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,922
Want some, uh, uh-

159
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,925
It's not champagne.
I don't know what it is.
- Sure.

160
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,428
So, how's it goin'?

161
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,472
Pretty good.
You just moved here, right?

162
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,806
Mm-hmm.
- When?

163
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,601
Saturday.
- Oh, wow.

164
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,103
And, uh, what brought you?

165
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,565
Boredom mostly.

166
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,193
Wanted to try something
new and exciting.
- Mmm.

167
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,071
Well, clearly you've
come to the right place.

168
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,243
So, have you
worked here long?
- About three or four years.

169
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,330
Wow. You've...

170
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,624
always wanted to write
greeting cards?

171
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,626
No, I don't even
want to do it now.

172
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,961
Well, you should
do something else then.

173
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,256
Yeah. I studied to be
an architect, actually.

174
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,343
You did? That's cool.
What happened there?

175
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,513
It didn't work out.

176
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,474
I needed a job, and here we are.

177
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,142
You any good?

178
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,604
Well, um, I wrote this one.

179
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,609
"Today you're a man.

180
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,569
Mazel tov
on your bar mitzvah."

181
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,531
It's a big seller.
I meant as an architect.

182
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,117
Yeah.

183
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,327
I doubt it.
- Well,

184
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,372
you're a perfectly adequate
greeting card writer.

185
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,166
Thank you. That was actually
my nickname in college.

186
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,168
They called me
"Perfectly Adequate" Hansen.

187
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,170
They used to call me Anal Girl.

188
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:42,177
I was very neat and organized.

189
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,475
Well, I should get back, so-
Uh-

190
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,644
All right. See you later.

191
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:40,319
I don't know, man.
I think it's official.

192
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,572
I'm in love with Summer.
I love her smile.

193
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,867
I love her hair. I love her knees.

194
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,203
I love this heart-shaped birthmark
she has on her neck.

195
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,789
I love the way she sometimes
licks her lips before she talks.

196
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,584
I love the sound of her laugh.

197
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,753
I love the way she looks
when she's sleeping.

198
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,757
# She's like the wind #

199
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,635
I love how I hear this song
every- every time I think of her.

200
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,095
I love how she makes me feel.

201
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,097
Like-

202
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,309
Like anything's possible,
or like- I don't know. Like-

203
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,812
Like life is worth it.

204
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,318
This is not good.

205
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,448
She likes Magritte and Hopper.

206
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,034
And we talked
about Bananafish
for like 20 minutes.

207
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,078
We're so compatible,
it's insane.

208
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,456
She's- well, she's not
like I thought at all.
She's amazing.

209
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,084
Oh, boy.
- What?

210
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:41,922
Just 'cause some
cute girl likes the same
bizarro crap you do,

211
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,007
that doesn't make her
your soul mate, Tom.

212
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,969
- Red team wins!
- What do you mean?

213
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,430
- It's off.
- what?

214
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,432
- Me and Summer.
- Was it ever on?

215
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,686
No, but it could have been,
in a world where
good things happen to me.

216
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,896
- Yeah, well, that's not
really where we live.
- No.

217
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,107
Lucky.

218
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,693
So, what happened?

219
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,736
All right. You ready?
- Yeah.

220
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,781
So there we are.
Nine more floors to ride,
just me and her.

221
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,866
Hey, Summer.

222
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,952
Hi.

223
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,455
How was your weekend?

224
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,457
It was good.

225
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,293
Can you believe that shit?

226
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,378
I'm sorry. what shit?

227
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:25,299
- I think I missed something.
- She said, "It was good."
Emphasis on the "good."

228
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,885
She basically said she spent
the weekend having sex with
some guy she met at the gym.

229
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,054
Skank. Whatever.
I'm over it.

230
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,974
What the hell
is wrong with you?
- She's not interested in me.

231
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,934
There's really nothing
I can do about that.

232
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,395
Just because
she said it was good?
And some other things.

233
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,689
Like, did she say, uh,
"hey" instead of "hi"?

234
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,735
I mean, 'cause you know
that that- that means
that she's a lesbian, right?

235
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,903
I gave her plenty of chances.

236
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:50,657
I'm going to the supply room.
Do you guys need anything?

237
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,410
I think you know what I need.

238
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,041
Uh, toner.

239
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,168
Okay. Sure. No problem.

240
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:14,723
# Good times for a change #

241
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,643
# See, the luck I've had #

242
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,396
# Can make a good man turn bad #

243
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:26,777
# So, please, please, please #

244
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:30,530
# Let me, let me, let me #

245
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,950
# Let me get what I want ##

246
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:38,080
Whatever, man. It's fine.
I don't need this crap really.
I just, you know-

247
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,249
I'm comfortable.
I'm unhassled.

248
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,504
People don't realize this,
but loneliness-

249
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,258
- It's underrated.
- You could just ask her out.

250
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,345
Don't be stupid.

251
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,641
Hey.

252
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:04,147
This Friday, all you can
karaoke at the Mill.
- No.

253
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,359
Come on.
They're not gonna let you
back in there after last time.

254
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,611
Ah, I wasn't that bad.

255
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,698
Dude, you threw up
on the stage, you tried to
fight the bartender...

256
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,658
and you threatened to
burn the place down.

257
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,536
But I didn't
burn the place down.
- We're not going back there, man.

258
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,206
Look. It's not like that, okay?
It's a work thing.
The whole office is going.

259
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,792
I can't go, even if I wanted-
You're not listening to me.

260
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:27,295
What?
- The whole office is going.

261
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:39,015
#Just like every cowboy #

262
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,061
# Sings a sad, sad song #

263
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:48,358
# Every rose has its thorn ##

264
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,360
Hi.
- Hi.

265
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,238
They said you weren't coming.
You asked if I was-

266
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,574
Goddamn. That song is brilliant!

267
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,659
What's up, Hansen?
Summer. Summer-

268
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,203
That's me.
Come on up.

269
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,539
You-

270
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:07,502
Okay. I'm new,
so no making fun of me.
- Whoo!

271
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,921
Thanks, chief.

272
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,965
Ah, thanks.
- Yeah, man.

273
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,258
Cheers.

274
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:20,724
# I got some troubles
but they won't last #

275
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,895
# I'm gonna lay right down
here in the grass #

276
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:28,774
# And pretty soon
all my troubles will pass #

277
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,401
# 'Cause I'm in Su-Su-Su #

278
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,403
# Su-Su-Su #

279
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,864
# Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su #

280
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,158
# Sugar Town ##

281
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,085
Like, that's what I was-
I guess.

282
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,129
Hello.
- Hi.

283
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,799
I didn't, uh- I didn't know
you were gonna join us.

284
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,051
I would have gotten you,
you know, a drink, or-

285
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,053
I'm good.
- You're good?

286
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,223
You- You were great-
great up, uh, singing.
- Thank you.

287
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,600
I wanted to sing "Born To Run,"
but they didn't have it.

288
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,644
I love "Born To Run."
- Me too.

289
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,104
Tom's from New Jersey.
- Really?

290
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,982
Yeah. I grew up there.
Uh, I lived there till I was 12.

291
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,901
I named my cat
after Springsteen.

292
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,903
No kidding.
What-what was his name?

293
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,947
Bruce.

294
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,573
Oh.
That makes sense.

295
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,245
So, do you have a boyfriend?

296
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,247
- No.
- Why not?

297
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,750
- 'Cause I don't want one.
- Come on. I don't believe that.

298
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,795
You don't believe
that a woman could enjoy
being free and independent?

299
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,839
Are you a lesbian?

300
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,049
No, I'm not a lesbian.

301
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,343
I just don't feel comfortable
being anyone's girlfriend.

302
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:42,055
I don't actually feel
comfortable being anyone's
anything, you know.

303
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,599
- I don't know what
you're talking about.
- Really?

304
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,685
Nope.

305
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,770
Okay. Let me
break it down for you.

306
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:53,024
- Break it down.
- Okay. I like being on my own.

307
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,152
Relationships are messy,
and people's feelings get hurt.

308
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,405
Who needs it? We're young.

309
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,949
We live in one of
the most beautiful
cities in the world.

310
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,285
Might as well have fun
while we can and...

311
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,704
save the serious stuff for later.

312
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:09,040
Holy shit. You're a dude.
She's a dude.

313
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:13,169
Okay. But wait, wait.
What happens if you fall in love?

314
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,213
What?

315
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,257
Well, you don't
believe that, do you?

316
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,634
It's love.
It's not Santa Claus.

317
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,636
Well, what does
that word even mean?

318
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,764
I've been in relationships,
and I don't think I've ever seen it.

319
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:28,018
Well, maybe that's-
- And most marriages end
in divorce these days.

320
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,395
Like my parents.
- Okay. Mine too, but-

321
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,189
Me thinks the lady
doth protest too much.

322
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:36,484
The lady dothn't.

323
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,613
There's no such thing as love.
It's a fantasy.

324
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,324
Well, I think you're wrong.

325
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,494
Okay. Well,

326
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,122
what is it that
I'm missing then?

327
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,627
I think you know it
when you feel it.

328
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,341
I guess we can just
agree to disagree.

329
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,762
Yeah.

330
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,473
Okay. Who's singing next?

331
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:09,267
I nominate
young Werther here.

332
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,478
I'm not nearly
drunk enough to-
Bartender.

333
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,732
Whoo! Whoo!
# outside there's a boxcar waiting #

334
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:19,986
# Outside the family stew #

335
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,323
# out by the fire breathing #
Whoo! Whoo!

336
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:27,452
# Outside we wait
till our face turns blue #

337
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,498
# I know the nervous walking #

338
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:35,543
# I know the dirty beard
ha-ha-hangs #

339
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,964
# Out by the boxcar waiting #

340
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,926
# Take me away
to nowhere plains #

341
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,972
# There is a wait so long #
# So long, so long #

342
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,809
# There is a wait so long #

343
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,769
# Here comes your man #

344
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,690
Whoo! You're good!
# Here comes your man #

345
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,237
# Here comes your man ##
Is it-

346
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,282
It's not?
No, that's not it.

347
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,284
What is that then?
I don't know. That-

348
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,578
That- That's something,
but that's not it.
- I know.

349
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:13,081
Ah, I used to
watch it every week.
- Oh. Yeah!

350
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,166
It was the best show on TV.
- I know.

351
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,460
Knight Rider? Come on.
- And the theme song is really good.

352
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,547
So good.
- This is gonna
bother me for a week.

353
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,549
Me too.

354
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:26,052
# And I'm proud to be an American #

355
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,847
# Where at least I know I'm free #

356
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,851
# And I'd like to entertain- ##

357
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,314
- You were amazing.
- I know, buddy.

358
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,316
You're amazing.

359
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,360
This was so much fun.
- Yeah.

360
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,654
You guys are so much-
- Wait! wait! Hey.

361
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,073
What's up?
- Not you.

362
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,117
You.

363
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,827
He likes you.
- Okay.

364
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,829
He likes likes you!
- Good night, McKenzie.

365
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,831
Why don't you just
tell her, Tom?
- Yeah.

366
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,667
You guys are the best!
Sorry you had to see that. He's-

367
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,961
Happens every time we come here.
He, uh- I don't know.

368
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,921
Something about
that guy and singing.

369
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,049
Is that true?
- Yeah, yeah.

370
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,177
He drinks, and he sings
and just loses his shit.

371
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,387
No, uh, not McKenzie.

372
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:11,473
Um, the other thing.

373
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,475
What thing?

374
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,561
Do you... like me?

375
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,900
Yeah.

376
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,985
Yeah, of course I like you.

377
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,946
As friends?

378
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,033
Right. As friends.

379
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,994
Just as friends?

380
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:37,499
Yeah. I mean, I- I don't know.
I hadn't really thought about, um-

381
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,876
Yes. why?

382
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,254
No reason. I just-

383
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:47,842
I think you're interesting,
and I'd like for us to be friends.

384
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,011
Is that all right?

385
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,724
Yeah. It's, um-

386
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,894
Yeah. You and me.
We should be friends.
- Mmm.

387
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,979
Okay. Good.

388
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:12,033
Well, I'm that way, so-

389
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,122
Okay. Well, good night.
- Good night.

390
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:38,101
- Hey.
- Hi.

391
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,590
So, that was fun
the other night.

392
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,881
You son of a bitch.
- Shh!

393
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,926
The same girl you've been
obsessing over for weeks now?
I've not been obsessing.

394
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,511
The girl you said was out
of your league, that you'd
never have a chance with.

395
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:56,679
That girl.
- Paul, seriously.

396
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,264
Did you bang her?
- No.

397
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,142
What, hum job? Hand job?
- Man, no.

398
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:05,730
No jobs. I'm still unemployed.
We- We kissed.

399
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,566
Level with me, man. Come on.
This is your best friend, huh?

400
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:12,111
Your best friend who tolerated
you whining about this girl
for weeks on end.

401
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,321
Paul-
- You were essentially
stalking her!

402
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,156
Paul! Shh!

403
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,746
- Hi.
- Hey.

404
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,123
I'm Summer.
- Summer.

405
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,502
I'm Paul.
- Hi, Paul. Nice to meet you.

406
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:35,260
Well, I gotta go.
I gotta do some, you know.

407
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:38,388
Yeah, man.
- Um, pretend I was never here.

408
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,224
Oh, wait! Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.
Um, if any jobs come up-

409
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,643
Thanks, Paul! See ya!

410
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,276
He's, uh, you know,
an old friend.

411
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,569
If you heard any of, um-

412
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:56,072
Heard what?
- Nothing. You wanna go?

413
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,825
Yeah. I'm stalking.
I mean, I'm starving.

414
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,665
Ah, hon?

415
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,709
Our sink is broken.

416
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:15,383
Man, all of our sinks
are broken.

417
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,726
What are we looking for again?

418
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,978
Uh, trivets.
How 'bout a fly gel?

419
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,105
No, I don't think so.

420
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:32,191
No? You don't
want a fly gel?

421
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,277
Home sweet home.

422
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:40,366
Our place really
is lovely, isn't it?

423
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:42,368
Yes.

424
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,579
Ooh! Idol's on.

425
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,630
The TV's not working.

426
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,966
Oh.

427
00:27:57,051 --> 00:28:00,762
Well, I'm famished.

428
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,764
Let's eat.

429
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,854
Mmm. Smells delicious.

430
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,941
Oh, honey, that's because
it is delicious.

431
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,070
I made it myself.

432
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,447
Bald eagle.
Your favorite.

433
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,949
Mm-hmm.

434
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,624
The sink's broken.

435
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,834
Well, that's okay, because...

436
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,506
that's why we bought a home
with two kitchens.

437
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,883
You're so smart.

438
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,302
I'll race you to the bedroom.

439
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,138
# Left behind #

440
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,225
# There goes the fear again #

441
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,979
# Let it go #

442
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,776
# There goes the fear##

443
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:05,076
Darling, I don't know
how to tell you this,

444
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,372
but... there's a Chinese family
in our bathroom.

445
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,809
This is fun.

446
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,520
You're fun.

447
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,522
Thanks.

448
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,028
Hey, um,

449
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:44,365
I just wanna tell you
that, um,

450
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,535
I'm not really looking...

451
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,247
for anything... serious.

452
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,711
Is that okay?

453
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,713
Yeah.

454
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,926
'Cause some people
kind of freak out
when they hear that.

455
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:06,512
No, not me.

456
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,973
You sure?

457
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,977
Yeah. Like, casual.
- Right? Take it slow.

458
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,021
Right.

459
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,106
No pressure.

460
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,808
Can you, uh-
Can you wait one second?

461
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:04,195
Okay. Settle.
She's just a girl.

462
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,239
Just a girl.

463
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,950
She wants to keep it casual,

464
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,536
which is why she's
in my bed right now.

465
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,247
But that's casual.
That's what casual people do.

466
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,125
That's fine. That's great.

467
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,467
Hi.
- Hi.

468
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:44,986
# What I want you've got
and it might be hard to handle #

469
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,280
# Like the flame that burns the candle #

470
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:50,449
# The candle feeds the flame #

471
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,578
# Yeah, yeah
what I've got full stock #

472
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:56,038
# of thoughts and dreams
that scatter#

473
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:59,292
# You're pullin' them all together #

474
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,795
# And I can't explain
oh, yeah #

475
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,423
# Well, well, you #
Hey.

476
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,425
# Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh #
Hello.

477
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,427
# You make my dreams come true #

478
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:12,221
# Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh #
Hi.

479
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:15,182
# Ooh-ooh #
# well, well, well, you #

480
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,019
# Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh #
# oh, yeah #

481
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:21,355
# You make my dreams come true #
Thanks.

482
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,774
# ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh #
# Yeah, oh, yeah #

483
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,276
# You #

484
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,323
# on a night when bad dreams
become a screamer#

485
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:33,409
# when they're messin'
with the dreamer#

486
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,953
# I can laugh it in the face #

487
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,290
# Twist and shout my way out #

488
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,792
# And wrap yourself around me #

489
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,754
# 'Cause I ain't the way you found me #

490
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:48,299
# And I'll never be the same
oh, yeah #

491
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,551
# Well, well, you #

492
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,348
# You make my dreams come true #

493
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:58,225
# ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh #
# whoa, yeah #

494
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,145
# Ooh-ooh #
# well, well, well, you #

495
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,939
# Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh #
# Whoo-whoo #

496
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:07,360
# You make my dreams come true #

497
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,236
# ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh #

498
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,280
# oh-oh-oh, yeah #
# Ooh-ooh #

499
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,783
# Now listen to this #

500
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:17,203
# I'm down on my daydream #

501
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:20,456
# oh, that sleepwalk
should be over by now #

502
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,458
# Oh, no #

503
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,795
# Yeah, you #

504
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,338
# Yeah ##

505
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,811
You know, I'm gonna- I'm gonna-
I'm gonna get Alfredo's number.

506
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,854
Okay.
- And I'll- And I'll bring it to you.

507
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:44,897
Okay.
- Okay?

508
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,148
Is this Solitaire?

509
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,818
So, did you get her back
yet or what?

510
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,572
Working on it.

511
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,954
Hey, maybe you should
write a book.
- What?

512
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,832
Well, you know, Henry Miller
said the best way
to get over a woman...

513
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,875
is to turn her into literature.

514
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,795
Well, that guy had
a lot more sex than me.

515
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,260
Oh, this is it! This is it!

516
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,345
So great to hear from you.

517
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,389
I can't this week, but maybe next?

518
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,599
I hope this means
you're ready to be friends.

519
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,035
Yeah, that's it. That is it.

520
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,580
Your girl is losing it.

521
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,166
Can you just be serious,
for just a second?

522
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,376
I am being totally serious.
- No, you're joking around.

523
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,129
No, I am not joking around.
"Octopus's Garden"?

524
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,840
Yes, "Octopus's Garden"
is the best Beatles song
ever recorded.

525
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,717
Why don't you just say "Piggies"?

526
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,802
Come on. I love Ringo Starr!

527
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,598
Nobody loves Ringo Starr.
- That's what I love about him.

528
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,852
No, no.

529
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:10,024
Ooh, this looks good.

530
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,401
Gets really good reviews.

531
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:20,117
You know what?
That looks pretty doable.

532
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,120
Why are you asking me now?
- Because this was your idea.

533
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,166
Put your hand there.
- Wait one second.

534
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:31,420
Okay. Three, two, one!
- One.

535
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,219
Yeah, the street level
isn't so exciting, but-

536
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:42,932
Like, if you look up-
# Sweet #

537
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:47,895
# Disposition #

538
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,148
The Fine Arts Building.

539
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:56,946
The guys who designed this,
Walker and Eisen,
are... two of my favorites.

540
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,991
# Never #
Isn't that cool?

541
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:05,746
# Too soon ##

542
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,004
This is my favorite spot.
- This is?

543
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,423
This is your favorite spot?

544
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,801
Right here.

545
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,804
How come?

546
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,015
Uh, I don't know.
It's kind of hard to explain,
I guess.

547
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,852
Well, try.

548
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,688
Um- Well, okay.

549
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:34,567
Like, that building- that's, uh-

550
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,361
That's been there since 1911.

551
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,573
And that- that's the Continental.
That's L.A.'s first skyscraper.

552
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,033
It was built in 1904.

553
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,827
What is that?

554
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,912
That?

555
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,082
That's a parking lot.
- Oh!

556
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,627
Yeah. That's-
That's also a parking lot.

557
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,381
That's, um- Yeah.

558
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,009
There's a lot of beautiful
stuff here too though.

559
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:07,141
I don't know.
I just... wish people
would notice it more.

560
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:11,145
If it were me, then, uh-

561
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,564
If it were you what?

562
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,734
I don't know. I think
I'd... make 'em notice.

563
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,070
How would you
make them notice?

564
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,160
I don't know.
There's a lot of different
stuff you could do.

565
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,704
Show me.

566
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,416
Please. I don't know
anything about architecture.

567
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:35,252
You want me to
draw you something?
- Yeah.

568
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,797
I don't have any paper.
- Well, use my arm.

569
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,968
Please, I need a tattoo.

570
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,680
Well, let's see your arm.
- That's the spirit.

571
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:53,270
Well, the buildings need
to be integrated better, so-

572
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:56,273
You could maximize
light capacity here.

573
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:22,675
It's kind of messy.

574
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,760
That's okay.

575
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:40,818
For Tom Hansen, this was the night
where everything changed.

576
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:44,238
That wall Summer
so often hid behind-

577
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,908
the wall of distance, of space, of casual-

578
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,162
that wall was slowly coming down.

579
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,958
For here was Tom, in her world,

580
00:38:56,042 --> 00:39:00,462
a place few had been invited
to see with their own eyes.

581
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,798
And here was Summer,
wanting him there.

582
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,634
Him, no one else.

583
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,886
Have you ever been
in a tornado?
- No.

584
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:11,765
It's that and
my teeth falling out.

585
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,767
I have that too!
- You do?

586
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:17,229
Yeah! It's so weird.
It's like being an old man.

587
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,065
What else do you have?

588
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,192
Um, earthquakes?

589
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,528
Really?
- No.

590
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:32,244
You know, I dream
sometimes about flying.

591
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,330
It starts out like I'm running
really, really fast.

592
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,332
I'm, like, superhuman.

593
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,711
And the terrain starts to get
really rocky and steep.

594
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,590
And then I'm running so fast
that my feet aren't even
touching the ground.

595
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:49,303
And I'm floating,
and it's like this amazing,
amazing realness.

596
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,140
I'm free. I'm safe.

597
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,060
Then I realize,

598
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,812
I'm completely alone.

599
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:04,234
And then I wake up.

600
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,320
As he listened, Tom began to realize...

601
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,823
that these weren't stories
routinely told.

602
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:13,285
These were stories
one had to earn.

603
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,371
He could feel the wall coming down.

604
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:19,750
He wondered if anyone else
had made it this far.

605
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:23,837
Which is why the next six words
changed everything.

606
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,924
I've never told anybody
that before.

607
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,013
I guess I'm not just anybody.

608
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,557
So what are you exactly?

609
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,643
I don't know.
Are you her boyfriend?

610
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,937
It's not that simple.
- Sure, it is.

611
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,147
What, like, are we going steady?
- Come on, guys.

612
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:44,858
You know, we're- we're adults.
We know how we feel.

613
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,944
We don't need
to put labels on it.

614
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,946
I mean,
"boyfriend," "girlfriend."

615
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,533
All that stuff is-
It's really juvenile.

616
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:55,077
You sound gay.
You really do.

617
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,079
Okay, first of all,

618
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:01,125
your last girlfriend
was Amy Sussman
in the seventh grade,

619
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,919
and you dated
for, like, three hours.

620
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:08,924
And you-
you've been with Robyn
since what- like 1998?

621
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,426
'97.
- '97. See-

622
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:14,304
Shoot.

623
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:18,642
I don't think the two of you
are exactly authorities
on modern relationships.

624
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,317
So, what should I do?
- You should ask her.

625
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,319
What?

626
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,030
Well, why rock the boat,
is what I'm thinking.

627
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,116
I mean,
things are going well.

628
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,743
You start putting labels on it,
that's like the kiss of death.

629
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:40,664
It's like saying, "I love you."
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

630
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,625
That's what happened
between me and Sean.

631
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,336
Who the hell's Sean?
- My boyfriend before Mark.

632
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,714
Who the- never mind.

633
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,634
So, what you're saying-
I'm saying you do
want to ask her.

634
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,846
It's obvious.
You're just afraid you'll get
an answer you don't want,

635
00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:00,017
which will shatter
all the illusions of how great
these past few months have been.

636
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,019
Now look, if it were me,

637
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,563
I'd find out now before you
show up at her place...

638
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:08,650
and, well, she's in bed
with Lars from Norway.

639
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,528
Who's Lars from Norway?

640
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,530
Just some guy
she met at the gym...

641
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:17,117
with Brad Pitt's face
and Jesus' abs.

642
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,580
Wait! No, Coach.
We're not done here.

643
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,707
Rachel!
- Look, it's easy, Tom.

644
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,792
Just don't be a pussy.

645
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,187
You okay?

646
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,398
Yeah.
- You sure?

647
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:51,109
Summer,
I gotta ask you something.

648
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,237
What?
- What are we, um-

649
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,075
What are we doing?
- I thought we were going
to the movies.

650
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,577
Yeah. Nah, I mean, like,
what are we, like-

651
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:03,288
What's going on here, with us?

652
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:05,332
I don't know.

653
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,835
Who cares?

654
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:11,964
I'm happy. Aren't you happy?
- Yeah.

655
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,966
Good.

656
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,837
London, 1964.

657
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,880
Those girls knew how to dress.

658
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:57,551
Nowadays, it's all
these giant sunglasses...

659
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,886
and tattoos.

660
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,180
It's handbags with
little dogs in them.

661
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:06,268
Who okayed this?
Some people like it.

662
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:10,063
I like how you dress.

663
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:13,692
I was thinking about
getting a butterfly tattoo
about yea big on my ankle.

664
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,777
No.

665
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,571
Oh.

666
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,906
Yo.

667
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,908
How's it going?

668
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,161
Uh, okay.

669
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,496
You live around here?

670
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,749
Um, yeah, not too far.

671
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,126
I've never
seen you here before.

672
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,337
You're not too observant.

673
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:36,423
That's funny. You're funny.

674
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:39,051
So let me buy you a drink.
- No, Thank you.

675
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,388
You with this guy?
- Hey, I'm Tom.

676
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:46,058
Whatever.
So, come on. One drink.
What are you drinking?

677
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,310
I said no, thanks.

678
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,270
You're serious? This guy?

679
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,356
Hey, buddy-
You know what?
Don't be rude.

680
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,483
I'm flattered,
but I'm not interested.

681
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:58,528
So why don't you go over there
and leave us alone? Thanks.

682
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,532
It's a free country.

683
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:14,753
I can't believe
this is your boyfriend.

684
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,762
What are you doing?

685
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,850
It was really just a crazy thing.

686
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:32,270
It happened like-
It felt like it happened
fast, but really,

687
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:35,440
it- it also felt like it
was happening really slowly,

688
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,484
like everything all was just-

689
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:41,238
I don't know. It doesn't
feel like you think it would-

690
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:44,032
Hey, what's the matter?

691
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:47,035
I just- I can't believe you.

692
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,371
You can't believe me?

693
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,165
You were so completely,
completely uncool in there.

694
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:56,336
Wait. Are you mad at me?
I just got my ass kicked for you.

695
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,713
Oh, really? Was that for me?
Was that for my benefit?

696
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:00,424
Yes, it was.

697
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,884
Okay, well, next time don't,
'cause I don't need your help.

698
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:06,430
You know what?
I'm really tired.

699
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:11,435
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

700
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,283
No. You know what?

701
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,786
I'm not going anywhere
till you tell me what's going on.

702
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:31,872
Nothing's going on.

703
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,917
We're just-

704
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:40,255
What? We're just what?

705
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:44,134
We're just friends.
- No! Don't pull that with me!

706
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,219
Don't even try to-

707
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:49,681
This is not how
you treat your friend.

708
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:53,810
Kissing in the copy room?
Holding hands in IKEA?

709
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:56,730
Shower sex? Come on!
Friends, my balls!

710
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:05,655
I like you, Tom.
I just don't want a relationship-

711
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,241
Well, you're not the only one
that gets a say in this!

712
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:11,369
I do too! And I say we're
a couple, goddamn it!

713
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,836
After you, please.

714
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,329
I shouldn't have done that.

715
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,875
Done what?
- Gotten mad at you.

716
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,877
I'm sorry.

717
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:50,969
Look, we don't have to
put a label on it.

718
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,054
That's fine. I get it.

719
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:56,224
But, you know, I just-
I need some consistency.

720
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:58,685
I know.

721
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,771
I need to know that
you're not gonna wake up
in the morning...

722
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,482
and... feel differently.

723
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:14,242
And I can't give you that.

724
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:16,244
Nobody can.

725
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:27,797
That hurt? I'm sorry.

726
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,383
No, it doesn't hurt.

727
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,802
I like you.

728
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,890
All right.

729
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,027
# You loved her
You were kissing #

730
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:53,615
Shh. well, what about you?
- Did you ever even
have a boyfriend?

731
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,617
Well, of course.
- Yeah?

732
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,661
Yeah.
Well, tell me about them.

733
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,663
No.
- Oh? why not?

734
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:02,040
Because it's not important.

735
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,626
I'm interested.

736
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,839
All right. Fine.
You want to go there?

737
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,133
Yeah. I can take it.
- Fine.

738
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,764
So-

739
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,934
Well, in high school
there was Markus.

740
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,311
Quarterback-slash-homecoming king?

741
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:25,897
No. He was a rower.

742
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:29,025
He was very hot.

743
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:34,656
For a brief time in college
there was, um- there was Charlie.

744
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,119
She was nice, but-

745
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,956
And then there was
my semester in Sienna.

746
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,041
Fernando Belardelli.

747
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,629
Also known as "The Puma."

748
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:53,174
- The Puma?
- Yeah, The Puma, 'cause, you know.

749
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,972
So-

750
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:02,308
Oh, that's it?
- The ones that lasted, yeah.

751
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,853
What happened? Why-
Why didn't they work out?

752
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:07,731
What always happens. Life.

753
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,530
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

754
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,575
No, it's not.
- It's awesome. Trust me.

755
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,577
I'm serious.

756
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,788
I'll go first.

757
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:28,209
Penis.

758
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,720
Penis.

759
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,972
Penis!
Penis!

760
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,016
Penis!
There's kids around.

761
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,477
There are no kids around.

762
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,771
Penis!
Penis!

763
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:50,023
You having fun?
- Yeah.

764
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,442
This is the kind of thing
you did with The Puma, isn't it?

765
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:55,779
Oh, we rarely left the room.

766
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,448
Penis!

767
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,742
Sorry. Tourette's.
You know how it is.
Penis!

768
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,869
She has it too. Penis!
Penis!

769
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:06,456
Shh. Everyone's
looking over here.
- I'm done. I'm done.

770
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,166
Are you done?
- I'm done.

771
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,793
You're done?
- Yeah.

772
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:12,086
This is too much.
- Unleash me. I'm done.

773
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,172
Promise?
- I promise.

774
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,550
I promise.

775
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,928
Penis!

776
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,111
It's very complex.
- Mmm.

777
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:40,240
In a way, it sort of, like,

778
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:43,117
says... so much...

779
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:45,995
by...

780
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,373
saying so little.

781
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:57,715
Do you want to go to the movies?
- Yep.

782
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,485
Suffering.

783
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,155
So much suffering.

784
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:06,075
Suffering.
Suffering.

785
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,450
T-Tom?

786
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,036
Mr. Vance would like to
see you in his office.

787
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,873
Tom.

788
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,125
Have a seat.

789
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,632
Has something happened
to you recently?

790
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,717
What do you mean?

791
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:08,262
A death in the family,
someone taken ill-
Anything like that.

792
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,264
No.

793
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,018
Look, I don't mean to pry, but...

794
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,187
does this have something to do
with Summer leaving?

795
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,440
Who?
My assistant.

796
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:23,695
Your, um-
Tom, everyone knows.

797
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,991
Never mind.

798
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:31,953
The reason I'm asking is,
lately your work performance...

799
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,706
has been... a little off.

800
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,750
I'm not following.
- Okay.

801
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:40,336
Um, here's something
that you wrote last week.

802
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:43,506
Uh, "Roses are red,
violets are blue.

803
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,842
Fuck you, whore."

804
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:48,678
Now, most shoppers
at Valentine's Day-

805
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:51,681
Mr. Vance, are you firing me?
- No. No.

806
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,809
Relax, Hansen.
You're one of the good ones.

807
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,520
Okay. Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.

808
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,605
Things have been a little difficult.

809
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,026
That's okay. I completely
understand that.

810
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:07,530
I'm just saying
that perhaps you could
channel those energies,

811
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,950
um, into something like this.

812
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,581
Funerals and sympathy.

813
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:20,043
Misery, sadness, loss of faith,

814
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:22,253
no reason to live.

815
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,839
This is perfect for you.

816
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:27,425
Uh-
- Good. okay.

817
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,927
Now back to work you go.

818
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:36,684
Thank you.

819
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,035
Hey.
- Hey.

820
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:56,788
Don't you have, like,
20 cards to write by Friday?
- Nope. All done.

821
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:59,916
Really? Can you help me?
'Cause I've run out of ways
to say "congrats."

822
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,711
Okay. I got "Good job,"
"Well done" and "Way to go."

823
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:05,421
That's it.

824
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:09,592
How 'bout, "Every day
you make me proud,

825
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,678
but today you get a card."

826
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:15,306
Shit, that's good!
- I know.

827
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,769
Have you tried "Merry"?

828
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:23,147
Wow! That's perfect! Merry!
- Wow!

829
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:26,275
We've been stuck on this
for an hour.

830
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,654
Hmm. How about...

831
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:37,036
"I love us"?

832
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,579
Aw.

833
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:42,250
I hate Summer.

834
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,377
I hate her crooked teeth.

835
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,170
I hate her 1960s haircut.

836
00:57:46,255 --> 00:57:47,964
I hate her knobby knees.

837
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:50,925
And I hate her cockroach-shaped
splotch on her neck.

838
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,928
I hate the way she smacks her lips
before she talks.

839
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,514
And I hate the way she sounds
when she laughs.

840
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,977
# She's like the wind #

841
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,062
I hate this song!

842
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:07,900
Son, you're gonna
have to exit the vehicle.

843
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:10,153
I normally don't do blind dates,

844
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:13,239
but Paul and Robyn spoke
very highly of you.

845
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:15,783
Ah.
- They said you write
greeting cards.

846
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:17,869
That's so interesting.
I wanted to write.

847
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:20,246
I actually majored
in English in college,

848
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,290
but what are you gonna do
with that degree?

849
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,542
I went to Brown.
Where did you go?
- Alison.

850
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,544
Hmm?

851
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,921
Listen, it's great to meet you,

852
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,382
and... you're a very attractive girl.

853
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:34,427
I just wanted to say up front
that this isn't-

854
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:38,014
It's not gonna go anywhere.
- Oh.

855
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:41,767
I liked this girl.
I mean, I loved her.

856
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,769
What does she do?

857
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:47,481
She took a giant shit
on my face.

858
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:50,067
Literally.
- Literally?

859
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:54,322
Not literally.
That's disgusting. Jesus.

860
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:56,616
What's the matter with you?

861
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,618
The point is,

862
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:02,079
I'm messed up. I am.

863
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:04,415
You know, on the one hand,
I want to forget her.

864
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,417
On the other hand,

865
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:10,796
I know that she's the only person
in the entire universe
that will make me happy.

866
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:12,882
Mm-hmm.
- You ever do this?

867
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:17,595
You think back on the times
you had with someone, replay it
in your head over and over again,

868
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,973
and you look for those
first signs of trouble.

869
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:25,561
There's two options really.

870
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:28,731
Either... she's an evil,

871
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:32,068
emotionless,
miserable human being,

872
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:36,239
or... she's a robot.

873
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,282
Small Wonder.
- You know, Vicki.

874
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,410
That would explain
a lot actually.
- Can I ask you a question?

875
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,997
Yeah.
- She never cheated on you?

876
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:49,418
No. Never.
- She ever take advantage
of you in any way?

877
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:51,420
No.

878
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:55,633
And she told you up front
that she didn't want a boyfriend.

879
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:59,220
Yeah.

880
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,185
I got a great idea.

881
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:10,231
# Well, some things
you can explain away #

882
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:13,734
# But my heartache's in me
every day #

883
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:17,738
# Did you stand by me
No, not at all #

884
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,740
# Di- ##

885
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:22,785
Oh, fine! Go!
That's fine. See ya.

886
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,955
Waste of time.
You don't look anything
like Summer.

887
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:31,544
Now departing on Track 2,
Pacific Surfliner.

888
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,838
Full service to Santa Barbara.

889
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,881
All aboard, please.

890
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:45,182
Hey, baby.
- Hey, you here?

891
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,268
Hell no.
- What do you mean,
"Hell no"?

892
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,979
I'm not going to that.
- Yes, you are.

893
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,023
No, man. It's gonna be
all old people.

894
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:54,483
Yeah, but you said you were going.
That's why I'm going.

895
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:57,361
And that's why
I called her last night,
told her I was sick.

896
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,906
Like a ninja.
Dude! I'm gonna- I'm not gonna
know anybody at this thing.

897
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,451
Maybe you'll meet
some hot granddaughters
or something.

898
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,578
I'm hanging up now.
Bye, baby.

899
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,040
May I have your attention, please?

900
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:11,417
Passengers boarding the train
in Los Angeles, please...

901
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,003
have your tickets out
and ready for collection.

902
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,328
Hi, Tom!

903
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,789
Hey. Summer.

904
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:53,667
I must have walked right by you.
- Yeah.

905
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,796
Well, um, what are you doing?
Are you going to Millie's?

906
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:01,175
Me too.
Cool.

907
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:05,846
- I forgot you knew her.
- Yeah, we worked together
all that time, so-

908
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,391
of course.
I love Millie.
She's the sweetest.

909
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,518
She is.

910
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:12,895
- How are you?
- I'm good.

911
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:15,231
Good. I- I wrote to you.
I never heard back, but-

912
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:17,775
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that.
I- I just, you know-

913
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:21,195
It got kind of crazy,
and the holidays came up,
so work was-

914
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,697
You still working for Vance?

915
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,574
Yeah.

916
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:29,829
Well, I was gonna go get a coffee
if you wanna-

917
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,667
"The Architecture of Happiness."

918
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:36,919
Yeah.
- That looks like a good book.

919
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,046
Yeah, it's-

920
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:43,300
Well, I don't want to bother you.
- No, no. I, um-

921
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:45,761
Yeah, let's get coffee.

922
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:47,805
After you.

923
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:55,229
# Sweet #

924
01:02:55,313 --> 01:03:02,027
# Disposition #

925
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:12,913
# Never#

926
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:18,544
# Too soon #

927
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:24,592
# A moment, a love
A dream aloud #

928
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:28,429
# A kiss, a cry
our rights, our wrongs #

929
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:31,390
You look nice.
- Thanks.

930
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:33,434
So do you.
# Sweet #

931
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:37,855
Well?
# Disposition ##

932
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,445
Penis.

933
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,990
No.

934
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,576
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

935
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,953
You may kiss the bride.

936
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,331
# Helping the kids out of their coats #

937
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:59,251
# Wait, the babies haven't been born #

938
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,297
# Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh #

939
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:06,342
# Unpacking the bags and setting up #

940
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:09,261
# And planting lilacs and buttercups #

941
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:12,097
Okay. what else you got?

942
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:14,308
Well, you snore.
- No, I don't.

943
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,644
You do.
- No, I don't.

944
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,646
Yeah.
- Well, you do too.

945
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:22,066
Oh, I definitely do.
And your feet reek.

946
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,151
That one time!
- No, every time.

947
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,195
That one time!
No.

948
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,447
That one time especially,
but every time.

949
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:32,701
And when you wake up,
your hair, it sticks up like that.

950
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,870
It's ridiculous.
- You're ridiculous.

951
01:04:34,955 --> 01:04:36,914
Your favorite Beatle is Ringo.

952
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,208
Damn right!

953
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:41,502
Ringo's the best.
- Ringo is-

954
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:44,380
Goose!
Oh! oh! oh!

955
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:48,634
Man! He's fast. Damn! All right.

956
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,719
You got me. Duck.

957
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,055
Duck.

958
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:59,103
# At last #

959
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:04,108
# My love has come along #

960
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,196
# My lonely days are over #

961
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:11,240
One, two, three.

962
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,330
# And life is like a song #

963
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,374
Wanna dance?
- Yeah.

964
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,376
Okay.

965
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,170
# Oh, at last #

966
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,177
# The skies above are blue #
Hey, I was wondering, um-

967
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:36,932
I was gonna maybe have
a party on Friday, um,

968
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:41,395
on our roof top that has,
like, a really nice garden,

969
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,480
if you want to come.

970
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,566
Yeah.
# for you are mine #

971
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,985
If you're not busy.

972
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:51,113
# At last #
I don't think I will be.

973
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:57,786
They're good, huh?
- They are good.

974
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,567
I guess I just got lucky.

975
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:30,986
Um, we met in elementary school.

976
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:34,031
In seventh grade
we had the same class schedule,

977
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:36,241
and, uh,

978
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:39,662
we just clicked, you know?

979
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:41,372
Love?

980
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,165
Shit, I don't know.

981
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:46,669
As long as she's cute
and she's willing, right?

982
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:50,255
I'm flexible on the cute, so-

983
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,966
Twenty-one years.

984
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:56,136
She's the light that guides me home.

985
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:59,306
Yes, that is from one of our cards.

986
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:01,392
No. Someone else wrote it.

987
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:03,811
Doesn't make it less true.

988
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:06,522
I think technically
the "girl of my dreams"...

989
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:11,318
would probably have, like,
a really bodacious rack, you know.

990
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:13,821
Maybe different hair.

991
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:16,365
Probably-
You know, she'd probably be
a little more into sports.

992
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,785
But, um, truthfully,

993
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,664
Robyn's- Robyn's better
than the girl of my dreams.

994
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:26,125
She's real.

995
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:43,183
# He never, ever saw it coming at all #

996
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:47,271
# Never, ever saw it coming at all #

997
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,398
Tom walked to her apartment,

998
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:52,359
intoxicated by the promise of the evening.

999
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:55,154
# It's all right
It's all right #
He believed that this time...

1000
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:58,073
his expectations would align with reality.

1001
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:00,492
# It's all right #

1002
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:11,170
# Hey, open wide
Here comes original sin #

1003
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:13,630
Hi.
- Hey.

1004
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:18,635
# Hey, open wide
Here comes original sin #
You look nice.

1005
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,387
Yeah. Thanks.

1006
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,181
I like your tie. Wow!
- Hi.

1007
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:23,891
How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

1008
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,226
Good.
# It's all right
It's all right #

1009
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:29,605
# It's all right
It's all right, it's all right #

1010
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,899
# It's all right #

1011
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:36,779
# No one's got it all #
I, um, brought you something.

1012
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:39,364
# No one's got it all #
That's so nice.

1013
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:44,620
# No one's got it all #
Thank you.

1014
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:47,372
You shouldn't have.
That's so nice.
It's the-

1015
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,374
Thank you so much.
- No problem.

1016
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,460
I'm excited to read it.
- Yeah.

1017
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,504
Come on.

1018
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:55,672
# And we're going to these meetings #

1019
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:59,718
- So, Tom, what is it that you do?
- Uh, I write greeting cards.

1020
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:02,513
Tom could be
a really great architect
if he wanted to be.

1021
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:04,765
That's unusual.

1022
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,934
I mean, what made you go
from one to the other?

1023
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:09,228
I guess I just figured,

1024
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:11,980
why make something disposable,
like a building,

1025
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:15,984
when you can make something
that lasts forever, like a greeting card?

1026
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:22,533
# It's all right
It's all right #

1027
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:25,953
# It's all right
It's all right #

1028
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:29,081
What?
# It's all right #

1029
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:32,793
# No one's got it all #
Do you guys
know each other?

1030
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:39,758
# No one's got it all #

1031
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:43,846
# Power to the people
We don't want it #

1032
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:47,140
# we want pleasure
And the TVs try to rape us #

1033
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:49,560
# And I guess that they're succeeding #

1034
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:51,645
# And we're going to these meetings #

1035
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:54,022
# But we're not doing any meeting #

1036
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,024
# And we're trying to be faithful #

1037
01:09:56,109 --> 01:10:00,070
# But we're cheating
cheating, cheating #

1038
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:18,505
# I'm the hero of the story
Don't need to be saved #

1039
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,883
# It's all right #

1040
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:24,469
# It's all right
It's all right, it's all right #

1041
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:27,264
# It's all right
It's all right #

1042
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:30,017
# It's all right
It's all right, it's all right #

1043
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:33,103
# It's all right
It's all right #

1044
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:46,450
# No one's got it all #

1045
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:48,785
# All, all #

1046
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:51,997
# All, all ##

1047
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:15,812
# Hung up and bent on a stranger #

1048
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:20,067
#Just trying to swing a full-time ride #

1049
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:23,695
# I never knew the cold hand of danger #

1050
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,615
# Till I met this one and took it inside #

1051
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,575
# Now I can't get near it #

1052
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,827
Get a room! Really.
# Don't want to hear it #

1053
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,288
# My cover's blown #

1054
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:35,874
# I walked in the rain like a drone #

1055
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:38,126
# All the way to Marquette #

1056
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:42,881
# The infinite pet #

1057
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:46,510
# Oh, no #

1058
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:50,347
# No, no, no, no, no #

1059
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,724
# Cheaper than all your threats #

1060
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:55,268
# No, no ##
Shit.

1061
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:58,063
I've been calling you
every five minutes.
Are you okay?

1062
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:00,107
I'm great.
- What happened to you?

1063
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:03,360
I don't wanna talk about it.
- You always wanna
talk about it.

1064
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,904
Not this.
- Okay. well, come on.
Let's go.

1065
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:09,241
Where are we going?
- It's Thursday!

1066
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:12,577
This one says, "Go for it!"

1067
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:15,122
And this one says,
"You can do it!"

1068
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:18,250
We have a whole line
of inspirational photographic cards...

1069
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,460
featuring Pickles, my cat.

1070
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:23,380
I think people will really enjoy them.

1071
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:26,550
- Thank you.
- Good job, Rhoda.

1072
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,677
That's inspirational stuff.

1073
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:31,346
Okay. Who's next?

1074
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,017
We haven't heard from
Sympathy in a while.

1075
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:36,768
Hansen?
- Yeah?

1076
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,604
The Winter Collection?
Do you have anything
to contribute?

1077
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,732
Uh, no.

1078
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:43,734
I really don't.

1079
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:45,861
Okay.

1080
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:48,280
We'll come back to you.
Uh, McKenzie?

1081
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:52,159
Actually, you know what?
- Yes, Tom?

1082
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:55,120
Can I say something about the cat?
- Well, okay.

1083
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,456
Yeah, uh, this is-

1084
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,583
And, Rhoda, no disrespect here,

1085
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:03,253
but, um, this is total shit.

1086
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,589
Tom!
"Go for it" and "You can do it"?

1087
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:07,799
That's not inspirational.
That's suicidal.

1088
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:10,844
If Pickles goes for it right there,
that's a dead cat.

1089
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:13,930
These are lies. we're liars.

1090
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,349
Think about it.
Why do people buy these things?

1091
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:18,769
It's not 'cause they want
to say how they feel.

1092
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:22,814
People buy cards 'cause
they can't say how they feel,
or they're afraid to.

1093
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:25,317
We provide the service
that lets them off the hook.

1094
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,945
You know what?
I say, to hell with it!
Let's level with America.

1095
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,615
At least let them speak
for themselves! Right?

1096
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:34,910
I mean, look! What- what is this?
What does it say?

1097
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,912
"Congratulations
on your new baby." Right?

1098
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:39,206
How 'bout, "Congratulations
on your new baby.

1099
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:42,542
- That's it for hanging out.
Nice knowing you."
- Sit down, Hansen.

1100
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:46,588
How 'bout this one, with all
the pretty hearts on the front?
I know where this is going. Yep!

1101
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:50,258
"Happy Valentine's Day,
sweetheart. I love you."

1102
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:53,845
That sweet? Ain't love grand?

1103
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,098
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

1104
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:58,266
What does that even mean, "love"?

1105
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:01,144
Do you know? Do you? Anybody?

1106
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:02,646
Tom.

1107
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:05,732
If somebody gave me this card,
Mr. Vance, I would eat it.

1108
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:11,947
It's- It's these cards,
and the movies, and the pop songs-

1109
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:14,616
They're to blame for all the lies...

1110
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,078
and the heartache, everything.

1111
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,914
And we're responsible.
I'm responsible.

1112
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:26,795
I think we do a bad thing here.

1113
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:30,423
People should be able
to say how they feel-
how they really feel-

1114
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:34,636
not, you know, some words
that some strangers
put in their mouths.

1115
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,222
Words like "love"...

1116
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:42,519
that don't mean anything.

1117
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:45,897
Sorry. I'm sorry. I, uh-

1118
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,443
I quit. I'm-

1119
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:53,113
There's enough bullshit
in the world without my help.

1120
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,391
All right. Next we do running drills.

1121
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,643
Hey, you're sketching again.

1122
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:25,937
Yeah, well, just doodling.

1123
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:29,733
Okay, Tom. we got 20 seconds.
Talk to me. You okay?

1124
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:32,068
Yeah, I'm good. I'm great.

1125
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:41,369
You know, my friends
are all in love with you.

1126
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:43,371
You know, it's like we said.

1127
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:46,666
Plenty of other fish in the sea.
- Thanks.

1128
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:49,002
But, uh, those are guppies.

1129
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:51,004
Yeah.

1130
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:54,382
Hey, Tom?
- Mmm.

1131
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:58,220
Look, I know you think
that she was the one,

1132
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:01,806
but I don't.

1133
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:05,143
Now, I think you're just
remembering the good stuff.

1134
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:08,230
Next time you look back, I, uh-

1135
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,815
I really think
you should look again.

1136
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:51,690
It's playing at 5:00.
Do you wanna see it?

1137
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:55,735
Um, I don't know.
We could just go back
to your place or-

1138
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,655
No, I really want to see it.
Let's go.

1139
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:21,261
# Time it was and what a time it was #

1140
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:23,263
# It was #

1141
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:28,184
# A time of innocence #

1142
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:31,313
# A time of confidences #

1143
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:34,357
You okay?
- Yeah.

1144
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:37,610
What- what is it?
The movie?

1145
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:40,447
It's nothing. I'm just-
I'm just being stupid.

1146
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:42,157
Yeah?
- Yeah.

1147
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:47,287
# Preserve your memories
They're all that's left you ##

1148
01:17:48,456 --> 01:17:50,457
It pains me we live in a world...

1149
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,625
where nobody's heard
of Spearmint.

1150
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:55,962
I've never heard of them.
- I put 'em on that mix
I made you.

1151
01:17:56,047 --> 01:17:58,340
They're track one.

1152
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,759
Oh, yeah.

1153
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:29,788
So, what do you wanna do?

1154
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:32,123
I think I'm just gonna
call it a day.

1155
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,793
You don't wanna
get some dinner?
Are you hungry?

1156
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,047
You all right?

1157
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:42,801
I'm just tired.
- Okay.

1158
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:57,440
I got it. Pancakes!

1159
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:37,021
# oh, girl, I don't know
all the reasons why #

1160
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:42,026
# I found the answer
looking in your eye #

1161
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:46,739
# I go out walking all day long #

1162
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:51,202
# Take away this lonely man
Soon he will be gone #

1163
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,621
# 'Cause I'll tell you everything #

1164
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:57,375
# About living free #

1165
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:03,298
# Yes, I can see you, girl #

1166
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:07,051
# Can you see me #

1167
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:15,518
# You don't need to know
what I do all day #

1168
01:20:15,603 --> 01:20:20,064
# It's as much as I know
watch it waste away #

1169
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:22,525
# 'Cause I'll tell you everything #

1170
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:26,696
# About living free #

1171
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:32,410
# Yes, I can see you, girl #

1172
01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:37,790
# Can you see me #

1173
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:04,234
# 'Cause I'll tell you everything #

1174
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:08,112
# About being free ##

1175
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,988
Hey, Tom.

1176
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:06,671
I thought I might see you here.

1177
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:16,723
I always loved this place,
ever since you brought me.

1178
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:19,475
So I, uh-

1179
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,894
I guess I should say
congratulations.

1180
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:25,481
Only if you mean it.

1181
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:28,359
Ah. Well, in that case-

1182
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,994
So, are you okay?

1183
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:41,122
I will be, eventually.

1184
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,583
You wanna-
- Hmm.

1185
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:49,005
I like your suit.
- Ah, thanks.

1186
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,382
You look sharp.

1187
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:54,552
So do you.
Thanks.

1188
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:57,138
I quit the office.
- You did?

1189
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:59,557
I didn't know. That's great!

1190
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:03,227
And you, um-

1191
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:06,189
you're married.

1192
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,941
Yeah. It's crazy, huh?

1193
01:23:17,368 --> 01:23:21,329
You should have told me
when we were at the-
I know.

1194
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:23,748
You know, at the wedding
when we were dancing.

1195
01:23:23,874 --> 01:23:26,292
Well, he hadn't asked me yet.
But he was in your life.

1196
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:29,128
Yeah.
- So why'd you dance with me?

1197
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,175
'Cause I wanted to.

1198
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:39,097
You just do what you want,
don't you?

1199
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:48,648
You never wanted to be
anybody's girlfriend,

1200
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:50,983
and now you're somebody's wife.

1201
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:53,152
Surprised me too.

1202
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:56,030
I don't think I'll ever
understand that.

1203
01:23:57,449 --> 01:24:00,118
I mean,
it doesn't make sense.

1204
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,579
It just happened.

1205
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:07,542
Right, but that's what
I don't understand.
What just happened?

1206
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:11,963
I just- I just woke up one day,
and I knew.

1207
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:13,965
Knew what?

1208
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,803
What I was never sure of with you.

1209
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:34,986
You know what sucks?

1210
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:38,448
Realizing that everything
you believe in is complete
and utter bullshit.

1211
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:40,533
It sucks.
- What do you mean?

1212
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:44,579
Uh, you know, destiny,
and soul mates, and true love,

1213
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:49,333
and all that childhood
fairy tale nonsense.

1214
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,711
You were right.
I- I should have listened to you.

1215
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:55,298
No.
- Yeah. what?
What are you smiling at?

1216
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,968
Tom.
- What?

1217
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:03,389
What are you looking at me
like that for?

1218
01:25:03,474 --> 01:25:06,100
Well, you know,

1219
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:08,394
I guess it's 'cause...

1220
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:11,022
I was sitting in a deli
and reading Dorian Gray

1221
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,608
and... a guy comes up to me...

1222
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:16,277
and asked me about it,

1223
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:19,363
and... now he's my husband.

1224
01:25:22,201 --> 01:25:24,660
Yeah. And... so?

1225
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:28,623
So, what if I'd gone to the movies?

1226
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:33,628
What if I had gone
somewhere else for lunch?

1227
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:37,048
What if I'd gotten there
10 minutes later?

1228
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:40,635
It was-

1229
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,054
It was meant to be.

1230
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:45,807
And I just kept thinking,

1231
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:49,560
Tom was right.
- No.

1232
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:51,729
Yeah, I did.

1233
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:54,315
I did.

1234
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:03,533
It just wasn't me
that you were right about.

1235
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:32,019
I should go.

1236
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:35,106
But I'm really happy to see
that you're doing well.

1237
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:44,574
Summer!

1238
01:26:46,577 --> 01:26:48,786
I really do hope
that you're happy.

1239
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:25,740
Most days of the year
are unremarkable.

1240
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:28,910
They begin and they end...

1241
01:27:28,994 --> 01:27:32,914
with no lasting memories
made in between.

1242
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:35,541
Most days have no impact...

1243
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:37,627
on the course of a life.

1244
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:41,505
May 23 was a Wednesday.

1245
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:02,193
Are you interviewing?
- Sorry?

1246
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:05,905
Are you interviewing
for the position?

1247
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:08,532
Oh, yeah. why? Are you?
- Yeah.

1248
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:10,534
Mm-hmm.

1249
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:12,745
My competition.

1250
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:15,498
It would appear.

1251
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:19,752
Yeah. So, a little awkward.

1252
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:21,754
Yeah.

1253
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:27,718
Well, I hope you, um,
don't get the job.

1254
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:31,305
Well, I hope you
don't get the job.

1255
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:36,268
Have I seen you before?

1256
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,354
Me? I don't think so.

1257
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:42,149
Do you ever go
to Angelus Plaza?

1258
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:45,152
Yes. That's, like,
my favorite spot in the city.

1259
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:47,196
Yeah. Okay. Except for
the parking lots, but-

1260
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,198
Yeah. I- I agree.
- Yeah, yeah.

1261
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,325
I think I've seen you there.
- Really?

1262
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:54,286
Yeah.
- I haven't seen you.

1263
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:58,666
You must not
have been looking.

1264
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,751
If Tom had learned anything,

1265
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:03,879
it was that you can't ascribe
great cosmic significance...

1266
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:06,090
to a simple earthly event.

1267
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:11,721
Coincidence.
That's all anything ever is.

1268
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:13,806
Nothing more than coincidence.

1269
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:16,225
Tom Hansen.
- Yeah.

1270
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:18,310
Come on back.
- Thank you.

1271
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:23,607
Tom had finally learned
there are no miracles.

1272
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:26,193
There's no such thing as fate.

1273
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:28,696
Nothing is meant to be.

1274
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:32,366
He knew. He was sure of it now.

1275
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:35,119
Tom was-
- Sorry. Um-

1276
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:37,413
I just left, uh-
Can I- one second.

1277
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:40,249
He was pretty sure.

1278
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:43,419
- Hey.
- You again.

1279
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:45,838
Yeah. I, uh, was just wondering...

1280
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:49,175
if maybe after this, if, um, you-

1281
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:53,721
you want to get some coffee
or something.

1282
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:55,806
Oh, I'm sorry.

1283
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:59,935
I'm sort of supposed to
meet someone after this.

1284
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,979
Okay.

1285
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:11,197
Sure.

1286
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:13,908
What's that?
Why not?

1287
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:17,244
Okay. Well, then I'll just, uh-
I'll wait for you-

1288
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:19,538
We- We'll figure it out.
We'll figure it out.

1289
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:23,834
- My name's Tom.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Autumn.

1290
01:30:39,518 --> 01:30:43,145
# She's got you high
and you don't even know yet #

1291
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:46,732
# She's got you high
and you don't even know yet #

1292
01:30:46,817 --> 01:30:50,402
# The sun's in the sky
It's warming up your bare legs #

1293
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:54,115
# And you can't deny
you're looking for the sunset #

1294
01:30:54,199 --> 01:31:01,372
# She's got you high
and you don't even know yet #

1295
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:04,917
# It's the search for the time
before it leaves without you #

1296
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:08,754
# Have you lost your mind
or has she taken all of yours too #

1297
01:31:08,839 --> 01:31:12,299
# What's this about
I figured love would shine through #

1298
01:31:12,384 --> 01:31:16,011
# We've lost romance
