I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea.

When I was a little girl,

1033
01:00:12,726 --> 01:00:15,286  
a witch cast a spell
on me.

Every night I become <i>this</i>.

This horrible, ugly beast!

1036
01:00:23,806 --> 01:00:28,641  
I was placed in a tower to await the day
my true love would rescue me.

1037
01:00:28,726 --> 01:00:31,194  
That's why I have to marry
Lord Farquaad tomorrow...

01:00:31,286 --> 01:00:34,562  
before the sun sets
and he sees me...

But, Donkey,
I'm a princess,

1044
01:00:52,246 --> 01:00:55,682

is meant to look.

I have to.
