1
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:38,682
Hello

2
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:40,939
Yes?

3
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:45,059
What?

4
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:46,983
Sir, kindly switch off your
mobile phone

5
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:49,233
Just one sec, please

6
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:01,146
Excuse me

7
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:21,645
Excuse me

8
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:22,978
Sir, please sit down

9
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:34,607
Captain, there's a
medical emergency

10
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,523
A passenger has just
fallen down in the aisle

11
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,517
Delhi, Air India 101 returning
due to medical emergency

12
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:49,395
Excuse me, sir

13
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:02,977
Hold on!

14
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:16,684
I'm fine now, thanks.
Carry on, please

15
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:19,517
Wait

16
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,229
Get the car.
- Mr. Dhillon?

17
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:54,761
Want the name tattooed?
Get the car

18
00:03:57,896 --> 00:03:58,761
To the hotel, sir?

19
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:01,640
Yes, yes, but via Vasant Vihar

20
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:05,472
Step on the gas, dude!

21
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:19,259
Yeah, Farhan?

22
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:21,884
Get ready. I'll pick you up
in five minutes

23
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:23,093
What happened?

24
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:25,137
Chatur called. Remember him?

25
00:04:25,936 --> 00:04:27,180
The 'Silencer'?

26
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:28,266
Yeah

27
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,809
He said Rancho is coming

28
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:34,933
What?

29
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:38,800
He said: Come to the campus at 8.
On the tank

30
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:41,343
Oh shucks!

31
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:42,390
Hurry.

32
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:43,722
Ok

33
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,013
Honey, I'll be back soon.
Oh, shoes

34
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:54,090
We found our buddy

35
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:57,717
What?

36
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:00,101
Tell me later, bye

37
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,434
You forgot your pants

38
00:05:12,852 --> 00:05:13,846
Now to the hotel, sir?

39
00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:17,057
Yes, but via
Imperial College of Engineering

40
00:05:17,643 --> 00:05:18,555
Ok sir

41
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:19,590
Forgot my socks

42
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:21,506
More than just your socks

43
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:23,384
Your pants

44
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:24,507
Oh no

45
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:40,222
Now get my brother
from the airport

46
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,547
Same last name: Dhillon

47
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:45,304
This is Dhillon.
Where's my cab? On the runway?

48
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:06,672
Hey Rancho

49
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:08,467
Hey Chatur, where's Rancho?

50
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,425
Rancho

51
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:12,255
Where's Rancho?

52
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,964
Welcome, idiots

53
00:06:19,474 --> 00:06:20,671
Some 'madeira' for you?

54
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:25,429
The same rum you
guzzled those days

55
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:27,343
Have a drink

56
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:29,212
Where is Rancho?

57
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:33,011
Patience. First look at this

58
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:37,423
Don't eye my wife. Check out
the mansion behind, idiots

59
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,679
$ 3.5 million

60
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:42,802
Swimming pool: heated.

61
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:46,092
Living room: maple wood flooring

62
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:49,962
My new Lambhorghini 6496 cc -

63
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:51,758
very fast

64
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,921
Why're you showing us all this?

65
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:55,462
Forgot?

66
00:06:58,721 --> 00:06:59,586
What's this?

67
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,010
'5th September'. Today's date

68
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:21,629
I challenge you

69
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:24,049
We'll meet again after ten years

70
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:26,419
Same day. Same place

71
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,672
We'll see who's more successful

72
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:34,752
Have the balls? C'mon, bet;

73
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:40,424
Remember? I'd challenged
that idiot right here

74
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:44,045
I kept my promise. I'm back

75
00:07:44,886 --> 00:07:48,832
Jackass; I aborted a flight,
he forgot his pants

76
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:50,041
all to meet Rancho

77
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:53,089
5 years we've searched.
Don't know if he's alive

78
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,885
and you think he'll show up
for your silly bet

79
00:07:56,094 --> 00:08:00,218
I know he won't show up

80
00:08:00,886 --> 00:08:02,710
You gonna break his jaw
or should I

81
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,920
So why'd you call us here?

82
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,296
To meet Rancho

83
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:11,842
Come and see where I've reached
and where he rots

84
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,384
So you know where Rancho is?

85
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,551
Yes

86
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:18,923
Where?

87
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:21,966
He is in Shimla

88
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:33,419
Free as the wind was he

89
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:40,259
Like a soaring kite was he

90
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:48,248
Where did he go... let's find him

91
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:06,457
Free as the wind was he

92
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:11,671
Like a soaring kite was he

93
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:17,170
Where did he go... let's find him

94
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:23,545
We were led by the path we took

95
00:09:23,757 --> 00:09:26,921
While he carved a path of his own

96
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:32,500
Stumbling, rising, carefree walked he

97
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:37,247
We fretted about the morrow

98
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:40,623
He simply reveled in today

99
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:46,581
Living each moment to the fullest

100
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:51,169
Where did he come from...

101
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:58,494
He who touched our hearts
and vanished...

102
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:05,126
Where did he go... let's find him

103
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:14,994
In scorching Sun,
he was like a patch of shade...

104
00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:18,371
In an endless desert, like an oasis...

105
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:23,370
On a bruised heart,
like soothing balm was he

106
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:28,668
Afraid, we stayed confined in the well

107
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:32,000
Fearless, he frolicked in the river

108
00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:37,711
Never hesitating to swim
against the tide

109
00:10:39,378 --> 00:10:42,660
He wandered lonesome as a cloud

110
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:47,827
...Yet he was our dearest friend

111
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:52,999
Where did he go... let's find him

112
00:10:53,337 --> 00:10:54,201
Rancho

113
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:56,784
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad

114
00:10:57,544 --> 00:11:00,744
He was as unique as his name

115
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,294
From birth we were taught -
Life is a race

116
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:07,744
Run fast or you 'll be trampled

117
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:12,289
Even to be born, one had to race
300 million sperms

118
00:11:14,544 --> 00:11:18,158
1978. I was born at 5.15 pm

119
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:21,412
At 5.16, my father announced

120
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:26,123
My son will be an engineer.
- Farhan Qureshi. B.Tech. Engineer

121
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,744
And my fate was sealed

122
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:33,244
What I wanted to be... no one asked

123
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:58,125
Raju Rastogi...
Ranchhoddas Chanchad

124
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:00,787
Room number?

125
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,663
D-26

126
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:07,364
C'mon

127
00:12:07,624 --> 00:12:09,331
I'm Man Mohan. MM

128
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,331
These engineers call me
Millimeter

129
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,995
For eggs, bread, milk, laundry

130
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,866
finishing journals,
copying assignments

131
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:19,621
I'm your guy. Fixed rates.
No bargaining

132
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,788
Hey wait, hold this

133
00:12:24,332 --> 00:12:28,077
Meet Kilobyte, Megabyte,
and their mother Gigabyte

134
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,162
Go ahead, click -
this family doesn't bite

135
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:38,702
Check him out...
another God-fearing soul

136
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:45,702
Hi. Farhan Qureshi
- I'm Raju Rastogi

137
00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:51,195
Don't worry

138
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:55,617
a few days here and
hell lose faith in God

139
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:59,578
Then naked babes will be
on the wall, and he'll say -

140
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:03,080
Oh God,
give me one chance with her

141
00:13:03,664 --> 00:13:04,825
Get out of here

142
00:13:05,497 --> 00:13:07,701
Four bucks. Two per bag

143
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,655
Here's five. Keep the change

144
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:16,121
Thanks boss. For your tip,
here's one in return -

145
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:20,286
Wear your best underwear tonight

146
00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:23,735
Why?

147
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:28,362
Your Majesty, thou art great

148
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:31,569
Accept this humble offering

149
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:33,695
Ha... here's a He-Man

150
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:39,400
What a pretty piece.
Cute and compact

151
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:41,202
A campus tradition: On Day 1...

152
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:43,911
Freshmen must pay
their respects to Seniors

153
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:46,280
in their underwear

154
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:49,822
This is when we first saw Rancho

155
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,282
Spiderman

156
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:01,698
Batman

157
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:11,237
Fresh meat

158
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:14,819
Greetings.
Drop your pants, get stamped

159
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:15,775
Name?

160
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:17,611
'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad'

161
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:21,784
What a mouthful;
Needs serious cramming

162
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:23,567
Come on: pants off

163
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:27,897
Being stubborn?

164
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:35,863
Wet pants not good, kiddo.
Take them off

165
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,032
Aal izz well
- What's that?

166
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:40,778
Aal izz Well

167
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:41,780
What did he say?

168
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:45,110
Someone tell him.
Hey James Bond

169
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,440
Make him understand

170
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:50,357
Take off your pants or
they are going to piss on you

171
00:14:50,493 --> 00:14:53,028
Hey 007!
Ashamed to speak Hindi?

172
00:14:53,118 --> 00:14:56,697
Sorry sir, I was born in Uganda,
studied in Pondicherry

173
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:58,241
so little slow in Hindi

174
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:01,531
So explain slowly. No hurry

175
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:04,945
Feeling cold?

176
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:07,738
Pray undress

177
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:12,899
or he'll do
'urine-expulsion' on you

178
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:15,817
Calls pissing 'urine-expulsion';

179
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:19,694
A true linguist
in the land of engineers!

180
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:26,899
Hey, come out of there

181
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:36,437
Come out or...

182
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:40,737
or I'll do 'urine-expulsion'
on your door

183
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,279
If you aren't out by
the count of ten

184
00:15:53,073 --> 00:15:57,611
I'll do 'urine-expulsion'
on your door all semester

185
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:02,395
One

186
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,864
Two

187
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,359
Three

188
00:16:24,821 --> 00:16:26,231
Four

189
00:16:30,363 --> 00:16:31,441
Five

190
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:38,982
Six

191
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:46,483
Seven

192
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:54,101
Eight

193
00:16:59,237 --> 00:17:00,434
Nine

194
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,147
Ten

195
00:17:56,943 --> 00:18:01,481
Salt water is a great conductor
of electricity. 8th Grade Physics

196
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:04,686
We had studied it.
He applied it

197
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:13,936
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe
was the Director of ICE

198
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,433
Students called him Virus,
computer Virus

199
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:20,394
Virus on the way, with eggs

200
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:24,181
Freshmen are summoned.
Come quickly

201
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:27,054
Virus was the most competitive
man we had ever seen

202
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:31,431
He couldn 't bear anyone
getting ahead of him

203
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:38,431
To save time,
his shirts had Velcro

204
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:40,107
and his ties had hooks

205
00:18:42,566 --> 00:18:46,690
He'd trained his mind to write
with both hands simultaneously

206
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:54,391
Everyday at 2 pm he took a
7 1/2 minute power nap

207
00:18:54,815 --> 00:18:56,059
with an opera as lullaby

208
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:00,731
Govind, his valet, had instructions

209
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:06,972
to carry out all unproductive tasks
such as shaving, nail-cutting etc

210
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:26,552
What is this?
- Sir, nest

211
00:19:26,647 --> 00:19:28,970
Whose?
- A koel bird's nest, sir

212
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:30,058
Wrong

213
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:32,978
A koel bird never makes
her own nest

214
00:19:34,064 --> 00:19:36,516
She lays her eggs in
other nests

215
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,395
And when they hatch,
what do they do?

216
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:48,977
They push the other eggs
out of the nest

217
00:19:52,938 --> 00:19:53,932
Competition over

218
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:58,802
Their life begins with murder.
That's nature

219
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:02,223
Compete or die

220
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:06,302
You also are like the koel birds

221
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:15,012
And these are the eggs
you smashed to get into ICE

222
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:20,468
Don't forget, ICE gets
400,000 applications a year

223
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:25,011
and only 200 are selected: You;

224
00:20:25,644 --> 00:20:30,267
And these? Finished.
Broken eggs

225
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:34,889
My son... he tried for three years

226
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,306
Rejected. Every time

227
00:20:41,643 --> 00:20:43,266
Remember, life is a race

228
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:47,515
If you don't run fast,
you'll get trampled

229
00:20:48,226 --> 00:20:50,099
Let me tell you a
very interesting story

230
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:53,637
This is an astronaut pen

231
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:57,554
Fountain pens and ballpoint pens
don't work in outer space

232
00:20:58,393 --> 00:21:02,636
So scientists spent
millions to invent this pen

233
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:07,302
It can write at any angle, in any
temperature, in zero gravity

234
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,474
One day, when I was a student

235
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,516
the Director of our institute
called me

236
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:14,220
He said, 'Viru Sahastrabuddhe.'
I said, 'Yes sir'

237
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:15,808
'Come here;'
I got scared

238
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,381
He showed me this pen

239
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:22,131
He said, 'This is a
symbol of excellence'

240
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:24,964
'I give it to you'

241
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:30,719
'When you come across an
extraordinary student like yourself

242
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:33,014
...pass it onto him'

243
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,425
For 32 years, I've been
waiting for that student

244
00:21:38,808 --> 00:21:39,970
But no luck

245
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:44,797
Anyone here, who'll strive
to win this pen?

246
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,507
Good.
Put your hands down

247
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:56,594
Shall I post it on the notice board?
Hands down

248
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:58,378
One question, sir

249
00:21:59,974 --> 00:22:03,339
Sir, if pens didn't work
in outer space

250
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:06,515
why didn't the astronauts
use a pencil?

251
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:09,426
They'd have saved millions

252
00:22:22,431 --> 00:22:23,889
I will get back to you on this

253
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,171
He zaps a Senior's privates
at night

254
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,630
fingers the Director in the day.
Best avoid him

255
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:35,885
You deflated Virus's erection

256
00:22:36,098 --> 00:22:39,925
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

257
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:42,502
Buzz off.
You don't have school?

258
00:22:42,847 --> 00:22:44,423
Who'll pay for it? Your pop?

259
00:22:44,514 --> 00:22:47,844
Keep off my dad!
- Relax

260
00:22:48,347 --> 00:22:51,842
For school you don't need
tuition money, just a uniform

261
00:22:52,055 --> 00:22:57,470
Pick a school,
buy the uniform, slip into class

262
00:22:58,179 --> 00:22:59,755
In that sea of kids,
no one will notice

263
00:23:00,387 --> 00:23:03,172
If I get caught?
- Then new uniform, new school

264
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:05,553
See that?
- He was different...

265
00:23:06,055 --> 00:23:09,217
He challenged conventions
at every stage

266
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,547
A free-spirited bird had
landed in Virus's nest

267
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,338
We were robots, blindly following
our professors ' commands

268
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:19,583
He was the only one
who was not a machine

269
00:23:19,762 --> 00:23:22,215
What is a machine?

270
00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:29,176
Why're you smiling?

271
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:33,380
Sir, to study Engineering
was a childhood dream

272
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,673
I'm so happy to be here finally

273
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:41,089
No need to be so happy.
Define a machine

274
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:45,918
A machine is anything that
reduces human effort

275
00:23:46,344 --> 00:23:47,718
Will you please elaborate?

276
00:23:51,302 --> 00:23:56,504
Anything that simplifies work,
or saves time, is a machine

277
00:23:58,385 --> 00:24:00,672
It's a warm day, press a button,
get a blast of air

278
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,134
The fan... A machine;

279
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:05,919
Speak to a friend miles away.
The telephone... A machine!

280
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,175
Compute millions in seconds.
The calculator... A machine!

281
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,881
We're surrounded by machines

282
00:24:12,427 --> 00:24:14,915
From a pen's nib to a pants' zip -
all machines

283
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:17,747
Up and down in a second.
Up, down, up, down...

284
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:22,043
What is the definition?

285
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:24,459
I just gave it to you, sir

286
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:29,665
You'll write this in the exam?
This is a machine: up, down...

287
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:32,464
Idiot; Anybody else?

288
00:24:33,176 --> 00:24:34,040
Yes?

289
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,705
Sir, machines are any combination
of bodies so connected

290
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,376
that their relative motions
are constrained

291
00:24:38,508 --> 00:24:40,913
and by which means, force
and motion may be transmitted

292
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,336
and modified as a screw
and its nut, or a lever arranged

293
00:24:43,466 --> 00:24:46,133
to turn about a fulcrum
or a pulley about its pivot, etc

294
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,337
especially, a construction,
more or less complex

295
00:24:48,425 --> 00:24:50,332
consisting of a combination
of moving parts, or

296
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:53,754
simple mechanical elements,
as wheels, levers, cams etc

297
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:56,039
Wonderful

298
00:24:56,341 --> 00:24:57,798
Perfect. Please sit down

299
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,376
Thank you

300
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,798
But sir, I said the same thing,
in simple language

301
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:07,953
If you prefer simple language,
join an Arts and Commerce college

302
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:09,962
But sir, one must get
the meaning too

303
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:13,582
What's the point of blindly
cramming a bookish definition

304
00:25:13,841 --> 00:25:15,463
You think you're smarter
than the book?

305
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,793
Write the textbook definition, mister,
if you want to pass

306
00:25:20,964 --> 00:25:22,706
But there are other books...
- Get out!

307
00:25:23,714 --> 00:25:24,994
Why?

308
00:25:25,173 --> 00:25:27,211
In simple language: Out;

309
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:37,996
Idiot;

310
00:25:40,047 --> 00:25:42,536
So, we were discussing
the machine...

311
00:25:44,131 --> 00:25:45,078
Why're you back?

312
00:25:46,214 --> 00:25:47,292
I forgot something

313
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:48,786
What?

314
00:25:49,922 --> 00:25:52,244
Instruments that record,
analyze, summarize, organize

315
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:54,661
debate and explain information;
that are illustrated, non-illustrated

316
00:25:54,797 --> 00:25:56,704
hard-bound, paperback,
jacketed, non-jacketed

317
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,835
with foreword, introduction,
table-of-contents, index

318
00:25:58,922 --> 00:26:00,746
that are intended for the
enlightenment, understanding

319
00:26:00,921 --> 00:26:02,580
enrichment, enhancement and
education of the human brain

320
00:26:02,713 --> 00:26:04,833
through the sensory route of
vision, sometimes touch

321
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:12,626
What do you mean?

322
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:14,159
Books, sir

323
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:17,124
I forgot my books. May I?

324
00:26:17,504 --> 00:26:19,162
Couldn't you ask simply?

325
00:26:19,587 --> 00:26:22,787
I tried earlier, sir.
It simply didn't work

326
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,915
Professors kept Rancho
mostly out... seldom in

327
00:26:32,337 --> 00:26:35,169
When thrown out of one class,
he'd slip into another

328
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:39,621
He said: First year or fourth year,
it's knowledge. Just grab it

329
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:41,413
He was unlike any of us

330
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:44,043
We fought for a shower
every morning

331
00:26:44,628 --> 00:26:46,867
He'd bathe
wherever he found water

332
00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:47,909
Morning, sir

333
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,626
Machines were his passion

334
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:56,167
When he spotted them,
he opened them

335
00:26:56,503 --> 00:26:57,497
Some he could re-assemble...

336
00:26:58,586 --> 00:26:59,913
some he couldn 't

337
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:03,282
There was another, just like him

338
00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:07,329
Joy Lobo

339
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,785
Sir. Excuse me, sir

340
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:11,865
Mr. Joy Lobo;

341
00:27:12,793 --> 00:27:15,198
Sir, if I could know the
convocation dates...

342
00:27:15,335 --> 00:27:16,163
Why?

343
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:18,076
Dad wants to make
train reservations

344
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:21,956
I'm the first engineer from my
village. Everyone wants to attend

345
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:25,038
In that case, call your dad

346
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:27,623
Please hurry up.
Don't waste my time

347
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:35,074
Hello

348
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:38,242
Dad, the Director wants to
speak to you

349
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:39,412
Joy;

350
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:42,030
Mr. Lobo, your son won't
graduate this year

351
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:44,532
What happened, sir?

352
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,781
He has violated all deadlines

353
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,864
Mr. Lobo, it's an unrealistic project

354
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,914
He is making some
nonsense helicopter

355
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:57,830
I suggest you don't book
your tickets. I'm so sorry

356
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:02,446
Sir, I am this close, sir
- Is your project ready?

357
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,827
Is your project ready?
- Sir, see it once, please

358
00:28:06,957 --> 00:28:08,580
Submit it, and we'll consider

359
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,072
Sir, a small extension...
- Why, why should I?

360
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:14,282
After dad's stroke,
I couldn't focus for two months

361
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:15,659
Did you stop eating?

362
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:17,195
No

363
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:18,328
Stopped bathing?

364
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:20,363
So why stop studying?

365
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:23,200
Sir, I'm very close.
See it once, please...

366
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:24,494
Mr. Lobo;

367
00:28:24,832 --> 00:28:27,699
Sunday afternoon, my son
fell off a train and died

368
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:32,951
Monday morning, I taught a class.
So don't give me that nonsense

369
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:38,122
I can give you sympathy,
not an extension

370
00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:40,788
Sir... I'm very close...

371
00:29:10,913 --> 00:29:12,868
Lifelong I lived

372
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,283
The life of another

373
00:29:15,496 --> 00:29:17,783
For just one moment

374
00:29:18,204 --> 00:29:20,527
Let me live as I...

375
00:29:20,745 --> 00:29:22,702
Lifelong I lived

376
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:25,194
The life of another

377
00:29:25,454 --> 00:29:27,491
For just one moment

378
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,324
Let me live as I...

379
00:29:40,454 --> 00:29:44,992
Give me some sunshine
Give me some rain

380
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:50,193
Give me another chance
I wanna grow up once again

381
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:54,824
Give me some sunshine
Give me some rain

382
00:29:55,161 --> 00:30:00,909
Give me another chance
I wanna grow up once again

383
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:03,362
Dude's come up with an
amazing design

384
00:30:03,744 --> 00:30:05,201
A wireless camera atop a helicopter

385
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:09,693
Can be used for
traffic updates, security... Wow!

386
00:30:10,078 --> 00:30:12,992
But Virus said it's an
impractical design, it won't fly

387
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,282
It will fly; We'll make it fly

388
00:30:17,577 --> 00:30:19,781
Don't tell Joy. It'll be a surprise

389
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,820
We'll fly it up to his window
and capture his reaction

390
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,531
If we work on his project,
who'll work on ours?

391
00:30:26,035 --> 00:30:29,116
Tests, vivas, quizzes -
42 exams per semester

392
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:30,946
You scare easily, bro

393
00:30:32,701 --> 00:30:36,564
Take your hand, put it over your
heart, and say, 'Aal izz well'

394
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:38,941
All is well?
- Aal izz well

395
00:30:39,243 --> 00:30:41,613
Words of wisdom from
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

396
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:44,238
We had an old watchman
in our village

397
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:50,325
On night patrol, he'd call out,
'Aal izz well'

398
00:30:50,992 --> 00:30:54,440
And we slept peacefully.
Then there was a theft

399
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:56,691
and we learned that
he couldn't see at night;

400
00:30:56,992 --> 00:31:00,439
He'd just yell 'Aal izz well',
and we felt secure

401
00:31:02,325 --> 00:31:06,898
That day I understood
this heart scares easily

402
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,732
You have to trick it

403
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:16,697
However big the problem,
tell your heart, 'All is well, pal'

404
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,656
That resolves the problem?

405
00:31:19,908 --> 00:31:21,697
No. But you gain courage to face it

406
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:27,564
Learn it up, bro.
We're gonna really need it here

407
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:49,695
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

408
00:31:53,573 --> 00:31:57,613
Let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

409
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:05,404
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

410
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:09,358
Just let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

411
00:32:09,572 --> 00:32:13,436
Yell: All is Well...

412
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,730
The chicken's clueless
about the egg's fate

413
00:32:17,322 --> 00:32:20,734
Will it hatch or
become an omelette

414
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,734
No one knows
what the future holds

415
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,354
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

416
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:31,854
Whistle away the toll
Yell: All is Well

417
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:35,943
Hey bro: All is Well

418
00:32:36,696 --> 00:32:40,310
Hey mate: All is Well

419
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:44,316
Hey bro: All is Well

420
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,314
Confusion and more confusion
No sign of any solution

421
00:32:57,528 --> 00:33:01,474
Ah... finally a solution
But wait... what was the question?

422
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:04,644
If the timid heart with fear
is about to die

423
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:08,727
Then con it bro,
with this simple lie

424
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,644
Heart's an idiot,
it will fall under that spell

425
00:33:13,485 --> 00:33:15,358
Let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

426
00:33:15,568 --> 00:33:19,692
Whistle away the toll
Yell: All is Well

427
00:33:20,902 --> 00:33:24,102
Hey bro: All is Well

428
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:27,982
Hey mate: All is Well

429
00:33:28,818 --> 00:33:31,899
Hey bro: All is Well

430
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:45,347
Blew the scholarship on booze
But that did not dispel my blues

431
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:49,306
Holy incense lit up my plight
And yet God's nowhere in sight

432
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:52,647
The lamb is clueless for
what it's destined

433
00:33:53,442 --> 00:33:56,689
Will it be served on skewers
or simply minced

434
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,725
No one knows
what the future holds

435
00:34:01,275 --> 00:34:03,266
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

436
00:34:03,483 --> 00:34:07,856
Whistle away the toll
Yell: All is Well

437
00:34:08,817 --> 00:34:11,731
Hey bro: All is Well

438
00:34:12,775 --> 00:34:15,559
Hey mate: All is Well

439
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,851
Hey bro: All is Well

440
00:34:21,316 --> 00:34:25,310
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

441
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,606
Just let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

442
00:34:31,732 --> 00:34:35,312
All is Well

443
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:38,474
The chicken's clueless
about the egg's fate

444
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,687
Will it hatch or
become an omelette

445
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:46,475
No one knows
what the future holds

446
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:49,354
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

447
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,981
Whistle away the toll

448
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:53,189
Eureka! Eureka;

449
00:34:55,023 --> 00:34:57,891
Yell: All is Well

450
00:34:58,856 --> 00:35:02,019
Hey Mrs. Chicken: All is Well

451
00:35:02,856 --> 00:35:05,854
Hey Mr. Lamb: All is Well

452
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,889
Hey bro: All is Well

453
00:35:10,023 --> 00:35:12,143
Hey, take it up to Joy's window

454
00:35:12,814 --> 00:35:13,892
Take it higher

455
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:16,388
Look at Silencer: the nude dude;

456
00:35:19,855 --> 00:35:21,396
Joy, come out

457
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,978
Come to the window

458
00:35:25,188 --> 00:35:26,562
Joy, look outside

459
00:36:20,894 --> 00:36:21,759
Good news, sir

460
00:36:23,144 --> 00:36:26,141
The police and Joy's father
have no clue

461
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:28,762
Everyone thinks this is suicide

462
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:32,180
The post mortem report -

463
00:36:32,477 --> 00:36:34,800
Cause of Death: Intense
pressure on windpipe

464
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:36,013
resulting in choking

465
00:36:38,768 --> 00:36:42,714
All think the pressure
on the jugular killed him

466
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:47,386
What about the mental pressure
for the last four years?

467
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:49,263
That's missing in the report

468
00:36:52,184 --> 00:36:53,890
Engineers are a clever bunch

469
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:58,681
They haven't made a machine
to measure mental pressure

470
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:02,469
If they had, all would know...

471
00:37:03,684 --> 00:37:05,093
this isn't suicide... it's murder

472
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:13,213
How dare you blame me
for Joy's suicide?

473
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:16,932
If one student can't handle
pressure, is it our fault?

474
00:37:17,391 --> 00:37:21,006
Life is full of pressures.
Will you always blame others?

475
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:25,261
I don't blame you, sir.
I blame the system

476
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:30,884
Look at these statistics -
India ranks N0.1 in suicides

477
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,965
Every 90 minutes,
a student attempts suicide

478
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:39,556
Suicide is a bigger killer
than disease

479
00:37:39,765 --> 00:37:41,093
Something's terribly wrong, sir

480
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:43,470
I can't speak for the rest

481
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,095
but this is one of the
finest colleges in the country

482
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,756
I've run this place for 32 years

483
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:52,553
We were ranked 28th.
Now we're N0.1

484
00:37:52,724 --> 00:37:54,300
What's the point, sir?

485
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:59,302
Here they don't discuss
new ideas or inventions

486
00:38:01,098 --> 00:38:06,005
They discuss grades,
jobs, settling in the USA

487
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:12,212
They teach how to get good scores.
They don't teach Engineering

488
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:14,594
Now you will teach me
how to teach?

489
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:15,969
No sir, I...

490
00:38:19,223 --> 00:38:20,300
Sir, my paper...

491
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,293
Vaidyanathan, please sit down

492
00:38:42,055 --> 00:38:43,962
Here is a
self-proclaimed professor

493
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:49,134
who thinks he is better than
our highly qualified teachers

494
00:38:49,846 --> 00:38:54,302
Professor Ranchhoddas Chanchad
will teach us Engineering

495
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,542
We do not have all day

496
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:55,753
You have 30 seconds
to define these terms

497
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:58,214
You may refer to your books

498
00:39:58,801 --> 00:40:00,839
Raise your hand
if you get the answer

499
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:05,500
Let's see who comes first,
who comes last

500
00:40:06,342 --> 00:40:09,590
Your time starts... now

501
00:40:39,216 --> 00:40:40,129
Time up

502
00:40:42,675 --> 00:40:43,669
Time up, sir

503
00:40:45,549 --> 00:40:47,919
No one got the answer?

504
00:40:50,424 --> 00:40:53,790
Now rewind your life by a minute

505
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:57,839
When I asked this question,
were you excited? Curious?

506
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:00,756
Thrilled that you'd learn
something new?

507
00:41:01,549 --> 00:41:03,954
Anyone? ... Sir?

508
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:09,713
No. You all got into a frantic race

509
00:41:11,756 --> 00:41:13,877
What's the use of such methods,
even if you come first

510
00:41:16,131 --> 00:41:19,497
Will your knowledge increase?
No, just the pressure

511
00:41:20,422 --> 00:41:21,963
This is a college,
not a pressure cooker

512
00:41:24,173 --> 00:41:27,703
Even a circus lion learns to sit
on a chair in fear of the whip

513
00:41:28,797 --> 00:41:32,293
But you call such a lion
'well trained', not 'well educated'

514
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,328
Hello!

515
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:38,413
This is not a philosophy class.
Just explain those two words

516
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:40,503
Sir, these words don't exist

517
00:41:41,672 --> 00:41:45,002
These are my friends' names.
Farhan and Raju

518
00:41:57,546 --> 00:41:58,459
Quiet;

519
00:41:59,963 --> 00:42:02,795
Nonsense! Is this how
you'll teach Engineering?

520
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,161
Sir, I wasn't teaching
you Engineering

521
00:42:05,754 --> 00:42:07,247
You're an expert at that

522
00:42:08,087 --> 00:42:11,334
I was teaching you... how to teach

523
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,078
And I'm sure one day you'll learn

524
00:42:17,087 --> 00:42:20,084
because unlike you, I never
abandon my weak students

525
00:42:20,587 --> 00:42:21,581
Bye, sir

526
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,748
Quiet;

527
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,408
Quiet, I said

528
00:42:31,878 --> 00:42:35,243
I regret to inform you
that your son...

529
00:42:35,378 --> 00:42:36,491
Farhan...
Raju...

530
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:37,830
has fallen into bad company

531
00:42:38,169 --> 00:42:41,333
Without urgent corrective steps,
his future will be ruined

532
00:42:42,419 --> 00:42:45,701
Virus 's letters dropped on
our homes like atom bombs

533
00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:48,456
Hiroshima and Nagasaki
plunged into gloom

534
00:42:48,544 --> 00:42:51,625
Our parents invited us -
for a dressing down

535
00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:54,825
Come in

536
00:42:57,377 --> 00:42:58,325
See that?

537
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,281
We could afford
just one air-conditioner

538
00:43:04,043 --> 00:43:07,705
We put it in Farhan's room,
so he could study in comfort

539
00:43:09,168 --> 00:43:13,114
I didn't buy a car.
I manage with a scooter

540
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:15,873
We put all our money
into Farhan's education

541
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:21,499
We sacrificed our comforts
for Farhan's future. U nderstand?

542
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,499
You took these pictures, Farhan?

543
00:43:33,417 --> 00:43:35,407
He had that useless
obsession for a while

544
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:38,033
Went around taking
pictures of animals

545
00:43:38,124 --> 00:43:40,909
Wanted to be a
wildlife photographer

546
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:44,530
Son, what was your
score that year?

547
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:46,696
91%

548
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:51,699
Hear that? Straight drop
from 94% to 91%

549
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,290
You find it funny?

550
00:43:56,958 --> 00:44:01,034
No sir, sorry. I'm just
amazed at the photos

551
00:44:01,207 --> 00:44:03,826
Why make him an engineer...
Why not a wildlife photographer?

552
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:05,160
Enough;

553
00:44:06,415 --> 00:44:11,700
I humbly request you -
Don't ruin my son's future

554
00:44:13,207 --> 00:44:15,577
Food's on the table, boys. C'mon

555
00:44:20,498 --> 00:44:22,784
If you ever visit again,
do eat with us

556
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:27,163
Dad denied us a meal...

557
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,406
So, to fill our bellies with food...

558
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:33,072
and ears with more reprimands,
we reached Raju's house

559
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,115
Raju's house was straight
out of a 50's black and white film

560
00:44:39,872 --> 00:44:40,867
A small, dingy room...

561
00:44:41,038 --> 00:44:42,532
a paralyzed father...

562
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,527
a coughing mother...

563
00:44:44,914 --> 00:44:46,406
and an unwed sister

564
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:48,913
A sofa sprouting springs...

565
00:44:49,372 --> 00:44:51,658
a 24 hour water supply -
from the leaking roof

566
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:55,944
Mother was a retired school
teacher and a tireless complainer

567
00:44:56,622 --> 00:44:58,778
Father was once a postmaster

568
00:44:59,288 --> 00:45:01,693
Paralysis shut down
his body partly...

569
00:45:02,163 --> 00:45:04,568
his salary completely.
And the sister...

570
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:08,360
Kammo's turned 28.
They demand a car in dowry

571
00:45:08,996 --> 00:45:11,614
If you don't study and earn,
how will she marry?

572
00:45:12,121 --> 00:45:13,033
Some okra?

573
00:45:14,038 --> 00:45:17,901
Okra is now 12 /- per kilo,
cauliflower is 10/-

574
00:45:18,245 --> 00:45:19,655
It's daylight robbery;

575
00:45:20,037 --> 00:45:24,031
What will we eat if we get
warnings from your college?

576
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:25,199
Mom!

577
00:45:26,787 --> 00:45:27,734
Cottage cheese?

578
00:45:28,204 --> 00:45:31,735
Cottage cheese should be sold
at the jewelers, in velvet pouches

579
00:45:32,036 --> 00:45:33,826
Cottage cheese?
- No, no, it's ok

580
00:45:34,494 --> 00:45:36,036
Mom, please

581
00:45:36,911 --> 00:45:38,701
Alright, I'll shut up

582
00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:44,861
Earn for the family,
slave like a maid

583
00:45:45,077 --> 00:45:47,364
and then take the vow of silence

584
00:45:48,327 --> 00:45:52,866
If not with my son, with whom
do I share my woes: his friends?

585
00:45:56,786 --> 00:45:57,863
Hey Raju

586
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:02,441
We were in a huge dilemma

587
00:46:03,076 --> 00:46:06,193
Do we comfort our friend
or console his mom?

588
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:10,361
Screw it, we thought, let's
focus on the cottage cheese

589
00:46:22,284 --> 00:46:25,117
Even his eczema cream
costs 55 /- now

590
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:31,195
Another roti?

591
00:46:31,533 --> 00:46:34,484
No, thank you. We're through

592
00:46:42,284 --> 00:46:44,855
Okra for 12 /-
- Cauliflower for 10 /-

593
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:49,733
At least you were offered a meal

594
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:53,442
Unlike your sadistic dad...
'Hitler' Qureshi;

595
00:46:53,575 --> 00:46:56,276
And your mom is Mother Teresa...
Feeding us 'eczema roti'!

596
00:46:56,532 --> 00:47:00,112
Don't poke fun at my mom;
- Enough, you guys

597
00:47:00,408 --> 00:47:01,817
I'm famished. Let's eat out

598
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:04,319
It's month end. Who'll pay?
His Mother Teresa?

599
00:47:05,366 --> 00:47:09,939
To eat out, you don't need money.
Just a uniform. Look...

600
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,399
C'mon
- Come

601
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,230
Good evening,
good evening

602
00:47:18,324 --> 00:47:19,189
Oh, U ncle

603
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:27,736
Three large vodkas.
- Half soda, half water

604
00:47:27,948 --> 00:47:29,192
If we're caught, we're dead

605
00:47:29,364 --> 00:47:31,900
What's for starters?
- Get double portions

606
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:35,023
Leave this here and start
some peppy music

607
00:47:35,781 --> 00:47:37,440
Pia, what the hell!

608
00:47:37,823 --> 00:47:40,525
Why're you wearing
this ancient piece of junk?

609
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:45,318
What'll people say: My fiancee...

610
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:48,309
a doctor in the making,
wearing a cheap, 200 /- watch;

611
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:50,731
Please take it off. Thank you

612
00:47:51,281 --> 00:47:52,311
Hi handsome

613
00:47:52,447 --> 00:47:55,279
Hey Aunty.
You're looking good

614
00:47:55,364 --> 00:47:57,934
Don't miss my set, darling
- Rubies?

615
00:47:58,114 --> 00:48:00,732
From Mandalay
- Mandalay... Wow;

616
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:03,524
Hey, let's go meet David
- Of course

617
00:48:06,696 --> 00:48:07,775
Excuse me

618
00:48:09,947 --> 00:48:11,108
Yes?

619
00:48:11,404 --> 00:48:12,483
Flowers

620
00:48:13,988 --> 00:48:17,188
May I take the glass?
- Why?

621
00:48:17,488 --> 00:48:19,774
So you don't break it on my head

622
00:48:20,571 --> 00:48:21,815
Why would I do that?

623
00:48:22,237 --> 00:48:24,358
For the free advice I'll now impart

624
00:48:25,529 --> 00:48:26,394
What?

625
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,313
Don't marry that ass

626
00:48:29,403 --> 00:48:30,317
Excuse me?

627
00:48:30,529 --> 00:48:32,235
He's not a human,
he's a price tag

628
00:48:32,654 --> 00:48:35,652
He'll turn your life into a
nightmare of brands and prices

629
00:48:36,278 --> 00:48:38,849
He'll ruin your life.
Your future will be finished

630
00:48:39,153 --> 00:48:40,018
Want a demonstration?

631
00:48:42,194 --> 00:48:43,818
Shall I find out
the price of his shoes?

632
00:48:45,362 --> 00:48:47,269
I won't ask.
He'll announce it himself

633
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:05,268
What the hell...
Mint sauce on my $300 shoes!

634
00:49:05,402 --> 00:49:08,602
Run for your life;
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

635
00:49:09,152 --> 00:49:11,854
Genuine Italian leather -
hand-stitched;

636
00:49:16,444 --> 00:49:19,145
Dad, are they your guests?

637
00:49:22,485 --> 00:49:25,767
My students.
What're they doing here?

638
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:30,931
Hold on, Dad

639
00:49:32,484 --> 00:49:34,724
These beans smell great

640
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:37,182
No room for roti
- Just pile it on

641
00:49:39,151 --> 00:49:40,525
Hi
- Hey

642
00:49:42,067 --> 00:49:45,065
That was an eye-opener.
Thank you so much

643
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,853
It was my moral responsibility

644
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,059
Can I ask you for little more help?

645
00:49:52,151 --> 00:49:54,769
Dad won't let me break off
this engagement

646
00:49:55,734 --> 00:49:59,727
You explain so well.
Can you give him a demo too?

647
00:50:00,025 --> 00:50:02,644
Certainly.
Raju, the mint sauce

648
00:50:03,191 --> 00:50:04,648
You're really sweet

649
00:50:05,858 --> 00:50:08,939
Where is your daddy?
- Right behind you

650
00:50:13,565 --> 00:50:15,889
Aal izz well

651
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:21,846
Run for your life;
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

652
00:50:22,149 --> 00:50:23,689
What're you doing here?

653
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:27,432
We'll hand these gifts
to the couple

654
00:50:28,482 --> 00:50:30,768
I'll do that for you.
It's my sister's wedding

655
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,352
Sister?

656
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,596
Sir, what's the sum total
of your daughters?

657
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:40,054
Empty. No gift cheques

658
00:50:40,398 --> 00:50:42,472
Forgot the cheques, Raju
...Farhan?

659
00:50:42,564 --> 00:50:46,724
We didn't invite you,
you must be from the groom's side

660
00:50:47,231 --> 00:50:51,176
No sir, we're here as the
emissaries of science

661
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,518
How? Can you explain?

662
00:50:53,772 --> 00:50:57,433
Dad, he explains superbly.
I'm sure he'll give us a demo

663
00:50:57,731 --> 00:50:58,678
Won't you?

664
00:50:59,522 --> 00:51:03,102
Well, Delhi has plenty of
power cuts that...

665
00:51:03,356 --> 00:51:05,678
disrupt wedding celebrations

666
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:08,142
So I thought of making
an inverter that...

667
00:51:08,272 --> 00:51:10,677
draws power from guests' cars

668
00:51:10,897 --> 00:51:12,271
I see

669
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,973
Wow

670
00:51:14,355 --> 00:51:15,765
So where's the inverter?

671
00:51:16,563 --> 00:51:18,186
Sir, the design is ready

672
00:51:21,271 --> 00:51:22,551
Where's the design, Farhan?

673
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,013
I gave you the design
- I gave it to Raju

674
00:51:26,438 --> 00:51:27,386
Raju, design?

675
00:51:30,479 --> 00:51:34,224
Never mind the design.
I'll make the inverter and show you

676
00:51:34,562 --> 00:51:38,223
You can only invent stories,
not an inverter

677
00:51:38,521 --> 00:51:41,602
I'll make one, I promise

678
00:51:41,937 --> 00:51:45,433
And I'll name it after you.
After all, it was invented...

679
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,349
at your daughter's wedding.
So it'll be an honor...

680
00:51:49,479 --> 00:51:55,511
Farhan, Raju. I'll see you
in my office tomorrow

681
00:52:01,394 --> 00:52:04,890
Sir, what was the cost per plate?
We'll reimburse you

682
00:52:05,228 --> 00:52:06,886
...in installments

683
00:52:09,352 --> 00:52:12,600
We'll never crash a wedding again
- Not even my own

684
00:52:12,728 --> 00:52:14,967
In fact, I won't even marry.
Nor will he

685
00:52:15,644 --> 00:52:17,681
Uh... right. No marriage

686
00:52:19,186 --> 00:52:21,555
Your parents shouldn't have
married either

687
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:25,762
The world would have
to feed two less idiots

688
00:52:28,268 --> 00:52:29,298
Sit!

689
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:41,339
Pay attention

690
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:57,220
This is Ranchhoddas's father's
monthly income

691
00:52:58,558 --> 00:53:04,887
Couple of zeroes less,
and it's still a sizeable income

692
00:53:07,433 --> 00:53:13,762
But erase another zero,
and I would worry a little

693
00:53:15,016 --> 00:53:18,382
Isn't that your father's income,
Farhan?

694
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:20,972
Yes, sir

695
00:53:22,349 --> 00:53:24,387
Now take away another zero...

696
00:53:27,432 --> 00:53:31,212
and that's your family income,
Raju Rastogi

697
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:33,764
Big reason to worry

698
00:53:38,474 --> 00:53:45,631
Take my advice and shift into
Chatur Ramalingam's room

699
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:50,299
Exams are here. Stay with
Rancho and you're sure to fail

700
00:54:12,222 --> 00:54:14,627
Want a shave?
- No, sir

701
00:54:14,805 --> 00:54:15,670
Then get lost!

702
00:54:26,929 --> 00:54:32,511
Raju, don't worry. This is Virus's
move to split us. Divide and rule

703
00:54:32,638 --> 00:54:33,715
I have to worry

704
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:37,633
He grades us, and I need
good grades for a good job

705
00:54:38,554 --> 00:54:41,587
Unlike you, I don't have a
rich dad I can live off

706
00:54:41,721 --> 00:54:43,592
Shut up, Raju

707
00:54:43,846 --> 00:54:46,512
Must we follow all his hogwash?
'Aal izz well'

708
00:54:46,888 --> 00:54:48,344
I won't be his flunky... like you

709
00:54:49,303 --> 00:54:51,591
You're crossing the line
- No, I'm drawing one

710
00:54:52,096 --> 00:54:53,802
I have a family to support

711
00:54:56,012 --> 00:54:58,252
Dad's medicines
swallow up mom's pension

712
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:04,592
My sis can't marry because
they want a car in dowry

713
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:11,754
Mom hasn't bought a
single saree in five years

714
00:55:14,594 --> 00:55:17,794
Now don't get your mom's
wardrobe into the debate

715
00:55:18,928 --> 00:55:20,918
By the way, how many sarees
per annum is reasonable?

716
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,254
Hey... no wisecracks about mom

717
00:55:24,011 --> 00:55:28,253
We'll study with all our heart,
but not just for grades

718
00:55:28,927 --> 00:55:33,251
To quote a Wise One: Study
to be accomplished, not affluent

719
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:39,544
Follow excellence. And success
will chase you, pants down;

720
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,378
Which Wise One says this?
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas?

721
00:55:45,427 --> 00:55:46,421
Go rot in the bogs;

722
00:55:48,051 --> 00:55:51,048
Raju, don't stress. We'll top
our class. Nothing is impossible

723
00:55:51,343 --> 00:55:52,504
Oh yeah?

724
00:55:56,176 --> 00:55:58,296
Shove this back into the tube

725
00:56:01,343 --> 00:56:02,965
Raju got onto another train

726
00:56:03,508 --> 00:56:08,664
His travails with Chatur began.
Yes, I mean travails, not travels

727
00:56:13,092 --> 00:56:14,999
Chatur was called 'Silencer'

728
00:56:15,341 --> 00:56:19,039
To sharpen his memory,
he popped pills from a local quack

729
00:56:19,466 --> 00:56:21,421
And then let off silent...
but lethal farts

730
00:56:24,132 --> 00:56:27,333
I didn't do it... Raju?

731
00:56:27,508 --> 00:56:30,174
He always blamed others
for the output

732
00:56:30,924 --> 00:56:33,792
Silencer crammed 18 hours a day

733
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:37,166
On exam eve,
he would distract others

734
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:44,213
His belief: There are only
two ways of topping

735
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:47,831
Elevate your own grades or
shrink your opponents' grades

736
00:56:52,131 --> 00:56:55,996
Rancho decided to subdue
Silencer and rescue Raju...

737
00:56:56,465 --> 00:56:57,744
with one master plan

738
00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:07,797
Our Director has unceasingly
served... 'Served' means...

739
00:57:07,881 --> 00:57:11,921
Damn the meaning,
I'll memorize it

740
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,953
Chatur was the introductory speaker
at the Teachers' Day function

741
00:57:17,297 --> 00:57:21,207
To impress Virus, he got his
speech written by the librarian...

742
00:57:21,422 --> 00:57:22,750
in highbrow Hindi

743
00:57:24,297 --> 00:57:29,666
Hello. Hold on.
Chatur, call for you

744
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:32,452
Please collect the printout.
I'll be right back

745
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:37,120
Oh... the things I have to do...

746
00:57:40,713 --> 00:57:43,877
Mr. Dubey, the Director was
remembering you

747
00:57:44,005 --> 00:57:45,581
Really?
- Yes. Just now

748
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:49,328
I'll see him right away.
Give this to Chatur

749
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:57,538
Hello. Hello
- Hello, Mr. Ramalingam?

750
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:58,582
Yes?

751
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:01,540
I'm calling from the police station

752
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,753
Are you from Uganda?
- Yes sir

753
00:58:06,295 --> 00:58:09,328
Your life is in danger
- What? ... How?

754
00:58:10,461 --> 00:58:12,251
Listen carefully, or else...

755
00:58:12,878 --> 00:58:17,203
you'll get killed as you step out
of the college gate

756
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:19,204
Why? What happened?

757
00:58:19,336 --> 00:58:20,912
While Chatur was kept engaged

758
00:58:21,336 --> 00:58:25,330
Rancho altered a few words
in his speech, for eg...

759
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:27,914
'served' became 'screwed'

760
00:58:28,752 --> 00:58:30,032
Yes sir?

761
00:58:30,586 --> 00:58:33,121
Who are you?
- Dubey. Librarian

762
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:36,872
I'm permanent staff, sir

763
00:58:37,502 --> 00:58:38,912
Congratulations

764
00:58:39,335 --> 00:58:42,701
Hold on a moment.
The chief is on the other line

765
00:58:43,085 --> 00:58:44,033
Excuse me, sir

766
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:55,950
Yes... so where was I?

767
00:58:56,209 --> 00:58:58,615
You said I may die...
outside the gate

768
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:05,162
Right. As you get out of the gate,
you'll see a traffic signal

769
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:07,413
Traffic signal. Ok

770
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:13,160
When it turns red,
all the cars will halt

771
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:14,995
Ok. Then?

772
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:17,116
Then cross the road
with great caution

773
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:23,112
Because son, in rush hour
if a car hits you, you're dead

774
00:59:25,042 --> 00:59:26,867
What nonsense! I know that

775
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,579
You know that? Excellent.
Then you're safe my boy

776
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:39,698
From the librarian, Silencer

777
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:41,409
You don't call me that,
Chanchad

778
00:59:47,249 --> 00:59:49,323
Hey. The Director said
he didn't call for me

779
00:59:50,124 --> 00:59:52,363
Who said 'called'?
I just said he 'remembered' you

780
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,111
Remembered?
Rascals;

781
01:00:03,164 --> 01:00:05,321
Distinguished Mr. Chairperson

782
01:00:07,623 --> 01:00:11,912
Chief guest, the Honorable
Minister of Education

783
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:16,486
respected teachers and friends

784
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:22,951
ICE has now soared
beyond the stratosphere

785
01:00:23,581 --> 01:00:27,870
The credit goes solely to

786
01:00:28,288 --> 01:00:32,069
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.
Give him a big hand

787
01:00:32,205 --> 01:00:36,246
Sir, the voice is his
but the words are mine

788
01:00:36,997 --> 01:00:39,236
He's a great guy, really you are

789
01:00:40,997 --> 01:00:48,900
For 32 years, he has
unceasingly screwed students

790
01:00:51,455 --> 01:00:53,824
He means: 'served' students

791
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,650
I'm sure his endeavors
will continue

792
01:00:59,329 --> 01:01:04,366
We are astounded at
how one man, in one lifetime

793
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,494
can screw so many, so well

794
01:01:10,578 --> 01:01:15,864
With rigorous training
he's built up his stamina

795
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:26,191
He's spent every living minute
just screwing

796
01:01:28,787 --> 01:01:30,528
Let's replicate his methods

797
01:01:34,328 --> 01:01:39,992
Tomorrow ICE students
will go across the globe

798
01:01:40,661 --> 01:01:46,858
Wherever we go,
we promise to screw

799
01:01:50,911 --> 01:01:54,110
We'll hoist this screwer's flag
all over the world

800
01:01:59,702 --> 01:02:04,489
We'll show the world that
our capacity to screw...

801
01:02:04,826 --> 01:02:06,817
cannot be matched by any student...

802
01:02:07,076 --> 01:02:10,607
anywhere on the planet

803
01:02:18,325 --> 01:02:21,359
Mr. Minister. Good evening

804
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:29,439
You have given this institution
what it sorely needs

805
01:02:30,201 --> 01:02:31,823
Booty, funds
- Bosom

806
01:02:35,409 --> 01:02:37,564
It's booty, stupid. Bosom means...

807
01:02:38,992 --> 01:02:41,029
What nonsense! That's insulting

808
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:46,196
Everyone has a bosom,
but it remains pocketed

809
01:02:47,783 --> 01:02:49,773
No one offers it so readily

810
01:02:53,782 --> 01:02:54,730
Vulgar fellow;

811
01:02:54,907 --> 01:02:56,530
You have generously offered
your bosom...

812
01:02:56,907 --> 01:02:59,988
to this relentless screwer

813
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:07,191
Now see how he makes it grow

814
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:11,691
Is this what you teach here, Director?

815
01:03:19,364 --> 01:03:22,777
On this august occasion,
here's a Sanskrit verse...

816
01:03:22,906 --> 01:03:25,904
Listen to this: the might
of his fart in verse

817
01:03:26,448 --> 01:03:28,983
A good loud fart is honorable

818
01:03:29,198 --> 01:03:31,567
'Fart'? Go, Silencer

819
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,607
A medium fart is tolerable

820
01:03:37,905 --> 01:03:41,484
Softer windbreaks are terrible

821
01:03:44,447 --> 01:03:49,353
And the silent ones unbearable

822
01:03:53,655 --> 01:03:55,231
What did I do?

823
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:02,438
That's what mindless cramming
does to you

824
01:04:02,613 --> 01:04:06,108
Cramming may see you
through four years of college

825
01:04:06,362 --> 01:04:10,191
but it will 'screw' you
for the next 40 years

826
01:04:11,404 --> 01:04:14,023
He still doesn't get it

827
01:04:20,154 --> 01:04:24,527
'Medium fart is tolerable'...
Unbelievable;

828
01:04:24,779 --> 01:04:27,445
You're a poet, Rancho.
How did you think of this?

829
01:04:28,861 --> 01:04:32,274
That was fun.
He didn't know what hit him

830
01:04:34,778 --> 01:04:38,108
You swines!
What did I ever do to you?

831
01:04:41,069 --> 01:04:43,107
Sorry man.
Don't take it personally

832
01:04:43,361 --> 01:04:44,604
I will

833
01:04:45,194 --> 01:04:48,061
Chatur Ramalingam
will never forget this insult

834
01:04:48,694 --> 01:04:52,558
I'll think of it every minute,
every second of my life

835
01:04:52,861 --> 01:04:58,230
Sorry man. That was a demo
for Raju: Don't cram blindly

836
01:04:58,568 --> 01:05:00,772
Understand and enjoy
the wonders of Science

837
01:05:00,901 --> 01:05:03,391
I'm not here to enjoy Science

838
01:05:03,527 --> 01:05:06,442
So You're here to screw Science

839
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:11,108
Go ahead.
Laugh at my methods

840
01:05:12,193 --> 01:05:16,517
But one day these methods
will bring me success

841
01:05:16,984 --> 01:05:19,852
That day I'll laugh and you'll cry

842
01:05:21,276 --> 01:05:25,518
You're on the wrong track again.
Don't chase success

843
01:05:26,401 --> 01:05:28,605
Become a good engineer
and success will chase you

844
01:05:28,818 --> 01:05:33,439
These ideals don't work
in the real world

845
01:05:34,275 --> 01:05:38,269
You take your train, I'll take mine

846
01:05:39,067 --> 01:05:42,349
Ten years from now
we'll meet at the same station

847
01:05:43,234 --> 01:05:48,186
Same day. Same place.
We'll see who's more successful

848
01:05:48,483 --> 01:05:50,888
you... or I

849
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:55,975
Have the balls? C'mon, bet;

850
01:05:56,191 --> 01:05:59,771
It's a challenge

851
01:06:01,066 --> 01:06:01,979
Watch it!

852
01:06:08,607 --> 01:06:09,520
What's he writing?

853
01:06:17,148 --> 01:06:19,435
Don't forget this date

854
01:06:27,731 --> 01:06:30,302
I'm not used to
such expensive gifts, Suhas

855
01:06:30,648 --> 01:06:31,891
Get used to them, Pia

856
01:06:32,023 --> 01:06:34,144
You're gonna be
Suhas Tandon's wife

857
01:06:34,273 --> 01:06:35,386
Where's the bill, man?

858
01:06:39,856 --> 01:06:40,768
I'll be back

859
01:06:51,147 --> 01:06:52,805
You changed the speech?
- What?

860
01:06:52,896 --> 01:06:53,761
Don't lie

861
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,352
Um... Yeah

862
01:06:56,563 --> 01:06:58,969
What's your problem with dad?
- I have no problem

863
01:06:59,438 --> 01:07:02,271
I'm making an inverter
named after him. Look... Oh

864
01:07:06,604 --> 01:07:08,098
Why're you harassing him?

865
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:10,389
'Cause he runs a factory,
not a college

866
01:07:10,646 --> 01:07:14,343
Churning out asses.
Like that one

867
01:07:19,479 --> 01:07:20,510
She destroyed it, man

868
01:07:23,895 --> 01:07:25,140
How dare you call him an ass?

869
01:07:25,354 --> 01:07:28,636
He is one!
First Engineering, then MBA

870
01:07:28,771 --> 01:07:30,559
then becomes a banker in the USA

871
01:07:31,478 --> 01:07:33,967
Because it rakes in
more money?

872
01:07:34,228 --> 01:07:36,763
Life for him is just
a profit-loss statement

873
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:39,010
He sees profit in you,
so he's with you

874
01:07:39,354 --> 01:07:43,015
Director's daughter, doctor in the
making... Good for his image!

875
01:07:43,311 --> 01:07:44,591
It's not you he cares for

876
01:07:46,853 --> 01:07:48,227
Who do you think you are?

877
01:07:48,478 --> 01:07:50,137
What do you mean
he doesn't care for me?

878
01:07:52,061 --> 01:07:54,052
New watch? One moment

879
01:07:55,269 --> 01:07:57,343
You always need a demo

880
01:07:58,394 --> 01:07:59,223
Hey Suhas

881
01:08:01,394 --> 01:08:02,970
Where were you?

882
01:08:03,394 --> 01:08:05,052
She's looking for her watch

883
01:08:05,227 --> 01:08:07,017
What? You lost the watch

884
01:08:07,269 --> 01:08:08,430
Never mind. Get another

885
01:08:08,727 --> 01:08:10,006
It cost 400,000;

886
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:14,016
Mine's just 250/-
but keeps the same time

887
01:08:14,185 --> 01:08:16,508
How could you be so careless, Pia

888
01:08:16,685 --> 01:08:19,801
This callous attitude is
disgusting. It's disrespectful

889
01:08:19,935 --> 01:08:22,506
That was a limited edition watch

890
01:08:22,892 --> 01:08:26,341
Now wear your ancient
piece of junk at dinner

891
01:08:27,684 --> 01:08:29,094
What're you staring at?

892
01:08:32,059 --> 01:08:34,808
Here come the tears!
Real mature, Pia

893
01:08:35,351 --> 01:08:36,595
I can't handle this

894
01:08:37,434 --> 01:08:39,554
Stop crying and look for it

895
01:08:53,058 --> 01:08:55,973
Find another wrist
for this watch... Ass;

896
01:09:02,391 --> 01:09:05,057
Hey, you're awesome.
Called him an ass to his face

897
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:06,173
Get lost

898
01:09:06,974 --> 01:09:08,135
It's too noisy here

899
01:09:08,474 --> 01:09:10,381
She's saying 'Thank you',
I hear 'Get lost'

900
01:09:10,557 --> 01:09:13,390
I said 'Get lost'
- Don't get so uptight

901
01:09:13,766 --> 01:09:16,515
Actually, you never
really loved him

902
01:09:16,932 --> 01:09:17,796
What do you mean?

903
01:09:18,182 --> 01:09:22,969
When you see him, do the
winds whisper a melody?

904
01:09:24,515 --> 01:09:26,138
Your scarf flies in slow motion?

905
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,882
The Moon appears gigantic?

906
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:31,960
That happens in movies, not in life

907
01:09:32,098 --> 01:09:35,132
Happens in life too -
if you love a person

908
01:09:35,473 --> 01:09:36,551
...not an ass

909
01:09:41,931 --> 01:09:46,588
Hello. What?

910
01:09:47,681 --> 01:09:51,177
Oh God; Ok, I'm on my way

911
01:09:54,389 --> 01:09:56,297
You're a medical student,
right? Need your help

912
01:09:56,389 --> 01:09:58,095
It's an emergency, please
- What?

913
01:09:58,597 --> 01:10:01,797
Please come with me.
What's that oath you doctors take -

914
01:10:02,014 --> 01:10:04,680
You'll never deny a patient help...
The Hippocratic Oath

915
01:10:05,347 --> 01:10:07,172
Please help me,
it's an emergency

916
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,843
You gatecrash my sister's wedding,
break off my engagement...

917
01:10:15,221 --> 01:10:17,591
my dad is popping
BP pills because of you...

918
01:10:18,096 --> 01:10:19,672
and here I am, helping you;

919
01:10:20,805 --> 01:10:22,002
Unbelievable;

920
01:10:23,179 --> 01:10:27,042
This Hippocratic Oath -
It's really done us in!

921
01:10:31,887 --> 01:10:33,795
Where's Raju, ma'am?
- Gone to get a cab

922
01:10:34,179 --> 01:10:35,671
Called the ambulance
two hours ago

923
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:38,541
In this country,
pizza reaches in 30 minutes

924
01:10:38,762 --> 01:10:39,675
but an ambulance...;

925
01:10:39,929 --> 01:10:42,215
He needs hospitalization.
Urgently

926
01:10:56,344 --> 01:10:57,375
Hey stop;

927
01:10:59,678 --> 01:11:01,917
Move, it's an emergency!

928
01:11:03,553 --> 01:11:04,666
Move... move...

929
01:11:06,636 --> 01:11:07,714
Move... move...

930
01:11:11,761 --> 01:11:13,916
Doctor, emergency!

931
01:11:15,511 --> 01:11:16,423
That's the patient

932
01:11:22,385 --> 01:11:24,459
Keep this. Hey, here's Raju

933
01:11:24,969 --> 01:11:26,876
What the hell;
You brought dad on the scooter

934
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,086
Should I've sent him by courier?

935
01:11:30,468 --> 01:11:33,300
No wisecracks on dads profession!
Where is he?

936
01:11:33,885 --> 01:11:35,709
Go ask the doctor

937
01:11:36,676 --> 01:11:39,923
Close call, Pia. A little delay,
we'd have lost him

938
01:11:40,301 --> 01:11:43,050
Glad you didn't wait for an ambulance
and got him on the scooter

939
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:44,960
Call me if there's a problem

940
01:11:53,884 --> 01:11:56,882
Rancho; Thank you...

941
01:11:58,634 --> 01:12:01,667
Thanking your buddies;
Silencer teaching you manners?

942
01:12:02,884 --> 01:12:05,965
Didn't he teach you -
A friend is man's greatest bosom?

943
01:12:07,758 --> 01:12:10,672
Go on now.
You have an exam tomorrow

944
01:12:11,257 --> 01:12:14,505
Exams we have many...
Dad mostly just one

945
01:12:16,174 --> 01:12:18,461
We won't budge from here
without the Postmaster

946
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:20,039
Don't worry

947
01:12:27,091 --> 01:12:31,249
Rancho, forgive me.
I was scared

948
01:12:31,507 --> 01:12:33,628
It's ok. Quiet, now

949
01:12:36,174 --> 01:12:38,330
Please forgive me

950
01:12:44,924 --> 01:12:48,964
It's ok, calm down.
Go see your dad

951
01:12:49,506 --> 01:12:50,880
And don't go
with that weepy face

952
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:58,168
Thanks buddy

953
01:13:09,755 --> 01:13:14,543
Natty scooter. Saved a life.
How much does it cost?

954
01:13:14,838 --> 01:13:17,161
Pour some mint sauce
on it. It'll tell you

955
01:13:19,796 --> 01:13:21,704
Hey, happy Independence Day

956
01:13:21,963 --> 01:13:23,669
Today isn't Independence Day

957
01:13:24,005 --> 01:13:27,168
For you it is! Now you're free
to wear your mom's watch

958
01:13:27,797 --> 01:13:30,546
No ass can say it's an
ancient piece of junk

959
01:13:32,837 --> 01:13:33,702
Hey

960
01:13:35,671 --> 01:13:37,662
How do you know
it was mom's watch?

961
01:13:39,421 --> 01:13:41,874
At your sister's wedding,
you wore sparkling new clothes

962
01:13:42,671 --> 01:13:43,868
Only the watch was old

963
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:45,417
What could that mean?

964
01:13:47,711 --> 01:13:50,875
You really missed your mom
that day, didn't you?

965
01:13:53,712 --> 01:13:54,742
Yes

966
01:13:55,795 --> 01:13:57,536
Your mom must've been
really beautiful

967
01:14:00,087 --> 01:14:02,243
Yes. How do you know?

968
01:14:02,503 --> 01:14:03,498
Seen your dad?

969
01:14:05,045 --> 01:14:06,703
'Life is a race. If you don't run fast

970
01:14:06,878 --> 01:14:08,501
you'll be a broken egg
...cuckoo bird'

971
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:09,867
You...

972
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:19,789
The winds whisper a melody

973
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:26,744
The sky hums along

974
01:14:28,335 --> 01:14:34,249
Time itself is singing...

975
01:14:35,293 --> 01:14:38,825
Zoobi do...

976
01:14:39,585 --> 01:14:44,159
Param pum

977
01:14:45,793 --> 01:14:50,497
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

978
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:55,783
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

979
01:14:56,459 --> 01:15:01,495
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

980
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:06,491
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

981
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:11,905
Leaves sing on their branches
Bees jam with flowers

982
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:17,031
Crazy sunbeams dance off petals
As birds yodel in the skies

983
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:22,531
Flowers, bold and brazen
Snuggle and cootchie-coo

984
01:15:22,999 --> 01:15:27,574
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

985
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:33,198
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

986
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:38,412
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

987
01:15:39,332 --> 01:15:44,073
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

988
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:49,529
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

989
01:15:52,706 --> 01:15:55,740
Let's make the unique and
ever useful mint sauce

990
01:15:56,164 --> 01:16:01,533
The all-powerful sauce that
exposes phony people

991
01:16:02,456 --> 01:16:04,779
Your 7th house is clear

992
01:16:05,289 --> 01:16:07,446
Shunning an ass,
you 'll fall for a human

993
01:16:07,956 --> 01:16:09,663
Time is ripe for love

994
01:16:14,455 --> 01:16:16,410
Temperature in New Delhi
remains stable

995
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:20,864
Clear skies.
But if in love, expect rain

996
01:16:26,497 --> 01:16:31,119
Pitter-patter go the raindrops
Whish-whoosh whistles the wind

997
01:16:31,621 --> 01:16:36,658
Do-da-dee waltzes the rain
Boom-boom echoes the sky

998
01:16:36,954 --> 01:16:42,026
Drenched in rain and passion
You sway your hips on cue

999
01:16:42,246 --> 01:16:47,033
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

1000
01:16:47,912 --> 01:16:52,487
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1001
01:16:53,328 --> 01:16:57,737
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1002
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:03,236
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1003
01:17:03,954 --> 01:17:08,776
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1004
01:17:30,369 --> 01:17:35,026
The gorgeous low moon
Serenades the earth

1005
01:17:35,536 --> 01:17:40,607
A shooting star skips along
Crooning a ballad of love

1006
01:17:41,118 --> 01:17:45,989
The night is bright but lonesome
Come touch me, my handsome

1007
01:17:46,368 --> 01:17:51,191
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

1008
01:17:52,076 --> 01:17:56,615
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1009
01:17:57,159 --> 01:18:01,982
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1010
01:18:02,659 --> 01:18:07,115
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1011
01:18:07,784 --> 01:18:12,737
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1012
01:18:13,283 --> 01:18:17,656
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi'
...goes my silly heart

1013
01:18:18,575 --> 01:18:26,527
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi'
...goes my silly heart

1014
01:18:33,158 --> 01:18:34,402
Hello. Wake up

1015
01:18:35,325 --> 01:18:37,943
Huh... Postmaster's dead?
- What;

1016
01:18:38,032 --> 01:18:39,525
No, stupid

1017
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:42,272
It's 8.30, your exam is at 9

1018
01:18:42,949 --> 01:18:45,319
But we can't leave him alone

1019
01:18:45,657 --> 01:18:48,442
I'm here.
It's a matter of three hours

1020
01:18:48,532 --> 01:18:51,198
Take my scooter.
It's getting late

1021
01:18:51,657 --> 01:18:52,687
Hey...

1022
01:18:57,111 --> 01:18:58,485
Gosh, what an ancient watch

1023
01:19:05,028 --> 01:19:05,975
Go

1024
01:19:24,068 --> 01:19:26,473
Sorry, we're late
- It was an emergency

1025
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,473
Settle down there

1026
01:19:38,026 --> 01:19:39,269
Sir, they're still writing

1027
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:42,315
Hello. Time up

1028
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:45,769
Please, five minutes.
We started half an hour late

1029
01:19:45,942 --> 01:19:47,139
It was an emergency

1030
01:19:47,234 --> 01:19:51,523
He glared at us like we 'd
asked for both his kidneys

1031
01:19:52,734 --> 01:19:53,895
But we continued writing

1032
01:19:54,858 --> 01:19:57,892
He continued arranging
the answer sheets

1033
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,312
Done, sir

1034
01:20:08,316 --> 01:20:10,935
You're late.
I can't accept these

1035
01:20:11,149 --> 01:20:12,013
Sir, please, sir

1036
01:20:16,565 --> 01:20:17,892
Sir, do you know who we are?

1037
01:20:19,358 --> 01:20:21,182
Prime Ministers son?
Even then...

1038
01:20:21,482 --> 01:20:23,556
I will not accept your paper

1039
01:20:25,065 --> 01:20:27,056
Do you know
our names and roll numbers?

1040
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:29,470
No...

1041
01:20:31,315 --> 01:20:32,345
Who are you?

1042
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,431
He doesn't know: Run!

1043
01:20:36,106 --> 01:20:38,393
Hey, what's your roll number?

1044
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:43,479
Where the hell are their papers?

1045
01:20:47,981 --> 01:20:49,806
O Lord, have mercy

1046
01:20:49,898 --> 01:20:55,680
Today was Results day.
Time to make a deal with God

1047
01:20:55,814 --> 01:20:58,302
Just save my Electronics.
I'll offer a coconut

1048
01:20:58,772 --> 01:21:03,678
Sir Snake, bless my Physics.
I promise a pint of milk per day

1049
01:21:03,897 --> 01:21:07,309
O Mother Cow,
help me pass... have this grass

1050
01:21:07,563 --> 01:21:10,893
I vow: No X-rated thoughts
of girls in my class...

1051
01:21:11,189 --> 01:21:12,645
Watch over my results

1052
01:21:12,855 --> 01:21:16,718
God of Wealth, I'll offer 100 /-
every month

1053
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:19,556
100 /- won't bribe even a traffic cop

1054
01:21:20,271 --> 01:21:22,097
let alone the Almighty

1055
01:21:23,313 --> 01:21:25,386
Check from the bottom

1056
01:21:26,397 --> 01:21:28,517
You are... last

1057
01:21:30,229 --> 01:21:31,142
And you?

1058
01:21:33,187 --> 01:21:34,644
Second last

1059
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:37,306
Rancho?

1060
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:42,807
Not there

1061
01:21:44,187 --> 01:21:45,217
My heart sank

1062
01:21:45,812 --> 01:21:50,220
Not 'cause our ranks tanked,
but 'cause our friend flunked

1063
01:21:52,687 --> 01:21:56,383
There's a mistake.
It's not possible. It's injustice

1064
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:03,434
What's Silencer howling about?

1065
01:22:04,061 --> 01:22:05,009
He got the second rank

1066
01:22:06,935 --> 01:22:08,393
Who's first?

1067
01:22:09,602 --> 01:22:10,716
Rancho

1068
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:14,471
Rancho?

1069
01:22:16,935 --> 01:22:17,765
Move aside

1070
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,847
We learned a lesson
in Human Behavior:

1071
01:22:25,644 --> 01:22:31,012
Your friend fails, you feel bad.
Your friend tops, you feel worse

1072
01:22:31,726 --> 01:22:36,134
We were sad.
Two others were sadder

1073
01:22:37,393 --> 01:22:41,257
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
Front row. Right of the Director

1074
01:22:41,893 --> 01:22:44,179
Uday Sinha. Second row. Third seat

1075
01:22:45,101 --> 01:22:48,348
Alok Mittal. Second row. Fifth seat

1076
01:22:50,142 --> 01:22:52,808
Sahili Rao. Third row...

1077
01:22:52,976 --> 01:22:55,428
Sir, why this seating
according to rank?

1078
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,844
Any problem with that?

1079
01:22:57,975 --> 01:23:02,099
Yes, this grading system is
like a caste system

1080
01:23:02,558 --> 01:23:05,722
A-graders: Masters
C-graders: Slaves

1081
01:23:06,017 --> 01:23:09,299
It's not nice, sir
- You have a better idea?

1082
01:23:09,892 --> 01:23:14,050
Yes. Results should not be
displayed at all

1083
01:23:14,516 --> 01:23:18,593
Why publicise someone's flaws?

1084
01:23:18,891 --> 01:23:23,928
If your iron count is low,
will the doctor prescribe tonic...

1085
01:23:24,058 --> 01:23:25,514
or air your report on TV

1086
01:23:26,350 --> 01:23:27,427
You see, sir?

1087
01:23:28,016 --> 01:23:29,806
So basically,
what you are saying is

1088
01:23:30,307 --> 01:23:32,097
I should personally go to
each student's room

1089
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:34,218
and whisper in his ears...

1090
01:23:35,265 --> 01:23:37,670
'You have come first';
'You're second';

1091
01:23:37,766 --> 01:23:39,342
'Oh, I'm so sorry,
you have failed'

1092
01:23:42,348 --> 01:23:46,721
No sir, I mean
grades create a divide

1093
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:51,012
I've topped, so I'm next to you

1094
01:23:51,265 --> 01:23:53,669
My pals came last,
they're in the back corner

1095
01:23:53,848 --> 01:23:55,389
At least they're in the corner

1096
01:23:55,515 --> 01:23:57,919
More time with you, and
they'll be out of the photo

1097
01:23:59,055 --> 01:24:01,046
They will neither pass,
nor get a job

1098
01:24:01,848 --> 01:24:05,711
They'll get jobs, sir.
There must be some firm that...

1099
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:08,005
prefers humans to machines

1100
01:24:09,888 --> 01:24:11,714
They'll get jobs. I guarantee

1101
01:24:13,722 --> 01:24:16,044
You guarantee it;

1102
01:24:16,264 --> 01:24:17,804
Bet, sir?

1103
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,507
Govind
- Yes, sir?

1104
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:29,962
Even if one of them gets
a job in campus interviews...

1105
01:24:31,179 --> 01:24:32,376
shave off my moustache

1106
01:24:35,138 --> 01:24:36,003
Sir!

1107
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:39,337
Happy?
- Smile, please

1108
01:24:40,637 --> 01:24:41,585
Happy, sir

1109
01:24:46,554 --> 01:24:49,552
Jackass;
Honking to hide your tooting

1110
01:24:50,095 --> 01:24:52,797
Septic tank; Popping pills again?

1111
01:24:53,054 --> 01:24:55,720
I didn't do it... Raju?

1112
01:24:55,928 --> 01:24:57,551
This is a familiar stink

1113
01:24:57,637 --> 01:25:00,670
He's the sole cause for
global warming

1114
01:25:25,927 --> 01:25:28,545
Toss me your wallet: I'll buy pants

1115
01:25:29,135 --> 01:25:33,295
Take Chatur's suit instead
- Don't touch my suit

1116
01:25:34,468 --> 01:25:36,258
Rancho'll recognize you
even in underwear

1117
01:25:36,426 --> 01:25:40,420
Where's this?
- If I could read, would I sell peanuts?

1118
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:43,206
He can't read
- But he can speak

1119
01:25:43,426 --> 01:25:47,420
Wait. Do you know a
Ranchhoddas Chanchad?

1120
01:25:47,635 --> 01:25:49,376
Yes, he lives there

1121
01:25:50,051 --> 01:25:55,384
Free as the wind was he

1122
01:25:57,384 --> 01:26:02,799
Like a soaring kite was he

1123
01:26:04,467 --> 01:26:06,754
Where did he go...

1124
01:26:06,967 --> 01:26:09,206
let's find him

1125
01:26:09,342 --> 01:26:12,008
Chatur, your pills
- Thanks. Where were they?

1126
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:14,585
In the pocket
- Hey, my pants!

1127
01:26:14,717 --> 01:26:16,708
Karl Marx says to
share all resources

1128
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:20,255
Hey, you'll give people ideas

1129
01:26:21,799 --> 01:26:22,830
I want it now

1130
01:26:38,091 --> 01:26:39,204
What happened?

1131
01:26:41,341 --> 01:26:42,538
Rancho's father

1132
01:26:46,049 --> 01:26:48,798
Excuse me,
where is Ranchhoddas?

1133
01:26:49,632 --> 01:26:52,037
There he is
- Thank you

1134
01:27:15,214 --> 01:27:18,377
Rancho...
- Yes?

1135
01:27:18,963 --> 01:27:22,661
Sorry. We're looking for Ranchhoddas

1136
01:27:23,672 --> 01:27:24,999
I am Ranchhoddas

1137
01:27:25,589 --> 01:27:29,499
No, I mean... 'Ranchhoddas
Shamaldas Chanchad'

1138
01:27:30,921 --> 01:27:33,492
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad. That's me

1139
01:27:38,963 --> 01:27:41,249
Ranchhoddas, take care, son

1140
01:28:00,545 --> 01:28:02,666
'Ranchhoddas Chanchad'

1141
01:28:09,837 --> 01:28:10,866
Raju

1142
01:28:36,127 --> 01:28:39,742
I'll be in the Guinness Book for
driving Delhi-Shimla in underwear

1143
01:28:39,877 --> 01:28:40,991
That too, for the wrong guy;

1144
01:28:41,502 --> 01:28:45,448
Same name, same degree,
same photo, but a different guy

1145
01:28:46,002 --> 01:28:47,494
What's going on?

1146
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:50,876
How did Silencer get
Rancho's address?

1147
01:28:52,043 --> 01:28:52,907
Good point!

1148
01:28:54,335 --> 01:28:55,744
Hey Chatur, come here

1149
01:29:02,043 --> 01:29:05,539
How dare you open this?
I got this from San Francisco

1150
01:29:05,584 --> 01:29:07,125
Handmade biscuits

1151
01:29:08,918 --> 01:29:11,204
Specially for Mr. Phunsukh Wangdu

1152
01:29:11,459 --> 01:29:13,615
Phunsukh Bangdu?
Who's that?

1153
01:29:13,709 --> 01:29:18,282
Not Bangdu. Wangdu. 'W'.
Phunsukh Wangdu

1154
01:29:18,417 --> 01:29:21,249
Do you know who that is?
He's a great scientist

1155
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:24,035
400 patents.
The world wants him

1156
01:29:25,083 --> 01:29:28,531
Took me a year
to get an appointment

1157
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:34,742
Once he signs the deal with
my company, I'll be huge!

1158
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:38,992
Forget Wangdu.
How'd you get Rancho's address?

1159
01:29:39,125 --> 01:29:41,080
You should be thanking
Phunsukh Wangdu

1160
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:45,036
He led me to Rancho, See this

1161
01:29:47,207 --> 01:29:51,616
My secretary was here to fix
an appointment with Wangdu

1162
01:29:51,748 --> 01:29:56,073
She didn't get the appointment.
But I found Rancho

1163
01:29:56,207 --> 01:30:01,824
I checked the Shimla directory
and found Rancho's name

1164
01:30:01,873 --> 01:30:03,532
What happened to his face?

1165
01:30:03,915 --> 01:30:06,201
Plastic surgery
in honor of your visit?

1166
01:30:10,623 --> 01:30:12,447
Only one man has the answer

1167
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:17,661
Sorry Papa,
I couldn't fulfill your last wish

1168
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:22,945
You kept asking me
to take you on pilgrimage

1169
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:26,360
But I waited
for the highway tender

1170
01:30:27,872 --> 01:30:32,329
There the tender opened,
here you closed your eyes

1171
01:30:36,413 --> 01:30:40,905
I am so sorry, Papa.
I could not be a good son...

1172
01:30:41,079 --> 01:30:42,407
Wrong

1173
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:45,704
You're an engineer.
Your degree's on the wall!

1174
01:30:45,996 --> 01:30:47,276
You were a very good son

1175
01:30:49,913 --> 01:30:54,654
How dare you barge in?
I'll have you arrested

1176
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:58,029
No, you'll be arrested.
We've made enquiries

1177
01:30:58,288 --> 01:31:01,404
You use the degree
to clinch contracts

1178
01:31:01,871 --> 01:31:05,117
It's our friend's degree.
How did you get it?

1179
01:31:20,703 --> 01:31:22,113
This is a 150 acre estate

1180
01:31:22,536 --> 01:31:25,736
If I shoot and bury you,
no one would even notice

1181
01:31:26,078 --> 01:31:26,990
Get the point?

1182
01:31:28,328 --> 01:31:29,193
Now get lost

1183
01:31:34,744 --> 01:31:39,069
I'm taking Papa's ashes to the
sacred river. Can take yours too

1184
01:31:46,536 --> 01:31:48,112
Grab Papa!

1185
01:31:51,036 --> 01:31:52,149
Here, here

1186
01:31:56,285 --> 01:31:57,315
Let go of Papa;

1187
01:32:00,244 --> 01:32:03,075
Tell the truth or
Papa is flushed;

1188
01:32:03,201 --> 01:32:06,116
Hand over Papa
- Papa goes to the sacred sewer

1189
01:32:06,827 --> 01:32:10,157
Get Papa out of the potty
- You pull trigger, I pull flush.

1190
01:32:10,285 --> 01:32:11,611
I'll count to three

1191
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:15,356
Wanna shoot us?
Raju, scatter the ashes

1192
01:32:18,075 --> 01:32:19,070
One

1193
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:23,983
Take us down,
and Papa's down the drain

1194
01:32:25,241 --> 01:32:26,155
Two

1195
01:32:26,242 --> 01:32:28,695
Then grope for him in the gutter

1196
01:32:28,826 --> 01:32:29,690
What is it, Raju?

1197
01:32:31,116 --> 01:32:33,606
We've got the wrong urn.
It's empty;

1198
01:32:34,492 --> 01:32:35,404
Empty?

1199
01:32:36,784 --> 01:32:40,231
Empty: we'll empty it out;

1200
01:32:40,367 --> 01:32:41,231
No, no;

1201
01:32:41,325 --> 01:32:44,192
We'll empty it out

1202
01:32:44,283 --> 01:32:46,736
No... hands up!

1203
01:32:49,033 --> 01:32:52,066
Who are you?

1204
01:32:52,241 --> 01:32:53,354
I am Rancho

1205
01:32:54,658 --> 01:32:57,110
I swear on Papa, it's true

1206
01:32:57,324 --> 01:32:59,114
I am Rancho;
That was Chhote.

1207
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,070
Chhote?

1208
01:33:02,448 --> 01:33:07,438
He was our gardener's son, Chhote

1209
01:33:09,407 --> 01:33:12,238
He stayed on with us
after he was orphaned

1210
01:33:14,449 --> 01:33:22,270
Did odd jobs around the house,
ran errands

1211
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:24,977
He had a passion for learning

1212
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:30,905
He'd wear my old uniform
and slip into school

1213
01:33:32,906 --> 01:33:35,857
And attend any class he liked.
It suited me

1214
01:33:36,822 --> 01:33:42,855
I made him do my homework,
take my exams

1215
01:33:43,405 --> 01:33:46,439
It was going well, till
one day...

1216
01:33:46,864 --> 01:33:51,437
Our teacher saw a sixth grader
doing tenth grade math

1217
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,028
Which grade are you in, son?

1218
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:55,435
What's your name?

1219
01:33:56,405 --> 01:33:57,352
We got caught

1220
01:33:58,488 --> 01:33:59,897
Papa was a powerful man, so...

1221
01:34:00,029 --> 01:34:03,526
our teacher alerted him
before going to the Principal

1222
01:34:04,029 --> 01:34:07,975
You started it, you will finish it

1223
01:34:10,696 --> 01:34:13,480
People pretend to show me respect

1224
01:34:14,195 --> 01:34:16,399
But behind my back...

1225
01:34:17,363 --> 01:34:18,985
mock me as an illiterate

1226
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:22,024
I won't let that happen to my son

1227
01:34:23,111 --> 01:34:27,436
This boy wants to study.
I want just a degree

1228
01:34:27,987 --> 01:34:29,942
Let the game go on

1229
01:34:30,944 --> 01:34:32,568
Make this kid an engineer

1230
01:34:33,819 --> 01:34:39,188
and I'll have a degree
in my son's name on that wall

1231
01:34:39,528 --> 01:34:43,521
I went to London for four years,
he went to college as me

1232
01:34:45,194 --> 01:34:51,357
He'd promised to cut contact with all
after getting the degree

1233
01:34:53,402 --> 01:35:01,982
But he always said,
'Two idiots will come looking for me'

1234
01:35:06,694 --> 01:35:08,351
He really misses you both

1235
01:35:10,776 --> 01:35:14,722
I'll give you his address,
go to him

1236
01:35:18,067 --> 01:35:21,563
But please keep my secret

1237
01:35:23,442 --> 01:35:24,603
What secret?

1238
01:35:37,942 --> 01:35:41,437
You got the wrong urn, sir.
Papa is in here

1239
01:35:43,649 --> 01:35:46,220
What the hell's going on?
Who was that gun guy?

1240
01:35:46,275 --> 01:35:49,806
Complicated story.
Without subtitles. Not for you

1241
01:35:49,858 --> 01:35:52,144
Ignore it
- Where're we going?

1242
01:35:53,483 --> 01:35:54,395
Ladakh

1243
01:35:54,441 --> 01:35:55,815
Ladakh! Why?

1244
01:35:56,524 --> 01:35:57,472
To meet Rancho

1245
01:35:57,649 --> 01:36:00,647
What's he doing in Ladakh?

1246
01:36:00,691 --> 01:36:04,270
No clue. We have
the address of a school

1247
01:36:04,524 --> 01:36:07,605
School teacher!

1248
01:36:08,482 --> 01:36:11,895
I'm Vice President of
Rockledge Corporation, and he...

1249
01:36:12,315 --> 01:36:14,601
A for Apple, B for Ball...

1250
01:36:14,774 --> 01:36:15,970
D for Donkey

1251
01:36:16,690 --> 01:36:21,643
Next week I sign a huge deal
with Phunsukh Wangdu

1252
01:36:21,815 --> 01:36:24,848
And he... A for Apple, B for Ball...

1253
01:36:28,564 --> 01:36:30,970
Today my respect
for that idiot shot up

1254
01:36:31,898 --> 01:36:34,221
Most of us went to college
just for a degree

1255
01:36:34,814 --> 01:36:39,021
No degree meant
no plum job, no pretty wife...

1256
01:36:39,315 --> 01:36:41,884
no credit card, no social status

1257
01:36:42,564 --> 01:36:44,389
None of this mattered to him

1258
01:36:44,523 --> 01:36:46,347
He was in college
for the joy of learning

1259
01:36:46,856 --> 01:36:50,138
He never cared
if he was first or last

1260
01:36:50,731 --> 01:36:53,053
Who was the first man
on the Moon?

1261
01:36:53,314 --> 01:36:54,510
Neil Armstrong, sir

1262
01:36:54,605 --> 01:36:56,761
Obviously, it is Neil Armstrong.
We all know it

1263
01:36:56,938 --> 01:36:58,183
Who was the second?

1264
01:36:58,689 --> 01:37:00,311
Don't waste your time.
It's not important

1265
01:37:00,772 --> 01:37:03,260
Nobody remembers the man
who ever came second

1266
01:37:04,396 --> 01:37:09,847
Soon, 26 companies
will be here with job offers

1267
01:37:10,313 --> 01:37:15,977
You'll have a job
even before your final exam

1268
01:37:16,729 --> 01:37:18,601
This is your last lap, my friends

1269
01:37:18,937 --> 01:37:21,142
Put the pedal to the metal.
Step on the gas

1270
01:37:21,229 --> 01:37:23,220
Go out there and make history!

1271
01:37:26,645 --> 01:37:27,842
Any questions?

1272
01:37:30,395 --> 01:37:31,308
Yes?

1273
01:37:32,645 --> 01:37:36,259
Sir, suppose a student gets a job...

1274
01:37:36,645 --> 01:37:43,933
but narrowly fails the final exam,
will he still have the job?

1275
01:37:44,437 --> 01:37:45,764
Very good question

1276
01:37:49,019 --> 01:37:51,389
Anyone else
with the same question?

1277
01:37:53,311 --> 01:37:54,638
As expected

1278
01:37:56,978 --> 01:38:00,094
Please come on stage.
Give them a big hand

1279
01:38:11,269 --> 01:38:13,555
For the last four years

1280
01:38:13,602 --> 01:38:16,553
they've been our most
consistent students

1281
01:38:16,685 --> 01:38:20,015
Consistently last in every exam

1282
01:38:20,852 --> 01:38:22,226
Come my geniuses, come

1283
01:38:23,684 --> 01:38:29,302
Their brains will fetch
a handsome price

1284
01:38:30,017 --> 01:38:33,051
'Cause they're completely unused

1285
01:38:35,559 --> 01:38:36,802
And to answer their question -

1286
01:38:37,183 --> 01:38:40,515
The exam won't affect their jobs

1287
01:38:41,308 --> 01:38:44,839
Because no company
will hire them anyway!

1288
01:38:45,683 --> 01:38:48,717
They're so unique, their
names will be writ in gold -

1289
01:38:49,017 --> 01:38:51,932
'Farhanitrate' and 'Prerajulization'

1290
01:38:52,016 --> 01:38:53,510
Give them a big hand,
please, everybody

1291
01:39:02,599 --> 01:39:07,471
He screwed us;

1292
01:39:07,599 --> 01:39:09,555
In front of everyone

1293
01:39:10,682 --> 01:39:15,802
God, I'll give up meat,
light a 1000 incense sticks

1294
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:17,680
Do me just one favor -

1295
01:39:17,766 --> 01:39:20,218
Delete Virus!

1296
01:39:21,849 --> 01:39:23,839
Burn him in hell

1297
01:39:25,223 --> 01:39:29,052
Fry Virus-nuggets in bubbling oil

1298
01:39:29,806 --> 01:39:32,674
You think God is a contract killer?

1299
01:39:33,307 --> 01:39:34,585
You shut up

1300
01:39:35,307 --> 01:39:38,221
You're in the center
of the photo every year

1301
01:39:38,265 --> 01:39:40,220
We're rotting in the corner

1302
01:39:41,265 --> 01:39:44,297
This year we may fall
out of the photo altogether

1303
01:39:46,764 --> 01:39:48,590
Know why I come first?
- Why?

1304
01:39:49,014 --> 01:39:50,721
Because I love machines

1305
01:39:51,514 --> 01:39:53,339
Engineering is my passion

1306
01:39:54,389 --> 01:39:55,633
Know your passion?

1307
01:39:58,472 --> 01:40:00,178
That's my bag
- Be quiet

1308
01:40:01,138 --> 01:40:02,466
What're you up to?

1309
01:40:04,889 --> 01:40:07,045
This... is your passion

1310
01:40:08,263 --> 01:40:09,721
Go post this letter

1311
01:40:10,097 --> 01:40:11,376
What letter?

1312
01:40:14,138 --> 01:40:18,427
5 years ago he wrote this for
his favorite wildlife photographer

1313
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:21,964
Andre...
- Istvan

1314
01:40:22,929 --> 01:40:26,544
He wanted to train with him
in Hungary

1315
01:40:27,471 --> 01:40:30,801
But in fear of his dad, the Fuhrer,
never posted it

1316
01:40:32,512 --> 01:40:36,092
Quit Engineering, marry Photography

1317
01:40:37,054 --> 01:40:39,045
Follow your talent

1318
01:40:42,178 --> 01:40:46,218
If Michael Jackson's dad
forced him to be a boxer...

1319
01:40:47,011 --> 01:40:50,542
and Mohammad Ali's dad
pushed him to be a singer...

1320
01:40:51,261 --> 01:40:52,589
imagine the disaster

1321
01:40:54,636 --> 01:40:57,172
Do you get it?

1322
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:04,049
Idiot; Loves Photography,
but is marrying machines

1323
01:41:08,677 --> 01:41:10,087
Your Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

1324
01:41:11,386 --> 01:41:15,544
Engineering is
my wife and mistress both

1325
01:41:16,968 --> 01:41:19,504
But I still fail. Why?
- Explain

1326
01:41:20,635 --> 01:41:23,005
'Cause you're a coward,
scared of the future

1327
01:41:24,718 --> 01:41:29,210
Look at this -
more holy rings than fingers

1328
01:41:29,759 --> 01:41:32,959
One ring per fear -
exam, sis's dowry, job

1329
01:41:34,426 --> 01:41:38,206
With such fear of tomorrow,
how'll you live today?

1330
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:40,710
How'll you focus on studies?

1331
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:45,126
Strange buddies; One lives
in fear, the other in pretense

1332
01:41:46,134 --> 01:41:51,502
You live in both: fear and pretense

1333
01:41:51,717 --> 01:41:57,796
You're scared to tell Pia you
love her... so you pretend you don't

1334
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:02,374
What rubbish!

1335
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:07,085
Easy to offer free advice,
tough to follow it

1336
01:42:07,175 --> 01:42:10,421
Have the guts? Go confess to Pia.

1337
01:42:10,883 --> 01:42:14,746
There's no connection!
- Deep connection, Your Holiness

1338
01:42:14,841 --> 01:42:20,340
Listen, if you confess to Pia

1339
01:42:20,758 --> 01:42:25,214
I'll tell Dad: No Engineering,
I'm marrying Photography

1340
01:42:26,383 --> 01:42:30,044
And I'll dump my rings
before the job interview

1341
01:42:30,465 --> 01:42:31,544
Deal?

1342
01:42:33,757 --> 01:42:35,415
Have the guts?

1343
01:42:35,548 --> 01:42:37,835
His Holiness is speechless

1344
01:42:43,882 --> 01:42:44,747
Let's go

1345
01:42:49,798 --> 01:42:51,125
Follow me
- Where?

1346
01:42:56,756 --> 01:42:58,297
Let's go

1347
01:42:58,797 --> 01:43:01,922
Hey Virus; I'm anti-Virus

1348
01:43:01,922 --> 01:43:03,631
Hope no dog here

1349
01:43:03,631 --> 01:43:05,954
Cowards! Let's go

1350
01:43:06,089 --> 01:43:09,786
If any danger,
I'll give the Virus alert

1351
01:43:22,004 --> 01:43:23,628
Beware: Virus inside

1352
01:43:44,212 --> 01:43:45,409
Need background score?

1353
01:43:45,628 --> 01:43:46,623
Pia
- Who's it?

1354
01:43:49,379 --> 01:43:53,076
Don't yell! It's me, Rancho

1355
01:43:55,004 --> 01:43:58,416
Just listen for a moment,
then I'm gone

1356
01:43:58,712 --> 01:44:01,116
Say not a word...

1357
01:44:01,462 --> 01:44:02,456
Pia...
- Yes?

1358
01:44:04,586 --> 01:44:07,916
Those 22 minutes with you
on the scooter

1359
01:44:08,753 --> 01:44:13,326
were the most enchanting
22 minutes of my life

1360
01:44:17,752 --> 01:44:23,167
I could spend an eternity
with you on the scooter

1361
01:44:23,293 --> 01:44:24,158
Wow

1362
01:44:25,419 --> 01:44:28,535
...and time stands still

1363
01:44:29,585 --> 01:44:36,993
Every night you ride into my dreams
on your scooter, dressed as a bride

1364
01:44:40,001 --> 01:44:42,324
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet

1365
01:44:45,793 --> 01:44:48,744
and come close to kiss me

1366
01:44:51,834 --> 01:44:54,120
But that kiss doesn't happen

1367
01:44:54,959 --> 01:44:55,871
Why?

1368
01:44:56,209 --> 01:44:59,373
Because the noses collide,
and I wake up

1369
01:45:00,459 --> 01:45:02,117
The noses never collide, stupid!

1370
01:45:07,208 --> 01:45:10,325
I'm sorry,
I thought you were Pia

1371
01:45:10,917 --> 01:45:11,864
I wish I was

1372
01:45:12,166 --> 01:45:13,956
Sis, why did you interrupt?

1373
01:45:14,417 --> 01:45:16,241
It took him four years
to say this

1374
01:45:16,458 --> 01:45:19,491
Pia, kiss him.
Show that noses don't collide

1375
01:45:19,583 --> 01:45:22,830
You have my permission,
kiss him... He's so cute!

1376
01:45:23,375 --> 01:45:25,033
Who's this?
- My sister

1377
01:45:26,041 --> 01:45:27,071
Who're you?

1378
01:45:36,749 --> 01:45:40,494
When you were talking,
he kicked. First time;

1379
01:45:40,541 --> 01:45:44,368
He? How do you know
it's a 'he' or 'she'?

1380
01:45:44,666 --> 01:45:48,706
Papa asked the astrologer If we'd
get an engineer or a doctor

1381
01:45:49,665 --> 01:45:50,577
Meaning?

1382
01:45:50,748 --> 01:45:53,616
Boy becomes an engineer,
girl a doctor

1383
01:45:54,415 --> 01:45:59,914
Champ, better stay inside.
Out here's a circus

1384
01:46:00,998 --> 01:46:04,742
Your grandpa is the ringmaster.
He'll crack his whip -

1385
01:46:04,873 --> 01:46:10,288
'Run! Life is a race.
Be an engineer'

1386
01:46:11,122 --> 01:46:16,359
But you follow your heart.
If grandpa scares you...

1387
01:46:17,164 --> 01:46:20,529
put your hand on your heart
and say, 'All is well'

1388
01:46:21,413 --> 01:46:22,195
He kicked

1389
01:46:24,205 --> 01:46:25,283
Say it again

1390
01:46:26,497 --> 01:46:28,120
All is well

1391
01:46:28,996 --> 01:46:30,703
Kicked again

1392
01:46:32,330 --> 01:46:35,327
Once more
- All is well

1393
01:46:39,829 --> 01:46:43,989
All is well

1394
01:46:44,579 --> 01:46:45,527
Who is it?

1395
01:46:46,371 --> 01:46:47,366
Go

1396
01:46:48,037 --> 01:46:53,073
You sent hate-mail to Dad,
here's pee-mail for you

1397
01:46:53,162 --> 01:46:57,618
Enjoy the pee-mail, happy reading;

1398
01:47:04,079 --> 01:47:06,828
Who is it?
- Your future son-in-law

1399
01:47:07,078 --> 01:47:08,571
And the wedding party

1400
01:47:09,411 --> 01:47:10,490
Rastogi;

1401
01:47:12,911 --> 01:47:14,737
Security, that way

1402
01:47:44,327 --> 01:47:48,071
So you all have already learned
about the simple pendulum

1403
01:47:48,785 --> 01:47:52,695
Now let's get down to the advanced
study about compound pendulum

1404
01:47:54,118 --> 01:47:58,111
It's an irregular object
oscillating about its own axis

1405
01:47:58,534 --> 01:47:59,612
Let me demonstrate to you

1406
01:48:00,201 --> 01:48:02,156
What's this?
- Pencil

1407
01:48:02,450 --> 01:48:03,908
What's inside?
- Lead

1408
01:48:03,950 --> 01:48:06,107
Good. Lead is the axis to this pencil

1409
01:48:06,617 --> 01:48:09,615
Even you can be a compound
pendulum, if you oscillate about...

1410
01:48:17,242 --> 01:48:19,861
Where is Raju Rastogi?
- Present, sir

1411
01:48:27,324 --> 01:48:29,232
Hi. Everybody is here

1412
01:48:30,908 --> 01:48:31,986
Good morning, sir

1413
01:48:32,908 --> 01:48:34,105
Where were you last night?

1414
01:48:34,658 --> 01:48:37,739
Studying all night, sir
- Studying?

1415
01:48:37,908 --> 01:48:38,856
Really?

1416
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:41,989
Hasn't slept two nights,
that's why he looks scruffy

1417
01:48:42,074 --> 01:48:42,986
Not slept?

1418
01:48:43,158 --> 01:48:44,187
What did you study?

1419
01:48:45,282 --> 01:48:49,323
Induction motor, sir.
The whole chapter

1420
01:48:49,616 --> 01:48:50,528
Whole chapter?

1421
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:52,777
In that case, Mr. Ra ju Rastogi...

1422
01:48:52,865 --> 01:48:53,778
Yessir!

1423
01:48:53,907 --> 01:48:56,573
Can you tell us how an
induction motor starts?

1424
01:49:04,656 --> 01:49:05,569
Stop it

1425
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:15,526
Sir, rum

1426
01:49:17,406 --> 01:49:18,436
Mr. Rastogi

1427
01:49:18,906 --> 01:49:21,276
Let's have a cup of tea
in my office

1428
01:49:27,363 --> 01:49:28,312
Sir?

1429
01:49:29,489 --> 01:49:30,401
Close the door

1430
01:49:35,655 --> 01:49:36,733
Can you type?

1431
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:38,895
Yes, sir

1432
01:49:39,072 --> 01:49:40,564
Will you type a letter for me?

1433
01:49:42,655 --> 01:49:43,733
Definitely, sir

1434
01:49:44,030 --> 01:49:44,978
Come, sit

1435
01:49:45,738 --> 01:49:46,768
Sir, I'm sorry sir...

1436
01:49:49,154 --> 01:49:50,102
Please type

1437
01:49:51,779 --> 01:49:52,609
Dear Sir...

1438
01:49:53,571 --> 01:49:56,984
It is my painful duty to inform you...

1439
01:49:58,279 --> 01:50:00,946
that your son is rusticated...

1440
01:50:01,738 --> 01:50:04,307
No, sorry, delete that.
Go back

1441
01:50:05,029 --> 01:50:09,105
Your son, Mr. Raju Rastogi...

1442
01:50:10,195 --> 01:50:14,354
is rusticated from the
Imperial College of Engineering

1443
01:50:14,945 --> 01:50:16,354
Come on, type

1444
01:50:23,819 --> 01:50:25,526
It'll kill my dad, sir

1445
01:50:25,694 --> 01:50:27,484
Please type
- Sir, please sir

1446
01:50:27,944 --> 01:50:31,890
My decision is final and
irrevocable

1447
01:50:33,944 --> 01:50:39,099
He lives just to see me
become an engineer

1448
01:50:39,152 --> 01:50:43,442
Should've thought of that
before peeing on my door

1449
01:50:43,569 --> 01:50:48,024
Sir, give me one chance... please

1450
01:50:53,610 --> 01:50:57,023
Ok, remove your name
from the letter...

1451
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:00,516
and put in Rancho's

1452
01:51:01,943 --> 01:51:04,146
I know he was with you
last night

1453
01:51:04,984 --> 01:51:09,060
Be my witness and
I'll spare you

1454
01:51:12,609 --> 01:51:16,650
You have 7 1/2 minutes to think

1455
01:52:03,731 --> 01:52:08,685
We won't let go of you

1456
01:52:10,107 --> 01:52:15,605
We're not done yet... no way

1457
01:52:17,731 --> 01:52:20,931
The heavens may beckon you

1458
01:52:21,022 --> 01:52:24,223
But we'll take up arms against God

1459
01:52:24,273 --> 01:52:30,352
And it's not a fight we intend to lose

1460
01:52:30,897 --> 01:52:34,014
You may try your best to escape

1461
01:52:34,147 --> 01:52:37,346
Try with all your might

1462
01:52:37,522 --> 01:52:44,135
But there is no way
we are letting go of you

1463
01:52:44,730 --> 01:52:50,809
We won't let go of you

1464
01:52:51,271 --> 01:52:57,552
We're not done yet... no way

1465
01:52:59,396 --> 01:53:02,145
Rancho, watch that monitor

1466
01:53:02,438 --> 01:53:03,219
Raju

1467
01:53:05,021 --> 01:53:08,184
His body is paralyzed with shock,
but his mind is alert

1468
01:53:08,687 --> 01:53:13,012
He can see and hear us.
Please don't cry in front of him

1469
01:53:14,854 --> 01:53:19,262
Speak to him normally,
motivate him, joke around

1470
01:53:22,270 --> 01:53:24,936
Good news, Raju.
Your dad's recovered

1471
01:53:25,104 --> 01:53:26,512
The new medicine worked

1472
01:53:26,936 --> 01:53:29,769
Is this your family tradition -

1473
01:53:30,561 --> 01:53:33,936
As one male gets up,
the other conks out?

1474
01:53:33,936 --> 01:53:35,594
Come, wake up

1475
01:53:36,477 --> 01:53:37,887
Your dad wants Pia's scooter

1476
01:53:38,020 --> 01:53:41,847
Should I give it to him?
Hope he won't dent it

1477
01:53:47,852 --> 01:53:52,177
Raju, Farhan is live on webcam.
From the hostel

1478
01:53:54,435 --> 01:53:57,268
Look, Virus has canceled
your suspension order

1479
01:53:57,602 --> 01:53:59,842
Problem solved... Wake up now

1480
01:54:00,144 --> 01:54:02,893
Everything's resolved;
You hear that?

1481
01:54:03,268 --> 01:54:06,100
Rise and shine, buddy

1482
01:54:07,685 --> 01:54:10,884
In this journey of few strides

1483
01:54:11,101 --> 01:54:14,052
On the path called life

1484
01:54:14,268 --> 01:54:20,098
Don't quit...
Just celebrate the ride

1485
01:54:20,893 --> 01:54:24,056
Listen please to those
who love you

1486
01:54:24,184 --> 01:54:27,217
Every dark night is
followed by sunrise

1487
01:54:27,559 --> 01:54:32,797
Don't shut out those
who love you

1488
01:54:33,017 --> 01:54:39,512
We won't let go of you

1489
01:54:39,641 --> 01:54:45,970
We're not done yet... no way

1490
01:54:46,183 --> 01:54:52,594
We won't let go of you

1491
01:54:52,724 --> 01:55:00,297
We're not done yet... no way

1492
01:55:03,641 --> 01:55:07,504
Look, mom bought a new saree
- Brand new

1493
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:09,264
It cost 2000 /-

1494
01:55:09,932 --> 01:55:11,175
Wake up now

1495
01:55:12,348 --> 01:55:14,469
She bought not one,
but ten sarees

1496
01:55:14,932 --> 01:55:15,844
Look!

1497
01:55:17,932 --> 01:55:19,045
Hey Raju;

1498
01:55:19,098 --> 01:55:22,132
C'mon tell me... How do I look?

1499
01:55:23,223 --> 01:55:26,305
Remember the letters
mom would write...

1500
01:55:26,432 --> 01:55:29,548
Always blessed you
with eternal life

1501
01:55:29,723 --> 01:55:35,837
Don't die on her... you can 't die

1502
01:55:36,223 --> 01:55:39,423
Look at us now, don't turn away

1503
01:55:39,555 --> 01:55:42,672
Smile once to show you care

1504
01:55:42,847 --> 01:55:51,427
Wake up,
don't torment us anymore

1505
01:55:55,472 --> 01:55:59,631
Did you hear about your sis?

1506
01:56:00,555 --> 01:56:03,256
She's getting married

1507
01:56:04,263 --> 01:56:05,590
Without any dowry

1508
01:56:06,263 --> 01:56:11,169
The bridegroom wants
nothing at all

1509
01:56:11,388 --> 01:56:14,883
He just wants Kammo

1510
01:56:15,512 --> 01:56:19,672
You know who the bridegroom is?
- Yeah

1511
01:56:19,721 --> 01:56:20,585
Guess;

1512
01:56:20,637 --> 01:56:22,544
You know him very well
- Yes

1513
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:24,379
He loves animals
- Huh...?

1514
01:56:24,554 --> 01:56:27,220
He's going to be a
wildlife photographer

1515
01:56:27,304 --> 01:56:28,880
Quiet... Shhhh...

1516
01:56:28,970 --> 01:56:32,134
Didn't get it? It's our Farhan

1517
01:56:33,095 --> 01:56:37,219
Farhan will never take any dowry

1518
01:56:37,803 --> 01:56:42,212
Farhan will marry your sister

1519
01:56:42,636 --> 01:56:46,795
For free; Free! Free;

1520
01:56:51,386 --> 01:56:53,791
Raju

1521
01:56:56,927 --> 01:57:00,707
One kilo okra, 500 grams cheese
for 'free' would've woken him

1522
01:57:01,094 --> 01:57:02,800
Why sacrifice me...!

1523
01:57:03,093 --> 01:57:05,084
Well done, buddy

1524
01:57:05,886 --> 01:57:09,417
So it's all fixed -
Farhan will marry your sister

1525
01:57:10,510 --> 01:57:11,505
Rancho

1526
01:57:14,135 --> 01:57:17,298
Rascals... Stop fibbing

1527
01:57:19,884 --> 01:57:20,915
Lucky escape;

1528
01:57:21,093 --> 01:57:27,505
We won't let go of you

1529
01:57:27,634 --> 01:57:34,045
We're not done yet... no way

1530
01:57:34,259 --> 01:57:40,623
We won't let go of you

1531
01:57:40,801 --> 01:57:46,797
We're not done yet... no way

1532
01:57:46,842 --> 01:57:53,337
We won 't let go of you

1533
01:57:53,674 --> 01:57:55,416
'Okra Rs.12 / kilo'

1534
01:58:04,716 --> 01:58:06,292
You called for a taxi?

1535
01:58:06,341 --> 01:58:08,130
I did
- It's waiting

1536
01:58:08,257 --> 01:58:09,750
Thank you. Why?

1537
01:58:10,174 --> 01:58:11,501
I'm going to the job interview

1538
01:58:11,757 --> 01:58:13,001
You coming with me?

1539
01:58:13,382 --> 01:58:18,004
No. I'm going for the interview.
You're going home

1540
01:58:18,132 --> 01:58:19,506
Why would I go home?

1541
01:58:21,007 --> 01:58:24,455
Remember, we promised
this rascal

1542
01:58:27,799 --> 01:58:29,872
Give me your tie

1543
01:58:31,423 --> 01:58:32,288
Why?

1544
01:58:32,506 --> 01:58:36,417
I doubt you'll go for the
interview after reading this

1545
01:58:37,339 --> 01:58:38,251
What's that?

1546
01:58:38,423 --> 01:58:41,290
A letter
- For you, from Hungary

1547
01:58:41,631 --> 01:58:44,250
Some photographer
called Andre Istvan

1548
01:58:52,172 --> 01:58:53,962
You posted my letter!

1549
01:58:54,130 --> 01:58:55,837
He loved your pictures

1550
01:58:56,297 --> 01:58:58,964
The guy wants you to assist him...

1551
01:58:59,755 --> 01:59:03,286
in the Brazilian rain forest,
for a year

1552
01:59:03,631 --> 01:59:05,253
Will pay you, too

1553
01:59:21,171 --> 01:59:22,450
Dad will never agree

1554
01:59:25,045 --> 01:59:27,713
Go speak to him...
from your heart

1555
01:59:29,379 --> 01:59:30,540
For once, dump your fears...

1556
01:59:31,212 --> 01:59:37,244
or someday, on your deathbed,
you'll regret it

1557
01:59:37,754 --> 01:59:40,325
You'll remember that the letter was
in your hand, taxi at the gate...

1558
01:59:40,462 --> 01:59:44,242
With just a little courage, you
could've turned your life around

1559
01:59:50,795 --> 01:59:52,750
Do you think he'll like it?

1560
01:59:53,378 --> 01:59:55,701
Why such an expensive gift?

1561
01:59:56,836 --> 01:59:59,289
Our son's getting
his first job today

1562
02:00:00,586 --> 02:00:04,496
Don't be stingy at
such a proud moment

1563
02:00:06,418 --> 02:00:07,413
Farhan?

1564
02:00:12,502 --> 02:00:14,788
Don't you have
the job interview today?

1565
02:00:16,543 --> 02:00:17,455
I didn't go

1566
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:21,952
I don't want to be
an engineer, Dad

1567
02:00:26,168 --> 02:00:28,123
What happened?
You had an accident?

1568
02:00:31,751 --> 02:00:36,988
See that building?
I jumped from its third floor

1569
02:00:39,792 --> 02:00:40,705
Why?

1570
02:00:41,042 --> 02:00:43,366
Because I was rusticated
from college

1571
02:00:46,293 --> 02:00:47,121
Why?

1572
02:00:47,625 --> 02:00:52,448
Drunk, I urinated
on the Director's door

1573
02:00:54,750 --> 02:00:58,411
That scoundrel Rancho
is messing with your mind!

1574
02:00:58,542 --> 02:01:02,287
I don't enjoy Engineering.
I'd make a terrible engineer

1575
02:01:04,417 --> 02:01:09,038
Rancho has a simple belief -
Make your passion your profession

1576
02:01:09,375 --> 02:01:10,951
Then work will become play

1577
02:01:11,083 --> 02:01:12,990
What'll you earn in that jungle?

1578
02:01:13,625 --> 02:01:17,286
A small stipend, but I'll learn a lot

1579
02:01:17,333 --> 02:01:18,529
Five years from now...

1580
02:01:19,250 --> 02:01:23,989
when you see your friends buying
cars and homes, you'll curse yourself

1581
02:01:24,082 --> 02:01:28,075
Life as an engineer will bring
only frustration. Then I'll curse you

1582
02:01:30,124 --> 02:01:31,914
I'd rather curse myself, Dad

1583
02:01:32,041 --> 02:01:33,238
The world will laugh!

1584
02:01:34,499 --> 02:01:36,489
Label you a loser,
for quitting in the final year

1585
02:01:37,373 --> 02:01:43,073
Mr. Kapoor feels you're fortunate
to be at ICE. What'll he think?

1586
02:01:43,332 --> 02:01:45,488
Mr. Kapoor didn't provide me
with an air-conditioner

1587
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:50,576
It wasn't Mr. Kapoor who slept
in discomfort while I slept well

1588
02:01:52,915 --> 02:01:55,912
He didn't take me around the zoo
on his shoulders

1589
02:01:58,747 --> 02:01:59,991
You did all that, Dad

1590
02:02:02,456 --> 02:02:07,906
How you feel, matters to me.
Mr. Kapoor makes no difference

1591
02:02:09,039 --> 02:02:10,946
I don't even know his first name

1592
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:13,995
You think you're the hero
of a melodrama?

1593
02:02:14,163 --> 02:02:16,912
Enough, please... he's upset

1594
02:02:18,163 --> 02:02:20,616
God forbid, if he did
something crazy like Raju...

1595
02:02:20,830 --> 02:02:22,406
Then the discussion is over

1596
02:02:22,704 --> 02:02:26,485
Don't say a word or
His Lordship will jump off the roof

1597
02:02:29,954 --> 02:02:34,944
No, Dad. I'll never attempt suicide.
I promise

1598
02:02:37,454 --> 02:02:44,445
The Rancho you detest
put this picture in my wallet

1599
02:02:46,037 --> 02:02:49,865
Told me to see it if a suicidal thought
crossed my mind

1600
02:02:49,995 --> 02:02:53,277
and imagine what'd happen
to your smiles

1601
02:02:53,328 --> 02:02:55,118
when you see my dead body

1602
02:03:00,662 --> 02:03:04,441
I want to convince you, Dad

1603
02:03:05,911 --> 02:03:08,364
but not with a suicide threat

1604
02:03:12,119 --> 02:03:15,947
Dad, what'll happen
if I become a photographer?

1605
02:03:16,244 --> 02:03:17,488
I'll earn less

1606
02:03:18,411 --> 02:03:20,117
I'll have a smaller house,
a smaller car

1607
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:23,701
But I'll be happy

1608
02:03:25,368 --> 02:03:26,648
I will be really happy

1609
02:03:27,952 --> 02:03:29,610
Whatever I do for you
will be out of genuine love

1610
02:03:31,535 --> 02:03:33,276
I've always listened to you

1611
02:03:33,660 --> 02:03:36,777
For once,
let me listen to my heart

1612
02:03:38,868 --> 02:03:39,780
Please... Dad

1613
02:03:46,201 --> 02:03:47,149
Dad...

1614
02:03:48,368 --> 02:03:49,611
Please don't go away...

1615
02:03:55,825 --> 02:03:57,022
Return this

1616
02:04:00,492 --> 02:04:02,980
Son, what's the cost
of a professional camera?

1617
02:04:04,241 --> 02:04:06,031
Can the laptop be exchanged for it?

1618
02:04:07,492 --> 02:04:09,363
If you need more money, just ask

1619
02:04:18,158 --> 02:04:20,113
Go live your life, my son

1620
02:04:23,033 --> 02:04:27,322
Your grades are consistently poor.
Reason?

1621
02:04:27,991 --> 02:04:28,856
Fear

1622
02:04:29,949 --> 02:04:31,358
I was a good student
since childhood

1623
02:04:32,115 --> 02:04:34,272
Parents hoped
I'd end their poverty

1624
02:04:36,199 --> 02:04:37,194
That scared me

1625
02:04:38,699 --> 02:04:42,146
Here I saw the mad race.
You don't count if you're not first

1626
02:04:43,907 --> 02:04:44,937
My fear grew

1627
02:04:46,615 --> 02:04:48,072
Fear is not good for grades, sir

1628
02:04:48,698 --> 02:04:51,104
I slipped on more
charms and rings

1629
02:04:52,115 --> 02:04:56,571
Prayed to God for favors.
No... begged for favors

1630
02:04:59,656 --> 02:05:02,773
16 broken bones gave me
two months to think and reflect

1631
02:05:03,322 --> 02:05:04,566
Finally, sense dawned

1632
02:05:06,072 --> 02:05:11,227
Today I didn't beg God for this job,
just thanked him for this life

1633
02:05:13,697 --> 02:05:17,690
If you reject me, no regrets

1634
02:05:18,030 --> 02:05:22,154
I'll still do something
worthwhile with my life

1635
02:05:22,696 --> 02:05:27,899
Such frank behavior
is not good for our firm

1636
02:05:28,488 --> 02:05:32,778
We need someone diplomatic
to handle clients

1637
02:05:32,863 --> 02:05:35,232
You're too straightforward

1638
02:05:37,112 --> 02:05:37,942
But...

1639
02:05:39,113 --> 02:05:45,559
if you assure us
you'll control this attitude

1640
02:05:45,696 --> 02:05:48,693
we may consider you

1641
02:05:52,029 --> 02:05:55,193
It took two broken legs
to get me up on my feet

1642
02:05:57,070 --> 02:05:58,895
Wasn't easy to get this attitude

1643
02:05:59,612 --> 02:06:00,477
Can't change it, sir

1644
02:06:04,153 --> 02:06:09,390
You keep your job...
I'll keep my attitude

1645
02:06:09,528 --> 02:06:10,902
I'm sorry, no offense, sir

1646
02:06:15,278 --> 02:06:16,143
Wait

1647
02:06:18,111 --> 02:06:22,104
I've interviewed countless
candidates for 25 years

1648
02:06:22,528 --> 02:06:25,395
Everyone turns into
a yes-man to get the job

1649
02:06:25,569 --> 02:06:26,943
Where did you spring from, son?

1650
02:06:28,861 --> 02:06:29,690
Sir?

1651
02:06:29,944 --> 02:06:32,562
Shall we discuss the salary?

1652
02:06:40,110 --> 02:06:41,022
Thank you, sir

1653
02:07:13,567 --> 02:07:17,774
Your Majesty, thou art great

1654
02:07:19,692 --> 02:07:21,350
Accept this humble offering

1655
02:07:57,940 --> 02:08:01,387
Govind!

1656
02:08:03,439 --> 02:08:06,935
You had said, 'If he gets a job,
shave it off'

1657
02:08:14,147 --> 02:08:15,178
What have you done?

1658
02:08:18,773 --> 02:08:22,184
I feel naked without
my moustache

1659
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:26,388
I've lost my dignity

1660
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:30,933
I won't accept defeat, Rastogi

1661
02:08:32,230 --> 02:08:36,270
The job isn't yours until you
pass your final exam

1662
02:08:37,730 --> 02:08:41,676
And this time,
I will set the question paper

1663
02:08:44,855 --> 02:08:47,473
Dad, that's not fair

1664
02:08:49,813 --> 02:08:53,344
Everything is fair in
Love and War

1665
02:08:53,854 --> 02:08:57,184
And this is World War... III

1666
02:08:58,646 --> 02:08:59,676
Rastogi, you're dead meat;

1667
02:09:04,646 --> 02:09:05,558
Hey

1668
02:09:07,979 --> 02:09:08,891
What're you doing here?

1669
02:09:11,853 --> 02:09:12,718
Be careful

1670
02:09:18,395 --> 02:09:22,258
You've been drinking
- Yup, had to down a couple

1671
02:09:22,811 --> 02:09:25,016
A couple too many;

1672
02:09:25,103 --> 02:09:27,010
Needed the guts
- For what?

1673
02:09:28,769 --> 02:09:30,309
For stealing this
- What's this?

1674
02:09:31,394 --> 02:09:35,553
The duplicate key to
Virus's office

1675
02:09:38,061 --> 02:09:40,383
The question paper's
in a cover with a red seal

1676
02:09:41,061 --> 02:09:45,054
Dad has set it, to fail Raju

1677
02:09:45,352 --> 02:09:46,300
Go get it;

1678
02:09:47,351 --> 02:09:49,922
Are you mad or what -
that's cheating;

1679
02:09:54,393 --> 02:09:57,640
Everything's fair in
Love and War

1680
02:09:59,143 --> 02:10:00,173
Tell me something...

1681
02:10:02,101 --> 02:10:03,298
Do you really feel...

1682
02:10:04,851 --> 02:10:10,386
the noses collide while kissing?

1683
02:10:15,809 --> 02:10:19,553
Wait. Have some dhokla

1684
02:10:22,017 --> 02:10:24,635
You Gujaratis are so cute

1685
02:10:25,559 --> 02:10:28,889
But why does your food
sound so dangerous?

1686
02:10:29,975 --> 02:10:35,212
Dhokla, Fafda, Handwa,
Thepla, Khakhra

1687
02:10:36,308 --> 02:10:38,464
Sound like missiles

1688
02:10:38,516 --> 02:10:39,380
C'mon

1689
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:42,088
'Today Bush dropped
two Dhoklas on Iraq'

1690
02:10:42,724 --> 02:10:45,592
'400 dead, 200 injured'

1691
02:10:45,933 --> 02:10:46,845
C'mon

1692
02:10:50,308 --> 02:10:51,303
Oh...

1693
02:10:52,807 --> 02:10:57,263
I can deal with Khakhra, Fafda.
But your name...

1694
02:10:58,182 --> 02:11:01,512
'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad': Yuck

1695
02:11:02,723 --> 02:11:05,294
I won't change my last name
after marriage

1696
02:11:07,140 --> 02:11:10,138
Pia, we can't get married

1697
02:11:13,682 --> 02:11:14,594
Why?

1698
02:11:15,432 --> 02:11:16,888
Is there someone else?

1699
02:11:19,389 --> 02:11:20,254
No

1700
02:11:20,556 --> 02:11:22,298
Are you gay?
- No

1701
02:11:24,139 --> 02:11:26,046
Then why don't you
propose to me?

1702
02:11:30,597 --> 02:11:32,054
Are you impotent?
- No

1703
02:11:34,722 --> 02:11:36,547
Then prove it

1704
02:11:37,014 --> 02:11:37,962
Pia, no

1705
02:11:38,221 --> 02:11:39,679
Stop, stop;

1706
02:11:39,847 --> 02:11:42,216
What happened?
- We didn't inform Pia

1707
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:44,754
Stop here,
my bladders are bursting

1708
02:11:44,805 --> 02:11:46,677
Shut up!
- Are you in touch with her?

1709
02:11:46,971 --> 02:11:50,135
No... I have her home number
Then call her, I'll stop

1710
02:11:56,596 --> 02:11:57,425
Hello

1711
02:11:57,513 --> 02:11:59,752
No place for urine-expulsion
in this country

1712
02:11:59,804 --> 02:12:03,217
Hello, is Pia there?
- No, she's not

1713
02:12:03,596 --> 02:12:05,385
Is she at the hospital?

1714
02:12:05,512 --> 02:12:07,088
Why would she be there?

1715
02:12:07,304 --> 02:12:09,508
She's getting married today -
in Manali

1716
02:12:17,511 --> 02:12:18,756
Too late! She's married

1717
02:12:20,179 --> 02:12:23,093
Not yet. It's a six hour drive

1718
02:12:23,428 --> 02:12:25,502
If we rush, we'll reach
before the vows

1719
02:12:26,011 --> 02:12:26,876
What do you say?

1720
02:12:28,802 --> 02:12:31,256
It's a no-brainer. Let's turn back

1721
02:12:31,470 --> 02:12:33,211
No turning back

1722
02:12:33,678 --> 02:12:36,427
Straight to Ladakh.
We'll meet Rancho and return

1723
02:12:36,594 --> 02:12:39,165
I have a Friday meeting with
Phunsukh Wangdu

1724
02:12:39,303 --> 02:12:40,843
Get into the car

1725
02:12:41,053 --> 02:12:44,050
If I miss my meeting,
the Japanese will get him

1726
02:12:44,261 --> 02:12:47,341
They're offering him a
first name in the company

1727
02:12:47,468 --> 02:12:49,756
'Phunsukh and Fujiyashi',
profit sharing...

1728
02:13:23,384 --> 02:13:25,540
Pia weds Suhas;
- Thanks for the suit

1729
02:13:27,883 --> 02:13:29,377
Virus will have a heart attack

1730
02:13:30,467 --> 02:13:33,168
At every daughter's wedding,
we're there to rock the party

1731
02:13:34,591 --> 02:13:38,004
Listen, I'll update Pia,
you peel off the price tag

1732
02:13:54,799 --> 02:13:57,039
Farhan
- We found Rancho

1733
02:14:05,174 --> 02:14:06,797
For Room 107?
- Yes, sir

1734
02:14:07,507 --> 02:14:10,339
You've taken ages
- Sorry, sir

1735
02:14:10,465 --> 02:14:11,330
Off, now

1736
02:14:20,382 --> 02:14:22,088
Housekeeping, sir
- Come in

1737
02:14:22,631 --> 02:14:25,249
Amore... Amore...

1738
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:26,714
Quick, iron my coat

1739
02:14:26,798 --> 02:14:29,630
Amore... Amore...

1740
02:14:30,506 --> 02:14:33,753
We found Rancho!
Now you can't marry this ass

1741
02:14:34,255 --> 02:14:35,334
You're mad, Farhan

1742
02:14:36,464 --> 02:14:39,131
Don't fool yourself, Pia.
You still love Rancho

1743
02:14:39,338 --> 02:14:41,293
You're still eating his favorite food

1744
02:14:41,589 --> 02:14:44,208
Amore... Amore...

1745
02:14:59,629 --> 02:15:03,837
He's incorrigible.
Once a price tag, always a price tag

1746
02:15:03,921 --> 02:15:06,789
Shut up, Farhan.
Suhas is a changed man

1747
02:15:07,337 --> 02:15:09,328
He doesn't speak of
brands and prices anymore

1748
02:15:09,379 --> 02:15:12,579
My 150,000/: coat

1749
02:15:12,671 --> 02:15:14,791
Why do you people eat sauce?

1750
02:15:14,837 --> 02:15:17,326
I'll sort it out, sir
- How?

1751
02:15:17,421 --> 02:15:19,991
Our laundry specializes in
cleaning mint-stained suits

1752
02:15:20,128 --> 02:15:22,119
I'll clean it in a jiffy

1753
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:28,747
Get it soon

1754
02:15:29,712 --> 02:15:31,951
But it's too late now, Farhan
- Pia

1755
02:15:32,837 --> 02:15:35,076
Let's go, Pia, we're late

1756
02:15:46,502 --> 02:15:49,832
Pia, it's me... Raju.
Don't yell, they'll kill me

1757
02:15:55,002 --> 02:15:55,915
Where is Suhas?

1758
02:15:55,960 --> 02:15:58,709
Housekeeping took my coat

1759
02:15:59,168 --> 02:16:00,958
Go... Send Suhas here

1760
02:16:01,169 --> 02:16:04,369
It's rude to leave the ceremony

1761
02:16:15,668 --> 02:16:17,326
Yeah, Farhan?
- The car's ready

1762
02:16:17,668 --> 02:16:20,287
Grab her hand and run.
Don't move

1763
02:16:21,793 --> 02:16:23,416
Sir...
- My coat?

1764
02:16:23,459 --> 02:16:24,626
You're here...

1765
02:16:24,626 --> 02:16:26,416
So who's at the altar?
- Altar?

1766
02:16:28,710 --> 02:16:31,198
Another couple of rounds,
and we'll be considered married

1767
02:16:31,376 --> 02:16:33,662
I'm already married, Pia.
Let's go

1768
02:16:34,126 --> 02:16:37,408
It's too late.
People will laugh at me

1769
02:16:37,667 --> 02:16:39,457
So you'll commit suicide?

1770
02:16:40,042 --> 02:16:40,954
Rastogi;

1771
02:16:41,042 --> 02:16:43,162
People will gossip briefly,
then forget

1772
02:16:44,542 --> 02:16:47,625
But you... you'll regret
on your deathbed

1773
02:16:47,625 --> 02:16:50,576
that the car was at the gate,
Rancho within reach...

1774
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:54,245
but in fear of people,
you married this ass

1775
02:16:56,416 --> 02:16:57,364
Housekeeping?

1776
02:17:37,081 --> 02:17:40,115
Pia, minor problem

1777
02:17:40,414 --> 02:17:41,279
What?

1778
02:17:41,706 --> 02:17:43,328
We don't know if Rancho's married

1779
02:17:43,373 --> 02:17:44,237
What;

1780
02:17:44,331 --> 02:17:46,997
He won't be married
- And if he is?

1781
02:17:47,873 --> 02:17:49,281
Then we'll drop you back

1782
02:17:50,163 --> 02:17:53,944
Relax! Handmade biscuit?

1783
02:17:57,789 --> 02:17:58,653
What's he doing here?

1784
02:17:59,705 --> 02:18:03,117
Ignore him
- The biscuit's very good

1785
02:18:04,163 --> 02:18:06,035
Till yesterday,
I was a law-abiding citizen

1786
02:18:06,539 --> 02:18:10,402
But in the last 24 hours,
I'd grounded an aircraft

1787
02:18:11,204 --> 02:18:13,658
almost assigned Shamaldas's
ashes to the sewers, and

1788
02:18:13,913 --> 02:18:18,321
made a bride elope from her
own wedding! All for Rancho

1789
02:18:19,788 --> 02:18:21,908
But he too would do
anything for friends

1790
02:18:22,162 --> 02:18:25,658
Like stealing the question paper...
from the lion's den

1791
02:18:25,745 --> 02:18:26,776
Envelope with the red seal

1792
02:18:27,787 --> 02:18:32,777
He feared that if Raju failed,
there'd be another high jump

1793
02:18:35,954 --> 02:18:41,239
We were principled thieves,
stealing the paper only for Raju

1794
02:18:41,620 --> 02:18:42,733
We'd sworn we won't even
take a peek

1795
02:18:45,453 --> 02:18:46,780
Where's it hidden...

1796
02:18:46,911 --> 02:18:50,573
We'll grow old searching;
Ask Pia

1797
02:18:56,786 --> 02:18:57,947
Pia, your phone

1798
02:18:59,203 --> 02:19:02,449
Mr. Papa-To-Be;
If you say 'All is well', he kicks

1799
02:19:02,536 --> 02:19:03,365
He kicked

1800
02:19:05,827 --> 02:19:07,319
Pia, your phone

1801
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:14,404
Found it! Rancho

1802
02:19:15,868 --> 02:19:16,863
Hello?

1803
02:19:35,284 --> 02:19:37,524
Quick, photocopy this

1804
02:19:58,700 --> 02:19:59,481
Where was it?

1805
02:19:59,783 --> 02:20:00,778
Put it back

1806
02:20:24,116 --> 02:20:26,152
We're safe!
- Where were you?

1807
02:20:30,740 --> 02:20:32,446
Here
- What's this?

1808
02:20:32,782 --> 02:20:33,694
A gift

1809
02:20:34,824 --> 02:20:38,734
Question paper.
Virus set it himself, to fail you

1810
02:20:46,322 --> 02:20:47,650
Strange buddies;

1811
02:20:48,989 --> 02:20:53,563
First teach you to be upright,
then offer a path to shame

1812
02:20:55,614 --> 02:20:56,644
No way

1813
02:20:58,239 --> 02:20:59,613
If I pass,
it'll be on my own steam

1814
02:21:03,488 --> 02:21:04,650
If I don't, it's still ok

1815
02:21:21,863 --> 02:21:26,401
He'd won us over!
I felt like embracing him as family...

1816
02:21:27,321 --> 02:21:29,228
but then I controlled my emotions

1817
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:51,271
Damn thief
- Sir, please, sir

1818
02:21:51,445 --> 02:21:54,645
Rascal
- Sorry sir

1819
02:21:55,195 --> 02:21:56,474
Wanted to change the system

1820
02:21:58,194 --> 02:22:03,147
You'll pee on my door
- Sir, what're you doing

1821
02:22:04,652 --> 02:22:05,647
Sorry sir

1822
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:08,983
You are rusticated!

1823
02:22:09,778 --> 02:22:12,775
If all of you aren't out by morning,
I'll call the police

1824
02:22:13,152 --> 02:22:14,526
I will call the police;

1825
02:22:17,028 --> 02:22:17,856
Rascals;

1826
02:22:18,194 --> 02:22:19,520
Rascals, all of you

1827
02:22:23,527 --> 02:22:25,850
How did he get my office key?

1828
02:22:27,151 --> 02:22:28,561
I gave him the key, Dad

1829
02:22:29,944 --> 02:22:33,735
I wish I'd given this key to
my brother... He'd be alive today

1830
02:22:33,735 --> 02:22:34,648
Stop it, Pia

1831
02:22:35,776 --> 02:22:38,609
You think your son
fell off a train and died?

1832
02:22:39,152 --> 02:22:40,064
Shut up, Pia

1833
02:22:40,151 --> 02:22:42,437
You decided he'd be an engineer

1834
02:22:42,610 --> 02:22:44,896
Did you ever ask him
what he wanted to be?

1835
02:22:45,692 --> 02:22:47,268
You put such pressure on him...

1836
02:22:47,650 --> 02:22:49,937
that he chose death
over the entrance exam

1837
02:22:54,192 --> 02:22:55,057
I don't understand...

1838
02:22:55,859 --> 02:22:58,429
Dad, you go to your room

1839
02:23:02,317 --> 02:23:04,686
Pia, don't do this

1840
02:23:07,150 --> 02:23:11,060
He wanted to study Literature,
be a writer

1841
02:23:13,316 --> 02:23:15,804
But all he wrote was
this suicide note

1842
02:23:15,858 --> 02:23:17,137
Put that away, please

1843
02:23:17,316 --> 02:23:18,975
No more cover-ups!

1844
02:23:22,358 --> 02:23:25,604
Just once...

1845
02:23:25,649 --> 02:23:29,346
if you'd said: Don't do Engineering
if you don't want to

1846
02:23:30,191 --> 02:23:31,600
just do what your heart is in

1847
02:23:33,065 --> 02:23:34,807
then he'd be alive today

1848
02:23:42,731 --> 02:23:44,806
He didn't commit suicide

1849
02:23:45,524 --> 02:23:46,517
You're right, Dad

1850
02:23:48,065 --> 02:23:49,309
It wasn't suicide...

1851
02:23:51,773 --> 02:23:52,851
It was murder

1852
02:24:08,772 --> 02:24:11,640
Many city roads are
completely submerged

1853
02:24:11,689 --> 02:24:13,679
Traffic has come to a standstill

1854
02:24:27,605 --> 02:24:31,432
Dad...

1855
02:24:32,521 --> 02:24:33,469
Mona?

1856
02:24:37,646 --> 02:24:40,134
Go back, Millimeter.
Why're you following us?

1857
02:24:40,687 --> 02:24:42,973
Why?
Your pop owns the road?

1858
02:24:43,104 --> 02:24:44,810
Please help,
we are desperate here;

1859
02:24:45,770 --> 02:24:47,642
You can't send an ambulance?

1860
02:24:48,645 --> 02:24:50,552
Get it from another hospital

1861
02:24:51,186 --> 02:24:54,718
The entire city's flooded, sir.
We're helpless

1862
02:24:58,229 --> 02:24:59,507
Mona, you ok?

1863
02:25:00,061 --> 02:25:01,056
Rancho, Pia

1864
02:25:03,437 --> 02:25:07,300
Rancho, you can't reach here.
Do as I say

1865
02:25:07,603 --> 02:25:12,473
The water bag has burst

1866
02:25:13,478 --> 02:25:16,013
Disconnected! Mona

1867
02:25:21,227 --> 02:25:22,222
Mona!

1868
02:25:26,602 --> 02:25:28,142
Turn on the lights
- Where to?

1869
02:25:28,644 --> 02:25:32,589
To the table tennis table
- Pia, we're in the common room

1870
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:38,432
Raju, turn on the web camera

1871
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:45,721
Where's Mona? Show me

1872
02:25:47,268 --> 02:25:48,216
Hold on

1873
02:25:50,435 --> 02:25:51,299
Here, Pia

1874
02:25:51,601 --> 02:25:54,515
Mona, don't worry. I'm with you

1875
02:25:54,601 --> 02:25:55,596
Pia, I'm dying!

1876
02:25:55,976 --> 02:25:58,595
Rancho, even when
there were no hospitals or docs

1877
02:25:58,726 --> 02:26:00,135
babies were delivered

1878
02:26:00,726 --> 02:26:03,049
You all will deliver this baby

1879
02:26:05,725 --> 02:26:07,301
All is well

1880
02:26:07,433 --> 02:26:10,431
How dare you? I'll kill you

1881
02:26:10,558 --> 02:26:12,596
Dad, stay out of this

1882
02:26:13,558 --> 02:26:15,715
Farhan, get towels and scissors

1883
02:26:15,767 --> 02:26:18,255
Millimeter, get clothes clips
and hot water

1884
02:26:18,516 --> 02:26:20,009
Rancho, cover Mona

1885
02:26:27,558 --> 02:26:29,098
Mona, try pushing

1886
02:26:29,516 --> 02:26:33,462
Push with all your might

1887
02:26:33,724 --> 02:26:36,129
Stop it! I can't do it

1888
02:26:36,349 --> 02:26:38,174
Rancho, check if there's crowning

1889
02:26:39,099 --> 02:26:39,963
Crowning...?

1890
02:26:41,307 --> 02:26:42,219
Get that diagram

1891
02:26:45,140 --> 02:26:47,889
See if the head is coming out

1892
02:26:50,224 --> 02:26:51,550
Check quickly

1893
02:26:52,307 --> 02:26:53,254
Go;

1894
02:26:53,932 --> 02:26:56,420
Go, Rancho, go

1895
02:27:03,681 --> 02:27:05,802
No crowning

1896
02:27:05,848 --> 02:27:07,755
Mona, please push

1897
02:27:10,431 --> 02:27:11,295
Mona!

1898
02:27:14,306 --> 02:27:15,467
She's tired, Pia

1899
02:27:15,889 --> 02:27:19,586
Wake her! If she won't push,
it's a big problem

1900
02:27:19,930 --> 02:27:23,711
They need a vacuum cup
- Where will they get one?

1901
02:27:23,889 --> 02:27:26,756
What's a vacuum cup?
How is it used?

1902
02:27:27,014 --> 02:27:27,878
I'll show you

1903
02:27:31,139 --> 02:27:35,464
If the mother's too fatigued to push,
a cup is placed on baby's head

1904
02:27:35,763 --> 02:27:39,543
Suction makes the cup
stick to the head...

1905
02:27:40,221 --> 02:27:42,128
and the baby is pulled out

1906
02:27:42,596 --> 02:27:44,800
I can make this
- How?

1907
02:27:45,054 --> 02:27:46,880
With a vacuum cleaner
- Vacuum cleaner?

1908
02:27:46,930 --> 02:27:48,007
Yes

1909
02:27:48,054 --> 02:27:50,424
That pressure's too high

1910
02:27:50,470 --> 02:27:52,627
I'll control it
- D'you have a vacuum cleaner?

1911
02:27:52,679 --> 02:27:53,757
Yes, in my office

1912
02:27:54,179 --> 02:27:56,880
Farhan, rush and get it
- Here's the key

1913
02:28:02,887 --> 02:28:06,335
Mona, push

1914
02:28:07,095 --> 02:28:08,635
Oh my God

1915
02:28:09,512 --> 02:28:10,424
What happened?

1916
02:28:15,303 --> 02:28:17,589
Raju, what happened?
- The power's gone

1917
02:28:18,553 --> 02:28:20,010
How'll the vacuum work now?

1918
02:28:20,053 --> 02:28:22,623
Farhan, you get the vacuum,
I'll get the power.

1919
02:28:22,678 --> 02:28:23,673
How?

1920
02:28:24,344 --> 02:28:25,837
Millimeter, get Virus out

1921
02:28:27,219 --> 02:28:29,885
What nonsense is this!

1922
02:28:30,094 --> 02:28:33,673
Not this Virus.
My Virus, the inverter

1923
02:28:33,844 --> 02:28:35,751
Get that, quick
- Ok

1924
02:28:36,011 --> 02:28:38,167
Raju, wake up the hostel

1925
02:28:38,344 --> 02:28:41,295
Get car batteries, wires,
and a vacuum gauge

1926
02:28:44,135 --> 02:28:46,801
Emergency in the common room!

1927
02:29:17,592 --> 02:29:19,713
Where's Rancho?
- Here, sir

1928
02:29:19,967 --> 02:29:22,669
Keep the batteries here
...and the wires

1929
02:29:24,925 --> 02:29:28,124
Raju, switch off everything,
connect the inverter to the mains

1930
02:29:32,925 --> 02:29:34,122
Rancho, vacuum cleaner

1931
02:29:35,258 --> 02:29:38,172
Farhan, get your lens cleaner

1932
02:29:38,217 --> 02:29:39,673
Blower?
- Yeah, get it

1933
02:29:42,383 --> 02:29:43,412
Rancho, blower

1934
02:29:43,549 --> 02:29:45,587
Good. Fix this to the gauge

1935
02:30:11,964 --> 02:30:13,243
Rancho, I'm done

1936
02:30:15,673 --> 02:30:16,834
All switches off?
- Yes

1937
02:30:18,381 --> 02:30:20,003
Hit the table
and computer switches

1938
02:30:20,048 --> 02:30:20,913
Ok

1939
02:30:33,588 --> 02:30:34,702
Raju, turn on the computer

1940
02:30:35,088 --> 02:30:36,795
Farhan, here

1941
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:40,918
Pia, come here quick

1942
02:30:43,380 --> 02:30:44,493
Love you, Rancho

1943
02:30:45,254 --> 02:30:47,245
Farhan, turn it on
- Ok

1944
02:30:53,796 --> 02:30:55,833
Pia, how much suction?

1945
02:30:56,212 --> 02:30:57,670
Not more than 0.5

1946
02:30:57,879 --> 02:30:59,917
Farhan, 0.5
- Cover it

1947
02:31:01,462 --> 02:31:02,375
0.5

1948
02:31:04,921 --> 02:31:08,961
Vacuum cleaner baby!
Mother of all deliveries

1949
02:31:10,045 --> 02:31:10,875
Farhan, stop

1950
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:11,749
Ok

1951
02:31:18,254 --> 02:31:19,497
Raju, get on the table

1952
02:31:19,753 --> 02:31:22,916
Push the baby down, like this

1953
02:31:23,087 --> 02:31:24,034
Ok

1954
02:31:25,128 --> 02:31:26,041
Farhan, turn it on

1955
02:31:30,628 --> 02:31:32,951
C'mon, you can do it

1956
02:31:34,086 --> 02:31:36,539
C'mon, push

1957
02:31:40,711 --> 02:31:43,282
Do it for Champ

1958
02:31:43,502 --> 02:31:45,955
C'mon, Mona

1959
02:31:47,669 --> 02:31:49,742
He's coming out;

1960
02:31:51,086 --> 02:31:52,874
You can do it

1961
02:31:53,668 --> 02:31:56,038
Yes Mona, push

1962
02:32:03,877 --> 02:32:04,954
Farhan, turn it off

1963
02:32:05,043 --> 02:32:06,073
Ok, off

1964
02:32:26,334 --> 02:32:28,123
Two clips,
cut the umbilical cord

1965
02:32:28,417 --> 02:32:30,621
Farhan, two clips on the cord

1966
02:32:31,333 --> 02:32:33,371
Get scissors
- Be careful

1967
02:32:34,583 --> 02:32:36,869
Cut at the center,
get a towel

1968
02:32:39,666 --> 02:32:41,989
Pia, he's not crying

1969
02:32:46,249 --> 02:32:49,164
Hey Champ!

1970
02:32:50,499 --> 02:32:52,952
Rancho, rub his back

1971
02:32:55,207 --> 02:32:57,245
Hey Champ
- Come on, Champ

1972
02:32:59,082 --> 02:33:01,202
No, nothing

1973
02:33:01,665 --> 02:33:02,696
Blow air into his mouth

1974
02:33:09,873 --> 02:33:10,703
C'mon, Champ

1975
02:33:16,248 --> 02:33:17,113
No response

1976
02:33:41,456 --> 02:33:45,069
Hush Mona, say -
All is well

1977
02:33:50,330 --> 02:33:51,277
He kicked

1978
02:33:52,580 --> 02:33:53,444
What?

1979
02:33:54,329 --> 02:33:55,609
He kicked

1980
02:33:59,079 --> 02:34:00,406
Say: All is well

1981
02:34:01,329 --> 02:34:08,948
All is well

1982
02:34:50,369 --> 02:34:53,734
If Virus had said, 'My grandson
will be an engineer'

1983
02:34:53,869 --> 02:34:55,740
I would've broken his jaw

1984
02:34:56,410 --> 02:34:59,243
But when he finally spoke,
he stunned us

1985
02:34:59,535 --> 02:35:02,699
What a kick!
Wanna be a footballer?

1986
02:35:03,744 --> 02:35:06,776
Be what you want to be

1987
02:35:23,243 --> 02:35:27,153
Wait: I've not finished with you!

1988
02:35:29,534 --> 02:35:32,069
First day of college,
you'd asked me a question...

1989
02:35:32,451 --> 02:35:34,855
Why didn't astronauts
use a pencil in space?

1990
02:35:35,617 --> 02:35:37,903
If a pencil tip breaks

1991
02:35:38,076 --> 02:35:43,988
it'd float in zero gravity.
Get into eyes, nose, instruments...

1992
02:35:44,116 --> 02:35:46,071
You were wrong

1993
02:35:47,658 --> 02:35:49,530
You cannot be right all the time

1994
02:35:51,616 --> 02:35:52,647
You understand?

1995
02:35:55,074 --> 02:35:55,939
Yes, sir

1996
02:35:57,200 --> 02:35:59,320
This was an important invention

1997
02:36:00,616 --> 02:36:01,646
You understand?

1998
02:36:03,032 --> 02:36:03,897
Yes, sir

1999
02:36:06,365 --> 02:36:15,644
My Director said, 'When you find
an extraordinary student...'

2000
02:36:33,697 --> 02:36:38,154
Go, study;
Pass your exams and leave

2001
02:36:47,030 --> 02:36:49,152
And now, Student of the Year...

2002
02:36:49,363 --> 02:36:51,853
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad

2003
02:37:09,488 --> 02:37:10,815
Sir, one photo

2004
02:37:28,279 --> 02:37:31,727
I wanted to capture all these
memories and take them home

2005
02:37:33,779 --> 02:37:39,147
That day, we hugged,
we rejoiced, we cried...

2006
02:37:39,445 --> 02:37:41,103
We vowed that we'd meet
at least once a year...

2007
02:37:41,778 --> 02:37:45,226
Who knew then, we were seeing
Rancho for the last time

2008
02:38:19,152 --> 02:38:20,099
Untie him

2009
02:38:23,443 --> 02:38:25,350
I'll sue you all in an
American court

2010
02:38:39,817 --> 02:38:40,682
Raju

2011
02:38:59,691 --> 02:39:01,682
Only Rancho can create
a school like this

2012
02:39:02,232 --> 02:39:03,311
But where is he?

2013
02:39:07,775 --> 02:39:09,018
Don't pee here

2014
02:39:10,108 --> 02:39:11,730
Go away creatures

2015
02:39:12,107 --> 02:39:15,188
Don't pee here
- I'll smack you

2016
02:39:32,940 --> 02:39:35,144
Bingo; He cannot be far

2017
02:39:46,606 --> 02:39:48,893
Excuse me,
where is Ranchhoddas?

2018
02:39:49,023 --> 02:39:51,013
He's not Ranchhoddas!
- Rancho...

2019
02:39:51,106 --> 02:39:53,310
Chhote... Dammit,
what's his name?

2020
02:39:53,439 --> 02:39:56,141
Calm down. Come with me

2021
02:39:58,606 --> 02:39:59,518
Where's he?
- Rancho

2022
02:40:06,897 --> 02:40:10,060
Farhan, he's read all your books

2023
02:40:16,355 --> 02:40:22,387
Raju, he reads your blog everyday.
Proudly shares it with the kids

2024
02:40:25,896 --> 02:40:29,391
Remember your helmet, Pia?
It was stolen...

2025
02:40:31,313 --> 02:40:34,512
Who are you?
How do you know us?

2026
02:40:34,771 --> 02:40:36,844
Didn't you recognize me?
- No

2027
02:40:37,771 --> 02:40:41,764
How would you?
Millimeter is now Centimeter

2028
02:40:46,811 --> 02:40:51,303
Not Centimeter, you're Kilometer

2029
02:40:52,144 --> 02:40:53,139
How did you get here?

2030
02:40:53,228 --> 02:40:56,475
I got a letter with
a train ticket inside

2031
02:40:56,728 --> 02:41:00,473
It said: 'Miss being in school?
Catch this train'... I did

2032
02:41:02,060 --> 02:41:03,175
That rascal Rancho;

2033
02:41:07,352 --> 02:41:08,347
Where is that idiot?

2034
02:41:19,519 --> 02:41:21,426
Dorje, you fly it

2035
02:41:36,392 --> 02:41:41,843
Every night you ride into my dreams
on a scooter, dressed as a bride

2036
02:41:42,809 --> 02:41:45,095
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet

2037
02:41:45,725 --> 02:41:48,474
and come close to kiss me

2038
02:41:52,058 --> 02:41:53,302
Couldn't you tell me
before leaving?

2039
02:41:55,641 --> 02:41:56,423
No

2040
02:41:58,266 --> 02:41:59,179
Sorry

2041
02:41:59,558 --> 02:42:00,388
Did you marry?

2042
02:42:00,975 --> 02:42:05,218
What? No

2043
02:42:06,183 --> 02:42:08,802
You?
- Almost... Idiot

2044
02:42:16,391 --> 02:42:17,256
So?

2045
02:42:18,724 --> 02:42:19,719
So what?

2046
02:42:20,224 --> 02:42:21,552
Do you love someone?

2047
02:42:25,974 --> 02:42:26,803
Yes

2048
02:42:32,848 --> 02:42:33,713
Who?

2049
02:42:34,974 --> 02:42:35,886
You

2050
02:43:01,597 --> 02:43:04,797
See, the noses don't collide,
stupid

2051
02:43:06,014 --> 02:43:06,843
That's right;

2052
02:43:07,097 --> 02:43:08,211
Rancho

2053
02:43:09,722 --> 02:43:10,586
Hi... Farhan;

2054
02:43:10,763 --> 02:43:12,884
Screw your 'Hi'

2055
02:43:13,305 --> 02:43:18,045
Hey, listen to me...
- No, you listen to me

2056
02:43:18,221 --> 02:43:20,508
I can explain everything

2057
02:43:21,596 --> 02:43:22,460
Hi... Raju;

2058
02:43:25,888 --> 02:43:27,085
How we hunted for you;

2059
02:43:27,305 --> 02:43:31,428
Didn't have a coin
for one phone call?

2060
02:43:33,471 --> 02:43:35,758
Add a couple from me too

2061
02:43:36,304 --> 02:43:41,506
Rascal, scoundrel
- Let him go now

2062
02:43:41,637 --> 02:43:42,585
Ok ok, enough

2063
02:43:43,928 --> 02:43:45,718
On your feet, c'mon

2064
02:44:15,719 --> 02:44:17,461
Having fun, idiots?

2065
02:44:17,719 --> 02:44:19,591
Hey... Hi Chatur

2066
02:44:19,885 --> 02:44:24,957
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
How do you do, Mr. Teacher?

2067
02:44:25,385 --> 02:44:32,176
Wow, you're a teacher in a village -
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2068
02:44:34,094 --> 02:44:38,833
Our trains left together.
But yours traveled in reverse...

2069
02:44:39,385 --> 02:44:42,299
from engineer to primary teacher

2070
02:44:44,468 --> 02:44:47,382
What's your salary, Chanchad?
5000 /-?

2071
02:44:47,759 --> 02:44:49,549
For me that's $ 100

2072
02:44:49,967 --> 02:44:53,380
My son's pocket money is
more than your salary

2073
02:44:53,509 --> 02:44:56,341
Cut the crap
- Crap is what he gave us

2074
02:44:56,509 --> 02:45:01,581
Wanted to change the education
system, change the world

2075
02:45:01,800 --> 02:45:04,714
Finally what does he change?
Kids' diapers

2076
02:45:04,842 --> 02:45:06,251
You gonna break his jaw
or should I?

2077
02:45:06,425 --> 02:45:07,337
Just relax

2078
02:45:07,425 --> 02:45:14,216
Remember I'd said
one day you'd cry and I'd laugh?

2079
02:45:15,883 --> 02:45:22,673
Sign here.
Accept: You lost, I won!

2080
02:45:22,924 --> 02:45:25,957
'Declaration of Defeat'!
Unbelievable, man

2081
02:45:26,132 --> 02:45:28,207
Chatur
- Crazy guy

2082
02:45:29,966 --> 02:45:34,339
Hey, this is Virus's pen!
You pinched it?

2083
02:45:34,757 --> 02:45:36,167
Forget it, man

2084
02:45:36,840 --> 02:45:40,537
This is for winners, not losers

2085
02:45:41,632 --> 02:45:48,623
If your school ever needs help,
call my assistant for a donation

2086
02:45:50,757 --> 02:45:53,589
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2087
02:45:55,090 --> 02:45:57,874
He hasn't changed at all!
- Ignore him

2088
02:45:58,006 --> 02:45:59,499
He's full of crap

2089
02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:04,247
Good news is your name
isn't Ranchhoddas Chanchad

2090
02:46:04,631 --> 02:46:08,672
Imagine, after marriage,
I'm Pia Chanchad: Yuck;

2091
02:46:09,422 --> 02:46:10,915
By the way,
what is your real name?

2092
02:46:11,755 --> 02:46:12,668
Phunsukh Wangdu

2093
02:46:13,464 --> 02:46:14,376
Wangdu?

2094
02:46:14,547 --> 02:46:15,411
Pia Wangdu!

2095
02:46:16,089 --> 02:46:17,830
You mean you're a scientist?

2096
02:46:18,047 --> 02:46:19,374
You have 400 patents?

2097
02:46:19,505 --> 02:46:21,377
I won't change my name
after marriage

2098
02:46:21,422 --> 02:46:23,044
You mean you're Chatur's
Wangdu?

2099
02:46:23,089 --> 02:46:25,328
It's you the Japanese are wooing?

2100
02:46:25,380 --> 02:46:26,293
I don't like Wangdu

2101
02:46:26,879 --> 02:46:29,084
Are you a scientist
or a teacher?

2102
02:46:29,505 --> 02:46:31,412
Scientist,
but I also teach children

2103
02:46:31,505 --> 02:46:33,625
So you are
TH E Phunsukh Wangdu?

2104
02:46:33,671 --> 02:46:34,833
Yes, yes;

2105
02:46:36,087 --> 02:46:39,003
Hey Silencer
- Hey Chatur, come back

2106
02:46:40,255 --> 02:46:41,368
Take that

2107
02:46:42,879 --> 02:46:45,202
Wait, I'll stop him

2108
02:46:53,087 --> 02:46:56,702
Mr. Wangdu,
I can't believe it's you

2109
02:46:57,212 --> 02:46:58,456
I'm sorry, Mr. Chatur

2110
02:46:58,504 --> 02:47:00,874
I can't sign the deal
with your company

2111
02:47:01,379 --> 02:47:03,416
What sir? Why sir?

2112
02:47:03,628 --> 02:47:06,460
How do I sign, man?
You took my pen

2113
02:47:08,336 --> 02:47:10,327
What pen, sir?
I didn't get you...

2114
02:47:10,670 --> 02:47:14,877
The one in your hand -
Virus's pen

2115
02:47:18,377 --> 02:47:19,871
Mr. Wangdu...?

2116
02:47:20,044 --> 02:47:21,241
Yes, Chatur?

2117
02:47:22,044 --> 02:47:24,035
A for Apple, B for Ball is...

2118
02:47:27,169 --> 02:47:28,828
...S for Screwed

2119
02:47:35,960 --> 02:47:40,084
You got me, Rancho -
I mean, Mr. Wangdu

2120
02:47:40,460 --> 02:47:42,083
Totally floored me. Good one

2121
02:47:42,752 --> 02:47:47,041
I hope our personal problems
won't affect this deal

2122
02:47:47,210 --> 02:47:50,410
Hey Chatur: take that

2123
02:47:51,043 --> 02:47:53,034
I was just joking, man

2124
02:47:53,418 --> 02:47:57,282
Deep down,
I knew you'd do great things

2125
02:47:58,293 --> 02:48:00,082
You're fibbing

2126
02:48:00,167 --> 02:48:02,122
No, really, I swear

2127
02:48:02,209 --> 02:48:04,200
Rancho: 100, Chatur: 0

2128
02:48:04,584 --> 02:48:06,907
You win, I lose.
You don't believe me?

2129
02:48:08,293 --> 02:48:09,701
Beware of farts

2130
02:48:09,750 --> 02:48:14,040
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

2131
02:48:14,125 --> 02:48:16,495
Free advice, Mr. Wangdu -
Run for your life;

2132
02:48:20,208 --> 02:48:24,284
Rancho, I'll lose my job, man.
I have small kids...

2133
02:48:25,250 --> 02:48:27,785
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas
had correctly stated

2134
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:33,071
Follow Excellence... Success
will chase you, pants down
