1
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:37,041
Get out of my way!

2
00:01:58,309 --> 00:01:59,429
Ok, here they are.

3
00:01:59,663 --> 00:02:03,224
Philippe, wake up now,  
I bet you 100 euros that I'll lose them.

4
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:05,421
Philippe?
Deal.

5
00:02:05,662 --> 00:02:07,062
Let's do this!

6
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:31,049
Gosh, you're on a good night.

7
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:43,306
Fuck.

8
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,676
You lost them alright.

9
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,258
Get out of the car!
Hands on the hood!

10
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:52,618
- I double.
- 200 euros that they're escorting us.

11
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:54,378
You're gonna lose again.

12
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,261
-200 euros!

13
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:57,890
-Come on! Show me your hands!

14
00:02:58,089 --> 00:02:59,733
Your hands goddammit!

15
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:04,082
- Wait. I'm gonna explain.
- Shut up. Hands on the hood.

16
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,427
- Wait.
- Get out of the car. Now!

17
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,338
Take it easy!

18
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:13,040
He can't get out.
He can't even open the door.

19
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:15,759
Look at him for god's sake!

20
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:20,327
There's a wheel chair in the trunk.
He's disabled. Go check!

21
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,990
Get off me.

22
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:26,841
- He's telling the truth.
- SO!

23
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:28,529
What did you think?

24
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,662
You think i'm driving that fast.
for the fun of it? 

25
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,045
I was going to the hospital.
I'm working for him. He's having a stroke!

26
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:39,334
The more we wait, the worse it gets.
He can't move, he can't do anything.
That's why I'm here.

27
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:41,366
I think we have a problem here.

28
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,586
Come see this.

29
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:49,918
-  What the fuck do we do now?
- That's right, think about it. Take your time.

30
00:03:50,193 --> 00:03:53,998
But meanwhile call his 15 years old daughter
and tell her her father is dead because of you!

31
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:57,423
Because if he's not taken care of within
5 minutes, it's over.

32
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,015
But take your time.

33
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,883
Think. Think fast.
He's dying!

34
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:07,973
Alright, don't lose any more time.
Go.

35
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:21,447
- Where are you going?
- ER.

36
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:26,723
We're gonna escort you, it's safer.
Let's go, we're escorting them!

37
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:30,101
They're gone. They're leaving.

38
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:31,514
Good.

39
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,247
Philippe, this is so gross.

40
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:37,398
I can't deal with that, how do
you produce this... beuargh.

41
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:40,674
Alright, you'll really have to
get your license eventually.

42
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:42,999
Yes but meanwhile "we're gonna
escort you, it's safer".

43
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:45,823
A 200 euros escort.

44
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:48,241
What? I never bet such amounts
of money.

45
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:51,959
Let's celebrate a little bit.

46
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:53,450
"We're gonna escort you, it's safer"

47
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:56,485
Cool it. I helped you big time.

48
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:59,728
Philippe, an escort. A safe escort!

49
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:37,042
Here he comes.
 
50
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,126
We took care of it.
A stretcher will be here in a second.

51
00:06:40,343 --> 00:06:42,230
- Are you gonna be ok?
- Yeah, it's fine.

52
00:06:42,457 --> 00:06:44,557
- Good luck.
- Whatever.

53
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:01,226
Now what?

54
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,133
Now you let me decide.

55
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:18,978
UNTOUCHABLES

56
00:07:20,593 --> 00:07:24,128
Based on a true story

57

58
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:08,698
Do you have references?

59
00:08:08,932 --> 00:08:11,411
Well yes. I validated my CAFAD.

60
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:14,371
A certificate of aptitude to take care of
disabled persons.

61
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:18,965
I validated it in a renowned instute
in the Landes country in 2001


62
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:24,707
I have a high school "Proximity Services" diploma
and a bachelor's in "Social and Familial Economy"

63
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:30,292
I don't... like... I mean... I have been mostly
studying rather than working.

64
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:32,606
What is your main motivation?

65
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:34,683
Money. Duh!

66
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:36,308
Mankind.

67
00:08:36,764 --> 00:08:38,682
I'm all about mankind.

68
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,080
Good for you.

69
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:44,165
To help others, I think.
It's good right? It's a good
answer?

70
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,630
I like the neighbourhood.

71
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,633
I love disabled persons. Since I was
a little child actually.

72
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,641
To promotes disabled people's autonomy,
I'd say.

73
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:54,865
Their social insertion.

74
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,663
Sports too. You gotta move, you know.

75
00:08:57,846 --> 00:08:59,762
For the social life, I mean.

76
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:02,438
These people can't do anything...

77
 00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:05,747
I saw...had my first professionnal experience...

78
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,531
It was Mme Dupont Morathie

 79
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:10,724
A really old lady...

80
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:12,468
really old...

81
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:14,687
I assisted her...

82
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:16,955
until the end, day after day.

83
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:21,663
In geriatrics there were good times too.
We had King's cake ... er ...

84
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:25,763
Oh... I'm also an expert in administrative stuff...

85
00:09:26,007 --> 00:09:28,625
Financial aid ...
Welfare ...

86
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,386
I... I don't know...

87
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,617
maybe you qualify?

88
00:09:32,793 --> 00:09:35,805
You'll check, Magalie.
But I don't think so...

89
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:45,075
- Yvan Laprade?
- Yes.

90
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:50,387
- No no no, get out!   - I've been waitin for 2 hours.
- It's my turn now.

91
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:56,078
Hello.

92
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:58,101
I'm coming to have a paper signed.

93
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,189
Please take a seat.

94
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:07,448
Do you have references?

95
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:09,411
References? I do.

96
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:10,659
So?

97
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:11,782
We're all ears.

98
00:10:11,982 --> 00:10:14,861
"Kool & the Gang",  "Earth, Wind & Fire".

99
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:17,835
Those are good references, aren't they?

100
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,647
I don't know them. Take a seat.

101
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:22,146
If you don't know them, you
don't know anything about music.

102
00:10:22,345 --> 00:10:24,883
I don't think I'm incult when
it comes to music

103
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,271
- Even if I don't know you "Sool" whatever...
- NO.

104
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:28,502
"Kool & the Gang".

105
00:10:28,738 --> 00:10:32,410
What about you?
You know Chopin, Schubert, Berlioz?

106
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,430
You're asking me if I know Berlioz?

107
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:36,517
I'd be surprised if YOU knew
anything about Berlioz.

108
00:10:36,684 --> 00:10:38,430
I'm a specialist, though.

109
00:10:38,632 --> 00:10:39,752
Oh really...

110
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:41,869
Who do you know there?

111
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,197
- Which building?
- What do you mean which building?

112
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:47,417
But, man...

113
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:50,321
Berlioz was a famous composer before
your residency was called after him.

114
00:10:50,493 --> 00:10:52,835
Writer, critic of the 19th century.

115
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:57,687
It's a joke. I know who Berlioz is.
But I see humor is like music for you.

116
00:10:58,778 --> 00:11:01,386
You don't know anything about it.

117
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:06,833
Tell us about your paper.

118
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:12,121
I need a signature...
To prove I came to the interview.

119
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:16,624
It says that unfortunately, despite
my obvious qualities...
whatever usual bullshit you use

120
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,491
you're still not interested.

121
00:11:18,732 --> 00:11:20,638
I need 3 of these to get welfare money again.

122
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:22,761
I understand, welfare.

123
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:26,442
- You don't have any other motivation in life?
- Oh I do.

124
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:31,229
There's one right here.
This here is really motivating...

125
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,389
So, what's happening now?

126
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:37,191
Signing? Not signing?

127
00:11:37,387 --> 00:11:39,313
I'm sorry I can't sign it right now.

128
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:40,386
Why is that?

129
00:11:40,571 --> 00:11:41,691
Why?

130
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:53,717
Oh yeah, that's a bit annoying.

131
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:57,149
Because I have a deadline, and since
I'm pretty late...


132
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,284
It's "a bit annoying", indeed.

133
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:02,714
Can't the motivation sign for you?

134
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:05,678
No, Magalie can't do that.

135
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:07,685
It's a shame.

136
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:10,798
She could have dropped in her number as well.

137
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,377
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

138
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,337
9 am. Your paper will be signed.

139
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:16,057
I wouldn't want to deprive you
from welfare.

140
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:18,515
- Sorry I can't walk you to the door.
- It's all good.

141
00:12:18,753 --> 00:12:22,240
Don't get up... 
I mean stay seated.


142
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:24,533
See you tomorrow.

143
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:07,930
- Nina?
- Yeah?

144
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,155
- Is she here?
- No. She'll be back late.

145
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:14,393


146
00:13:16,484 --> 00:13:18,333
No!  Hey!

147
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:21,650
Don't use it now, it's using all the water.

148
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:23,474
Stop the water!

149
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:25,314
And get out.

150
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,802
- I'm showering, what are you doing here?
- Leave me alone.  - Get out!

151
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:30,842
Make them leave. Come on.

152
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:32,986
Bitou, I'm not joking.

153
00:13:33,183 --> 00:13:33,988
Nina!

154
00:13:34,168 --> 00:13:36,330
Nina.  Get out, you and your fat belly!

155
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:39,368
Let it go! 

156
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:41,334
Give me a towel . Why are you still here...

157
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,670
Get out, all of you!

158
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:44,033
Bitou, come one

159
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:45,431
Hey! Bitou!

160
 00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,838
What do you think you're doing?

161
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:48,893
Sit down.

162
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:50,953
What do you want?
Coca-Cola or this one?

163
00:13:51,187 --> 00:13:53,126
I want Coca-Cola.

164
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:09,321
- Where do you come from?
- School.

165
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:12,150
Can you wipe the thrash can?

166
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:14,684
Where are you going now?

167
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,539
Horse-riding.

168
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,579
That's right, act like a smart ass.

169
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:56,302
It's for you.

170
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,945
Where have you been?

171
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:03,624
- Holidays.
- Holidays?

172
00:15:03,832 --> 00:15:05,888
You think people don't talk around here?

173
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:07,928
That I'm incredibly stupid?

174
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:11,568
You've been gone for 6 months.
Not one phone call. Nothing.

175
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,037
And you come back, as if nothing happened,
giving me a Kinder egg?

176
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:17,814
Do you think I'm gonna pay the rent with that?


177
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:18,901
The groceries?

178
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,497
*african language*

179
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:23,086
*african language*

180
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:25,187
Do you think it's a hotel here?
 
181
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,186
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

182
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:31,837
Moron.

183
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:35,683
- It's impossible to talk with you.
- You want to talk?

184
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:37,135
Alright.

185
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:41,113
I'm listening.

186
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:48,905
I'm listening now.

187
00:15:51,188 --> 00:15:52,767
You know Driss...

188
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,087
I prayed a lot for you.

189
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:57,640
But god forgive me...
 
190
00:15:57,887 --> 00:15:59,712
I have other children.

191
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,724
I still have hope for them.

192
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:08,134
I don't want to see you around
here anymore.

193
00:16:08,423 --> 00:16:10,499
You're taking all your stuff.

194
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:12,020
And you get the fuck out of here.

195
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,965
Got it?
 
196
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:16,384
Leave.

197
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:19,610
Leave!

198
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:32,778
... and he's gone!

199
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,771
It's a good one, right?

200
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:38,712
Ok, I'm off.

201
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:41,851
You don't think it was funny?

202
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:36,164
Yes?

203
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,912
- I'm here for my paper.
- Yes, I was waiting for you.

204
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:42,707
- You know... the paper.
- Get in.

205
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:54,974
Can you tell Philipp the boy is here?

206
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,121
Of course.

207
00:19:02,164 --> 00:19:04,158
- So?
- The beats are not quite done.

208
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:08,034
- But the radish are good.
- Ok.     - Hello.

209
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:15,438
Let's go.

210
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:20,536
Just so you know,
he had a rough night.

211
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,341
Just like you, apparently.

212
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,603
The day starts at 7

213
00:19:24,823 --> 00:19:26,543
with the nurse.

214
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:29,825
He needs 2 to 3 hours of care every morning.

215
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:33,107
I'm warning you, most people
give up after a week.

216
00:19:33,324 --> 00:19:35,375
They come and go pretty fast.

217
00:19:35,571 --> 00:19:36,612
Well...

218
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,590
I like the furniture, the music,
it's cool and all...

219
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:41,183
but I don't think I'll buy it.

220
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:42,398
And i don't have the whole day.

221
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:46,229
Listen, I was asked to give you a tour,
believe me I also have better things to do.

222
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:48,140
It's almost done anyway.

223
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:50,499
Here, you can communicate
with a babyphone.

224
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:53,222
It's like a Walkie-Talkie.
You hear him, he hears you.

225
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:57,294
According to the contract, you
also have your own room.

226
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,579
The toilets.

227
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:02,919
And a bathroom.

228
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,220
A private bathroom.

229
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:09,552
Hello...

230
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,747
It's here.

231
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:26,738
He's waiting for you.

232
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:29,687
One minute...

233
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:41,207
So I signed your paper.

234
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:45,211
It's in an envelope, on the little table.

235
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:53,161
By the way, how is it to be forced
to rely on others for a living?

236
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,111
What?

237
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:59,001
You don't have a problem living
from other people's work ?

238
00:20:59,236 --> 00:21:01,710
I'm good, what about you?

239
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:05,922
Do you think you'd be able to work?

240
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:07,840
I mean with duties, a schedule...

241
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:09,508
Responsibilities.

242
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,227
I was wrong.
You're funny.

243
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:15,132
I'm so funny I'm ready to take you
on a one month trial.

244
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:18,593
Do you want the day to think about it?

245
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:23,299
I don't think you'll make it past two weeks.

246
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,008
What?

247
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,526
You can't forget a single bone or
a single muscle.

248
00:21:53,707 --> 00:21:54,723
Everything has to move.

249
00:21:56,934 --> 00:21:58,294
we want to keep the skin and
the joints healthy.

250
00:21:58,548 --> 00:22:01,914
You'll have to be very meticulous.

251
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,078
Rigorous.

252
00:22:03,315 --> 00:22:05,244
Ok? You get it?

253
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:07,037
Hey, wake up!

254
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:08,432
Sleep at night.

255
00:22:08,713 --> 00:22:11,129
- I'm not sleeping.
- Come help me.

256
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:14,589
We're going to bring Philippe to his chair.

257
00:22:14,903 --> 00:22:16,763
And then to the shower.

258
00:22:18,412 --> 00:22:19,927
You know what?

259
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:23,456
Try yourself.  
Show me.

260
00:22:29,356 --> 00:22:30,860
Don't be afraid. Go ahead.

261
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:32,618
I'm not afraid.

262
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,166
- There. Good enough?
- Wait!

263
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:50,468
Never let him go until he's all strapped.

264
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:52,678
It's one of my sins.

265
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,717
None told me.

266
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:59,115
I'm in training.

267
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:02,504
Do you want gloves or what?
Rub harder, for god's sake.


268
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:05,523
It doesn't foam!
It's a weird shampoo.

269
00:23:05,766 --> 00:23:07,344
- How is it going?
- I'm washing his hair...

270
00:23:07,504 --> 00:23:08,651
but it doesn't foam.

271
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:09,832
What do you mean?

272
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:12,477
What the hell...
are you kidding me?

273
00:23:12,702 --> 00:23:14,763
You put the cream for his feet
in his hair.

274
00:23:14,969 --> 00:23:16,188
Wait, wait...

275
00:23:16,993 --> 00:23:20,924
Please tell me you can read.

276
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,880
You look really talented, don't you?

277
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,459
They look exactly the same.
Why isn't there only one for everything?

278
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:27,700
There are 20 of them.

279
00:23:27,942 --> 00:23:30,303
Ok, move on now.
I won't stay here for 2 hours.

280
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:34,097
- So I'm using this one?
- The one that says "shampoo".

281
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:38,003
- Are you gonna be ok?
- Of course, he'll be ok.

282
00:23:38,214 --> 00:23:40,442
My feet have never been styled so well.

283
00:23:40,677 --> 00:23:43,527
Go have your lunch, Marcelle.
Everything is fine.

284
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,912
Wow, do these come with a skirt?

285
00:23:47,143 --> 00:23:51,044
Those are contension stockings.
If I don't wear them, my blood won't flow 

286
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:53,282
and I'll pass out.

287
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:58,202
I'm not putting stocking on you.	

288
00:23:58,452 --> 00:24:00,128
We're gonna have a problem here.

289
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:03,851
Since I won't do it, we'll have to...
at a point... I mean...

290
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:05,995
we'll have to figure out if... Marcelle!

291
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:08,379
Maybe she can come back...

292
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,112
and do it herself.

293
00:24:10,338 --> 00:24:13,439
Since she's a girl and everything,
she knows how to.

294
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:15,983
I don't even know why we're debating,
I'm not gonna do it.

295
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:19,847
Even for you, at this point you'd
probably better pass out...

296
00:24:20,128 --> 00:24:25,301
You have to say no, to stand up for yourself.
Marcelle! We're not going to do the stockings.

297
00:24:33,902 --> 00:24:39,226
What's the matter, you're dealing with the stockings,
you have a cute little earring, I think it's coherent.

298
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:41,889
Easy on the sass, alright?

299
00:24:42,468 --> 00:24:44,208
Looks like you have experience...

300
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:47,579
No? You never thought about...

301
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:51,198
starting a salon or something?

302
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,975
Ok. Done.

303
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:56,855
Now what are these gloves for?

304
00:24:57,066 --> 00:24:59,262
Er... we're going to wait a while more for this.

305
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,076
You're not quite ready.

306
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:03,046
No. He's not quite ready.

307
00:25:03,304 --> 00:25:05,886
What does it mean, Marcelle?

308
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:08,339
- What is that?
- We'll explain at a point.

309
00:25:08,582 --> 00:25:10,132
Marcelle, we have to talk...

310
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:12,258
There's a problem with the training.

311
00:25:12,563 --> 00:25:15,226
It's not about being ready.
I do not do that.

312
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,470
I don't empty a stranger's butt.

313
00:25:17,668 --> 00:25:19,404
I don't even empty a friend's butt.

314
00:25:19,647 --> 00:25:21,006
I usually don't empty butts.

315
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,152
It's a matter of principles.

316
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:27,228
Can we talk about this later?
When I'm done eating, for example?

317
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:32,349
No.

318
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:35,042
No use speaking about it later.
I'm done with this.

319
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:37,256
It's weird, I don't like it.

320
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:40,568
I didn't say anything about the stockings.
But it cost me.

321
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:43,196
I'm making compromises, please do
the same for me.

322
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:46,656
- I'm done with the butt-emptying issue.
- I think I get it.

323
00:25:46,872 --> 00:25:48,586
It's not right.
I'm done.

324
00:25:48,822 --> 00:25:50,876
- Bon appetit.  
- Thank you.

325
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,043
- Pretty, huh?
- I love it.

326
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,404
Am I bothering you?

327
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,629
Is it a theater or what?

328
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,687
- I'm trying to eat here.
- Hey, what's up?

329
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:15,473
- Do you know where I can find a beer?
- Try in your hair.

330
00:26:16,653 --> 00:26:18,336
We had two 6-packs,
did you take them?

331
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:19,403
I don't know. I don't care.

332
00:26:19,617 --> 00:26:21,583
So take your feather duster with
you and leave.

333
00:26:21,756 --> 00:26:23,156
Come on, let's get out of here.

334
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:26,334
It's the new guy working for my father

335
00:26:26,562 --> 00:26:29,189
The "guy" has a name you know.

336
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:54,718
Damn.

337
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:56,039
- What?
- Sorry.

338
00:26:56,227 --> 00:26:57,679
- What happened?
- Nothing.

339
00:26:57,881 --> 00:26:59,701
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

340
00:27:00,372 --> 00:27:02,192
I'm massaging.

341
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:15,892
That is nuts.

342
00:27:16,824 --> 00:27:19,577
Are you having fun?

343
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:22,206
You don't feel anything down there!

344
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:23,203
What the hell...

345
00:27:23,405 --> 00:27:25,853
- What are you doing again?
- Experiments.

346
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:27,194
He doesn't give a shit, he feels nothing!
Look!

347
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,257
Stop it, you're gonna burn him.

348
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,485
Lawyer.

349
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:41,626
Lawyer.

350
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:46,462
No... this is personal.
I'll read it later.

351
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:48,772
Personal file?

352
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:51,312
Ok.

353
00:27:54,865 --> 00:27:56,685
Thrash.

354
00:27:56,949 --> 00:27:58,523
She has a little something, though.

355
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:02,130
Can't we create a hooker file?

356
00:28:07,924 --> 00:28:10,539
- Bon appetit.
- Thanks.

357
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:17,818
Please.

358
00:28:20,915 --> 00:28:22,235
Sorry.

359
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:23,828
I'm sorry.

360
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:34,521
Fuck, I keep forgetting.

361
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,780
Fuck, sorry.

362
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:46,742
That's good.

363
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:49,887
Driss?

364
00:28:50,082 --> 00:28:51,632
Can you come?

365
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,640
Do you hear me, Driss?

366
00:28:54,573 --> 00:28:56,393
Can you please come?

367
00:28:57,727 --> 00:28:58,847
Driss.

368
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,245
Driss.

369
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,810
What?

370
00:29:09,022 --> 00:29:11,466
It's almost 9.
Philippe is waiting.

371
00:29:11,698 --> 00:29:14,632
It's 9 alreday? I lost track of time,
it took forever for my bath to foam.

372
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,916
- This room's a piggery.
- Make me a coffee, I'm coming.

373
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:20,956
What about the babyphone?
It's supposed to always be with you.

374
00:29:21,152 --> 00:29:25,547
And I want Nutella! Not jams with weird fruits
that nobody knows of.

375
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,619


376
00:29:31,358 --> 00:29:33,008


377
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:36,011


378
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:46,218
I'm not going in there.

379
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,779
Even you!

380
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:51,795
I'm not gonna load you in the back
like a horse.

381
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:54,358
What about this one?

382
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:57,015
This one is not fit for me.

383
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:04,141
- What do you mean?
- I have to be pragmatic.

384
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,929
Pragmatic?

385
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:11,121
Oh damn!

386
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:13,359
Son of a...

387
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:14,999
Feels good, right?

388
00:30:15,222 --> 00:30:17,349
- It does!
- So good.

389
00:30:17,547 --> 00:30:19,648
It's nervous!

390
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:20,961
Let's go.

391
00:30:30,957 --> 00:30:32,876
That's the neighbour again.
He always parks here.

392
00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:36,400
He thinks it's his own parking spot.

393
00:30:37,729 --> 00:30:40,500
I see some change coming.

394
00:30:42,822 --> 00:30:44,146
- Hi, how is it going Patrick Swayze?
- What?

395
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,342
Would you like a cup of coffee?

396
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:48,337
- Can I see that?
- What the...

397
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:49,554
Come here.

398
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:53,540
Now read this. Read!

399
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,826
"No Parking"

400
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:57,675
- Louder. I can't hear you.   - "No Parking"!
- That's the way to do it.

401
00:30:57,864 --> 00:30:59,203
- Read the bottom of it.
- "Reserved spot".

402
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:02,125
Now you keep that in mind,
and you get the fuck out of here.

403
00:31:02,353 --> 00:31:04,068
Hurry up.

404
00:31:04,267 --> 00:31:05,667
Get lost!

405
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:17,240
We're opening on tuesday.
It will be sold by tuesday night.

406
00:31:17,425 --> 00:31:20,259
Can we go?
You've been looking at this for an hour.

407
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,151
You're gonna have to move at a point.

408
00:31:22,308 --> 00:31:24,647
This painting expresses an overwhelming serenity.

409
00:31:24,804 --> 00:31:26,606
And some violence as well.

410
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:27,889
I find it very moving.

411
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:30,492
Red stains on a white background
are moving?

412
00:31:30,716 --> 00:31:32,794
How much for this thing?

413
00:31:32,995 --> 00:31:35,758
I think it's 30 000 euros.
I can check if you want.

414
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:39,836
You'd better check indeed.
It sounds exaggerated.

415
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:44,547
You're not gonna pay 30 000 euros
for this piece of crap!

416
00:31:44,705 --> 00:31:46,969
- Unbelievable.
- You'd better believe it.

417
00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:49,755
This dude nosebled on a white
board and asks 30 000 euros for it?

418
00:31:49,962 --> 00:31:54,445
Tell me Driss, why do you think
people are interested in art?

419
00:31:54,947 --> 00:31:58,060
- I don't know, it's a business.
- No.

420
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,936
That's because it's the only thing
one leaves behind.

421
00:32:01,141 --> 00:32:05,375
That's bullshit. For 50 bucks and a stop at a hardware 
store, I can leave something behind as well.

422
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,269
I can even add extra blue 
for free if you wan

423
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:10,495
Stop talking nonsense.
Give me a M&M's.

424
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:12,169
No.

425
00:32:13,547 --> 00:32:15,122
Give me a M&M's.

426
00:32:16,423 --> 00:32:18,580
No feet, No sweets.

427
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,482
Hey, I'm joking.

428
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:24,055
It's a joke!

429
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,354
- Oh it's a joke!
- Well yeah!

430
00:32:26,565 --> 00:32:28,427
- A joke...
- A good one, right?

431
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:30,691
Really funny.

432
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:32,000
It's a classic.

433
00:32:32,234 --> 00:32:34,565
No feet, No sweets.

434
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,170
Give me one.

435
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,069
- It's so good!
- Cool it.

436
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:39,678
Oh come on!

437
00:32:40,102 --> 00:32:42,347
No legs, Philippe.

438
00:32:42,975 --> 00:32:46,626
I'll say it again for the tight-ass chick.
Too bad there's no audience.

439
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:52,031
Sorry, I was wrong about the price.

440
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,356
- Sounds right.
- Yes.

441
00:32:53,551 --> 00:32:55,932
It's 41.500 euros.

442
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:57,347
I'll take it.

443
00:32:58,082 --> 00:32:59,202
Really.

444
00:33:08,311 --> 00:33:09,431
Hi, Philippe.

445
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:11,931
How are you doing?

446
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:14,273
You summoned me, I'm here.

447
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:15,726
I'm listening.

448
00:33:16,147 --> 00:33:17,963
What's so important?

449
00:33:18,182 --> 00:33:21,348
I didn't 'summon' you...

450
00:33:24,989 --> 00:33:28,451
Can't you guess?

451
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:31,904
Who is this guy?

452
00:33:32,107 --> 00:33:34,078
Everybody's worried.
 
453
00:33:34,377 --> 00:33:37,043
Yvonne told me he's unstable,
brutal.

454
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,327
He hit a neighbour.

455
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:43,059
Philippe, you know better than
me you have to be careful.

456
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:46,369
You can't let anybody come
at your place.

457
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,858
Especially given your condition...

458
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:50,460
In this case...

459
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,709
I'm not quite sure you know
who you're dealing with.

460
00:33:55,671 --> 00:33:57,619
Go on...

461
00:33:58,268 --> 00:34:00,424
I have contacts in the police.

462
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,636
He's not Al Capone, but...

463
00:34:02,856 --> 00:34:05,608
he's not mother Theresa either.

464
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:10,141
He's just out of prison.
6 months for robbing a jewelry.

465
00:34:10,436 --> 00:34:12,783
If at least he was qualified...

466
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:15,819
but I hear he sucks.

467
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:18,476
Be careful. You know guy from
the suburbs have no mercy.

468
00:34:18,702 --> 00:34:21,121
That's it.

469
00:34:21,345 --> 00:34:23,992
That's what I want.
No mercy. [=No pity in french]

470
00:34:24,914 --> 00:34:28,863
He often hands me the phone,
you know why? He just forgets.

471
00:34:29,082 --> 00:34:31,863
So you're right. He doesn't really
feel any empathy for me.

472
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,966
But he's tall, strong, healthy,
and not as dumb as you think.

473
00:34:37,146 --> 00:34:40,388
So for now, given my 'condition'
like you say...

474
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:44,364
I don't give a damn about where
he comes from and what he's done.

475
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,020
As you want.

476
00:34:49,105 --> 00:34:50,925
That's all you wanted to say?

477
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:55,749
Hey, Magalie.

478
00:34:55,966 --> 00:34:57,664
- Do you have a minute?
- No, not really.

479
00:34:57,899 --> 00:35:00,424
I just want to show you
something really fast.

480
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:03,675
- What is it?
- Don't freak out, you'll see.

481
00:35:03,863 --> 00:35:07,618
- One minute, that's it.
- Deal.

482
00:35:12,157 --> 00:35:15,133
- So?
- So I have a bathtub.

483
00:35:15,378 --> 00:35:16,498
See.

484
00:35:17,702 --> 00:35:20,240
- Really fascinating...
- Yeah.

485
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,817
- So what?
- I was thinking...

486
00:35:23,026 --> 00:35:24,452
we could take a bath.

487
00:35:24,671 --> 00:35:26,043
It's big. There's enough room.

488
00:35:26,278 --> 00:35:29,867
I have bath salts, shower gel...

489
00:35:30,315 --> 00:35:31,534
Alright.

490
00:35:31,902 --> 00:35:33,761
Why not, after all?

491
00:35:34,476 --> 00:35:36,196
Exactly. Why not.

492
00:35:36,398 --> 00:35:37,784
Go ahead.

493
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:40,983
- Start undressing.
- Oh you're gonna play it naughty.

494
00:35:41,195 --> 00:35:42,315
I like that.

495
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:46,090
I'm taking off my clothes.
No problem.

496
00:35:48,423 --> 00:35:49,543
What?

497
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:51,364
Where are you going?

498
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,818
You agreed!

499
00:35:54,053 --> 00:35:57,357
We don't even have to use the salts.

500
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,658
What are you looking at?

501
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:04,701
I'm always anxious in the morning,
when the mail arrives.

502
00:36:05,149 --> 00:36:06,518
As Apollinaire once said...

503
00:36:06,846 --> 00:36:08,463
Quote...

504
00:36:08,652 --> 00:36:10,519
'I'm desperate when I don't hear from you...

505
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,720
Wait.

506
00:36:12,915 --> 00:36:14,756
I'm lost, you're going too fast.

507
00:36:14,975 --> 00:36:16,775
I was at : "As Apollinaire once said...".

508
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:20,930
Quote 'I'm desperate when I don't hear from you...

509
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:26,967
You might not get it, but this
is an intimate time.

510
00:36:27,397 --> 00:36:29,626
- Nope, I don't get it.
- Give it back.

511
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:31,534
I'll shut it down if you explain.

512
00:36:31,753 --> 00:36:34,093
There's nothing to explain.

513
00:36:34,344 --> 00:36:36,227
He's sending letters.

514
00:36:36,454 --> 00:36:37,583
Letters?

515
00:36:37,825 --> 00:36:40,292
- To whom?
- To women, usually.

516
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:42,469
Tell me, who is it?

517
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:46,211
There's one in particular.
Eleonore.

518
00:36:46,461 --> 00:36:48,449
Who is Eleonore?
I've never seen her.

519
00:36:48,637 --> 00:36:49,762
How come?

520
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:53,283
That's how epistolary relationships work.

521
00:36:55,602 --> 00:36:57,329
It means they write letters

522
00:36:57,587 --> 00:36:59,446
they only communicate by mail.

523
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:02,257
I'm not stupid, I got it.

524
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:06,282
Are those the blue letters?

525
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:10,098
What a seducer.

526
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:13,479
He's 'epistoling' like a boss

527
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:15,078
What about you?

528
00:37:15,323 --> 00:37:17,500
Isn't there someone?

529
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,821
Even Albert, the gardener?

530
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,195
- Not at all.
- Come on, I noticed.

531
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:25,065
He always has a smile for you.

532
00:37:25,252 --> 00:37:26,710
Am I right?

533
00:37:26,937 --> 00:37:30,250
- Am I right or not?
- Stop it now. It's ridiculous.

534
00:37:30,651 --> 00:37:32,061
- So did he get some or what?

535
00:37:32,272 --> 00:37:35,370
- What are you talking about?
- Did he plant his own cucumber?

536
00:37:36,728 --> 00:37:37,848
What?

537
00:37:39,477 --> 00:37:41,980
- I can't believe you...
- Albert, Albert...

538
00:37:42,645 --> 00:37:44,199
- Soon.
- No!

539
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:46,310
Soon, trust me.

540
00:38:04,846 --> 00:38:06,246
Fuck.

541
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:11,191
Hello...

542
00:38:12,388 --> 00:38:13,508
Are you ok?

543
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,232
Do you need music?

544
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:44,653
Stay calm.

545
00:38:44,996 --> 00:38:47,096
Calm down, Philippe.

546
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:57,101
Philippe.
Hey, Philippe.

547
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,370
Try to relax.

548
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,538
Breathe slowly.

549
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,650
Can you hear me?

550
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:22,013
Slowly.

551
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:28,833
You're gonna be ok.

552
00:39:52,602 --> 00:39:53,722
I need air.

553
00:39:54,301 --> 00:39:55,421
Air!

554
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:36,217
The fresh air feels great.

555
00:40:37,131 --> 00:40:40,430
- What time is it?
- I don't know, around 4 am.

556
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:45,513
I haven't been out in Paris by
this time of the day in a long time.

557
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,493
What happened?

558
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,526
Medication side effect.

559
00:40:50,872 --> 00:40:53,878
Doctors call these 'Ghost pains'.

560
00:40:55,173 --> 00:41:00,446
I rather say that I'm a frozen steak
thrown in a burning pan.

561
00:41:01,016 --> 00:41:04,160
I don't feel anything, but it's still painful.

562
00:41:06,293 --> 00:41:09,724
It has to stop. There must be
something that will relieve you.

563
00:41:11,275 --> 00:41:14,815
Yup. This could relieve me.

564
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:18,663
Well, we're all a little sick
when it comes to this...


565
00:41:18,883 --> 00:41:22,556
I might even be sicker than you.

566
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,778
By the way, I meant to ask you.
About the ladies...

567
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,759
Can you...?
How does it work?

568
00:41:30,884 --> 00:41:32,322
I have to adapt.

569
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:34,552
But concretely...
Can you do it or not?

570
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,128
I don't know if you're aware, but I have 
no feelings between my neck and my toes.

571
00:41:40,605 --> 00:41:42,425
So you can't.

572
00:41:44,111 --> 00:41:45,630
It's complicated.

573
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:48,871
I can, but I'm not always
the one to decide when.

574
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:50,812
Also, there's pleasure to be
found elsewhere.

575
00:41:51,101 --> 00:41:52,159
Really?

576
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:53,861
You can't imagine.

577
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:56,852
I sure can't.
What do you mean?

578
00:41:57,078 --> 00:42:00,032
The ears, for instance.

579
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:01,650
What about the ears?

580
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:06,062
It's a very sensitive,
erogenous area.

581
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,100
So you get your ears licked?

582
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:12,501
I couldn't have thought about that.

583
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,000
Philippe.

584
00:42:30,772 --> 00:42:33,757
- Hit that. It will help.
- What is this bullshit.

585
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,184
Come on, it can't get any worse.

586
00:42:36,533 --> 00:42:37,709
Hit it.

587
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,663
Come on, harder.

588
00:42:40,252 --> 00:42:42,495
Alright, let's share.

589
00:42:44,123 --> 00:42:45,523
More.

590
00:42:49,303 --> 00:42:52,530
- A bit more.
- Enough for tonight.

591
00:42:52,993 --> 00:42:55,818
Sorry to bring this back, but I'm
really curious about the ear thing.

592
00:42:56,048 --> 00:42:59,938
So if you have red ears, it means
you're turned on?

593
00:43:00,157 --> 00:43:01,977
That's it.

594
00:43:02,216 --> 00:43:05,779
Sometimes I even wake up with
hard lobes.

595
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:08,831
Both of them?

596
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:15,632
I met my wife Alice when we were
studying political sciences. We were 20.

597
00:43:15,877 --> 00:43:17,736
She was tall and elegant.

598
00:43:18,002 --> 00:43:19,938
Joyful bright eyes.

599
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,056
I saw pictures at your place.
It's the blonde one, right?

600
00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:24,251
Not bad.

601
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:26,801
We had an incredible story together.

602
00:43:26,994 --> 00:43:29,607
I wish you the same.

603
00:43:29,856 --> 00:43:33,165
God I loved her so much.

604
00:43:42,813 --> 00:43:45,402
Then she got pregnant once, twice...

605
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,695
She had five miscarriages.

606
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:55,721
Finally the doctors gave a diagnosis.
She didn't have much longer.

607
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:59,162
We decided to adopt anyway.

608
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:12,410
Sir.

609
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,449
Please.

610
00:44:15,346 --> 00:44:17,235
Please!

611
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:23,105
Yes.

612
00:44:23,814 --> 00:44:24,748
I want...

613
00:44:24,967 --> 00:44:27,473
I'm gonna have a tarte tatin.

614
00:44:27,674 --> 00:44:31,602
But cooked all the way.
Because the chocolate cake had a problem.

615
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:33,339
It was all fluid inside...

616
00:44:33,561 --> 00:44:34,796
flowing everywhere. It was weird.

617
00:44:36,561 --> 00:44:38,796
That's what a 'mi-cuit' is supposed to do, sir.

618
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,696
- That's why?
- Yes.

619
00:44:40,938 --> 00:44:42,765
I'm still gonna have a tarte tatin.

620
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:45,005
I always liked competition.

621
00:44:45,217 --> 00:44:47,306
Extreme sports, speed...

622
00:44:47,581 --> 00:44:50,338
Going faster, higher...

623
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,641
I had it all with paragliding.

624
00:44:52,822 --> 00:44:56,177
I got high, could see everything.
And breathe.

625
00:44:56,409 --> 00:45:00,860
I was raised with the conviction I was 
good enough to pee on the whole world.

626
00:45:01,234 --> 00:45:04,871
I'd like to drink something.
My mouth feels dry.

627
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:09,288
That's one of the side effects
when you smoke  weed..

628
00:45:09,595 --> 00:45:12,461
- What are the other ones?
- It makes you hungry...

629
00:45:12,672 --> 00:45:15,049
And chatty.

630
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:22,578
And then a day of bad weather,
a day I shouldn't have gone paragliding.

631
00:45:22,917 --> 00:45:24,444
But you did.

632
00:45:24,687 --> 00:45:29,935
Maybe to to share Alice's pain,
because I knew she wouldn't make it.

633
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:32,619
In the end, two broken cervicals.

634
00:45:32,807 --> 00:45:35,178
And only my head left to get high.

635
00:45:35,419 --> 00:45:39,416
The pain didn't take my mind away.

636
00:45:40,693 --> 00:45:44,587
My true disability is not having
to be in a wheel chair.

637
00:45:46,282 --> 00:45:48,102
It's having to be without her.

638
00:45:50,903 --> 00:45:53,003
What do the doctors say?

639
00:45:53,197 --> 00:45:56,529
You know, with the recent progress,
they're gonna keep me alive until 70.

640
00:45:56,811 --> 00:45:59,135
With massages and medication.

641
00:45:59,379 --> 00:46:03,530
It's expensive... 
but I'm a rich tetraplegic.

642
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:06,977
I would shoot myself.

643
00:46:07,204 --> 00:46:10,145
Well, you can't even do that
when you're tetraplegic.

644
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,260
Oh shit. That's right.

645
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:15,316
That's tough, man.

646
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:17,731
What day are we today?

647
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,342
I don't know, the 8th or the 9th...

648
00:46:19,585 --> 00:46:21,319
So it's official!

649
00:46:21,507 --> 00:46:24,277
- What?
- You did it.

650
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,338
Your trial is over.

651
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,457
- So I'm hired?
- Of course you're hired.

652
00:46:29,644 --> 00:46:32,149
- Can I count on you?
- Yeah.

653
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:33,209
Good.

654
00:46:33,428 --> 00:46:37,231
Then give me the 'Faberge' egg back.

655
00:46:37,942 --> 00:46:39,367
It's a gift from Alice.

656
00:46:39,571 --> 00:46:43,621
She got me one each year we were
together. I have 25 of them.

657
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,026
They're really important to me.

658
00:46:46,394 --> 00:46:47,741
I don't know, what do you...

659
00:46:47,976 --> 00:46:50,151
I didn't do it.

660
00:46:50,419 --> 00:46:52,312
What kind of egg is that?

661
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:07,220
Nina.

662
00:47:10,293 --> 00:47:13,361
- What are you doing here?
- Hurry up, get in the car.

663
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:16,215
Put your seatbelt on.

664
00:47:26,275 --> 00:47:27,675
How are you?

665
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:36,218
How is school?

666
00:47:37,228 --> 00:47:39,243
Why don't you answer my texts?

667
00:47:40,534 --> 00:47:42,354
I was busy.

668
00:47:44,902 --> 00:47:47,477
So tell me, who did you talk to on the phone?

669
00:47:47,738 --> 00:47:49,588
A cop, he wanted to talk to mom.

670
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,315
I faked her voice and told him
someone was going to pick him up.

671
00:47:54,775 --> 00:47:57,541
Did you find my egg?

672
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,940
Did you find it or not?

673
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:04,799
I don't care about your stupid egg.
I didn't find it anyway.

674
00:48:13,127 --> 00:48:14,356
What did you tell them?

675
00:48:14,528 --> 00:48:16,078
Nothing. I had nothing to tell them.

676
00:48:16,281 --> 00:48:18,724
I only had 30 grams, you know the law.
They couldn't do anything.

677
00:48:18,912 --> 00:48:21,658
They kept me in custody and
eventually had to let me go.

678
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,079
Do you want to have a sandwich?

679
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:26,756
- I'm not getting in this car.
- Cool it.

680
00:48:26,989 --> 00:48:28,580
- Let me go!
- Shut up. Who's taking you home?

681
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:31,527
- Who's taking you home?

682
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,755
- Get lost.
- It's none of your business.

683
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:35,774
- Get lost!

684
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,214
Her polished eyes are carved in delicate minerals,

685
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:55,701
And in this strange and symbolic nature...

686
00:48:55,968 --> 00:48:58,199
'And in this strange'

687
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,721
'and symbolic"

688
00:49:01,184 --> 00:49:03,889
- 'nature'
- How boring is that?

689
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:09,432
'Where the pure angel merges
with the antic sphynx'

690
00:49:09,664 --> 00:49:11,565
I never know if 'sphynx' takes
a 'i' or a 'y'?

691
00:49:11,832 --> 00:49:14,858
I'm so bored by all this.

692
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,208
It's a 'i'.

693
00:49:17,439 --> 00:49:19,940
Do you really have to go through this bullshit?

694
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:22,097
A sphynx, daisies, angels...

695
00:49:22,674 --> 00:49:25,479
Would you care for a guy telling you this?

696
00:49:25,813 --> 00:49:28,480
Of course, some use a more basic method.

697
00:49:29,658 --> 00:49:31,570
What's next?

698
00:49:31,789 --> 00:49:33,480
What does Eleonore look like?

699
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:36,503
I don't know, I don't care.

700
00:49:36,759 --> 00:49:39,559
It's intellectual. Emotional.

701
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:42,527
It comes before the physical
relationship for me.

702
00:49:42,714 --> 00:49:44,435
Intellectual alright, but  what
if she looks like a dog?

703
00:49:44,677 --> 00:49:47,125
You'd be having an intellectual
relationship with a dog.

704
00:49:47,315 --> 00:49:48,435
Very elegant.

705
00:49:48,743 --> 00:49:49,863
Really.

706
00:49:50,896 --> 00:49:52,645
What else.

707
00:49:52,874 --> 00:49:53,948
Bravo.

708
00:49:54,113 --> 00:49:56,695
How long has it been going on?

709
00:50:01,513 --> 00:50:03,333
He's such a pain in the ass.

710
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,932
Six months.

711
00:50:06,189 --> 00:50:07,382
Six months?

712
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,306
And you've never seen her?

713
00:50:09,572 --> 00:50:11,519
She really might be ugly. Or fat.

714
00:50:11,706 --> 00:50:12,980
Or even disabled.

715
00:50:13,169 --> 00:50:16,084
You should add that after the poem: 
'by the way, how much do you weigh' ?

716
00:50:16,324 --> 00:50:17,001
Write it.

717
00:50:17,203 --> 00:50:20,425
Thanks a lot for your
useful advice, Driss.

718
00:50:20,673 --> 00:50:22,413
Let's get back to it.

719
00:50:22,649 --> 00:50:24,049
Where was I?

720
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:30,239
I think a sphynx was eating daisies,
running in the fields, doing weird stuff.

721
00:50:30,476 --> 00:50:31,596
Let's see...

722
00:50:32,271 --> 00:50:34,781
'strange and symbolic nature'

723
00:50:35,023 --> 00:50:38,546
And in this strange and symbolic nature...

724
00:50:38,874 --> 00:50:39,879
You have to call her.

725
00:50:40,142 --> 00:50:44,032
- Where the pure angel merges with
the antic sphynx...

726
00:50:44,235 --> 00:50:45,934
I'm telling you.
Call her.

727
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:50,340
Spot it, Driss.
I'm better at written communication.

728
00:50:50,677 --> 00:50:51,662
Unbelievable.

729
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:55,855
Alright, but I'm gonna look for her
phone number, it stresses me out.

730
00:50:56,324 --> 00:50:57,203
Hey!

731
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:00,620
She's from the north... that's not good.

732
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:02,355
Leave this envelope.

733
00:51:02,534 --> 00:51:05,545
Never has a 'Miss France' come from the north.
They usually look like crap over there.

734
00:51:05,749 --> 00:51:07,342
Give the envelope back now.

735
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,887
She wrote her phone number, god damn it.
It's a sign. She wants you to call her!

736
00:51:11,075 --> 00:51:12,990
Please. Let it go.

737
00:51:13,222 --> 00:51:16,671
She wrote her phone number, Philippe.
What do you think? It means 'Call Me'.

738
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,928
'I want to lick your ear lobe'.

739
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:20,620
- Of course, Philippe.
- You're not calling her, are you?

740
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,406
She doesn't give a shit about poetry.
Six fucking months of poetry...

741
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:24,929
He's bonkers.
['Call Me. I want you.']

742
00:51:25,156 --> 00:51:28,317
- I won't talk to her.
- I'm gonna check if she has a weird accent.

743
00:51:28,568 --> 00:51:29,598
Northern accent sucks..

744
00:51:29,872 --> 00:51:31,149
Put down the phone!

745
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:34,480
- She wants a piece of Philippe.
- She's gonna have some.

746
00:51:34,705 --> 00:51:35,513
Hello.

747
00:51:35,755 --> 00:51:37,575
Nice voice, for a start.

748
00:51:38,399 --> 00:51:39,332
Hello...

749
00:51:39,505 --> 00:51:40,625
- No.

750
00:51:41,294 --> 00:51:42,142
- No.

751
00:51:42,384 --> 00:51:45,024
- Hello...
- Improvise, talk about daisies and shit...

752
00:51:45,221 --> 00:51:46,279
- Eleonore?

753
00:51:46,514 --> 00:51:47,634
- It's Philippe.

754
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:49,639
Well I...

755
00:51:49,842 --> 00:51:53,009
I'm calling you because I really
wanted to hear your voice.

756
00:51:53,234 --> 00:51:57,138
And so far, your 'Hello' already
fills me with joy.

757
00:51:57,354 --> 00:51:59,679
Hold on. I'm gonna get her.

758
00:52:00,591 --> 00:52:03,274
Stop with you complicated sentences.

759
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:06,345
- Hello.
- Eleonore. It's Philippe.

760
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:07,728
Philippe?

761
00:52:07,983 --> 00:52:10,963
Igen.Szerettem volna rni
egy levelet, aztn...

762
00:52:11,216 --> 00:52:14,729
I was writing you a letter.
And I thought, why not simply call her.

763
00:52:14,914 --> 00:52:17,066
Don't forget to ask about her weight.

764
00:52:17,324 --> 00:52:19,466
- Pardon me?
- Nothing.

765
00:52:19,956 --> 00:52:20,796
I'm grieving.

766
00:52:21,425 --> 00:52:22,510
I want to cry.

767
00:52:22,811 --> 00:52:24,768
I'm afraid.
Lord give me peace...

768
00:52:24,995 --> 00:52:26,479
Exactly, that's it!

769
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:27,949
I can't corner you.

770
00:52:28,176 --> 00:52:30,222
- How great that you love 'Rimbaud'.
- Sorry.

771
00:52:30,507 --> 00:52:31,907
- I was first in line.
- Eleonore.

772
00:52:32,175 --> 00:52:33,995
I'm glad.

773
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:36,150
Yes, I am.

774
00:52:36,424 --> 00:52:38,955
- What a big mouth... he can't be stopped.
- I'm sending you kisses.

775
00:52:40,376 --> 00:52:42,894
Everyone kisses, licking ears and all.

776
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:45,910
Good.  So what's up?

777
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,253
There's good news and less good news.

778
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,866
- What about the good part?
- 116 lbs.

779
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:53,307
- 116 lbs?  That's really good.

780
00:52:53,558 --> 00:52:56,488
Unless she's three feet tall.

781
00:52:57,005 --> 00:52:58,531
On the other hand...

782
00:52:58,748 --> 00:53:00,017
she wants a picture.

783
00:53:00,459 --> 00:53:02,668
- So?
- Come on.

784
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:04,993
Good evening.
Can I see your tickets?

785
00:53:05,203 --> 00:53:07,210
- Good evening.
- It's over here.

786
00:53:07,425 --> 00:53:08,921
- Perfect.
- Have a good night.

787
00:53:09,138 --> 00:53:11,439
- Good night to you.
- We'll be just here if you're looking for us...

788
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,340
We're not going to move.
Especially him.

789
00:53:15,754 --> 00:53:18,427
Wait...
What do you think women want?

790
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:19,611
I don't know.

791
00:53:19,841 --> 00:53:22,571
A cute, charming, elegant man...

792
00:53:22,809 --> 00:53:26,304
No kidding.
They want money. Security.

793
00:53:27,297 --> 00:53:29,408
Ask this dude.

794
00:53:30,265 --> 00:53:32,790
And you have all that.

795
00:53:33,206 --> 00:53:38,851
I might be naive, but I still hope
I have something more than my bank account..

796
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:43,104
She spent 6 months reading your goddamn
poems. And she likes it.

797
00:53:43,338 --> 00:53:45,050
She's weird, don't worry.

798
00:53:45,307 --> 00:53:47,440
I'm sure she doesn't give a damn
about the chair.

799
00:53:47,675 --> 00:53:48,635
That's true.

800
00:53:49,713 --> 00:53:52,248
Plus guys from the north drink so much
they're all beating their ladies.

801
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,527
She'll see there's no risk with you.

802
00:53:53,727 --> 00:53:55,127
Jerk.

803
00:53:56,844 --> 00:53:58,944
That's good thinking though, right?

804
00:54:00,109 --> 00:54:01,509
Yeah, whatever.

805
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,951
The photo is a good test.

806
00:54:03,162 --> 00:54:05,997
If she sends hers back it's a good sign.

807
00:54:06,211 --> 00:54:09,228
You can send a picture of you
with the chair, but not too obvious.

808
00:54:09,439 --> 00:54:11,794
You don't have to send a Telethon-like picture...

809
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,959
Drooling and all...

810
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:16,167
Looking like shit.

811
00:54:16,409 --> 00:54:18,229
Alright, alright.

812
00:54:30,847 --> 00:54:32,199
He has a problem.

813
00:54:32,393 --> 00:54:34,213
A big one.

814
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,114
Shush yourself.

815
00:54:39,307 --> 00:54:41,411
He's a tree...

816
00:54:41,643 --> 00:54:43,312
A singing tree.

817
00:54:49,522 --> 00:54:51,822
In german?

818
00:54:52,037 --> 00:54:53,437
Stop shushing me!

819
00:54:53,703 --> 00:54:55,681
It's in german anyway.

820
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,874
As if it wasn't enough.

821
00:54:58,116 --> 00:54:59,721
You're crazy.

822
00:54:59,932 --> 00:55:01,235
Oh man.

823
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:03,130
- How long does it last?
- Four hours.

824
00:55:03,318 --> 00:55:04,593
Fuck.

825
00:55:08,414 --> 00:55:10,857
You looked damn fine in the old times.

826
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,170
Which one?

827
00:55:15,337 --> 00:55:16,737
This one.

828
00:55:20,308 --> 00:55:22,553
There's also this one...
I like it a lot.

829
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:24,304
The chair is not obvious.

830
00:55:24,545 --> 00:55:28,168
But you can see something is going on,
and you look really good.

831
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:30,942
- Are we doing this?
- I don't know.

832
00:55:31,549 --> 00:55:33,141
Didn't you have a blast on the phone?

833
00:55:33,309 --> 00:55:34,125
I did.

834
00:55:34,344 --> 00:55:35,275
Is that all?

835
00:55:35,475 --> 00:55:37,776
- I had a fucking blast.
- So?

836
00:55:38,023 --> 00:55:40,382
So we're sending this goddamn picture.

837
00:55:40,597 --> 00:55:44,681
That's what I'm talking about.
Let's do it!

838
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:49,954
Give me a cigarette.

839
00:55:50,182 --> 00:55:52,076
Don't you ever knock?

840
00:55:52,264 --> 00:55:53,401
Are you painting?

841
00:55:53,658 --> 00:55:55,298
- Yes, get out!
- You're kidding me.

842
00:55:55,509 --> 00:55:57,872
Ha ha, painting. Did you learn how to
read as well?

843
00:55:58,082 --> 00:55:59,851
I told you to get out of here!

844
00:56:00,053 --> 00:56:03,122
Or what? You'll beat me? Is that
how women are treated in your country?

845
00:56:03,315 --> 00:56:05,823
You're out of your mind.
Fuck off!

846
00:56:06,007 --> 00:56:07,872
- I'll leave when I want.
- Right!

847
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:11,246
- See, I'm deciding to leave now.
- Leave!

848
00:56:11,472 --> 00:56:12,335
God damn it.

849
00:56:12,507 --> 00:56:15,908
Replace this picture with 
the other one.

850
00:56:16,861 --> 00:56:19,919
Please post it yourself,
and be discreet.

851
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:21,577
As you want.

852
00:56:22,623 --> 00:56:25,267
Now throw the other picture in the thrash.

853
00:56:25,543 --> 00:56:26,778
I'm loosing it.

854
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:28,642
She's driving me crazy.

855
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:34,299
- What's wrong?
- Your daughter is.

856
00:56:34,537 --> 00:56:37,195
- I was painting...
- You were... what?

857
00:56:37,796 --> 00:56:39,586
Yes, whatever. I wanted to tell you...

858
00:56:39,836 --> 00:56:42,034
She needs to cool it...
otherwise I will slap her.

859
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:44,732
- Alright, cool it a little.
- No, I'm not cooling anything!

860
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:46,975
Am I not your arms and your legs?

861
00:56:47,185 --> 00:56:47,676
Yes.

862
00:56:47,873 --> 00:56:51,514
Well I want to be your hands too.
So she can get what she deserves.

863
00:56:51,733 --> 00:56:53,959
Since you can't really do anything
besides driving your chair over her.

864
00:56:54,193 --> 00:56:57,275
Driss, don't you think you're exaggerating.
Yvonne.

865
00:56:57,923 --> 00:56:59,027
Yvonne...

866
00:57:00,409 --> 00:57:01,318
Well...

867
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,987
She might need a light admonition.

868
00:57:05,174 --> 00:57:05,959
A light one?

869
00:57:06,206 --> 00:57:08,352
She's 16, dressing and painting
her face outrageously.

870
00:57:08,585 --> 00:57:10,906
She's also making out with the
annoying dude all over the house.

871
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:14,056
But that's none of my business.
It's her education.

872
00:57:14,283 --> 00:57:16,650
What I have a problem with is
how she despises everyone.

873
00:57:16,853 --> 00:57:20,249
How she talks to me. To you!

874
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,614
What are we? Slaves?

875
00:57:22,841 --> 00:57:25,232
So if you let me, I'll give her
a lesson right now.

876
00:57:25,489 --> 00:57:29,374
Alright, I get it. Let me take care of it.

877
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,261
Then take care of it.
Fast.

878
00:57:33,806 --> 00:57:36,023
I'm gonna break something...

879
00:57:37,327 --> 00:57:39,454
He's painting?  What is he painting?

880
00:57:39,673 --> 00:57:41,173
I have no idea.

881
00:58:00,993 --> 00:58:03,093
Get up, Philippe.

882
00:58:39,565 --> 00:58:40,951
Fits you like a charm.

883
00:58:41,156 --> 00:58:43,407
Right.

884
00:58:52,994 --> 00:58:57,879
You need to respect the people working for me.
It's unacceptable. Do you understand?

885
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,001
I think she doesn't. Toughen up.

886
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:02,770
By the way I don't want to see this
dude here anymore.

887
00:59:02,982 --> 00:59:04,802
- God I get it! Leave me alone.
- I won't leave you alone.

888
00:59:05,015 --> 00:59:08,515
Do I need to drive my chair
over you to make you obey me?

889
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,034
That's it. We're getting there.

890
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:16,726
- You did that?
- Yeah.

891
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:19,000
I love it.

892
00:59:19,521 --> 00:59:22,477
I'm not saying I would hang it
at my place...

893
00:59:23,105 --> 00:59:24,505
but it's...

894
00:59:25,909 --> 00:59:28,579
How much do you think we'll get from it?

895
00:59:29,562 --> 00:59:30,962
We'll see.

896
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,455
We'll see more or less?

897
00:59:34,651 --> 00:59:35,771
It's...

898
00:59:36,979 --> 00:59:38,554
- What the hell?
- What?

899
00:59:38,774 --> 00:59:41,070
- I wasn't gonna use the tongue.
- You're retarded.

900
00:59:42,249 --> 00:59:45,853
Can't you go faster?
I can't run in these conditions.

901
00:59:46,263 --> 00:59:50,029
- I'm at the maximum.
- The maximum... it's way too slow.

902
00:59:50,903 --> 00:59:52,723
I can do 9 miles per hour.

903
00:59:54,539 --> 00:59:55,818
Is 9 miles/hour ok?

904
00:59:56,006 --> 00:59:58,106
Is it the best he can do?
Can't we get more?

905
00:59:58,068 --> 01:00:00,868
- It's the maximum.
- It'll do.

906
01:00:20,687 --> 01:00:21,807
Oh yeah...

907
01:00:30,564 --> 01:00:31,684
No, no.

908
01:00:31,993 --> 01:00:33,813
Stick to the ear.

909
01:00:34,252 --> 01:00:35,372
There.

910
01:00:52,089 --> 01:00:53,314
- Bye.
- Bye.

911
01:00:53,654 --> 01:00:54,924
Hi Yvonne.

912
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:57,799
No he can't hear me.

913
01:00:58,057 --> 01:00:59,768
Yvonne, trust me.

914
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,120
Ok.

915
01:01:01,518 --> 01:01:03,728
We'll be home at 8:30.

916
01:01:03,975 --> 01:01:06,892
Yes, we'll be on time Yvonne.

917
01:01:07,569 --> 01:01:08,921
- What's up? She's freaking out?
- Yeah.

918
01:01:09,135 --> 01:01:10,838
It's your surprise birthday again.

919
01:01:11,066 --> 01:01:12,740
It's half an hour earlier.

920
01:01:12,972 --> 01:01:14,964
She's all stressed out every year.

921
01:01:15,426 --> 01:01:19,959
She's inviting all my family, every 
year it's exactly the same deal.

922
01:01:20,366 --> 01:01:23,800
They're mostly coming to see if
I'm still alive.

923
01:01:24,074 --> 01:01:26,334
Just checking.

924
01:01:26,873 --> 01:01:29,981
And I pretend to be surprised.

925
01:01:30,277 --> 01:01:31,967
Everyone's doing their best.

926
01:01:32,225 --> 01:01:35,907
But in the end we're all really bored.

927
01:02:12,412 --> 01:02:13,532
Sorry.

928
01:02:14,111 --> 01:02:15,231
Excuse me.

929
01:02:15,592 --> 01:02:16,592
Sorry.

930
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:18,350
Sorry.

931
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,218
Excuse me.

932
01:02:20,468 --> 01:02:22,717
Would you mind changing seats?
I called this one.

933
01:02:22,928 --> 01:02:24,647
I would mind indeed.

934
01:02:25,022 --> 01:02:26,678
- Oh believe me you'll do it

935
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:30,326
Come on! Just shift to the left.

936
01:02:30,521 --> 01:02:31,847
There.

937
01:02:32,396 --> 01:02:33,762
Very nice of you.

938
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,994
The suit makes you look like another man.

939
01:02:47,213 --> 01:02:49,794
It looks good.

940
01:02:51,103 --> 01:02:53,694
You look like Barack Obama.

941
01:02:53,888 --> 01:02:55,008
Really?

942
01:02:57,909 --> 01:02:59,167
She has the hots for me.

943
01:02:59,649 --> 01:03:02,945
Barack Obama.
How cool is that.

944
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:08,915
It's a bit like someone called you...
Mitt Romney for instance.

945
01:03:09,149 --> 01:03:10,620
Raffarin.

946
01:03:11,382 --> 01:03:13,411
Or George Bush.

947
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:24,046
What are you doing?
You're gonna miss the concert.

948
01:03:24,325 --> 01:03:25,873
Leave me alone.

949
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:29,172
- Are you menstruating or what?
- Get out.

950
01:03:29,392 --> 01:03:30,559
- What's up?

951
01:03:31,713 --> 01:03:32,833
Elisa.

952
01:03:33,027 --> 01:03:34,207
Elisa.

953
01:03:34,516 --> 01:03:36,634
- Leave me alone, goddammit.
- What did you take?

954
01:03:37,851 --> 01:03:39,251
What did you do?

955
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,790
- Where did you find this?
- In Yvonne's purse.

956
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:46,161
Imodium?

957
01:03:46,371 --> 01:03:48,175
What was your plan?

958
01:03:48,396 --> 01:03:50,216
Suicide?

959
01:03:50,468 --> 01:03:54,676
- You're just gonna stop pooping for 3 months.
- Leave me alone!

960
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:56,846
Wait... you took Ibuprofen too?

961
01:03:57,113 --> 01:03:59,221
You're gonna die!
It's dangerous!

962
01:04:01,084 --> 01:04:03,488
What should we do?
Call 911?

963
01:04:03,776 --> 01:04:05,176
Why would you do that?

964
01:04:06,215 --> 01:04:07,538
It's Bastien.

965
01:04:07,758 --> 01:04:09,490
- What about him?
- He dumped me.

966
01:04:09,754 --> 01:04:13,138
He doesn't care about me.
He called me a slut.

967
01:04:13,536 --> 01:04:14,588
That's not ok at all.

968
01:04:14,869 --> 01:04:17,287
Nobody would care if I died anyway.


969
01:04:17,499 --> 01:04:19,364
Bullshit! Stop saying that.
Let's join the party.

970
01:04:19,529 --> 01:04:20,356
Can't you go see him?

971
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:22,400
Talk to him?

972
01:04:22,589 --> 01:04:25,368
- To who?
- Bastien. I'll pay you.

973
01:04:25,563 --> 01:04:27,592
What do you mean you'll pay me?
You've really lost it!

974
01:04:27,766 --> 01:04:29,897
Do you think I have time to deal
with childrens' heartaches?

975
01:04:30,087 --> 01:04:32,048
- Please.
- Talk to Bastien?

976
01:04:32,266 --> 01:04:33,386
Paying me?

977
01:04:34,452 --> 01:04:36,828
Who do you think you're talking to?

978
01:04:37,634 --> 01:04:39,632
Please, Driss.

979
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,541
How much?

980
01:04:43,285 --> 01:04:44,685
You're silly.

981
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:50,633
Well, there's something.
There's a particular touch to it.

982
01:04:50,967 --> 01:04:55,905
But I mean... 11 000 euros for an
unknown artist seems like a lot.

983
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:57,501
Hmm...

984
01:04:58,167 --> 01:05:02,461
On the other hand, if I don't buy it
it's going to be worth the triple in a year...

985
01:05:02,684 --> 01:05:04,503
And you'll tell me:
'I told you'.

986
01:05:04,714 --> 01:05:05,603
Am I right?

987
01:05:05,834 --> 01:05:06,783
Hmm.

988
01:05:07,306 --> 01:05:10,844
- You told me he has a gallery in London?
- Berlin.

989
01:05:11,075 --> 01:05:12,475
Berlin?

990
01:05:13,453 --> 01:05:14,853
Well that's...

991
01:05:15,436 --> 01:05:17,620
I don't know...

992
01:05:18,572 --> 01:05:21,819
11 000 euros is a lot.

993
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:26,165
Come on, give me something.
Does she have someone?

994
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,970
Yes. Fred.

995
01:05:28,251 --> 01:05:29,651
What about Fred?

996
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:31,712
They've been together for two years.

997
01:05:32,522 --> 01:05:36,282
But it's an on and off thing...
There's a lot of tension.

998
01:05:36,495 --> 01:05:39,676
Right now...
I know it's not going that well.

999
01:05:40,188 --> 01:05:41,828
- Maybe because of me.
- Yup.

1000
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:44,390
- Did she say something about me?
- No.

1001
01:05:44,834 --> 01:05:45,793
Alright, of course she did.

1002
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:47,301
A little bit.

1003
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:51,372
Yes! I knew it! She's got the hots for me.

1004
01:05:52,857 --> 01:05:53,960
What, you're spoofing me?

1005
01:05:54,186 --> 01:05:56,213
- No.
- Laugh as much as you want. 


1006
01:05:56,401 --> 01:05:58,233
One day Magalie will be in my bed.

1007
01:05:58,511 --> 01:06:00,649
Hope well and have well.

1008
01:06:01,243 --> 01:06:04,311
Careful with the appetizers,
given your stomach issues...

1009
01:06:04,536 --> 01:06:09,669
I'm not a doctor, but I know if
you take Imodium, something's wrong.

1010
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,176
Pardon me.  Please...

1011
01:06:20,505 --> 01:06:22,204
Can I ask you a favor?

1012
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:24,290
A little piece for me?

1013
01:06:25,124 --> 01:06:26,710
No, Philippe!  We were chilling.

1014
01:06:26,953 --> 01:06:28,073
Yes.

1015
01:06:29,084 --> 01:06:31,884
Vivaldi, the Fours Seasons

1016
01:06:32,487 --> 01:06:35,547
You'll see, you'll like it.

1017
01:06:50,241 --> 01:06:52,924
What about that? Don't tell me
you don't feel anything.

1018
01:06:53,155 --> 01:06:54,275
Nope. Nothing.

1019
01:06:55,241 --> 01:06:56,641
Not at all.

1020
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,460
For me, it's not music if you
can't dance to it.

1021
01:06:59,637 --> 01:07:03,037
Let's try something else.

1022
01:07:07,024 --> 01:07:08,844
Yeah. I know this one.

1023
01:07:09,255 --> 01:07:11,075
It's a commercial!

1024
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,060
For coffee, right?

1025
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:20,009
I shall leave thee now.

1026
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,596
I am expected by the king at the castle.

1027
01:07:22,883 --> 01:07:25,025
I'm taking the minstrels there.

1028
01:07:25,259 --> 01:07:26,379
Let's go.

1029
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:29,599
I'm a brave and good knight.

1030
01:07:30,052 --> 01:07:31,843
Wow, that's creepy...

1031
01:07:32,057 --> 01:07:34,911
It's about naked dudes...

1032
01:07:35,877 --> 01:07:39,372
They're running naked in the fields.

1033
01:07:39,615 --> 01:07:41,170
And giggling...

1034
01:07:42,199 --> 01:07:43,079
Alright, alright...

1035
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,993
Bach was badass.

1036
01:07:45,425 --> 01:07:47,061
I'm sure he got all the chicks with his music.

1037
01:07:47,306 --> 01:07:49,999
It's the 18th century's Barry White.

1038
01:07:50,696 --> 01:07:51,812
Oh I know this one.

1039
01:07:52,248 --> 01:07:54,393
Everyone know it.

1040
01:07:54,596 --> 01:07:55,875
Of course.

1041
01:07:56,187 --> 01:07:58,844
"You have reached the Paris unemployment agency"

1042
01:07:59,051 --> 01:08:01,260
"All our lines are currently busy"

1043
01:08:01,464 --> 01:08:04,264
"The estimated waiting time is : two years"

1044
01:08:11,235 --> 01:08:13,956
Isn't it Tom and Jerry?

1045
01:08:20,131 --> 01:08:21,733
Tom and Jerry...

1046
01:08:21,957 --> 01:08:23,385
What a jerk.

1047
01:08:23,589 --> 01:08:24,709
Help!

1048
01:08:24,924 --> 01:08:26,044
Help!

1049
01:08:27,824 --> 01:08:31,087
Now it's my turn. We listened to your classics,
let's listen to mine.

1050
01:08:31,306 --> 01:08:34,806
'Earth, Wind & Fire'.
I told you about them. So good!

1051
01:08:38,309 --> 01:08:39,323
It's something else.

1052
01:08:39,522 --> 01:08:40,947
That's something else for sure.

1053
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,550
Am I right?

1054
01:08:44,732 --> 01:08:45,852
Driss.

1055
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:48,413
- Driss.
- I can't hear you.

1056
01:09:21,267 --> 01:09:22,667
Come on, dance for Philippe's birthday.

1057
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:26,428
Come on. for Philippe.

1058
01:10:09,921 --> 01:10:11,041
There.

1059
01:10:16,582 --> 01:10:17,702
So...

1060
01:10:18,897 --> 01:10:21,108
With all that I didn't give you my present,

1061
01:10:21,347 --> 01:10:22,629
it arrived this morning.

1062
01:10:22,867 --> 01:10:25,480
I didn't want to ruin the party,
if she was ugly or something.

1063
01:10:25,715 --> 01:10:28,595
You never know.
But at least she responded.

1064
01:10:28,854 --> 01:10:31,060
Well...  Good night!

1065
01:10:32,099 --> 01:10:35,276
Alright, I'll open it...

1066
01:10:37,588 --> 01:10:38,708
So?

1067
01:10:40,496 --> 01:10:43,086
She does not look like a dog.
Not at all.

1068
01:10:43,371 --> 01:10:45,171
Oh damn...

1069
01:10:45,428 --> 01:10:48,005
It must be the only northern girl
with all her teeth.

1070
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:49,300
There's a note with it.

1071
01:10:49,535 --> 01:10:55,203
'I'm coming to Paris next week. I'm waiting for your call.'
'Dot dot dot.'

1072
01:10:56,013 --> 01:10:57,468
You know what 'Dot dot dot' means, right?

1073
01:10:57,695 --> 01:10:59,443
What does it mean?

1074
01:10:59,687 --> 01:11:02,273
- That's good?
- Of course it's good, she wants you.

1075
01:11:02,461 --> 01:11:04,731
One dot, two dots, three dots,
she wants you, end of the story.

1076
01:11:04,938 --> 01:11:08,923
- She wants me...

1077
01:11:09,456 --> 01:11:10,443
Feels good, doesn't it?

1078
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:13,470
- I'm too excited to sleep.
- But you will.

1079
01:11:14,252 --> 01:11:15,712
I'm putting the picture here.

1080
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:18,280
She's watching you sleep.

1081
01:11:18,788 --> 01:11:19,627
There.

1082
01:11:20,023 --> 01:11:21,771
Good night, Philippe.

1083
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:24,546
Sweet dreams.

1084
01:11:35,086 --> 01:11:37,948
Let's try the hat again.

1085
01:11:39,438 --> 01:11:41,359
- Not bad.
- No.

1086
01:11:41,578 --> 01:11:43,627
No. He looks like a chimney sweeper.

1087
01:11:43,845 --> 01:11:45,040
He can't be dressed too classic.

1088
01:11:45,236 --> 01:11:47,376
- What did I just say?
- Ok, so it's too classic.

1089
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:51,454
- Forget the hat.

1090
01:11:52,304 --> 01:11:54,357
Regular or fancy?

1091
01:11:54,647 --> 01:11:56,047
There's something.

1092
01:11:56,347 --> 01:11:57,579
It works.

1093
01:11:57,802 --> 01:11:59,587
- What about this?
- Stop laughing.

1094
01:12:00,154 --> 01:12:02,332
- Let's go horse-riding...
- Come on.

1095
01:12:02,602 --> 01:12:05,338
Yvonne will take me there.
I'll go alone.

1096
01:12:05,597 --> 01:12:08,142
- Really?
- It's ok.

1097
01:12:08,576 --> 01:12:10,667
Yes. I'll manage.

1098
01:12:10,938 --> 01:12:12,758
Alright.

1099
01:12:16,367 --> 01:12:17,995
I think I'm freaking out a little.

1100
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:21,234
Don't worry, noone can tell.

1101
01:12:23,168 --> 01:12:25,072
4 a x c minus b square
1102
01:12:25,358 --> 01:12:26,387
- b square?

1103
01:12:26,637 --> 01:12:28,565
I found 20, not b squ...

1104
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:29,594
Hey.

1105
01:12:30,178 --> 01:12:32,452
Go take a walk, funny hair.

1106
01:12:32,676 --> 01:12:34,793
- So Bastien... You remember me?
- Yeah.

1107
01:12:35,054 --> 01:12:35,987
- Oh yeah?
- What's wrong?

1108
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,203
I heard what you told Elisa.
It's not very nice.

1109
01:12:38,412 --> 01:12:39,636
- I didn't say anything...
- Shut up.

1110
01:12:39,854 --> 01:12:42,090
Now you'll act like a man and apologize.

1111
01:12:42,285 --> 01:12:44,413
- I'm sorry, man.
- Hands off me.

1112
01:12:44,636 --> 01:12:46,697
- Not to me, to her!
- Ok, to her.

1113
01:12:46,933 --> 01:12:49,145
And you'll bring her croissants every morning.

1114
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:50,666
- Plain or with butter?
- What?

1115
01:12:50,841 --> 01:12:53,332
- Plain or with butter?
- Whatever. I don't care.

1116
01:12:53,598 --> 01:12:54,938
Do as you want, but do it right.

1117
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:56,876
- You be nice.
- Yes. I'll be very nice.

1118
01:12:57,094 --> 01:12:58,914
Now move. Move!

1119
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:02,694
And take care of your hair.
Put a hair clip or something.

1120
01:13:04,871 --> 01:13:06,271
What time is it?

1121
01:13:07,896 --> 01:13:09,016
4:45

1122
01:13:16,536 --> 01:13:18,926
Should I loose the hat?

1123
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:21,618
Yeah. That's better.

1124
01:13:29,065 --> 01:13:30,885
What time is it?

1125
01:13:31,086 --> 01:13:34,597
46 - 47.
It's not changing that fast.

1126
01:13:35,393 --> 01:13:37,213
I'd like a whisky.

1127
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,600
Yeah.

1128
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:43,233
Please.

1129
01:14:15,496 --> 01:14:16,473
One more.

1130
01:14:16,961 --> 01:14:18,554
I don't if it's a good idea...

1131
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:20,220
Make it a double.

1132
01:14:22,495 --> 01:14:25,478
Sir, a double whisky please.

1133
01:14:54,179 --> 01:14:55,774
- Hello.
- Hello, Driss.

1134
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:57,718
What are you doing now?
Are you busy?

1135
01:14:57,930 --> 01:14:59,750
I'm working out.
How's it going?

1136
01:14:59,942 --> 01:15:02,255
Don't you want to get away?

1137
01:15:02,696 --> 01:15:04,286
No questions?

1138
01:15:04,544 --> 01:15:05,664
No. No questions.

1139
01:15:05,954 --> 01:15:08,364
- You want to leave?
- Yes.

1140
01:15:09,445 --> 01:15:10,565
Where are we going?

1141
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:13,201
Get some fresh air.

1142
01:15:13,591 --> 01:15:15,411
Get some fresh air.

1143
01:15:16,644 --> 01:15:18,844
I'll be there after a shower.

1144
01:15:21,029 --> 01:15:22,579
We're going. Take the hat.

1145
01:15:22,814 --> 01:15:25,733
- But ti's barely 6.
- We're going.

1146
01:16:01,118 --> 01:16:03,218
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1147
01:16:09,221 --> 01:16:12,705
Give him so champagne too.
It'll help him relax.

1148
01:16:12,921 --> 01:16:15,766
- I'm not stressed out.
- Really?    - No.

1149
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:33,780
It's only us?

1150
01:16:34,922 --> 01:16:38,190
The other people didn't come?
It's just us.

1151
01:16:56,845 --> 01:16:58,877
Ok, I'm a little nervous.

1152
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:00,201
Why?

1153
01:17:00,884 --> 01:17:02,284
I don't know.

1154
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:05,969
We both know you're not the luckiest person.

1155
01:17:06,165 --> 01:17:07,403
The accident...

1156
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:09,618
The chair...
Your wife.

1157
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:12,720
It's Kennedy-like scary.

1158
01:17:13,978 --> 01:17:15,550
- Miss.
- Yes?

1159
01:17:15,807 --> 01:17:18,300
Can you give him the package?

1160
01:17:18,548 --> 01:17:19,948
Thank you.

1161
01:17:24,075 --> 01:17:25,475
Thank you.

1162
01:17:26,244 --> 01:17:27,644
Why?

1163
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:36,750
What's that?

1164
01:17:36,976 --> 01:17:41,066
That's what you're worth in the art business.
I got 11 000 euros for your painting.

1165
01:17:41,381 --> 01:17:44,170
You shouldn't stop, you have
a hell of a talent.    - Yup.

1166
01:17:44,388 --> 01:17:46,618
That's a good deal.
I knew it.

1167
01:17:46,814 --> 01:17:49,267
I felt it.
It was instinct.

1168
01:17:49,495 --> 01:17:53,280
With the music and all...
It all blended...

1169
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:57,182
And then, an epiphany!
I saw a light.

1170
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:58,612
Ok, stay humble will you?

1171
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:01,207
11 000 euros, though, can you believe it?

1172
01:18:02,082 --> 01:18:03,771
What was that?

1173
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:07,302
Nothing. Just a hole in the cabin.

1174
01:18:07,569 --> 01:18:09,985
Philippe, tell me if something's wrong.

1175
01:18:10,321 --> 01:18:11,602
It was very nice knowing you.

1176
01:18:11,782 --> 01:18:13,854
No Philippe, I don't like these jokes.
Really

1177
01:18:14,125 --> 01:18:18,037
You're used to drama, but I'm not.

1178
01:18:48,045 --> 01:18:50,216
You have to be really insane to do that.

1179
01:18:50,435 --> 01:18:51,555
A little bit.

1180
01:18:57,212 --> 01:18:59,211
I'll tell you something, Philippe.

1181
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:03,671
- You're a maniac.
- Really?  I didn't know that.

1182
01:19:05,187 --> 01:19:08,164
- Now you get Driss ready.
- Sure.

1183
01:19:08,499 --> 01:19:10,795
Right. In your dreams.
I'm not doing any of this.

1184
01:19:11,586 --> 01:19:12,580
I'll be waiting for you over there.

1185
01:19:12,779 --> 01:19:14,670
I'll take pictures...
'Get Driss ready...'

1186
01:19:15,447 --> 01:19:17,628
How are you gonna take pictures?

1187
01:19:18,023 --> 01:19:21,199
Laugh all you want. I'm not doing this.

1188
01:19:33,505 --> 01:19:35,553
- I don't want to anymore.
- Wait.

1189
01:19:35,889 --> 01:19:37,414
- Take it off.
- Wait, wait.

1190
01:19:37,602 --> 01:19:39,702
I don't have to anyway, right?

1191
01:19:47,792 --> 01:19:49,342
Wait, what's going on?

1192
01:19:49,538 --> 01:19:50,485
Is something wrong?

1193
01:19:50,712 --> 01:19:52,112
Oh man.

1194
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:54,872
Fuck.

1195
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,206
Why is it going higher?

1196
01:20:08,222 --> 01:20:09,554
What's going on?

1197
01:20:09,801 --> 01:20:10,656
Oh my god.

1198
01:20:10,854 --> 01:20:11,974
Hey, Driss!

1199
01:20:13,363 --> 01:20:15,463
Relax, for god's sake.

1200
01:20:15,822 --> 01:20:17,842
I'm relaxed, can't we get down now?

1201
01:20:18,108 --> 01:20:19,928
I've seen it ,it's cool. I'm done.

1202
01:20:23,606 --> 01:20:25,006
What the hell!

1203
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:30,235
What is happening now?

1204
01:20:35,966 --> 01:20:37,086
Come on, Driss.

1205
01:21:02,664 --> 01:21:03,784
Listen to this.

1206
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:05,820
Where can you find a tetraplegic?

1207
01:21:06,133 --> 01:21:08,333
Where can you... I don't know.

1208
01:21:08,569 --> 01:21:11,226
Where you left him.

1209
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:13,868
Awful.

1210
01:21:14,089 --> 01:21:16,222
You're awful.

1211
01:21:17,964 --> 01:21:20,966
Driss, someone's here for you.

1212
01:21:22,609 --> 01:21:24,009
What are you doing here?

1213
01:21:24,509 --> 01:21:25,976
Why did you hide this?

1214
01:21:26,213 --> 01:21:28,458
- You answer the question.
- How did you find me?

1215
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:31,530
The unemployment agency sent this.
It mentions the address.

1216
01:21:32,457 --> 01:21:34,289
- And what's that?
- Nothing. Let it go.

1217
01:21:34,516 --> 01:21:36,516
- What did you do?
- I fell from my scooter.

1218
01:21:36,727 --> 01:21:38,106
- From your scooter?
- Yeah.

1219
01:21:38,317 --> 01:21:40,668
Bullshit. Get up.

1220
01:21:41,072 --> 01:21:43,266
This way.

1221
01:21:46,556 --> 01:21:47,956
Damn.

1222
01:21:51,529 --> 01:21:52,832
That's your room?

1223
01:21:53,145 --> 01:21:55,676
- Tell me what happened.
- Nothing.

1224
01:21:56,015 --> 01:21:58,696
- Tell me.
- It's none of your business.

1225
01:21:58,895 --> 01:22:01,459
How is it not my business?
You're hiding here but it's none of my business?

1226
01:22:01,671 --> 01:22:03,946
We were only four and they screwed us.
But don't worry, they're gonna pay.

1227
01:22:04,122 --> 01:22:06,135
You're not gonna make anyone 'pay'.
Does mom know?

1228
01:22:06,314 --> 01:22:07,026
No.

1229
01:22:07,257 --> 01:22:09,115
- Don't worry, I have it covered.
- You have nothing covered.

1230
01:22:09,296 --> 01:22:10,846
- You're a pain in the ass.
- Right.

1231
01:22:11,011 --> 01:22:13,192
Now you stay here and you don't
touch anything.

1232
01:22:13,396 --> 01:22:16,173
- Can I lie down?
- You don't touch anything!

1233
01:22:16,382 --> 01:22:17,917
Alright, I got it.

1234
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:20,219
Moron...

1235
01:22:23,714 --> 01:22:25,487
I'm telling you, he's with me.

1236
01:22:25,696 --> 01:22:27,096
Stop crying Nina.

1237
01:22:27,548 --> 01:22:29,869
He's not wounded, it's just a scratch.

1238
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:30,967
He's fine.

1239
01:22:31,186 --> 01:22:34,965
Calm down, Nina.
Nobody's killing anybody.

1240
01:22:35,266 --> 01:22:36,386
It's only words.

1241
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:39,444
Meanwhile I can't take care of him.
I'm working.

1242
01:22:39,766 --> 01:22:42,064
No, don't tell her.

1243
01:22:42,285 --> 01:22:45,733
You go crying in your room if you want,
but you don't tell her anything.

1244
01:22:53,516 --> 01:22:54,922
I think it's time for bed.

1245
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:57,638
I'm gonna stay up for a bit.

1246
01:22:58,201 --> 01:22:59,601
Sit down.

1247
01:23:01,287 --> 01:23:03,107
Sit down here.

1248
01:23:10,907 --> 01:23:13,762
What do you think of that woman?

1249
01:23:14,385 --> 01:23:17,357
- She looks hot.
- What else?

1250
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:20,655
Can we go upstairs now...
I have something to deal with...

1251
01:23:20,901 --> 01:23:22,721
I imagine her getting up...

1252
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,546
and turning around...

1253
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:28,001
so that I can finally see her face.

1254
01:23:30,434 --> 01:23:32,046
The boy looks like you.

1255
01:23:32,265 --> 01:23:34,748
- Adama?
- Yes.

1256
01:23:35,022 --> 01:23:36,638
I saw him earlier.

1257
01:23:36,865 --> 01:23:38,659
I think if I had crossed him in the street,

1258
01:23:38,977 --> 01:23:41,573
I could have told he was your brother.

1259
01:23:41,794 --> 01:23:42,914
That's weird.

1260
01:23:44,086 --> 01:23:44,972
Why?

1261
01:23:45,371 --> 01:23:47,861
Because he's not my brother.

1262
01:23:48,213 --> 01:23:49,333
Really?

1263
01:23:49,898 --> 01:23:51,753
It's complicated.

1264
01:23:52,857 --> 01:23:56,001
Is he your brother or not?

1265
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:01,880
Ok. I get it.

1266
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:04,829
Let's go.

1267
01:24:11,794 --> 01:24:13,857
My parents...

1268
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:16,961
they're not really my parents.

1269
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:19,374
They're my uncle and my aunt.

1270
01:24:19,696 --> 01:24:23,047
They came to get me in Senegal
when I was 8.

1271
01:24:23,397 --> 01:24:26,799
They couldn't have children, so they 
went to see a brother who had a load of them.

1272
01:24:27,041 --> 01:24:29,141
They took the elder.

1273
01:24:29,641 --> 01:24:31,041
Me.

1274
01:24:33,344 --> 01:24:34,997
I was called Bakary.

1275
01:24:35,224 --> 01:24:38,089
That's my real name.

1276
01:24:38,371 --> 01:24:40,538
But there were several Bakarys in the 
neighbourhood so they called me Idriss....

1277
01:24:40,892 --> 01:24:43,403
somehow it turned into Driss.

1278
01:24:44,099 --> 01:24:44,938
Then what?

1279
01:24:45,416 --> 01:24:48,689
Then out of nowhere my mother...
I mean my aunt...

1280
01:24:49,015 --> 01:24:51,700
she got pregnant twice.

1281
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:53,368
Then my uncle died.

1282
01:24:53,636 --> 01:24:55,380
And then there were other guys,
other children.

1283
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:58,193
I told you it's complicated.

1284
01:24:59,014 --> 01:25:03,999
About Adama. Don't you think he
needs a light admonition?

1285
01:25:10,824 --> 01:25:14,054
He came to get you, didn't he?

1286
01:25:16,592 --> 01:25:17,712
Driss.

1287
01:25:20,947 --> 01:25:22,767
I think it's the end of the road.

1288
01:25:23,265 --> 01:25:27,241
You weren't going to push a disabled's 
chair your whole life anyway.

1289
01:25:27,552 --> 01:25:33,261
And since you worked well, you'll
get unemployment again.

1290
01:25:36,127 --> 01:25:37,342
Enough.

1291
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,720
Let's go.

1292
01:25:39,191 --> 01:25:40,311
Come on.

1293
01:25:40,638 --> 01:25:41,758
Yeah.

1294
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:47,911
Vassary Bakary. Bakary Vassary.

1295
01:25:48,187 --> 01:25:49,003
It's beautiful.

1296
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:50,846
Very poetic.

1297
01:25:51,245 --> 01:25:53,100
It has an alliteration.

1298
01:25:53,303 --> 01:25:56,452
- Do you know what an alliteration is?
- No.

1299
01:25:58,869 --> 01:26:01,424
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Bastien. Thank you.

1300
01:26:01,658 --> 01:26:04,996
Oh we're having a brunch tomorrow.
Could you bring something more...

1301
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:06,079
Of course.

1302
01:26:06,298 --> 01:26:08,372
- Goodbye Yvonne.
- You didn't forget my little treats, did you?

1303
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,375
No.

1304
01:26:09,646 --> 01:26:11,632
- Good, thanks.
- Say hello to Elisa.

1305
01:26:11,863 --> 01:26:12,843
See you tomorrow.

1306
01:26:13,241 --> 01:26:16,041
Bastien, my friend.
What's up?

1307
01:26:22,508 --> 01:26:23,582
So it's true.

1308
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:25,292
- You're leaving.
- Yeah.

1309
01:26:25,506 --> 01:26:29,006
Don't worry, I have your number.
I'll call you very soon.

1310
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:32,879
- I know it's gonna be tough for you. Be strong.
- It's a shame.

1311
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:36,450
You know I'm getting your room?
There's a water issue in mine.

1312
01:26:36,684 --> 01:26:38,493
I might stay, in the end.

1313
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:41,169
We'd have to get warm in the bed together.

1314
01:26:41,581 --> 01:26:45,004
It would be a little too small.
I'm not alone.

1315
01:26:45,262 --> 01:26:46,382
Here she is.

1316
01:26:47,492 --> 01:26:50,385
- This is Frederique.
- Hello.

1317
01:26:51,933 --> 01:26:53,053
Hi.

1318
01:26:57,211 --> 01:26:58,285
I get it...

1319
01:26:58,622 --> 01:27:01,079
- What?
- I understand, it's your...

1320
01:27:01,547 --> 01:27:03,550
So that's why...

1321
01:27:03,743 --> 01:27:05,316
Yes.

1322
01:27:06,558 --> 01:27:07,507
Well.

1323
01:27:07,977 --> 01:27:11,437
I'm not giving you a kiss, then.

1324
01:27:15,438 --> 01:27:18,238
I would be up for a threesome you know.

1325
01:27:20,098 --> 01:27:22,135
Well... I'm down.

1326
01:27:22,301 --> 01:27:26,125
Not now though, I have to leave.
But I can come back.

1327
01:27:26,728 --> 01:27:30,087
- I have stuff to do, but I'll be back.
- I'm joking.

1328
01:27:33,642 --> 01:27:34,620
Alright...

1329
01:27:34,888 --> 01:27:37,109
See you, dudes.

1330
01:27:39,402 --> 01:27:41,776
Mr Michel Saloudy.

1331
01:27:46,468 --> 01:27:49,391
Keep it on all the time!

1332
01:27:49,624 --> 01:27:51,189
Are you mad about Magalie?

1333
01:27:51,409 --> 01:27:53,229
No. Nice one.

1334
01:27:53,605 --> 01:27:54,729
Nice one, but...

1335
01:27:56,605 --> 01:28:00,729
it did seem weird that she would resist.
It never happened to me.

1336
01:28:02,651 --> 01:28:04,549
Kiss?

1337
01:28:05,622 --> 01:28:07,229
Yes. Sure.

1338
01:28:09,787 --> 01:28:11,624
Yvonne.

1339
01:28:12,901 --> 01:28:14,958
You're good...

1340
01:28:15,334 --> 01:28:16,745
See you.

1341
01:28:16,981 --> 01:28:18,803
Yvonne.

1342
01:28:20,341 --> 01:28:21,741
Wait.

1343
01:28:27,211 --> 01:28:30,669
We won't need that anymore.

1344
01:28:31,645 --> 01:28:33,465
Bye.

1345
01:28:36,726 --> 01:28:38,320
Watch your foot.

1346
01:28:38,538 --> 01:28:39,938
Let's go.

1347
01:28:54,627 --> 01:28:55,747
Wait.

1348
01:28:57,490 --> 01:28:58,799
What is your bank?

1349
01:28:59,753 --> 01:29:00,428
Ok.

1350
01:29:00,697 --> 01:29:01,747
Excuse me.

1351
01:29:01,958 --> 01:29:05,364
Could you please move your car?
You can't park here.

1352
01:29:05,653 --> 01:29:06,653
It's written over there.

1353
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:08,235
- I'm moving.
- Thanks.

1354
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:10,290
I'll call you back.

1355
01:29:12,843 --> 01:29:15,678
Why do you mind?
We're not even driving.

1356
01:29:15,882 --> 01:29:17,982
It's a matter of principles.

1357
01:29:19,471 --> 01:29:20,591
Go on.

1358
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:23,563
Wait for me over there.

1359
01:29:34,508 --> 01:29:35,908
What are you doing?

1360
01:29:36,833 --> 01:29:38,233
I'm coming.

1361
01:31:12,069 --> 01:31:14,280
I can cancel my date you know.

1362
01:31:14,476 --> 01:31:16,105
Of course not.
Why would you do that?

1363
01:31:16,363 --> 01:31:18,895
Have a good tim.
Everything's fine.

1364
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:21,877
Yvonne?  I'm ready.

1365
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:23,843
Good. I'll be here in a minute.

1366
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:25,667
Well, everything's ready.

1367
01:31:26,051 --> 01:31:27,503
You just have to serve.

1368
01:31:27,746 --> 01:31:31,698
Call me if anything's wrong.

1369
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:37,324
- Call me, ok?
- Yeah.

1370
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:42,211
So if you're ready, I'm gonna serve your meal.

1371
01:31:42,532 --> 01:31:46,756
Take these scrubs off.
I feel like in an asylum.

1372
01:31:46,998 --> 01:31:49,635
- Alright.
- Do you have a cigarette?

1373
01:31:50,032 --> 01:31:52,747
No. I don't smoke.
Not anymore.

1374
01:31:53,465 --> 01:31:56,703
To be honest I gave up recently...

1375
01:31:56,909 --> 01:31:58,294
and you should do the same.

1376
01:31:58,591 --> 01:32:01,669
Even if you're not exercising or something...

1377
01:32:01,902 --> 01:32:05,381
it's better for your lungs, your breath.

1378
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,425
You're not going to eat.

1379
01:33:08,785 --> 01:33:10,243
What the hell!

1380
01:33:10,817 --> 01:33:12,204
Come on. Be careful.

1381
01:33:12,445 --> 01:33:14,165
I'm sorry.

1382
01:33:14,396 --> 01:33:15,846
- Good morning, sir.
- What?

1383
01:33:16,096 --> 01:33:18,806
It's the person you asked for ...

1384
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,361
For the head massage.
It's Mr Jacquet.

1385
01:33:21,611 --> 01:33:22,723
Good morning.

1386
01:33:23,063 --> 01:33:24,078
Get out!

1387
01:33:24,337 --> 01:33:25,770
Leave me alone.

1388
01:33:26,001 --> 01:33:26,932
Leave!

1389
01:33:27,152 --> 01:33:29,409
- Is it my fault?
- No, non.

1390
01:33:29,919 --> 01:33:32,174
He got up on the wrong side of the bed.

1391
01:33:34,335 --> 01:33:36,471
'got up on...'.
Idiot.

1392
01:33:37,053 --> 01:33:38,173
Moron.

1393
01:33:39,569 --> 01:33:40,673
Driss Vassary?

1394
01:33:40,856 --> 01:33:42,956
- Yes
- It's your turn.

1395
01:33:56,736 --> 01:33:59,187
You've only had your driving license for a month.

1396
01:33:59,382 --> 01:34:01,464
Yes, but I've been driving for longer.

1397
01:34:01,738 --> 01:34:04,794
I mean I drove in private ways,
out of the roads.

1398
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:06,920
Parking lots ...

1399
01:34:07,369 --> 01:34:09,197
I'm a good driver.

1400
01:34:11,041 --> 01:34:12,861
I read your file.

1401
01:34:13,425 --> 01:34:17,580
In your personal evaluation you only
wrote one word : pragmatic.

1402
01:34:18,659 --> 01:34:19,779
Yes.

1403
01:34:20,343 --> 01:34:21,463
It is important.

1404
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:25,211
You forgot to mention another important
aspect in our company.

1405
01:34:25,487 --> 01:34:26,416
Did I?

1406
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:30,041
You could just take the time 
to read the poster line.

1407
01:34:30,276 --> 01:34:32,255
- Hey, that's a twelve feet rhyme.

1408
01:34:32,454 --> 01:34:33,400
Sorry?

1409
01:34:33,606 --> 01:34:37,974
You-could-just-take-the-time
To-read-the-pos-ter-line

1410
01:34:38,323 --> 01:34:39,749
12 feet.

1411
01:34:40,138 --> 01:34:43,279
- That wasn't on purpose.
- Your catchphrase is 'Just in time'.

1412
01:34:43,576 --> 01:34:46,153
Oh that's why you put Dali's watches..

1413
01:34:46,417 --> 01:34:48,335
A little artistic touch.

1414
01:34:48,608 --> 01:34:50,396
Maybe...

1415
01:34:51,662 --> 01:34:54,353
- You like paintings?
- I do.

1416
01:34:54,734 --> 01:34:56,703
- I like Goya.
- She's alright...

1417
01:34:56,888 --> 01:35:01,267
...didn't sing much since Pandi-Panda.
[Chantal Goya is a french children's singer]

1418
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:09,030
Yes.

1419
01:35:10,711 --> 01:35:11,831
I'm coming.

1420
01:35:12,983 --> 01:35:14,803
I'm on my way.

1421
01:35:18,318 --> 01:35:20,138
- Are you ok?
- Yes.

1422
01:35:20,445 --> 01:35:22,265
Leave me alone.

1423
01:35:22,601 --> 01:35:25,729
Do you need water?
A wet towel?

1424
01:35:27,104 --> 01:35:28,504
Get out.

1425
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:32,016
- I mean I can...
- Leave me alone.

1426
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:39,646
There.

1427
01:35:39,881 --> 01:35:41,493
- Thanks, dude.
- You're welcome.

1428
01:35:41,704 --> 01:35:44,312
- Have a nice week-end.
- You too.

1429
01:35:44,593 --> 01:35:47,617
- What's going on?
- He's not doing well.

1430
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:50,097
- Where is he now?
- He was in the garden earlier.

1431
01:35:50,519 --> 01:35:51,639
Ok.

1432
01:36:04,461 --> 01:36:05,581
So...

1433
01:36:05,735 --> 01:36:07,575
What's going on?

1434
01:36:07,818 --> 01:36:10,110
What's the deal with the beard?

1435
01:36:11,251 --> 01:36:12,427
Freud?

1436
01:36:12,653 --> 01:36:15,131
Abraham Lincoln?
An old dude, anyway.

1437
01:36:15,443 --> 01:36:16,743
Victor Hugo.

1438
01:36:17,816 --> 01:36:19,774
You need a good shaving.
Take care of yourself.

1439
01:36:20,032 --> 01:36:21,348
It was time I came back.

1440
01:36:21,606 --> 01:36:23,347
I'll be here in a minute.

1441
01:37:14,627 --> 01:37:16,290
Now what?

1442
01:37:17,019 --> 01:37:19,595
Now you let me decide.

1443
01:38:59,242 --> 01:39:02,027
Don't you like that?

1444
01:39:22,227 --> 01:39:24,667
A sharp fast cut would relieve me.

1445
01:39:25,928 --> 01:39:28,552
It's good to see you're doing better.

1446
01:39:31,886 --> 01:39:34,722
I did my best.
Open your eyes.

1447
01:39:34,917 --> 01:39:36,293
Oh my god.

1448
01:39:36,511 --> 01:39:37,738
It's terrible.

1449
01:39:38,003 --> 01:39:39,446
- It's really bad.
- No! It looks good.

1450
01:39:39,634 --> 01:39:40,857
No.

1451
01:39:41,032 --> 01:39:41,751
Look...

1452
01:39:41,966 --> 01:39:44,506
leather jacket, without sleeves.

1453
01:39:44,785 --> 01:39:46,549
A Village People-like cap.

1454
01:39:46,734 --> 01:39:48,995
I know!
Jose Bove.

1455
01:39:49,686 --> 01:39:51,506
You look exactly like him.

1456
01:39:51,848 --> 01:39:54,342
Really weird. An orthodox priest or something.

1457
01:39:54,548 --> 01:39:56,977
- The pope.
- Exactly, the pope.

1458
01:39:57,870 --> 01:39:59,270
Come on.

1459
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:02,240
He's crazy.

1460
01:40:02,523 --> 01:40:04,409
What are you up to?

1461
01:40:05,619 --> 01:40:09,186
- I'm scared.
- No you'll see, it's awesome.

1462
01:40:11,579 --> 01:40:12,938
I look like my grandfather.

1463
01:40:13,283 --> 01:40:14,193
Really?

1464
01:40:14,494 --> 01:40:18,733
Oh Philippe, the moustache is turning me on. 
What is happening to me?

1465
01:40:19,446 --> 01:40:21,234
- Ok, I'll shave the rest.
- Thank you.

1466
01:40:21,556 --> 01:40:22,956
Alright.

1467
01:40:23,728 --> 01:40:26,001
No. Please. No.

1468
01:40:26,449 --> 01:40:27,529
No.

1469
01:40:27,819 --> 01:40:28,504
No

1470
01:40:28,855 --> 01:40:29,975
Nein!

1471
01:40:30,208 --> 01:40:33,586
- Nein is what you mean.
- I'm not ok with that.

1472
01:40:33,946 --> 01:40:36,298
Philippe, ach.

1473
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:39,286
So I'm your toy now.

1474
01:40:39,835 --> 01:40:42,042
You know you're mental right?
You have to get help.

1475
01:40:42,292 --> 01:40:44,108
Don't you feel like invading countries right now?

1476
01:40:44,345 --> 01:40:46,402
Ok, we're getting there...

1477
01:40:46,764 --> 01:40:48,702
just shave the rest.

1478
01:40:48,984 --> 01:40:50,278
You think it's funny?

1479
01:40:50,522 --> 01:40:52,642
Yes, I'm thinking about tetraplegic nazis.

1480
01:40:52,916 --> 01:40:57,316
How could they do the sign?

1481
01:40:58,306 --> 01:41:01,129
Ok, now you had fun. Shave it.

1482
01:41:03,373 --> 01:41:05,429
Heil.

1483
01:41:12,182 --> 01:41:13,467
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1484
01:41:13,694 --> 01:41:15,461
Vassary. I have a reservation at 1.

1485
01:41:15,663 --> 01:41:18,543
- Yes. Vassary.
- Follow me.

1486
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:25,682
- Over here.
- Thank you.

1487
01:41:26,105 --> 01:41:27,925
Thank you, sir.

1488
01:41:45,885 --> 01:41:47,326
So, Philippe.

1489
01:41:47,591 --> 01:41:49,817
I'm not staying for lunch.

1490
01:41:50,834 --> 01:41:53,148
- Why?
- I'm not leaving you alone.

1491
01:41:53,876 --> 01:41:57,048
You just happen to have a date.

1492
01:41:57,490 --> 01:41:58,689
A date?

1493
01:41:58,939 --> 01:42:00,472
What do you mean?

1494
01:42:01,237 --> 01:42:02,710
Don't freak out. It'll be fine.

1495
01:42:02,988 --> 01:42:03,819
What the...

1496
01:42:04,116 --> 01:42:07,300
Only this time you can't flee.

1497
01:42:08,323 --> 01:42:09,723
By the way...

1498
01:42:11,034 --> 01:42:14,288
I took my time, but I found it.

1499
01:42:14,509 --> 01:42:16,609
Give her my respects.

1500
01:42:17,738 --> 01:42:18,858
Driss.

1501
01:42:20,361 --> 01:42:21,481
Driss.

1502
01:42:24,224 --> 01:42:26,768
What's going on?

1503
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:48,269
Hello, Philippe.

1504
01:43:25,593 --> 01:43:31,752
Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo now lives in Marocco.
He's married again, and had two daughters.

1505
01:43:35,505 --> 01:43:40,855
Abdel Sellou now owns a company.
He's married and has three children.

1506
01:43:58,538 --> 01:44:03,070
Philippe and Abdel remained close friends.

1507
01:44:50,269 --> 01:47:45,351
