1 
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,200 
And let Columbus lost his way and 
not the first discovered America. 

2 
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:23,001 
Anyway .. he is my hero. 

3 
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:27,402 
He courageously held his tiny 
ship through the vast ocean. 

4 
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:30,003 
And now, the day of Columbus, 
we do not go to school. 

5 
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:35,504 
Thank you, Heather. Ronnie? 

6 
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:37,505 
Tell us about your hero. 

7 
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:52,006 
What is he writing? 

8 
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:55,807 
Hatiko dog was my grandfather. 

9 
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,708 
Many called Hati dog puzzle. 

10 
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:04,109 
Because no one knew 
where it came from. 

11 
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,010 
Perhaps it escaped from a dog shelter. 

12 
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:12,311 
Maybe - jumped from the car 
somewhere far away. 

13 
00:01:12,312 --> 00:01:14,912 
In Florida or New Jersey. 

14 
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:21,713 
No matter how, but Hati lost. 

15 
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,514 
No matter how it happened. 

16 
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:52,600 
But once, long ago, in the city, 
lived grandfather 

17 
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:55,501 
Hati appeared on the station. 

18 
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,802 
They began their history. 

19 
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:35,003 
Six days? A lot. 

20 
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:37,504 
I'll miss. Yes. 

21 
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:39,705 
Excellent, a lot of music. 

22 
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:42,206 
No, no, I'll walk on foot. 

23 
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:45,107 
Yes, I love you, too. While. 

24 
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:51,408 
Hey, buddy, lost? 

25 
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:53,409 
Come here. 

26 
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,010 
Come ... 

27 
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,711 
Lost, kid. 

28 
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:03,312 
Certainly, you are looking for. 

29 
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:09,913 
He then ran from you. 

30 
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:12,014 
- What platform? 
- Yes, on the platform. 

31 
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:14,215 
Good thing you found it. 

32 
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:16,816 
Yes. Well ... 

33 
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:20,917 
You know, there was a box, broken. 
I do not know whose it was, but ... 

34 
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:24,000 
Some of them certainly will. 

35 
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:27,401 
- Yes, clearly. - Let it foe you. 
While it does not take away. 

36 
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:28,803 
But ... No, I can not. 

37 
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:30,904 
- What? - I can not, Professor. 

38 
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:34,005 
He ran here. 
Such dogs do not throw it ... 

39 
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:37,606 
Yes, of course not. This is not quitting, 
someone will follow. 

40 
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:41,207 
Take it to him. And those who show up -- 
I say that dog you have. 

41 
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,608 
But something will come to you. 

42 
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:48,200 
You do not understand. He will 
hold here, maybe all night, 
If no one comes. 

43 
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:51,901 
No one will be, I'll lock it, it will 
safe until morning, but ... 

44 
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:55,402 
Tomorrow I have to hand it to the shelter. 

45 
00:05:08,203 --> 00:05:10,303 
Well, that Friday today. 

46 
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:15,904 
Know where you went ... Meanwhile 
stay with me. 

47 
00:05:16,105 --> 00:05:19,705 
In a warm house, plenty of company. 
Getting It Right. 

48 
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:22,806 
What? Yes, you like it. 

49 
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:23,607 
Sh-sh-sh ... 

50 
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,108 
So. 

51 
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:31,509 
Here, sit here. 

52 
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,210 
Only here, okay? Yes, that's it. 

53 
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:40,111 
Ok. Lie, lie ... 
Rui, it can be. 

54 
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,312 
Hello, handsome. 

55 
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:49,313 
- Hello. - Hello. 

56 
00:06:49,314 --> 00:06:51,314 
- How was it? - Excellent. 

57 
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:54,115 
- I am glad I missed? 
- Not a bit, and you? 

58 
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:56,616 
No, not remembered. 

59 
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:01,417 
And for you a surprise. 

60 
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:05,300 
Yes, I also have a small 
surprise for you. 

61 
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:07,801 
Come on, it's time to catch up. 

62 
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:12,202 
Catch up - it's great. 

63 
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,003 
Heard anything? 

64 
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:31,804 
Probably, the branch is knocking at the window. 

65 
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:20,605 
- Quiet, quiet, quiet, all right. 
- Parker! 

66 
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:22,106 
- We agreed! - I know, I know ... 

67 
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:24,507 
- Have you forgotten that? 
- Well, nothing I have not forgotten. 

68 
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:28,008 
No, I just found him at the station, 
he lost. 

69 
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,009 
Karl wanted to send him to doggy 
shelter and I thought ... 

70 
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,010 
Bring the puppy home and to persuade me 
leave it, right? 

71 
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:36,311 
No, no, I do not want him to leave, no. 

72 
00:08:36,312 --> 00:08:39,012 
Tomorrow morning I'll find out where exactly 
he was taken, right? 

73 
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:41,013 
I promise you I will do that. 

74 
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:44,614 
Here, these were the things Lucas. 

75 
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:46,615 
Now, now. 

76 
00:08:46,616 --> 00:08:48,716 
So, we climb. 

77 
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,217 
Look how many interesting things here. 

78 
00:08:57,318 --> 00:08:59,818 
Warm on. 

79 
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,419 
Here is cool. 

80 
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,620 
Like it? Luke loved her very much. 

81 
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:11,221 
Look, there's water. 

82 
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:16,322 
You could tell a lot, yes? 
Could? 

83 
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:19,723 
Okay, buddy. 

84 
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,424 
Not bad. 

85 
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,525 
Zasypay. 

86 
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,926 
You need a very doghouse. 

87 
00:09:43,227 --> 00:09:45,927 
I love the finger does not bite, I promise. 

88 
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,328 
Hey, puppy, puppy! 

89 
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,129 
Hey, baby, smile. 

90 
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,230 
Excellent! UUU, beautiful doggie! 

91 
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:06,431 
Dad, I like him. 

92 
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,432 
He has a name? 

93 
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:11,333 
Yes. Temporary Guest. 

94 
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,200 
Leave him alone, the house was empty since 
as Lucas is not. 

95 
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:25,301 
Ask your mother. 

96 
00:10:25,302 --> 00:10:26,702 
Mom! 

97 
00:10:26,703 --> 00:10:27,603 
Yes? 

98 
00:10:27,604 --> 00:10:29,204 
Come here, please. 

99 
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:33,205 
He is on your music taste. 

100 
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:38,206 
Really? Incredibly, it Bunder-dog! 
And I must leave him. 

101 
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,307 
Do not pass. And you - do not get it. 

102 
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,308 
I will not. 

103 
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,509 
You besides. 

104 
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,510 
Dad, he will jump out of here, here. 

105 
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:48,111 
Yes, it's better. 

106 
00:10:51,712 --> 00:10:53,312 
You got, boy? 

107 
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:58,213 
So, well, well, class. 

108 
00:10:58,814 --> 00:11:00,814 
With Michael met? 

109 
00:11:00,815 --> 00:11:06,615 
Yes, we went to the observation seen 
starfall. It was beautiful. 

110 
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:08,616 
How romantic. 

111 
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:10,217 
Very. 

112 
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,018 
And you do not ... 

113 
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:18,019 
Something to help? 

114 
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,620 
Yes, I found yesterday this kid on 
station, not hold, until the owner ... 

115 
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:26,621 
Hold? No, this is not an inn, 
a dog shelter, buddy. 

116 
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:31,222 
I just found it, what should I do? 

117 
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,923 
Give a look. 

118 
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:39,824 
Cute, new owners find 
can, but ... 

119 
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,825 
We give them two weeks. 

120 
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:46,226 
Two weeks? 

121 
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:48,627 
Yes, there is no place. 

122 
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:52,028 
Sorry. 

123 
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,129 
I'll call you in a week, 
well, not yet. 

124 
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,830 
- Hi, Maryann. 
- How are you, Parker? 

125 
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:04,331 
Wonderful. To be honest, I would 
you something to ask. 

126 
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:05,732 
Anything. 

127 
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:14,333 
Oh, well, I must! 

128 
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,434 
Hey, baby, hello, Priva-o! 

129 
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:21,535 
He's handsome! Where are you from? 

130 
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:25,500 
Yes he was there yesterday, I wandered to the station ... 
I do not know, it's all very strange. 

131 
00:12:25,501 --> 00:12:28,201 
Really? He is so cute! 

132 
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:30,202 
I want to hang it from you. 

133 
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:32,203 
Yes, well, well. 

134 
00:12:33,804 --> 00:12:36,804 
Parker, this puppy is just fabulous! 

135 
00:12:36,805 --> 00:12:38,605 
You would not want that? 

136 
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:40,406 
What, me take? 

137 
00:12:40,407 --> 00:12:42,007 
Such a beautiful puppy. 

138 
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:44,708 
What do you think, Anthony? 
How do you like the new neighbor? 

139 
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:47,109 
Impossible, Anthony! 

140 
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,010 
Sit quietly. 

141 
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:03,911 
Good morning, Professor. 

142 
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:04,912 
Jess. 

143 
00:13:04,913 --> 00:13:07,913 
You a sugar, 2 servings of cream ... 
Oh, who are you? 

144 
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:10,314 
A new friend, do not take? 

145 
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:12,015 
I prefer cash. 

146 
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:14,416 
Grow a great guard dog. 

147 
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:18,617 
This is to guard the hot dogs? 
I do not think so. 

148 
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:20,318 
Ha-ha, and I do not think so. 

149 
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:23,819 
No, who will now take the dog, eh? 

150 
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,820 
Its because I have to feed, to walk, wash, 
pick her ... 

151 
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:29,221 
I'll take it for him? 

152 
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:31,322 
On the house. 

153 
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:32,623 
Take a little more. 

154 
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:34,624 
Yeah, right, thank you, Jess. 

155 
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,625 
Health. 

156 
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,226 
There is news? 

157 
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:40,500 
No, there was nobody who would come 
or call. 

158 
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:41,901 
Nobody? 

159 
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,002 
Strange, really strange. 

160 
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:47,903 
Do not hold? 

161 
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:53,004 
Kate has published ads 
hang help? 

162 
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:54,905 
Oh please. 

163 
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:57,006 
Well, I'll help hang. 

164 
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:58,407 
You have a sensitive soul. 

165 
00:13:58,408 --> 00:13:59,408 
I know. 

166 
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,009 
And in a backpack he likes. 

167 
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,110 
Professor in the train any dog. 

168 
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:08,611 
- No dogs. 
- I hope. 

169 
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:11,612 
For a moment, I have something to show. 

170 
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:15,313 
Skip to repeat the first part and immediately 
go to the lyric. 

171 
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,314 
Okay. 

172 
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,315 
Better so. 

173 
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,616 
But it does mean that you have to play 
faster in pace. 

174 
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:21,617 
And come to the lyrical part, then ... 

175 
00:15:22,317 --> 00:15:24,317 
They need a deep sigh. 

176 
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:56,518 
Hi. 

177 
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:07,319 
Excellent. 

178 
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,220 
Puppy will not take? 

179 
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:19,121 
- Well, let's go again. 
- Yes, at first. 

180 
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:23,222 
This is all that is left on the box. 

181 
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:26,323 
"Yamanashi", the rest is torn off. 

182 
00:16:26,324 --> 00:16:29,224 
- What is it? 
- The area in central Japan. 

183 
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,725 
- Unusual dog, Parker. 
- Exactly. 

184 
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,226 
This Akita, Akita, as they say you have. 

185 
00:16:37,227 --> 00:16:39,827 
- A special breed. 
- Yes? 

186 
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:45,128 
- And what's this? 
- Hati. 

187 
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,229 
- What? 
- In Japanese, it is 8, a lucky number. 

188 
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,930 
And, happy? Lucky. 

189 
00:16:52,431 --> 00:16:56,131 
Hati ... Hati, good name, agree? 

190 
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:58,132 
Evidently, he's eighth in a litter was born. 

191 
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:02,433 
In the mystical meaning of number 8 - stretching 
to the heavens, falls to the ground. 

192 
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:07,434 
Well, as you take? 

193 
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:11,165 
Himself? No. I think he made a choice. 

194 
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,166 
In what sense? 

195 
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:16,267 
The fact that now he's your problem, 
not my brother. 

196 
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:18,868 
You are not a problem, right? 

197 
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:24,969 
Well, maybe you found it 
can - it you. 

198 
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,570 
Who knows? Hence, it should be. 

199 
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,571 
And he said that the shoguns grew 
Akita for fighting and hunting. 

200 
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:37,872 
In a sense, this royal breed. 

201 
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,873 
Ken did not tell you where to find 
His Majesty's house? 

202 
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,574 
I hung for 10 ads. 
Someone will take his Hati. 

203 
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,600 
Hati? 

204 
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:57,201 
This ... It was on the collar, a symbol. 

205 
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,802 
You gave him a name? 

206 
00:17:58,803 --> 00:18:00,003 
- No, I ... 
- You want him to leave. 

207 
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:01,704 
- No, I ... 
- Do you want you want. 

208 
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,905 
I do not want him to leave, I just ... 

209 
00:18:03,906 --> 00:18:05,606 
Confess yourself - do you want 
take it to us. 

210 
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:07,607 
I did not even think not. 

211 
00:18:08,608 --> 00:18:09,908 
Hati? 

212 
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:13,409 
Where you go? 

213 
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,710 
Lord 

214 
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:21,911 
Oh no ... Parker, a few months 
hard work! 

215 
00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:22,712 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 

216 
00:18:22,713 --> 00:18:26,013 
He will be on the streets all night, Parker said. 
These do not let you hear me? 

217 
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:27,514 
No objections! 

218 
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:30,515 
I hear, I hear you. 
I heard all good. 

219 
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,616 
- It's two months of work! 
- Believe me, I'm sorry. 

220 
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:43,017 
The work is important not only for me, 
it is important for the city! 

221 
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:44,018 
For mnya too. 

222 
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:46,219 
I am over this model 4 months worked. 

223 
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,620 
No, you do not care what I do. 
Yes, you just spit on it! 

224 
00:18:50,621 --> 00:18:52,521 
Kate, this is not true. 

225 
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:54,322 
Not calmed me! 

226 
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:05,423 
Hati. 

227 
00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:10,224 
Come on, buddy, come to me. Me. 

228 
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,725 
Yes, you'll go to the house. 

229 
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:15,426 
And it will take with them. 

230 
00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:31,227 
Akita. 

231 
00:19:31,928 --> 00:19:34,428 
So, where are you? 

232 
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,029 
Yes. Here's what you have. 

233 
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,130 
Your breed at least 4000 years 
maybe more. 

234 
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:49,200 
Yes? What else here? 

235 
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:56,701 
How did you do? 

236 
00:19:56,702 --> 00:20:04,602 
They write that the first animal, 
became friendly with people, you were. 

237 
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:07,803 
You knew about this? I knew it, tell me. 

238 
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:10,104 
You know, yes, you know, of course he knew. 

239 
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:13,605 
Well everything off. 

240 
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:17,906 
It is necessary to find a place for you. 

241 
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:24,207 
Thus, there seems to be bad, eh? 

242 
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:28,108 
Okay, go. Stay here, okay? 

243 
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:40,709 
Sit quietly. Now ... 

244 
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,310 
<i> essence combination is 
not to give beats to knock 
ball infel. </ i> 

245 
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:50,311 
<i> Let's see if this works 
tactics this time. </ i> 

246 
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,412 
All right, sit with you. 

247 
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:58,813 
<i> bad. The gap decreased 
to one point. </ i> 

248 
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,314 
Catch! 

249 
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:08,915 
Come on. 

250 
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:43,616 
Forgive me, please. 

251 
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:45,617 
Just do not need ... 

252 
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:48,118 
- I just climbed up. 
- Yes, yes, of course. 

253 
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,519 
For one night, only one, okay? 

254 
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,220 
Let's sleep? 

255 
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:02,221 
Stay here, everything will be fine. 

256 
00:22:05,722 --> 00:22:09,722 
Unbelievable. He is a fan of "Yankees." 

257 
00:22:09,723 --> 00:22:11,123 
No. 

258 
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:13,324 
- Yes, honestly. 
- Really? 

259 
00:22:13,325 --> 00:22:15,625 
Oh, it will be fun. 

260 
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,626 
Thus, Hati, will play. 

261 
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,827 
This is a ball. Ball. 

262 
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:22,828 
Throw, you bring it to me 
back, okay? 

263 
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:24,629 
Yes, ready? 

264 
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,430 
Come on, catch. 

265 
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:30,531 
No, no, no, the ball. 

266 
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:33,632 
Hati, Hati! Hati, no. Hey, Hati! 

267 
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:38,433 
I'll throw, and you bring it, okay? Come on. 

268 
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:41,134 
Brought. 

269 
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:46,035 
Hati, no, take the ball! 

270 
00:22:47,436 --> 00:22:49,536 
Hati, to me! To me, Hati! 

271 
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:53,937 
Come on, take, take. Hati, Hati! 

272 
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:57,238 
Come on, this ball, you take. 

273 
00:22:57,239 --> 00:23:01,239 
Come on, Hati. Me. You also can, 
I'm sure. 

274 
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,740 
You know, you're too harsh with them. 

275 
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:06,641 
Dog in trouble, and the father wants 
do a good deed. 

276 
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,842 
<i> Okay, let's see. </ i> 

277 
00:23:09,843 --> 00:23:10,743 
Mam. 

278 
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,144 
Ball, ball, ball, ball! You have to take. 

279 
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,845 
See how. 

280 
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:22,246 
He sdurel. 

281 
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,247 
Hello? 

282 
00:23:28,048 --> 00:23:31,148 
You are on your ad, yes? Are you a dog owner? 

283 
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:38,349 
No, no one has yet declared. We 
want to see it was in good hands. 

284 
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,350 
But what if you leave your number 
My husband will call you back. 

285 
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:46,451 
One second, I'll find a pen, right? 

286 
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,452 
Hello. 

287 
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,253 
No, the puppy is already taken. 

288 
00:24:20,754 --> 00:24:23,004 
Yes, I'm terribly sorry. 

289

Ow! No, no, no, Hati! 

290

Hati! Hati, Hati! 

291

Well, come on, bring it here. Bring. 

292 
00:24:57,608 --> 00:25:01,308 
No, you can not. Not. 
I'm going to work. 

293 
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:03,509 
See you in the evening, yet. 

294 
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,310 
Good morning, Professor. 
You are now delayed. 

295 
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:44,511 
I've already done - one sugar 
Two cream.

Thanks.

Good girl!

Okay.

- Nothing, thank you. 
- Are you sure? 
- Yes, yes, thank you. 

317

Okay, let's go, send. 

318

Maybe call a taxi? 

319

No, I'll walk, all right.

Oh, God. 

321 
00:27:22,738 --> 00:27:25,738 
Parker? You've gone to work. 

322 
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:28,239 
- Gone. 
- And so in the garden, dig? 

323 
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240 
He ran away and I came back. 

324 
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,741 
Do not say, do not, I know 
you say. 

325 
00:27:33,742 --> 00:27:36,842 
Stained, I myself finishing touches. 
I will bury, and you go. 

326 
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:39,000 
Okay, thank you. 

327 
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:44,101 
And you - wait here. 

328 
00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:46,202 
- We'll wait. 
- Until the evening before. 

329 
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:32,803 
Help yourself. 

330 
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:34,604 
Help yourself. 

331 
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:42,305 
Well, okay, I will give another. 
One, not more. 

332 
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:43,306 
Wait, wait. 

333 
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:51,507 
Well? Tasty, yes? 

334 
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:55,508 
Well, well, now ... is the last. 

335 
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:59,009 
Here, chew. Clever, Hati. 

336 
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,811 
Persuaded, the most recent. 

337 
00:29:10,112 --> 00:29:12,412 
Keep all. 

338 
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,713 
Well, I'm proud of you, fine. 

339 
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:35,114 
- Finally. 
- And the ending to be repeated. 

340 
00:29:35,115 --> 00:29:37,115 
- And forgive me for being late, okay? 
- No problem. 

341 
00:29:37,116 --> 00:29:39,216 
- No penalty will be? 
- No, we will not. 

342 
00:29:39,217 --> 00:29:40,217 
Well, thank you. 

343 
00:30:14,718 --> 00:30:18,418 
Hey, Hati! What are you doing here? 

344 
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,219 
You with sugar? 

345 
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,920 
- Chuck. 
- Good luck. 

346 
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:05,021 
Hey, Hati! 

347 
00:31:07,522 --> 00:31:09,000 
How did you get here was? 

348 
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:11,001 
Station Beydridzh. 

349 
00:31:13,302 --> 00:31:16,302 
Yes, yes, Mom, there is a train at 7:30. 

350 
00:31:19,103 --> 00:31:23,103 
- He was there all day? 
- No, 2 minutes he came and got there. 

351 
00:31:23,104 --> 00:31:25,404 
Are you kidding? With it Kate? 

352 
00:31:25,805 --> 00:31:27,105 
I have not seen it. 

353 
00:31:27,106 --> 00:31:29,306 
A. .. Okay. 

354 
00:31:29,307 --> 00:31:32,407 
Ok. Then go home. 

355 
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:36,308 
That same wretch. 

356 
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:41,809 
Come on, come home, baby. 

357 
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,210 
Mom! 

358 
00:31:45,211 --> 00:31:47,211 
Yes, dear? I'm here. 

359 
00:31:48,212 --> 00:31:50,312 
Hey, hello! 

360 
00:31:50,313 --> 00:31:51,913 
- I brought the chips. 
- Excellent. 

361 
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:53,414 
Mrs. Wilson, glad to meet. 

362 
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:55,415 
Oh, Michael, I too! Call me Kate. 

363 
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:56,416 
Ok. 

364 
00:31:57,817 --> 00:31:59,000 
Looks appetizing. 

365 
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:01,201 
Take this to the Pope. 

366 
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:02,702 
- Now? 
- Yes, he was in the backyard. 

367 
00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:04,203 
Well, there you have a grill? 

368 
00:32:04,204 --> 00:32:06,304 
Grill there, yes. Glad to see you. 

369 
00:32:06,305 --> 00:32:07,305 
I am glad. 

370 
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:09,306 
- Cut? 
- Yes, less often, my dear. And where is ... 

371 
00:32:11,207 --> 00:32:14,707 
You know, I wanted to play the guitar 
learned this in childhood. 

372 
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:15,708 
Seriously? 

373 
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:18,409 
Yes, I was nine or ten years. 

374 
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,710 
But brother pinched my fingers 
car door and I threw it away. 

375 
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000 
Came out by accident, but after that 
I stopped studying. 

376 
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:30,400 
I do not know, probably nothing. Because I 
love music 

377 
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:34,701 
... and am with great respect to 
musicians and everyone who plays. 

378 
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,000 
Michael, do you love my daughter? 

379 
00:32:39,201 --> 00:32:41,401 
Yes, sir ... Yes, very. 

380 
00:32:41,402 --> 00:32:46,402 
Ok. This is something that will help you 
in the hard days. 

381 
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,000 
Right. 

382 
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:55,301 
Hati is Michael. Michael, Hati. 

383 
00:32:55,302 --> 00:32:57,002 
Glad to meet you. 

384 
00:33:01,203 --> 00:33:04,003 
Hati, hey, want to play, eh? 

385 
00:33:04,004 --> 00:33:06,704 
Yes? Okay, ready? Catch the ball! 

386 
00:33:06,705 --> 00:33:10,505 
Come on out, bring it over there! 

387 
00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:15,006 
Next, Hati! Run after him! 
Come on, bring the ball! 

388 
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:19,607 
Michael, you want to return the ball - go down 
him myself, Hati not bring. 

389 
00:33:19,608 --> 00:33:21,708 
He is the sword does not run. 

390 
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:25,109 
Sunny. 

391 
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,110 
How are you, Michael? 

392 
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:29,111 
All is well. 

393 
00:33:29,112 --> 00:33:30,112 
Darling, are you all right? 

394 
00:33:30,113 --> 00:33:31,113 
Play. 

395 
00:33:31,114 --> 00:33:32,114 
Not hurt, exactly? 

396 
00:33:32,115 --> 00:33:33,115 
Not at all. 

397 
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:36,216 
I'm all right, look. 

398 
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:38,817 
- The leg is not sprained? 
- To play without me. 

399 
00:33:38,818 --> 00:33:39,818 
Ok. 

400 
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:46,419 
I throw the ball half a meter, 
you bring, eh? 

401 
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,620 
Even if I throw a ball alongside, 
it still will not bring? 

402 
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,621 
I died. 

403 
00:34:10,622 --> 00:34:11,622 
Ball?

404 
00:34:11,623 --> 00:34:14,323 
Yes, the ball. I throw that he brought 
but he does not want. 

405 
00:34:14,324 --> 00:34:16,324 
Not Akita, Parker. 

406 
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:18,525 
They have something against the balls? 

407 
00:34:18,526 --> 00:34:23,000 
No, but that the ball ran - head 
collie or sprinter-spanielya. 

408 
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:24,801 
No, Hati quite suits me, 
I am satisfied. 

409 
00:34:24,802 --> 00:34:28,602 
Well, because the Akita did not seek 
someone like. 

410 
00:34:28,603 --> 00:34:30,003 
And what do they want? 

411 
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:33,404 
He comes to the train, because 
special connection between you. 

412 
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:37,205 
And then, "Hey, buddy, bring the ball!" -- 
why? 

413 
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:41,406 
Well, for fun. And maybe for cookies. 

414 
00:34:41,407 --> 00:34:43,407 
To me, please, finally. 

415 
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:47,308 
They do not buy - they are Japanese, 
not the Americans. 

416 
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:48,809 
Yes, all this nonsense. 

417 
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:53,610 
If he brings the ball - on this he 
be a special reason. 

418 
00:34:55,411 --> 00:34:57,411 
I told him find her. 

419 
00:34:59,212 --> 00:35:01,312 
No, no, no, no, Hati, home. 

420 
00:35:01,313 --> 00:35:03,513 
You stay, I'm sorry, not me. 

421 
00:35:07,014 --> 00:35:08,314 
No, wait. 

422 
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:20,115 
Okay, let's go. 

423 
00:35:20,116 --> 00:35:21,116 
It is possible, let's go. 

424 
00:35:41,217 --> 00:35:43,017 
- Good morning, Milton. 
- Good morning. 

425 
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,018 
I am glad to see. 

426 
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,319 
- Moira. 
- Hey, Parker. 

427 
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,220 
Hiding from the sun? 

428 
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:53,521 
Caution, next. 

429 
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,400 
- Good morning, Professor. 
- Good morning, Parker! 

430 
00:36:01,401 --> 00:36:03,401 
But he did not grasp? 

431 
00:36:03,402 --> 00:36:05,402 
No, no, he was brought up. 

432 
00:36:05,403 --> 00:36:06,403 
To me, kid. 

433 
00:36:06,904 --> 00:36:11,500 
And now you go home, yes, home. 
Do you understand me? 

434 
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:14,701 
See you in the evening, and now go home. 

435 
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:18,402 
Clever. 

436 
00:36:24,603 --> 00:36:27,203 
- Have a nice day, Karl. 
- Both sides, professor. 

437 
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:37,104 
Hati. 

438 
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:42,805 
Take it. Only sh-sh-sh ... 
Do not say Milton, okay? 

439 
00:37:15,606 --> 00:37:17,206 
Welcome to Hati. 

440 
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,507 
You're waiting for me all day and think 
"Oh, how good I am, how good I am! 

441 
00:37:37,608 --> 00:37:38,808 
Hey, Hati! 

442 
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:48,709 
More champagne! 
Let bring champagne. 

443 
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,000 
I could, well ... I do not know. 

444 
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:52,001 
Should be in the kitchen. 

445 
00:37:52,002 --> 00:37:54,702 
As if other than us at the wedding 
no one. 

446 
00:37:56,203 --> 00:37:58,003 
Boy, girl, boy, girl. 

447 
00:38:04,304 --> 00:38:06,104 
You love the snow, huh? 

448 
00:38:13,005 --> 00:38:15,405 
Let's take a walk, you and me. 

449 
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:18,006 
Only two of us, we go. 

450 
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:19,907 
Tell me about something. 

451 
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,508 
Hati! 

452 
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:54,009 
That's great, Jake. 

453 
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,010 
Thanks. 

454 
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:57,911 
Kate! Not seen Hati? 
He was not at the station. 

455 
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,712 
No, I did not see in the morning ... 
Come here. 

456 
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,713 
Look at her. 

457 
00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:13,514 
30 years she was hidden from the eyes. 

458 
00:39:15,015 --> 00:39:16,615 
Beauty, eh? 

459 
00:39:17,116 --> 00:39:18,716 
Yes, good. 

460 
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,400 
- I schedule lag. 
- You catch up. 

461 
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:27,001 
Imagine opening night, it's you bent take flight. 

462 
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:32,402 
The young singer goes on stage 
sings an aria from La Bohme. 

463 
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:40,503 
More ballet, of course. Then, rock, 
rap, hip-hop, jazz and ... Hamlet! 

464 
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:46,905 
Then, of course, all the citizens 
leapt from their seats, applauding 
and rave of happiness. 

465 
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:52,806 
Mayor finds you, takes the stage 
puts at the center and thanked 
for what you have done the impossible. 

466 
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,807 
Yes? 

467 
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,808 
Yes. 

468 
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,609 
I like it. 

469 
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,310 
Hati! 

470 
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,011 
To me, baby! 

471 
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:10,612 
Hati? 

472 
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,213 
Ha-atm. 

473 
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:21,814 
What are you doing here? 

474 
00:40:29,225 --> 00:40:30,715 
So ... right. 

475 
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,116 
Sit down, sit, Hati, quietly. 

476 
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:40,617 
Sh-sh-sh, do not bother me. 

477 
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:47,218 
Hey, go, go, get out! 

478 
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,919 
Well, okay. 

479 
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,620 
Let's go, go, go, go! 

480 
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,821 
Parker! 

481 
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,122 
We were attacked skunk. 

482 
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,223 
Not want to join? 

483 
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:53,824 
No, I will refrain. 

484 
00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:57,225 
Well, okay. 

485 
00:42:02,126 --> 00:42:04,226 
Better open the window at night. 

486 
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:07,427 
From us true stinks? 

487 
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:11,928 
Perhaps you're right. 

488 
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:18,729 
Mom! 

489 
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,930 
Oh, hello, dear! 

490 
00:42:21,931 --> 00:42:24,331 
What happened? 

491 
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,532 
I must have something to say. 

492 
00:42:30,233 --> 00:42:31,233 
Guess. 

493 
00:42:31,234 --> 00:42:32,234 
What? 

494 
00:42:32,235 --> 00:42:34,135 
Okay, wait. 

495 
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,636 
Do you see changes? 

496 
00:42:39,637 --> 00:42:41,337 
No. 

497 
00:42:41,338 --> 00:42:42,338 
Yes! 

498 
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,339 
It's wonderful, darling! 

499 
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,440 
Oh, what wonderful news! 

500 
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,941 
I called my grandmother, immediately! 

501 
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,842 
Where is Dad? 

502 
00:42:53,843 --> 00:42:55,443 
Where normally. 

503 
00:42:56,944 --> 00:42:58,000 
Dad! 

504 
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:02,201 
Father! 

505 
00:43:05,702 --> 00:43:07,002 
What are you doing? 

506 
00:43:07,003 --> 00:43:11,203 
This full body massage, 
everything by the book, see? 

507 
00:43:11,204 --> 00:43:12,904 
You will soon become a grandfather. 

508 
00:43:12,905 --> 00:43:14,105 
It is necessary to dive deeper into the muscle ... 

509 
00:43:14,106 --> 00:43:16,106 
Father, father! 

510 
00:43:17,207 --> 00:43:21,207 
I will soon be a child. 
I am pregnant. 

511 
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:23,508 
You ... 

512 
00:43:26,609 --> 00:43:28,509 
What, seriously? 

513 
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:29,510 
Yes. 

514 
00:43:29,911 --> 00:43:31,211 
You'll have a baby? 

515 
00:43:37,312 --> 00:43:38,912 
I'll be a grandfather. 

516 
00:43:39,513 --> 00:43:42,613 
Kathy, I can not believe it! 

517 
00:43:47,714 --> 00:43:49,214 
Hello, dear. 

518 
00:43:49,215 --> 00:43:50,914 
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. 

519 
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:53,415 
Oh, what is it? 

520 
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:55,216 
A lot of useful products for you. 

521 
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:59,317 
Fresh vegetables, raspberries, pita with mare's milk, 
germinated cereals ... 

522 
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:05,018 
When I was pregnant with you, I'm chasing 
your father for a pizza with anchovies 
and red pepper, and ate, ate, ate ... 

523 
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:06,919 
He's not able to watch. 

524 
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,320 
You yourself believe something that lived 
with his father 25 years? 

525 
00:44:11,321 --> 00:44:13,521 
We are together longer than separately. 

526 
00:44:13,522 --> 00:44:14,522 
Wow. 

527 
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,500 
Dad told me that after the first 
Good-bye, returning to the car, 

528 
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:25,701 
managed so bored that he returned 
to see you back. 

529 
00:44:26,402 --> 00:44:28,802 
I remember watching him from the window. 

530 
00:44:29,403 --> 00:44:34,303 
She saw that he turned back and barely 
not rushed out the door to hug him. 

531 
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,204 
- Vain restrained. 
- I know. 

532 
00:44:36,205 --> 00:44:38,205 
But I always think too much. 

533 
00:44:38,206 --> 00:44:40,506 
Yes, exactly. As no one. 

534 
00:44:40,507 --> 00:44:41,807 
- So do not do. 
- I will not. 

535 
00:44:41,808 --> 00:44:42,808 
Ok. 

536 
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,009 
Hey, Hati! To me, Hati, to me! 

537 
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:49,610 
He always greets him there? 

538 
00:44:49,611 --> 00:44:50,611 
Look. 

539 
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,812 
Is not it strange? 

540 
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,113 
Hello, Professor. 

541 
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:00,514 
Good evening, Parker! 

542 
00:45:00,515 --> 00:45:01,515 
Good evening, Mary. 

543 
00:45:01,516 --> 00:45:02,716 
How do you teach this dog? 

544 
00:45:02,717 --> 00:45:04,717 
Surprisingly, and in fact every day. 

545 
00:45:15,918 --> 00:45:17,018 
Parker! 

546 
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:23,719 
Parker! 

547 
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,020 
You are too gorgeous. 

548 
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,221 
Well, I can still somehow 
correct. 

549 
00:45:52,022 --> 00:45:53,222 
Thanks. 

550 
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,523 
Would you like something else, madam? 

551 
00:45:58,824 --> 00:46:00,724 
It depends on what you have. 

552 
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:03,925 
All. 

553 
00:46:03,926 --> 00:46:04,926 
All? 

554 
00:46:16,627 --> 00:46:18,927 
Yes. All. 

555 
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,099 
You're a lot to me had such a time, I know. 

556 
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,800 
I do not remember if I thanked you at least once. 

557 
00:46:46,401 --> 00:46:48,501 
I love you so much. 

558 
00:46:51,602 --> 00:46:53,502 
And I love you. 

559 
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,003 
Strange. 

560 
00:46:59,104 --> 00:47:02,404 
Especially when you do not smell 
as a dog or a skunk. 

561 
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,105 
What happens not too often 
and it pleases me. 

562 
00:47:07,106 --> 00:47:09,306 
Okay? Yes, it smells of you 
so constantly! 

563 
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,607 
- I love you. 
- And I love you, yet. 

564 
00:47:30,508 --> 00:47:32,608 
Okay, Hati, go! 

565 
00:47:37,009 --> 00:47:38,709 
Hati, go! 

566 
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,710 
Come on, Hati, what is? 

567 
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,411 
What's wrong? 

568 
00:47:51,212 --> 00:47:54,212 
To me, me! Come on. 

569 
00:47:55,413 --> 00:47:59,413 
Tell me, what's wrong. 
Do you have something wrong? 

570 
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,714 
Looks good. What, eh? 

571 
00:48:06,315 --> 00:48:10,015 
Are you well? Yes. Well, are you going? 

572 
00:48:15,116 --> 00:48:16,616 
What is wrong with him? 

573 
00:48:16,617 --> 00:48:18,217 
I do not know. 

574 
00:48:18,218 --> 00:48:22,000 
Hati, decide. I have to leave 
working day. Come on, buddy. 

575 
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:25,701 
I left. 

576 
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:29,102 
- No, dear. 
- So long, until the evening. 

577 
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,603 
Last chance. 

578 
00:48:34,504 --> 00:48:36,004 
Bye! 

579 
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,005 
- Hi, Maryann. 
- And, Jess, good morning. 

580 
00:49:05,006 --> 00:49:08,606 
- I brought you coffee and donuts. 
- Fine, thank you. - Health. 

581 
00:49:21,707 --> 00:49:23,107 
Where Hati? 

582 
00:49:30,808 --> 00:49:33,008 
Hey, Hati! 

583 
00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:35,309 
Ah, here it is. 

584 
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,710 
Oh, how glad I am to see you. 

585 
00:49:38,711 --> 00:49:40,711 
What do you bring your ball? 

586 
00:49:40,712 --> 00:49:42,712 
Where do they get the ball? 

587 
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,513 
Want to play? Look. 

588 
00:49:46,414 --> 00:49:48,714 
Ready? Come on. 

589 
00:49:49,715 --> 00:49:51,815 
Take it, take it. 

590 
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,816 
Excellent, bring it to me! 

591 
00:49:55,717 --> 00:49:59,017 
Oh, I must! This is what I wanted. 

592 
00:49:59,018 --> 00:50:01,918 
Come again, farther away. I'll give up on. 

593 
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:09,719 
You're doing fine! That way, bring back. 

594 
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,320 
Oh-oh, how clever! Good girl! 

595 
00:50:15,321 --> 00:50:18,421 
You're just a lad! Did you see? 

596 
00:50:18,422 --> 00:50:19,422 
Hmm? 

597 
00:50:19,423 --> 00:50:23,023 
I threw the ball, and it brought! 
First time offered! He brought the ball! Yes! 

598 
00:50:23,024 --> 00:50:25,324 
Big day. 

599 
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:27,925 
Thanks. Good dog! 

600 
00:50:27,926 --> 00:50:31,326 
Okay, I went. Take them, it's yours. 

601 
00:50:33,027 --> 00:50:34,727 
For the first time brought. 

602 
00:50:34,728 --> 00:50:36,428 
Heh, first time! 

603 
00:50:37,329 --> 00:50:40,829 
No, no, no, wait, Professor! 
I'll instantly make you a coffee! 

604 
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,830 
Ok. 

605 
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:42,831 
Sorry, that was delayed. 

606 
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:45,832 
We saw what he did? 
I threw him the ball and he brought. 

607 
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:47,233 
No, not seen. 

608 
00:50:47,234 --> 00:50:49,234 
Take the ball. 

609 
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,235 
Do you want me to take? I can not play, 
I must go. At work time. 

610 
00:50:54,236 --> 00:50:56,336 
Take it with you, okay? 

611 
00:50:56,337 --> 00:50:58,000 
Done. 

612 
00:50:58,001 --> 00:50:59,601 
- Yes, thank you. 
- You're welcome. 

613 
00:50:59,602 --> 00:51:01,602 
- See you at 5. 
- I will be in place. 

614 
00:51:01,603 --> 00:51:04,003 
Home, Hati! Home! 

615 
00:51:12,304 --> 00:51:15,004 
OK, go here. To me, baby, to me. 

616 
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:17,805 
All right, all right. 

617 
00:51:18,306 --> 00:51:22,806 
See you at 5, go? 
Yes, clever. All run home. 

618 
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,307 
Now things are better there? 

619 
00:52:20,308 --> 00:52:21,308 
<i> Laughter. </ i> 

620 
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:24,309 
<i> - much! - If such 
possible. - We would do! </ I> 

621 
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:30,010 
Ok. Remember, we talked to you about 
John Philip Suso? 

622 
00:52:30,011 --> 00:52:33,711 
Writers marches, who lived 
at the turn of the century. 

623 
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:39,712 
He was famous, but did not recognize 
recording. 

624 
00:52:39,713 --> 00:52:42,713 
And his music no one is allowed 
record. 

625 
00:52:42,714 --> 00:52:47,614 
Beginning with Thomas Edison 
when he brought him to his new 
invention - the phonograph. 

626 
00:52:48,215 --> 00:52:54,715 
But Edison's ban did not stop and he 
secretly recorded his march to the performance 
orchestra at the parade. 

627 
00:52:55,716 --> 00:52:58,016 
It seems that this was the first 
pirate recording. 

628 
00:53:02,217 --> 00:53:05,517 
So what do you think? 
Was Suso rights? 

629 
00:53:05,518 --> 00:53:09,218 
And what now? Perhaps today 
implementing adequate leave, 

630 
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:15,719 
plugging in your CD-player to the amplifier 
on stage ... And? Enough? 

631 
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,620 
I do not know. 

632 
00:53:19,621 --> 00:53:26,121 
I am a lot older than you, but is inclined to believe 
that there is something special in music. 

633 
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:31,022 
Defies record. Life can 
record, the heart can not be written. 

634 
00:53:31,023 --> 00:53:34,223 
The moment of creation is elusive in nature. 

635 
00:54:07,024 --> 00:54:09,024 
Lord 

636 
00:54:09,025 --> 00:54:10,925 
What's wrong with him? 

637 
00:54:10,926 --> 00:54:12,926 
It looks like a heart attack. 

638 
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,027 
Welcome to Hati. How are you? 

639 
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:25,728 
Hello, Hati! 

640 
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:29,629 
Until tomorrow, Hati. 

641 
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,330 
So far, Hati. 

642 
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,931 
Hey, buddy. 

643 
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,632 
Will you go home? 

644 
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,833 
Hey, Hati. 

645 
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,134 
How are you, kid? 

646 
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,535 
Not so, as he did? 

647 
00:56:26,536 --> 00:56:28,536 
Forgive me, I learn. 

648 
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,037 
Andy! We must go, dear. 

649 
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,038 
Well, boy, wait here, okay? 
We return. 

650 
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,239 
I said that the soul is not more than the body. 

651 
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,740 
And I said, that the body is no more 
the soul. 

652 
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:25,841 
And nobody, even God, no higher than 
each of us for himself. 

653 
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:31,742 
In every thing I hear and see God. 
But do not understand it. 

654 
00:57:31,743 --> 00:57:36,243 
I can not just believe that there is 
Someone wonderful to me. 

655 
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:42,044 
I see God in the faces of men and women, 
and on my face in the mirror. 

656 
00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:47,645 
I find letters from God on the street 
and each has his signature. 

657 
00:57:47,646 --> 00:57:50,446 
But let them remain where they were. 

658 
00:57:50,447 --> 00:57:55,547 
For I know that wherever I go, I 
will accurately deliver the same. 

659 
00:57:55,548 --> 00:57:58,648 
Forever and ever. 

660 
00:58:51,749 --> 00:58:55,949 
Listen, do not have to wait for him. 

661 
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,750 
He did not return. 

662 
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,651 
Well, Hati. You better know 
what to do. 

663 
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,352 
Come on, buddy, come on, come on. 

664 
01:00:01,353 --> 01:00:03,253 
Come on, baby, come. 

665 
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:11,854 
Come on, Hati, go here. You will 
live with us. Come on, come on. 

666 
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,455 
It's time to go, Ronnie's been waiting for. 

667 
01:00:25,056 --> 01:00:27,000 
Come on, Hati, jump, jump here. 

668 
01:00:27,001 --> 01:00:31,001 
What a good boy. 
Done, Hati. 

669 
01:01:30,102 --> 01:01:32,302 
Hey, my stalwart! Andy? 

670 
01:01:32,303 --> 01:01:33,303 
Hati! 

671 
01:01:33,304 --> 01:01:34,304 
Andy! 

672 
01:01:34,305 --> 01:01:36,605 
What, dear? 

673 
01:01:36,606 --> 01:01:40,046 
Hati! Hati, come back! 

674 
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,747 
Another four will no longer be climbed. 

675 
01:04:03,748 --> 01:04:06,748 
Hey, think you have the first guest. 

676 
01:04:06,749 --> 01:04:10,949 
Hello, friend, went to the performed 
our new house? 

677 
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:14,150 
We started from the top, where almost everything is ready. 

678 
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:15,951 
Yes, but something with a basement do? 

679 
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:17,852 
Cellar has long been ready. 

680 
01:04:22,853 --> 01:04:25,053 
Donut with chocolate icing. 

681 
01:04:25,054 --> 01:04:27,654 
No, I do not like chocolate. 

682 
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:30,855 
Hey, Hati, what are you doing here? 

683 
01:04:30,856 --> 01:04:33,356 
Just take a look ... 

684 
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,957 
See, goes to his place. 

685 
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,858 
- I thought it was taken away. 
- So it was. 

686 
01:04:41,859 --> 01:04:46,559 
- Probably hungry. 
-Oh, good-natured you, Jess. 

687 
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,560 
We must give him a little. 

688 
01:04:48,561 --> 01:04:55,461 
Hey, Hati! Hot dog are you? 
Here, eat a hot dog. 

689 
01:04:57,862 --> 01:05:00,000 
Maybe he does not like your kitchen? 

690 
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:03,401 
Berry, delicious. This Jess prepared, 
you like. 

691 
01:05:10,202 --> 01:05:12,002 
From here he come from? 

692 
01:05:12,003 --> 01:05:15,003 
Just come. Come on, baby, eat. 

693 
01:05:15,004 --> 01:05:20,004 
Be careful, Hati. Some 
its hot dogs older than you. 

694 
01:05:20,005 --> 01:05:22,235 
And, no, do not listen to him. 

695 
01:05:36,536 --> 01:05:37,636 
Hati! 

696 
01:05:37,637 --> 01:05:38,900 
Oh, God. 

697 
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:41,801 
Hi! Oh, how I was worried about you ... 

698 
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,002 
I need you. 

699 
01:05:46,003 --> 01:05:48,203 
And what is it revolves around him? 

700 
01:05:48,204 --> 01:05:52,004 
This professor's daughter. 
He probably lived with them. 

701 
01:05:52,005 --> 01:05:54,005 
And Hati ran out? 

702 
01:05:54,006 --> 01:05:55,006 
Appears. 

703 
01:05:55,007 --> 01:05:56,307 
Oh, dear God ... 

704 
01:05:56,308 --> 01:05:58,308 
Let's go home. 

705 
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:01,209 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, she drags him along! 

706 
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:02,510 
Quietly, they own. 

707 
01:06:03,211 --> 01:06:06,011 
- Come on. 
- Come on, buddy. 

708 
01:06:06,012 --> 01:06:07,812 
Thank you very much. 

709 
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,713 
It will be better. Pour me some coffee. 

710 
01:06:19,314 --> 01:06:21,514 
Jess, come on, pour me some coffee. 

711 
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,615 
I also remember him. Every day. 

712 
01:07:05,816 --> 01:07:06,916 
Hey. 

713 
01:07:06,917 --> 01:07:13,317 
Hati, you know that we love you 
and we want you to stay with us. 

714 
01:07:16,518 --> 01:07:21,318 
But if you need to go, we understand. 

715 
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:24,819 
Ok. 

716 
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,520 
Farewell, Hati. 

717 
01:07:55,721 --> 01:07:57,921 
Good day, Hati. 

718 
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:32,722 
Hey, Hati! Here, take this. Only 
not tell Myra, okay? 

719 
01:08:34,623 --> 01:08:36,523 
Good night, Hati. 

720 
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,324 
- Good morning, Jess. 
- Hello, what now? 

721 
01:09:03,325 --> 01:09:06,925 
- I think a big hot dog and two donuts. 
- Good. 

722 
01:09:13,126 --> 01:09:15,626 
Be careful, hot. 

723 
01:09:20,327 --> 01:09:23,027 
Lucky, me! 

724 
01:09:23,028 --> 01:09:25,328 
Come on, sweetie. Hey, Lucky! 

725 
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:28,729 
Your coffee, enjoy your meal. 

726 
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:38,730 
Oh, excuse me, sir. That dog ... 

727 
01:09:39,131 --> 01:09:40,431 
Yes? 

728 
01:09:40,432 --> 01:09:43,432 
This accident is not the dog, which 
all say? 

729 
01:09:45,433 --> 01:09:47,233 
And what do you care? 

730 
01:09:47,234 --> 01:09:51,834 
Oh, sorry, I am Teddy Bartz, reporter. 

731 
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,135 
Yes, I have heard a lot about him from fellow travelers. 

732 
01:09:56,136 --> 01:09:59,236 
I do not know, but you can do 
good story. 

733 
01:10:01,837 --> 01:10:04,237 
I Boliens, Carl Boliens. 

734 
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:07,538 
B-to-i-l-i-e-n-a. 

735 
01:10:07,539 --> 01:10:08,539 
- Not through E. 
- Got it. 

736 
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:11,540 
This I found him and handed over to other hands. 

737 
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,041 
Yes? 

738 
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:17,242 
And where now, Charles ... Where does he live? 

739 
01:10:17,243 --> 01:10:21,843 
Well ... Nobody knows exactly 
somewhere comes. 

740 
01:10:21,844 --> 01:10:24,444 
- He does not chase away? 
- No, I used to. 

741 
01:10:25,345 --> 01:10:27,045 
He does everything as needed. 

742 
01:10:27,046 --> 01:10:31,846 
And I can take a picture? For reportage. 

743 
01:10:31,847 --> 01:10:34,447 
Oh, I do not mind. 
Hati, you do not mind? 

744 
01:10:34,448 --> 01:10:36,248 
Thank you, very well. 

745 
01:10:36,249 --> 01:10:38,949 
E. .. First, a single shot. 

746 
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:41,850 
No dog? Okay. Sit. 

747 
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,351 
Hmm ... No, I ... 

748 
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,652 
And, yes, okay, as you know. 

749 
01:10:47,653 --> 01:10:50,353 
I am grateful to you, you are very kind. 

750 
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,954 
Well, now, together. 

751 
01:10:52,955 --> 01:10:54,355 
About! Yes, well. 

752 
01:10:54,356 --> 01:10:56,356 
Look there, do not turn away. 

753 
01:10:56,357 --> 01:10:58,657 
Smile ... Wonderful. 

754 
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:06,158 
"A devoted dog waiting for the return 
deceased owner. 

755 
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,059 
Hey, Hati. 

756 
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:21,760 
The lad from Delhi has sent you money, 
that he was given for breakfast. 

757 
01:11:21,761 --> 01:11:24,461 
So I bought you food. 

758 
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,962 
This is the third week. 

759 
01:11:27,963 --> 01:11:30,963 
If it goes, I'm in the bank 
account is opened. 

760 
01:11:31,564 --> 01:11:33,564 
Just do not say that I'm not fed. 

761 
01:11:36,765 --> 01:11:38,965 
Doggie something we succeed. 

762 
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:42,066 
Look, is not it dear? 

763 
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:44,667 
Welcome to Hati. 

764 
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,268 
- Where are you going to do with the money? 
- I am his guardian. 

765 
01:11:56,869 --> 01:11:59,069 
- I am now. 
- Thank you. 

766 
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:18,370 
Hati. Hello. How are you? 

767 
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,571 
You are here, Hati. This is for you. 

768 
01:12:24,302 --> 01:12:25,972 
Hungry, and. 

769 
01:12:25,973 --> 01:12:29,673 
Yes, it's so cold to eat. 

770 
01:12:31,074 --> 01:12:33,974 
I'm Jess, keep a stall here. 

771 
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:36,600 
Ken-Fyuts Esi, a friend of Professor Wilson. 

772 
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:38,601 
A friend of the professor? 

773 
01:12:38,602 --> 01:12:41,102 
One sugar, two of cream. 

774 
01:12:42,203 --> 01:12:44,303 
You must have read the article. 

775 
01:12:44,304 --> 01:12:45,304 
Read. 

776 
01:12:45,305 --> 01:12:47,305 
Saw my name there? 

777 
01:12:47,306 --> 01:12:49,406 
Yes, I did. This ... 

778 
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,407 
Twice. 

779 
01:12:50,708 --> 01:12:52,808 
Can I help with the costs? 

780 
01:12:52,809 --> 01:12:55,009 
No, I beg you, do not need money. 

781 
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:57,010 
And if he falls ill? For treatment. 

782 
01:12:57,011 --> 01:13:02,311 
Let us collect. Passengers will, sellers. 
We all take care of him. 

783 
01:13:02,312 --> 01:13:06,812 
This area became home to Hati. 
He comes into place in time. 

784 
01:13:06,813 --> 01:13:08,200 
Every day. 

785 
01:13:08,201 --> 01:13:09,701 
Look closely behind him. 

786 
01:13:09,702 --> 01:13:11,400 
We are behind him? 

787 
01:13:11,401 --> 01:13:12,901 
Sure. 

788 
01:13:14,702 --> 01:13:18,802 
Okay, go. And then hotdogs me 
waiting for. 

789 
01:13:18,803 --> 01:13:19,803 
Glad acquaintance. 

790 
01:13:19,804 --> 01:13:22,204 
Me too. And thanks. 

791 
01:13:26,605 --> 01:13:30,205 
A year has passed, right? 

792 
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:36,406 
Sometimes I wake up in the night 
and remember Parker. He was a good 
another. 

793 
01:13:36,407 --> 01:13:40,207 
I understand how you feel. 

794 
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:43,708 
Hati, my friend Parker never 
not return home. 

795 
01:13:43,709 --> 01:13:47,709 
But if Hatiko want to wait, then 
Hatiko to wait. 

796 
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:49,710 
You do want? 

797 
01:13:52,911 --> 01:13:57,000 
Dolgikh old are you, Hati. 

798 
01:14:07,001 --> 01:14:12,901 
Well, mister, for now, eat. 
Good boy. 

799 
01:14:16,502 --> 01:14:20,502 
Want more? Here, take this. 

800 
01:14:22,303 --> 01:14:27,003 
Here you go, baby, the last piece. 
Tasty, yes? 

801 
01:14:37,104 --> 01:14:38,604 
This is where you all bought it? 

802 
01:14:38,605 --> 01:14:41,605 
Oh, thank you, that you met me ... 
Until tomorrow, Hati. 

803 
01:14:42,806 --> 01:14:44,506 
Chao, Hati. 

804 
01:15:21,207 --> 01:15:22,713 
Thanks. 

805 
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:37,514 
As usual, eh? 

806 
01:15:37,515 --> 01:15:40,015 
Why you ever not take 
chicken wings? 

807 
01:15:40,016 --> 01:15:41,016 
Hey, this ... 

808 
01:15:41,017 --> 01:15:42,017 
Mustard? 

809 
01:15:43,018 --> 01:15:45,218 
Mrs. Wilson? Glad to see you. 

810 
01:15:45,219 --> 01:15:46,219 
Hello. 

811 
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:50,620 
Hey, this is the professor's wife, yes? 

812 
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,221 
Today 
The Merchant of Venice 

813 
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,022 
Parker Wilson 
A loving husband and father

814 
01:16:48,223 --> 01:16:50,223 
Kate. 

815 
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:55,000 
Ken ... 

816 
01:16:57,601 --> 01:16:59,601 
Much time has passed. 

817 
01:17:00,202 --> 01:17:02,202 
Yes, a lot. 

818 
01:17:11,403 --> 01:17:16,003 
10 years. It is hard to believe. 

819 
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,704 
Welcome to Hati. 

820 
01:17:37,605 --> 01:17:40,005 
Good day, Hati. 

821 
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:57,606 
Coffee without sugar, and do not put in hot dog 
mustard. Ketchup is the best. 

822 
01:17:57,607 --> 01:17:59,607 
Well, here's the best. 

823 
01:18:22,308 --> 01:18:24,000 
Hati? 

824 
01:18:30,301 --> 01:18:32,301 
Hati ... 

825 
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,002 
Oh, old man, are you still waiting for? .. 

826 
01:18:49,503 --> 01:18:51,703 
Good boy. 

827 
01:18:53,404 --> 01:18:56,404 
All true. 

828 
01:19:10,705 --> 01:19:14,305 
Can I wait with you 
the next train? 

829 
01:19:17,006 --> 01:19:18,506 
Yes? 

830 
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000 
Thanks. 

831 
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,000 
Oh, Hati ... 

832 
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,300 
Tiny. 

833 
01:19:45,301 --> 01:19:46,301 
Like it? 

834 
01:19:46,302 --> 01:19:47,302 
Yes. 

835 
01:19:47,303 --> 01:19:49,203 
But look here. 

836 
01:19:49,204 --> 01:19:50,204 
Oh, it's me. 

837 
01:19:50,205 --> 01:19:56,005 
This I remember well. I remember the day, 
when did this picture. 

838 
01:19:56,906 --> 01:19:58,706 
What is he wonderful. 

839 
01:20:00,307 --> 01:20:02,207 
Oh, is he at the wedding. 

840 
01:20:02,208 --> 01:20:07,008 
Yes, here it is. And. 

841 
01:20:07,009 --> 01:20:09,309 
And where my grandfather found Hati? 

842 
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:14,210 
Ronnie, in fact it is found Hati 
your grandfather. 

843 
01:20:14,211 --> 01:20:16,011 
How so? 

844 
01:20:16,012 --> 01:20:20,512 
One evening my grandfather 
returning home. 

845 
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,813 
Came out of the train and the platform, 
among ... 

846 
01:22:15,914 --> 01:22:17,514 
Hey, wake up. 

847 
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:19,915 
Hey, baby. 

848 
01:22:21,016 --> 01:22:24,616 
Hey, let's go. Rather, come on! 

849 
01:22:51,817 --> 01:22:53,417 
Hati! 

850 
01:22:53,418 --> 01:22:55,618 
Hey, kid! 

851 
01:23:36,219 --> 01:23:41,019 
I do not remember his grandfather, he died 
I was very young. 

852 
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:47,020 
But when I hear a story about him and Hati, 
I think I know him. 

853 
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:54,021 
They taught me to appreciate their loyalty and 
never forget those whom you love. 

854 
01:23:54,422 --> 01:23:58,622 
So Hati forever my hero. 

855 
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,023 
Look how he was glad to see you. 

856 
01:24:16,324 --> 01:24:17,924 
Go you? 

857 
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:23,525 
To me, Hati, let's go. 

858 
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000 
This Hatiko was born in Japan 
Odate city in 1923. 

859 
01:24:38,001 --> 01:24:45,301 
Its owner, Dr. Isabura Ueno, 
professor of Tokyo University, 
died in May 1925. 

860 
01:24:45,302 --> 01:24:49,702 
Hati returned to the station Shibui 
and waited for him there 9 years. 

861 
01:24:49,703 --> 01:24:54,103 
Hatiko died in March 1934. 

862 
01:24:55,404 --> 01:25:01,904 
Today a bronze statue waiting Hatiko 
standing at the railway station Shibui.
