1
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,153
Hunger strike?
How long has this been going on?

2
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:08,115
She hasn't had a thing yesterday or today.

3
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:10,348
- Sending meals up to her regularly?
- Yes, sir.

4
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:12,235
Why don't you jam it down her throat?

5
00:01:12,318 --> 00:01:14,036
It's not that simple, Mr. Andrews.

6
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:17,747
I'll talk to her myself.
Have some food brought up to her.

7
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:19,432
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:23,112
I won't eat a thing
until you let me off this boat.

9
00:01:23,198 --> 00:01:25,632
Come now, Ellie.
You know I'll have my way.

10
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:28,795
Not this time, you won't!
I'm already married to him.

11
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:31,108
You'll never live
under the same roof with him.

12
00:01:31,198 --> 00:01:32,074
I'll see to it.

13
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:34,837
Get it through your head,
King Westley and I are married!

14
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:38,354
Definitely, legally, actually married!
It's over, it's finished.

15
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:41,589
There's not a thing you can do about it.
I'm over 21 and so is he.

16
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:43,157
While you've been onboard...

17
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:46,071
...l've arranged to
have your marriage annulled.

18
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:49,355
Annulled. I'll have something to say
about that and so will King.

19
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:50,757
I expect him to.

20
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:54,708
The vittles. Come in.

21
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:57,187
I told you not to bring any food in here.

22
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,388
Now wait a minute. This isn't for you.

23
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:00,633
Put it down here.

24
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:11,393
Smart, aren't you? So subtle.

25
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,072
Strategy, my dear.

26
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:15,797
Was it strategy sending
those gorillas to drag me away...

27
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:17,357
...from the Justice of the Peace?

28
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:19,474
Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.

29
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:21,196
I've won many arguments that way.

30
00:02:21,278 --> 00:02:24,475
Besides not liking him,
you haven't got a thing against King.

31
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:27,591
- He's a fake.
- He's one of the best flyers in the country.

32
00:02:27,678 --> 00:02:30,146
He's no good.
You married him because I said not to.

33
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:32,314
You're always telling me what not to do.

34
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:34,354
Because you've always been
a stubborn idiot.

35
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:36,554
I come from a long line of stubborn idiots.

36
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:39,596
Don't shout so.
You may work up an appetite.

37
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:42,192
I'll shout if I want to!
I'll scream if I want to!

38
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:43,313
All right, scream.

39
00:02:43,398 --> 00:02:46,708
Let me off this boat or I'll break
every piece of furniture in here!

40
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:48,311
Here, now.

41
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:51,310
Have a nice piece of juicy steak.
You don't have to eat it.

42
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:53,389
Just smell it. It's a poem.

43
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:12,796
Lower the boats! Catch her!

44
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:15,077
Come on, men!

45
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:20,554
She got away, sir.

46
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:22,549
Of course, she's too smart for you.

47
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:25,552
Send a wireless
to the Lovington Detective Agency.

48
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,673
"Daughter escaped again.

49
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:29,192
"Watch roads,
airports and train stations in Miami."

50
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:34,794
All aboard!
Palm Beach, Savannah, Jacksonville...

51
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:37,593
...New York, Philadelphia.

52
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:40,590
We're wasting our time.
Imagine Ellie Andrews riding on a bus.

53
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,350
I told the old man it was bunk.

54
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:43,992
Ticket for New York, please.

55
00:03:48,398 --> 00:03:51,117
- Here's your ticket.
- Thank you very much.

56
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:54,237
Thank you.

57
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,593
What's going on here?
I'd like to use that phone.

58
00:04:01,678 --> 00:04:04,431
Go away. This is history in the making.

59
00:04:04,638 --> 00:04:07,948
- What?
- There's a man biting a dog in there.

60
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:10,268
Heel, boy.

61
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:12,275
I can't stand this any longer.

62
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:14,316
In a pig's eye, you will.

63
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:19,187
Listen monkey face, when you fired me,
you fired the best news hound...

64
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:21,786
...your filthy scandal sheet ever had.

65
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,035
You wouldn't know a newspaper story
if it kicked you in the pants.

66
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:28,827
I got all your copy. Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna write it in Greek?

67
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:30,192
I'd start a new department.

68
00:04:30,278 --> 00:04:32,508
That was free verse,
you gas house palooka.

69
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:35,630
What was free about it?
It cost this paper a gob of dough.

70
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:37,436
And it's not going to cost us any more!

71
00:04:37,598 --> 00:04:38,508
Gordon.

72
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,316
Did you know he reversed the charge?

73
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:42,150
What? Why you...

74
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:47,190
When you get back to New York,
you keep far away from this office.

75
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:51,271
You're fired. You don't work here
anymore and you never will.

76
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:53,997
What'd he say?

77
00:04:57,358 --> 00:04:59,110
So, you're changing your tune?

78
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:02,671
You're late with your apologies.

79
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:06,353
I wouldn't go back to work for you
if you begged me on your hands and knees!

80
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:08,275
I hope this'll be a lesson to you.

81
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:11,997
Did we tell that baby?

82
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:15,906
- We don't need anymore of his lip.
- You told him, Pete.

83
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:18,114
I guess he knows now,
how I feel about his job.

84
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:19,756
I bet he does, too.

85
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:21,430
Is my chariot ready?

86
00:05:21,518 --> 00:05:24,510
Your chariot awaiteth withouteth,
mighty King.

87
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:28,752
- Lead on, sire.
- Make way for the king.

88
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:30,630
Make way for the king.

89
00:05:30,718 --> 00:05:32,436
Long live the king.

90
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,229
Philadelphia, all aboard!

91
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:45,077
Step down Marty, King is back.

92
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:47,467
On the rack in the back.
It's your goodbye chariot.

93
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,186
Make hams of you and scram!

94
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,990
Two thousand miles is a long trip.

95
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:57,398
Make yourself comfortable
with a pleasant pillow.

96
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,707
Pillow, sir?

97
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:11,076
Driver! If you'll be good enough
to move those newspapers, I'll have a seat.

98
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:22,115
Hey, wait a minute!

99
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:26,790
What do you think you're doing?

100
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,917
The papers. What's the idea of
throwing them out?

101
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:32,990
The papers? It's a long story, my friend.

102
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:35,467
I never did like the idea
of sitting on newspapers.

103
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:39,107
I did it once, and all the headlines
came off on my white pants.

104
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:42,315
It actually happened.
Nobody bought a paper that day.

105
00:06:42,398 --> 00:06:46,073
They followed me all over town and read
the news off the seat of my pants.

106
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:49,514
A fresh guy. What you need is
a good sock on the nose.

107
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:56,113
Listen partner,
you may not like my nose, but I do.

108
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:58,514
I always wear it out in the open so...

109
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:01,158
...if anybody wants to
take a sock at it, they can.

110
00:07:01,998 --> 00:07:03,317
Yeah?

111
00:07:05,278 --> 00:07:08,190
Now, that's a brilliant answer.
Why didn't I think of it?

112
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:10,792
Our conversation could have been over
long ago.

113
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:12,033
Yeah?

114
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,673
If you keep that up,
we won't get anywhere.

115
00:07:15,278 --> 00:07:16,393
Yeah?

116
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:19,988
You got me. Yeah!

117
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:32,272
Excuse me, lady.
But that upon which you sit is mine.

118
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:35,071
I beg your pardon?

119
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:37,626
Now listen,
I put up a stiff fight for that seat.

120
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:40,552
So, if it's just the same to you, scram.

121
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:43,993
Driver, are these seats reserved?

122
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:47,468
- No. First come, first serve.
- Thank you.

123
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:50,910
These seats accommodate two people,
don't they?

124
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:52,750
Maybe they do, maybe they don't.

125
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:53,867
Thank you.

126
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,031
Move over.

127
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,787
This is a "maybe they do."

128
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:12,591
If you'd ask me real nice,
I might put that bag up there for you.

129
00:08:29,998 --> 00:08:32,751
Next time you drop in, bring your folks.

130
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:54,268
Get some! Come on, everybody!

131
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:56,516
Hot dogs, folks!

132
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:02,993
Rest station, 15 minutes.
We'll only be here 15 minutes.

133
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:04,397
Red hot coffee!

134
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:06,831
Right around there.

135
00:09:06,918 --> 00:09:08,874
Get the red hot coffee! Hot dogs!

136
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,870
Can't enjoy the ride unless you eat!

137
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:53,387
He got away.

138
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:56,636
I found myself in the middle of brush
and no sign of the skunk.

139
00:09:56,718 --> 00:09:58,993
I don't know what you're raving about,
young man.

140
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:02,627
- Furthermore, I'm not interested.
- Well of all the...

141
00:10:03,238 --> 00:10:06,310
Maybe you'll be interested
to know your bag is gone.

142
00:10:06,558 --> 00:10:08,435
My heavens! It's gone!

143
00:10:08,518 --> 00:10:10,031
I knew you'd catch on eventually.

144
00:10:11,798 --> 00:10:14,870
- What am I going to do now?
- Don't tell me your ticket was in it.

145
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,395
No, got that all right. But not my money.
All I have here is $4.

146
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:21,514
You can wire home
for money in Jacksonville.

147
00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:22,667
No, I can't.

148
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:26,435
- Yes, I guess I will.
- I'll tell the driver about your bag.

149
00:10:26,518 --> 00:10:28,349
Thank you, I'd rather you didn't.

150
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:31,748
Don't be a fool. You've lost your bag.
The company should pay for it.

151
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:34,352
- What's your name?
- I don't want it reported!

152
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:36,747
That's silly.
The company will take care of it.

153
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:40,797
Can you understand English?
Would you please keep out of my affairs?

154
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:42,834
I want to be left alone.

155
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:48,354
Why, you ungrateful brat.

156
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:50,306
Board!

157
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:52,111
All aboard!

158
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,186
Jacksonville, 30 minutes for breakfast.

159
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:34,235
Only 30 minutes for breakfast.

160
00:12:35,478 --> 00:12:37,867
Just 30 minutes. That's all. No more.

161
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,277
Read all about it!

162
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:07,155
I'm so sorry.

163
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,710
Silly, isn't it?

164
00:13:10,718 --> 00:13:12,515
Why, everybody's gone!

165
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:18,115
Thank you for that, very much.

166
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:22,751
- We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
- Yes.

167
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:26,870
That was foolish of me.

168
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:30,232
Why didn't you shove me away?

169
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:34,348
I hated to wake you up.
You look kind of pretty asleep.

170
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:37,231
How about some breakfast?

171
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:42,116
No thank you. No, I'm going
to the Windsor Hotel.

172
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:46,273
Windsor? You'll never make it in time.
We leave in a half an hour.

173
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:48,315
No, they'll wait for me.

174
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,633
Driver, I'm going to be a few minutes late.
Be sure to wait for me.

175
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:55,873
Yeah?

176
00:13:56,518 --> 00:13:57,587
Yes.

177
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:20,676
Where's the bus to New York?

178
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:22,356
It left about 20 minutes ago.

179
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:26,552
But that's ridiculous. I was on that bus.
I told them to wait.

180
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:29,193
I'm sorry, miss, but it's gone.

181
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:33,630
Good morning. Remember me?
I'm the fellow you slept on last night.

182
00:14:35,718 --> 00:14:37,913
Seems to me,
I've already thanked you for that.

183
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:39,392
What time's the next bus?

184
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,911
8:00 tonight.

185
00:14:40,998 --> 00:14:43,876
8:00? That's 12 hours.

186
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:45,517
Sorry, miss.

187
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,358
What's wrong?
Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?

188
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:51,794
Why are you so excited?
You missed it, too.

189
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:53,516
Yeah, I missed it too.

190
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:57,431
Don't tell me you did it on my account.

191
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:01,873
I hope you haven't any idea
that what happened last night is...

192
00:15:02,478 --> 00:15:04,867
Young man,
you needn't concern yourself about me.

193
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,516
I can take care of myself.

194
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:10,313
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.
Here's your ticket.

195
00:15:10,838 --> 00:15:12,112
My ticket?

196
00:15:12,238 --> 00:15:14,149
I found it on the seat.

197
00:15:17,838 --> 00:15:20,989
Thank you.
It must have fallen out of my purse.

198
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:25,916
You'll never get away with it,
Miss Andrews.

199
00:15:26,878 --> 00:15:29,870
- What are you talking about?
- You won't get away with it.

200
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,428
Your father will stop you before
you get halfway to New York.

201
00:15:34,118 --> 00:15:36,154
You must have me confused
with someone else.

202
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:38,433
Quit kidding. It's all over the front page.

203
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:45,996
I've always been curious to know...

204
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,037
...what kind of a girl would marry
a front-page aviator like King Westley.

205
00:15:50,118 --> 00:15:54,430
Take my advice. Grab the next bus back
to Miami. That guy's a phoney.

206
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:57,913
I didn't ask for your advice.

207
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:00,634
That's right. You didn't.

208
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:03,988
You're not going to notify my father,
are you?

209
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:05,352
What for?

210
00:16:06,118 --> 00:16:08,313
You probably could get
some money out of him.

211
00:16:08,438 --> 00:16:09,712
I never thought of that.

212
00:16:09,798 --> 00:16:13,313
If you promise not to do it,
I'll pay you as much as he will.

213
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:15,156
You won't gain a thing by giving me up.

214
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:17,274
I'm willing to make it worth your while.

215
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:19,633
I've got to get to New York
without being stopped.

216
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:21,550
It's very important to me.

217
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:23,310
I'd pay you now, only...

218
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:25,832
...all I had when I jumped off
the yacht was a watch.

219
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,909
I had to pawn it to get these clothes.

220
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:30,831
I'll give you my address.
You can contact me in New York.

221
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:32,272
Never mind.

222
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,794
I had you pegged right from the jump.

223
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:39,876
Just the spoiled brat of a rich father.
The only way you get anything is to buy it.

224
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:43,911
You're in a jam and all you can think of is
your money. It never fails, does it?

225
00:16:44,398 --> 00:16:46,275
Ever hear of the word "humility"?

226
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,791
No, you wouldn't.

227
00:16:47,878 --> 00:16:49,596
It never occurred to you to say...

228
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:52,397
..."Please, Mister, I'm in trouble.
Will you help me?"

229
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,946
That'd bring you down off your high horse.

230
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:57,347
I'll tell you something to ease your mind.

231
00:16:57,438 --> 00:16:58,951
You don't have to worry about me.

232
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:01,587
I'm not interested in your money
or your problem.

233
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:05,637
You, King Westley, your father.
You're all a lot of hooey to me.

234
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:12,876
You send telegrams here?

235
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:16,151
I'm just fine, thanks. And how are you?

236
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:23,029
"To Joe Gordon,
in care of New York Mail, New York.

237
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:27,031
"Am I laughing. The biggest scoop
of the year just dropped in my lap.

238
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:30,549
"I know where Ellen Andrews is."
No, do you really?

239
00:17:31,478 --> 00:17:33,548
Go on. Send the telegram.

240
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:37,512
"How would you like to have the story?
You big tub of..."

241
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:39,711
Mush.

242
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:41,948
"Tub of mush. Well, try and get it.

243
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:45,508
"What I said about never writing
another line for you still goes.

244
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,509
"Are you burning? Peter Warne."

245
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:49,350
That'll be $2.60.

246
00:17:49,438 --> 00:17:51,474
- Send it collect.
- Collect?

247
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:52,786
Collect.

248
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:03,072
Bus leaving for Savannah, Charleston,
Columbia, Greensboro, Richmond...

249
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:07,276
...Washington, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, New York...

250
00:18:32,718 --> 00:18:38,031
Hi, sister. All alone? My name's Shapeley.
May as well get acquainted, it's a long trip.

251
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,393
Gets tiresome.
Especially for somebody like you.

252
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:42,150
You look like you've got class.

253
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:46,789
Yes, with a capital "K". I'm the guy
that knows class when he sees it.

254
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:50,314
Believe you me. Ask any of the boys.
They'll tell you.

255
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:52,195
Shapeley sure knows how to pick them.

256
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:55,476
Shapeley's the name
and that's the way I like them.

257
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:57,350
You made no mistake sitting next to me.

258
00:18:57,438 --> 00:18:59,110
Most girls you meet on the bus...

259
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:01,428
...ain't nothing to write home
to the wife about.

260
00:19:01,518 --> 00:19:04,316
You gotta be awful careful
who you hit it up with.

261
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:06,707
You can't be too particular, neither.

262
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:09,073
What's the matter, you ain't saying much?

263
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:12,912
Seems to me you're doing excellently
without any assistance.

264
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:18,313
That's pretty good. "Seems to me you're
doing excellently without any assistance."

265
00:19:18,438 --> 00:19:20,713
Well shut my big, nasty mouth.

266
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:23,590
Looks like you're one up on me.

267
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:26,636
There's nothing I like better
than to meet a high-class mama...

268
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:30,757
...that can snap back at you.
The colder they are, the hotter they get.

269
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,317
That's what I always say.

270
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,117
Yes, sir.

271
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:38,111
When a cold mama gets hot,
boy how she sizzles.

272
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,228
Now you're just my type.

273
00:19:42,318 --> 00:19:45,390
Believe me, sister,
I could go for you in a big way.

274
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:50,472
"Fun-on-the-side Shapeley," they call me.
With accent on the "fun". Believe you me.

275
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:53,830
Believe you me,
you bore me to distraction.

276
00:19:55,998 --> 00:19:58,466
Looks like you're two up on me now.

277
00:19:58,798 --> 00:19:59,708
Hey, you.

278
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:04,470
- There's a seat over there for you.
- What's the idea?

279
00:20:04,678 --> 00:20:07,954
I'd like to sit next to my wife,
if you don't mind.

280
00:20:08,278 --> 00:20:09,472
- Your wife?
- Yes.

281
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:11,347
Come on.

282
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,553
Yeah. Sure, excuse me.
You know, I was just...

283
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:19,108
Sure. Excuse me, miss.
I was just trying to make things pleasant.

284
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:20,667
Excuse me, I...

285
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:23,147
I didn't mean anything, Doc.

286
00:20:24,838 --> 00:20:26,271
- No offence, Doc.
- No.

287
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:36,148
If you promise not to snap my head off,
I'd like to thank you.

288
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:40,271
Forget it. I didn't do it for you.
His voice gets on my nerves.

289
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:48,389
What'd you do all day?

290
00:20:49,238 --> 00:20:52,913
Ran in and out of doorways.
Trying to keep out of the rain.

291
00:20:55,518 --> 00:20:57,509
Your clothes are all wet.

292
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,552
Here.

293
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:03,394
You're as helpless as a baby.

294
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:04,547
Thank you.

295
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:09,428
Here you are, folks. Cigars, cigarettes,
chewing gum, candy, magazines.

296
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:10,917
Here, boy.

297
00:21:13,158 --> 00:21:15,353
- Yes, ma'am.
- A box of chocolates, please.

298
00:21:15,438 --> 00:21:17,906
- Never mind. She doesn't want it.
- But...

299
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:20,512
- Of course, I do. What do you mean?
- Beat it.

300
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:23,557
Well, you've got your nerve. Here, boy!

301
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:27,196
$1.60.

302
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:29,836
You had $4 last night.

303
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:32,589
How will you get to New York at this rate?

304
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:35,033
That's none of your business.

305
00:21:35,398 --> 00:21:37,673
You're on a budget from now on.

306
00:21:38,158 --> 00:21:41,070
- Just a minute. You can't...
- Shut up.

307
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,832
- What's the matter, officer?
- Bridge washed out.

308
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:07,148
Looks like we can't get through
till morning.

309
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:09,508
If any passengers want a place to sleep...

310
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:11,873
...you'll find an auto camp
up yonder a piece.

311
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,233
- Where?
- Right over there. See those lights?

312
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:16,626
Dyke's Auto camp.

313
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:18,908
All right, thanks. Hey, brat.

314
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:20,951
Are you talking to me?

315
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:23,546
Yeah. Come on,
we're stopping here for the night.

316
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:41,631
Hey! Come on, we're all set.

317
00:22:52,398 --> 00:22:56,073
Good evening. Hope you
and your husband rest comfortable.

318
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:07,315
Come on! What are you going to do,
stay out there all night?

319
00:23:27,678 --> 00:23:29,430
Darn clever, these Armenians?

320
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:31,350
Yeah, it's a gift.

321
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:38,478
I just had the unpleasant sensation
of hearing you referred to as my husband.

322
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,631
Yeah. I forgot to tell you about that.
I registered as Mr. And Mrs.

323
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:43,992
You did?

324
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:48,390
What am I expected to do? Leap for joy?

325
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:51,272
I kind of half expected you to thank me.

326
00:23:52,118 --> 00:23:54,837
Your ego is absolutely colossal.

327
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:57,512
Yeah, it's not bad. How's yours?

328
00:24:04,198 --> 00:24:07,986
You know, compared to you,
my friend Shapeley's an amateur.

329
00:24:09,598 --> 00:24:12,874
Just whatever gave you any idea
I'd stand for this?

330
00:24:13,158 --> 00:24:16,833
Now wait a minute.
Let's get this straightened out right now.

331
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,474
If you're nursing any silly notion
that I'm interested in you, forget it.

332
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:22,753
You're just a headline to me.

333
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:24,597
A headline?

334
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:27,549
You're not a newspaper man, are you?

335
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:29,709
Chalk up one for your side.

336
00:24:30,718 --> 00:24:33,869
Now listen. You want to
get to King Westley, don't you?

337
00:24:33,998 --> 00:24:37,593
All right, I'm here to help you.
What I want is your story.

338
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:42,594
Exclusive. A day-to-day account.
All about your mad fight to happiness.

339
00:24:43,318 --> 00:24:46,674
I need that story.
Between you and me, I've got to have it.

340
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:52,751
Isn't that just too cute.

341
00:24:53,518 --> 00:24:56,635
There's a brain behind that face of yours,
isn't there?

342
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:01,789
You've got everything nicely figured out
for yourself. Including this.

343
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,870
This? Well, that's a matter
of simple mathematics.

344
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:09,110
These cabins cost $2 a night.
I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear...

345
00:25:09,238 --> 00:25:13,117
...but the family purse won't stand
for our having separate establishment.

346
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:22,711
Thank you very much, sir.
You've been very kind.

347
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:25,387
It's all right with me.
Go on out in the storm.

348
00:25:25,478 --> 00:25:27,355
But I'm going to follow you.

349
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:28,427
Yeah.

350
00:25:28,758 --> 00:25:33,513
And if you get tough, I'll just have to turn
you over to your old man. Right now.

351
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,988
Savvy? That's my whole plot in a nutshell.

352
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,148
A simple story for simple people.

353
00:25:41,238 --> 00:25:43,832
You behave yourself,
I'll see you get to King Westley.

354
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,910
If not,
I'll just have to spill the beans to Papa.

355
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:50,950
Now, which of these beds do you prefer?

356
00:25:52,158 --> 00:25:53,989
This one? All right.

357
00:26:16,198 --> 00:26:19,395
That, I suppose,
makes everything quite all right.

358
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:21,027
This?

359
00:26:24,158 --> 00:26:27,548
I like privacy when I retire.
Yes, I'm very delicate in that respect.

360
00:26:27,638 --> 00:26:29,196
Prying eyes annoy me.

361
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,316
Behold the walls of Jericho.

362
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:39,394
Maybe not as thick as the ones
that Joshua blew down with his trumpet.

363
00:26:39,518 --> 00:26:40,917
But a lot safer.

364
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:43,671
You see, I have no trumpet.

365
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:47,072
Now to show you
my heart's in the right place...

366
00:26:47,158 --> 00:26:49,626
...l'll give you my best pair of pyjamas.

367
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:53,788
Do you mind joining the Israelites?

368
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:56,754
You don't want to join the Israelites?

369
00:26:56,838 --> 00:27:00,387
All right. Perhaps you're interested
in how a man undresses.

370
00:27:01,638 --> 00:27:04,630
There's a funny thing about that.
Quite a study in psychology.

371
00:27:04,718 --> 00:27:06,515
No two men do it alike.

372
00:27:06,718 --> 00:27:10,233
I once knew a man who kept his hat on
until he was completely undressed.

373
00:27:10,598 --> 00:27:12,236
Now he made a picture.

374
00:27:12,438 --> 00:27:15,714
Years later, his secret came out.
He wore a toupee.

375
00:27:17,598 --> 00:27:19,475
I have a method all my own.

376
00:27:19,678 --> 00:27:23,591
If you'll notice, the coat came first.
Then the tie. Then the shirt.

377
00:27:24,238 --> 00:27:28,072
Now, according to Hoyle,
after that the pants should be next.

378
00:27:28,838 --> 00:27:30,430
There's where I'm different.

379
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:32,355
I go for the shoes next.

380
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:35,152
First the right. Then the left.

381
00:27:36,598 --> 00:27:40,477
After that, it's every man for himself.

382
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:04,276
Still with me, brat?

383
00:28:07,238 --> 00:28:09,149
Don't be a sucker.

384
00:28:10,638 --> 00:28:13,027
A good night's rest will do you
a lot of good.

385
00:28:13,198 --> 00:28:15,268
Besides, you got nothing to worry about.

386
00:28:15,438 --> 00:28:19,192
The walls of Jericho will protect you
from the big bad wolf.

387
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,872
"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
The big bad wolf

388
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:38,312
"The big bad wolf

389
00:28:38,518 --> 00:28:43,467
"She's afraid of the big bad wolf
Tra, la, la, la, la"

390
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,713
Would you mind please,
putting out the light?

391
00:28:48,878 --> 00:28:50,277
No, not at all.

392
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:31,791
I wish you'd take those things
off the walls of Jericho.

393
00:29:31,878 --> 00:29:33,516
Excuse me.

394
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:00,710
By the way, what's your name?

395
00:30:02,158 --> 00:30:03,352
What's that?

396
00:30:03,438 --> 00:30:05,235
Who are you?

397
00:30:06,158 --> 00:30:07,477
Who, me?

398
00:30:08,678 --> 00:30:11,317
I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night.

399
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:15,593
I'm the soft morning breeze
that caresses your lovely face.

400
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,354
You've got a name, haven't you?

401
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:21,427
Yeah, I got a name. Peter Warne.

402
00:30:22,118 --> 00:30:23,870
Peter Warne.

403
00:30:24,918 --> 00:30:26,510
I don't like it.

404
00:30:26,678 --> 00:30:30,557
Don't let it bother you.
You're giving it back to me in the morning.

405
00:30:32,718 --> 00:30:34,549
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne.

406
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:37,472
The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Warne.

407
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:00,031
- Another message, sir.
- What is it? What is it?

408
00:31:00,118 --> 00:31:02,916
It's from Charleston.
"Checking every northbound train.

409
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:05,427
"Also assigned 20 operators
to watch main highways.

410
00:31:05,518 --> 00:31:08,237
"No sign of her yet.
Will continue to do all possible.

411
00:31:08,318 --> 00:31:10,149
"Signed, Lovington Detective Agency."

412
00:31:10,438 --> 00:31:12,474
It's just the same as all the others.

413
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,757
- Yes, sir?
- I said I was in a hurry to get to New York.

414
00:31:15,838 --> 00:31:18,068
- What are we crawling for?
- I got it wide open.

415
00:31:18,158 --> 00:31:20,228
- All right, step on it.
- Yes, sir.

416
00:31:20,318 --> 00:31:21,956
I hope she's all right.

417
00:31:22,078 --> 00:31:25,912
All right? Of course, she's all right.
What could happen to her?

418
00:31:26,478 --> 00:31:28,992
- Nothing, sir.
- Then shut up about it.

419
00:31:52,358 --> 00:31:53,757
Hello?

420
00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:57,471
Hey, mister.

421
00:32:01,438 --> 00:32:02,757
Hello.

422
00:32:03,118 --> 00:32:04,949
What's the matter, you not up yet?

423
00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:07,626
- What time is it?
- 8:00. Here.

424
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,794
It's a toothbrush, thanks.

425
00:32:12,438 --> 00:32:14,906
My dress, you had it pressed.

426
00:32:15,478 --> 00:32:17,514
Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon.

427
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:19,788
You sweet thing.
Where'd you get it pressed?

428
00:32:19,878 --> 00:32:22,551
I'll count to 10.
If you're not out of bed by then...

429
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:24,276
...l'll drag you out myself.

430
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:27,475
- One, two, three, four, five...
- I really think you would!

431
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:30,231
I'm out! I'm out!

432
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:33,757
You'll find the showers
just behind the second cottage.

433
00:32:35,758 --> 00:32:36,986
Outside?

434
00:32:37,478 --> 00:32:39,548
All the best homes have them outside.

435
00:32:42,358 --> 00:32:44,474
I can't go out like this.

436
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:47,358
- Like what?
- Like this. I have no robe.

437
00:32:47,438 --> 00:32:49,076
Here, use mine.

438
00:32:50,318 --> 00:32:51,512
Thanks.

439
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:52,753
Make it snappy.

440
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:55,147
Wait, it's not my fault. You got the sleeve.

441
00:32:55,398 --> 00:32:58,117
- Here are my puppets.
- Thanks.

442
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:03,077
Where'd you say the showers were?

443
00:33:03,158 --> 00:33:04,386
Here's a towel.

444
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:06,992
Thank you.

445
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:10,748
You're kind of little, aren't you?

446
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:12,147
Where's the shower?

447
00:33:12,238 --> 00:33:14,798
Your hair's cute like that.
You should never comb it.

448
00:33:14,918 --> 00:33:16,670
I'll find it myself.

449
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:49,830
Are the showers in there?

450
00:33:49,918 --> 00:33:51,636
They ain't out here.

451
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:53,232
Thank you.

452
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:59,308
Can't a body have a little privacy
around here?

453
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:07,788
You want a shower around here,
you'll stand in line.

454
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:20,277
Hi, sister. You remember me, Shapeley?

455
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:22,270
Say, I'm sorry about last night.

456
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:25,794
Didn't know you was married to that guy.
You should've told me right off.

457
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,830
High time you got back.

458
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:39,386
I met some very interesting women
at the showers.

459
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:42,874
We got chatting about this and that.
You know how time flies.

460
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:47,549
Come on. Sit down.

461
00:34:50,078 --> 00:34:51,830
My, my. Scrambled eggs.

462
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:57,313
Egg. One egg. One donut, black coffee.
That's your ration till lunch.

463
00:34:57,878 --> 00:34:58,833
Any complaints?

464
00:34:58,918 --> 00:35:00,317
No. No complaints.

465
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:03,629
I'd have cream for your coffee,
but I'd be buying a whole pint.

466
00:35:03,758 --> 00:35:05,555
You don't have to apologise to me.

467
00:35:05,638 --> 00:35:07,833
You don't know how much
I appreciate all this.

468
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:10,711
What makes you so disgustingly
cheerful this morning?

469
00:35:11,118 --> 00:35:12,233
Must be the spring.

470
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,469
I thought maybe "believe you me"
told you some more snappy stories.

471
00:35:15,558 --> 00:35:19,710
No. He apologised for last night.
Said he didn't know we were married.

472
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:22,790
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be.

473
00:35:24,878 --> 00:35:26,436
- Donut?
- Thanks.

474
00:35:28,758 --> 00:35:30,874
You think this whole business is silly?

475
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,311
Running away and all.

476
00:35:32,398 --> 00:35:34,036
No. Makes too good a story.

477
00:35:34,118 --> 00:35:37,554
Yes, you do.
You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat.

478
00:35:37,758 --> 00:35:40,192
Perhaps I am.
Although, I don't see how I can be.

479
00:35:40,278 --> 00:35:42,508
Spoiled people are used to
having their way.

480
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,236
I never have. On the contrary.

481
00:35:44,318 --> 00:35:48,277
I've always been told what to do and how
to do it and when and with whom.

482
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:52,554
Can you believe, this is the first time
I've ever been alone with a man?

483
00:35:52,678 --> 00:35:53,747
Yeah.

484
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:55,908
It's a wonder I'm not panic-stricken.

485
00:35:55,998 --> 00:35:57,795
You're doing all right.

486
00:35:57,998 --> 00:35:58,987
Thanks.

487
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:06,554
Nurses, governesses, chaperones,
even bodyguards. It's been a lot of fun.

488
00:36:06,638 --> 00:36:08,947
One consolation,
you can never get lonesome.

489
00:36:09,638 --> 00:36:14,109
It has its moments. It's become a sort of
game, trying to outwit father's detectives.

490
00:36:14,478 --> 00:36:17,993
I did once. Actually went shopping
without a bodyguard.

491
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:20,792
It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral.

492
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:23,790
It didn't last long,
they found me in a department store.

493
00:36:23,878 --> 00:36:27,837
I was so mad, I ran out the back way
and jumped into the first car I saw.

494
00:36:28,038 --> 00:36:29,266
Guess who was in it?

495
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:30,632
Santa Claus?

496
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:31,947
Ghandi?

497
00:36:32,038 --> 00:36:33,949
King Westley was in it.

498
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:37,035
- Is that how you met him?
- Yes.

499
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:40,151
We rode around all afternoon.
Father was frantic.

500
00:36:40,238 --> 00:36:43,230
By 6:00,
he was having all the rivers dragged.

501
00:36:45,238 --> 00:36:47,957
Where'd you learn to dunk,
in finishing school?

502
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:50,427
Now don't you start telling me
I shouldn't dunk.

503
00:36:50,518 --> 00:36:52,793
Of course you shouldn't.
You don't know how.

504
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:57,235
Dunking is an art. Don't let it soak so long.
A dip and sock, into your mouth.

505
00:36:57,318 --> 00:36:59,957
You leave it in too long,
it gets soft and falls off.

506
00:37:00,038 --> 00:37:03,474
It's all a matter of timing.
I'll write a book about it.

507
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:04,786
Thanks, professor.

508
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:08,467
Just goes to show you. $20 million,
and you don't know how to dunk.

509
00:37:08,678 --> 00:37:11,636
I'd change places with
a plumber's daughter any day.

510
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:15,074
How do I know who you are?
I never saw you before.

511
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,590
You can't go around bothering my tenants.
There's no girl by that name here.

512
00:37:19,758 --> 00:37:21,908
How do I know you're detectives?

513
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:23,989
Show him your credentials, Mac.

514
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:27,548
Detectives.

515
00:37:28,638 --> 00:37:31,550
That's father at work. Peter, what'll I do?

516
00:37:31,638 --> 00:37:34,277
Maybe I can jump out of the window.
They won't see me.

517
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:35,791
Get yourself all mussed up.

518
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,551
Get your hair down over your eyes
and undo your buttons.

519
00:37:39,678 --> 00:37:42,146
I got a letter from Aunt Bella last week.

520
00:37:42,238 --> 00:37:45,594
She said if we don't stop over
in Wilkes-Barre, she'll never forgive us.

521
00:37:45,678 --> 00:37:47,236
What are you talking about?

522
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:50,750
The baby's due next month.
They want us to come.

523
00:37:51,158 --> 00:37:54,867
She saw your sister on the street
the other day. Said she's looking swell.

524
00:37:58,078 --> 00:37:59,193
Come in.

525
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:01,917
I hope Aunt Bella has a boy, don't you?

526
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:05,877
Grandma says it's gonna be a girl.
She hasn't missed calling one in years.

527
00:38:06,638 --> 00:38:08,390
Man here to see you, sweetheart.

528
00:38:08,478 --> 00:38:10,196
Who, me? You wanna see me?

529
00:38:10,278 --> 00:38:11,597
What's your name?

530
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,990
- Are you addressing me?
- Yeah. What's your name?

531
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:17,996
Wait a minute.
That's my wife you're talking to.

532
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:20,747
What do you mean coming here?
What do you want?

533
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:24,035
- We're looking for somebody.
- Fine, but don't come busting in here.

534
00:38:24,118 --> 00:38:25,153
This isn't a public park.

535
00:38:25,238 --> 00:38:26,956
I got news to take a sock at you.

536
00:38:27,078 --> 00:38:29,034
- Take it easy.
- The men are detectives.

537
00:38:29,118 --> 00:38:31,188
Even if they're the
whole police department...

538
00:38:31,278 --> 00:38:33,428
...they can't bust in here,
questioning my wife.

539
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:36,157
Don't get so excited.
He asked you a simple question.

540
00:38:36,238 --> 00:38:40,834
Is that so? How many times
have I told you not to butt in?

541
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:43,955
You don't have to lose your temper!

542
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:46,154
As usual. Every time I try to protect you.

543
00:38:46,238 --> 00:38:49,196
At the elks dance,
when that big Swede hit on you.

544
00:38:49,278 --> 00:38:51,473
He did not! I told you a million times.

545
00:38:51,558 --> 00:38:54,197
He kept pawing you
all over the dance floor.

546
00:38:54,278 --> 00:38:55,836
He didn't. You were drunk.

547
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,636
Nuts! Just like your old man.

548
00:38:57,718 --> 00:39:00,312
Once a plumber's daughter,
always a plumber's daughter.

549
00:39:00,398 --> 00:39:02,434
There ain't an ounce of
brains in your family.

550
00:39:02,518 --> 00:39:04,236
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough!

551
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:07,270
- Shut up!
- You see what you've done?

552
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:11,027
Sorry, but you see,
we've gotta check up on everybody.

553
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:13,188
We're looking for a girl
named Ellen Andrews.

554
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:15,149
Daughter of that big Wall Street mogul.

555
00:39:15,238 --> 00:39:17,627
Too bad you're not looking for
a plumber's daughter.

556
00:39:17,718 --> 00:39:19,151
Quit bawling!

557
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:22,914
I told you they were a perfectly
nice married couple.

558
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:37,994
You weren't bad, jumping in like that.

559
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:40,672
- You've got a brain.
- You're not so bad, yourself.

560
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:42,589
We could start a two-people
stock company.

561
00:39:42,678 --> 00:39:45,317
Things get tough,
we'll play to small town auditoriums.

562
00:39:45,398 --> 00:39:47,593
We'll call this one, "The Great Deception."

563
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:49,987
What about "Cinderella" or
a real hot love story?

564
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:51,193
No, too mushy.

565
00:39:51,278 --> 00:39:52,996
I like mushy stuff.

566
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:55,151
Quit bawling!

567
00:39:55,998 --> 00:39:57,511
Bus leaves in five minutes!

568
00:39:57,638 --> 00:39:59,788
- What?
- Your bus leaves in five minutes.

569
00:39:59,878 --> 00:40:02,517
Holy smoke, we're not even packed yet.

570
00:40:07,118 --> 00:40:09,586
I'm starting to think
you couldn't find your way home.

571
00:40:09,678 --> 00:40:10,906
This is the last session...

572
00:40:11,198 --> 00:40:12,836
- Yeah?
- Telegram for you.

573
00:40:12,918 --> 00:40:15,273
- Bring it in.
- Another wire from Peter Warne.

574
00:40:15,598 --> 00:40:19,910
Warne? Throw it in the wastebasket.
Wait a minute. What does it say?

575
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:24,314
"Have I got a story. Stop.
It's getting hotter and hotter. Stop.

576
00:40:24,598 --> 00:40:26,395
"Hope you're the same."

577
00:40:28,038 --> 00:40:29,517
- Collect?
- Yes.

578
00:40:29,598 --> 00:40:32,192
- Lf you accept another one, you're fired.
- Yes, sir.

579
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:34,508
And that gives me an idea for all of you.

580
00:40:34,998 --> 00:40:36,750
I want action, Lovington, action.

581
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:39,636
- We can't do the impossible.
- It isn't impossible.

582
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:42,391
She's somewhere between here and Miami.
I want her found.

583
00:40:42,518 --> 00:40:45,078
- I put extra men on, the whole way.
- That's not enough.

584
00:40:45,158 --> 00:40:46,432
Send in Clark and Brown.

585
00:40:46,518 --> 00:40:48,873
- You sure she isn't with King Westley?
- No.

586
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:51,671
He's being trailed 24 hours a day.

587
00:40:51,798 --> 00:40:54,232
He can't even get a phone call
we don't know about.

588
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,310
I'm worried. After all,
something might have happened to her.

589
00:40:57,398 --> 00:40:58,433
I don't think so.

590
00:40:58,518 --> 00:41:00,509
Brown, arrange a radio broadcast.

591
00:41:00,598 --> 00:41:02,793
Coast-to-coast hook up.
Offer a reward of...

592
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:05,108
...$10,000 for information
on her whereabouts.

593
00:41:05,678 --> 00:41:07,987
Clark, send the story
to all of the newspapers.

594
00:41:08,118 --> 00:41:10,678
Some out-of-town papers
may not have a picture of her.

595
00:41:10,758 --> 00:41:13,989
Wire this to them.
I want the story to break right away.

596
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:16,077
Now we'll get some action!

597
00:41:50,478 --> 00:41:51,911
Fine, that's fine.

598
00:41:52,998 --> 00:41:57,196
You know that one
about the man who flew on the trapeze?

599
00:41:57,838 --> 00:41:59,237
Yeah.

600
00:42:04,278 --> 00:42:08,066
"Once I was happy
but now I'm forlorn

601
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:11,668
"Like an old coat
that is tattered and torn

602
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:15,515
"Left in this wide world
to weep and to mourn

603
00:42:16,278 --> 00:42:19,475
"Betrayed by a maid in her teens

604
00:42:19,918 --> 00:42:22,830
"This maid that I loved
she was handsome

605
00:42:23,678 --> 00:42:27,193
"And I tried all I knew how to please

606
00:42:27,598 --> 00:42:30,988
"But I never could please her
one-quarter so well

607
00:42:31,078 --> 00:42:34,991
"As the man on the flying trapeze

608
00:42:35,118 --> 00:42:38,667
"He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

609
00:42:38,878 --> 00:42:42,473
"The daring young man
on the flying trapeze

610
00:42:42,638 --> 00:42:46,153
"His actions are graceful,
all the girls he does please

611
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:49,908
"And my love he has stolen away"

612
00:42:56,318 --> 00:42:58,388
I know the second verse there.

613
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:04,027
"Now he'd play with a miss
like a cat with a mouse

614
00:43:04,478 --> 00:43:07,595
"His eyes would undress
every girl in the house

615
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:15,148
"Perhaps he is better described as a louse
And still people came just the same

616
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,033
"Now he smiles from the bar
on the people below

617
00:43:19,198 --> 00:43:22,190
"And one night he smiled on my love

618
00:43:23,078 --> 00:43:24,670
"She blew him a kiss

619
00:43:24,918 --> 00:43:30,709
"And she hollered bravo
And he hung by his schnozzle from above

620
00:43:30,878 --> 00:43:34,234
"He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

621
00:43:34,638 --> 00:43:39,712
"Daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful

622
00:43:39,798 --> 00:43:45,714
"All the girls he does please
And my love he has stolen away"

623
00:43:48,078 --> 00:43:50,228
Do you mind if I take the third one?

624
00:43:55,398 --> 00:43:58,868
"I wept and I whimpered
I simpered for weeks

625
00:43:59,038 --> 00:44:02,508
"While she spent her time
with the circus' freaks

626
00:44:02,718 --> 00:44:06,393
"The tears were like hailstones
that rolled down my cheeks

627
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:09,510
"Alas, Alack and Alaska

628
00:44:10,038 --> 00:44:13,394
"I went to this fellow
the villain, and I said

629
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:16,828
"I'll see that you get your deserts

630
00:44:16,998 --> 00:44:20,354
"His thumb to his nose
he put up with a sneer

631
00:44:20,638 --> 00:44:24,108
"He sneered once again and said no

632
00:44:24,238 --> 00:44:27,628
"He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

633
00:44:27,758 --> 00:44:30,716
"That daring young man
on the flying trapeze

634
00:44:31,398 --> 00:44:34,834
"His actions are graceful
The girls he does please

635
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:38,473
"My love he has stolen away"

636
00:44:45,798 --> 00:44:48,710
- Everybody keep your seats.
- Thank the man for me, Peter.

637
00:44:48,798 --> 00:44:52,108
It's the first comfortable position
I've been in all night.

638
00:44:52,918 --> 00:44:56,228
"She flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

639
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,876
"The daring young..."

640
00:44:59,438 --> 00:45:02,077
What's the matter with you?
Somebody help.

641
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,716
Something happened to her.

642
00:45:03,798 --> 00:45:05,390
Look how pale she is.

643
00:45:13,398 --> 00:45:15,389
Let's give her a chance to snap out of it.

644
00:45:15,558 --> 00:45:17,708
Don't worry. She'll be all right.

645
00:45:19,558 --> 00:45:22,152
We ain't ate nothing since yesterday.

646
00:45:24,038 --> 00:45:25,869
What happened to your money?

647
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:30,236
Ma spent it all on the tickets.
We didn't know it was gonna be so much.

648
00:45:31,238 --> 00:45:33,308
We shouldn't have come, I guess.

649
00:45:33,918 --> 00:45:36,910
But Ma said there was a job
waiting for her in New York...

650
00:45:36,998 --> 00:45:39,466
...and if we didn't go, she might lose it.

651
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:47,672
She'll be all right
when she's had something to eat.

652
00:45:47,998 --> 00:45:51,513
The next time we come to,
you buy some food. Now come on.

653
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:55,035
I shouldn't ought to take this.
Ma'll get mad.

654
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:58,116
Don't tell her.
You don't want her to get sick again.

655
00:45:58,198 --> 00:46:00,075
No, but you might need it.

656
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,034
Come on.

657
00:46:01,118 --> 00:46:02,153
I got millions.

658
00:46:02,238 --> 00:46:03,034
Here.

659
00:46:03,158 --> 00:46:05,228
- Thanks.
- Come on, go back.

660
00:46:22,118 --> 00:46:23,676
Better phone for some help.

661
00:46:23,758 --> 00:46:26,670
Go phone if you want to.
The nearest town is 10 miles away.

662
00:46:26,798 --> 00:46:27,913
Yeah?

663
00:46:28,158 --> 00:46:31,434
Say, buddy.
Like to take a look at my paper?

664
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:36,387
Travelling like this, you lose track
of what's going on in the world.

665
00:46:36,558 --> 00:46:38,708
Take that story there, for instance.

666
00:46:40,078 --> 00:46:42,467
If I was to see that dame,
you know what I'd do?

667
00:46:42,598 --> 00:46:43,633
No.

668
00:46:43,758 --> 00:46:45,794
I'd go fifty-fifty with you.

669
00:46:46,278 --> 00:46:47,074
Why?

670
00:46:47,158 --> 00:46:48,876
Because I don't believe in hogging.

671
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:52,109
A bird that figures that way
always ends up behind the eight ball.

672
00:46:52,198 --> 00:46:53,870
That's what I always say.

673
00:46:56,878 --> 00:46:58,436
What's on your mind?

674
00:46:58,598 --> 00:47:00,793
Five G's or I crab the works.

675
00:47:06,878 --> 00:47:09,551
Let's get away from here
and talk this over privately.

676
00:47:09,638 --> 00:47:12,072
I knew she wasn't your wife all the time.

677
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:18,997
Lucky thing, my running into you.
Just the man I need.

678
00:47:19,078 --> 00:47:22,229
- You made no mistake, believe me.
- I can use a smart guy like you.

679
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:25,754
- When you're talking to old man Shapeley...
- Can you make a gat?

680
00:47:26,198 --> 00:47:26,994
Huh?

681
00:47:27,398 --> 00:47:29,389
A gat. A rod.

682
00:47:29,998 --> 00:47:31,829
- Got any fireworks on you?
- No.

683
00:47:33,038 --> 00:47:36,917
I got a couple of machine guns
in my suitcase. I'll give you one of them.

684
00:47:36,998 --> 00:47:39,990
May have trouble up north.
Have to shoot it out with the cops.

685
00:47:40,078 --> 00:47:43,388
If you manage, those five G's
are as good as in the bag. Maybe more.

686
00:47:43,478 --> 00:47:45,673
I'll talk to the Killer, he'll take care of you.

687
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:46,748
Killer?

688
00:47:46,878 --> 00:47:49,472
Yeah. The big boy. The boss of the outfit.

689
00:47:49,918 --> 00:47:51,988
You're not kidnapping her, are you?

690
00:47:52,118 --> 00:47:55,713
What else, stupid? You don't think
we're after that penny-ante reward?

691
00:47:55,798 --> 00:47:58,437
$10, 000? Chicken feed.

692
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:02,194
Now listen, we're holding that dame
for a million smackers.

693
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:05,953
Say, I didn't know it was anything like this.
You see, I've got...

694
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:08,627
What's the matter? You getting yellow?

695
00:48:08,718 --> 00:48:12,028
I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids.
I can't afford to get...

696
00:48:12,198 --> 00:48:14,428
Pipe down your mug before I...

697
00:48:14,998 --> 00:48:17,637
What are you trying to do,
tell the whole world about it?

698
00:48:17,718 --> 00:48:20,790
Listen, you're into this thing
and you're staying in, get me?

699
00:48:20,878 --> 00:48:22,357
You know too much.

700
00:48:22,438 --> 00:48:24,269
I won't say anything, honest I won't.

701
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:27,236
How do I know that?
I got a notion to plug you.

702
00:48:27,478 --> 00:48:31,391
- Why should I take a chance with you?
- Trust me, mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.

703
00:48:31,478 --> 00:48:32,433
Yeah?

704
00:48:34,398 --> 00:48:35,877
What's your name?

705
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:37,477
Oscar Shapeley.

706
00:48:37,678 --> 00:48:40,033
- Where do you live?
- Orange, New Jersey.

707
00:48:40,478 --> 00:48:42,070
Got a couple of kids?

708
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:45,469
Yes, sir. Just babies.
A little golden-haired girl.

709
00:48:45,558 --> 00:48:48,118
- You love them, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

710
00:48:48,278 --> 00:48:50,075
You wouldn't. You're not thinking of...

711
00:48:50,158 --> 00:48:52,592
- You keep your trap shut, all right?
- Sure.

712
00:48:52,878 --> 00:48:55,346
- Lf you don't...
- I'll keep my trap shut. I will.

713
00:48:55,438 --> 00:48:57,315
You ever hear of Bugs Dooley?

714
00:48:57,798 --> 00:48:59,151
Bugs Dooley? No.

715
00:48:59,238 --> 00:49:02,628
He was a nice guy, just like you.
And he made a big mistake one day.

716
00:49:02,758 --> 00:49:04,237
Got a little too talkative.

717
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:06,036
- You know what happened to his kid?
- No.

718
00:49:06,118 --> 00:49:09,508
I can't tell you. But when Bugs heard
about it he blew his brains out.

719
00:49:09,878 --> 00:49:11,311
That's terrible.

720
00:49:11,878 --> 00:49:14,836
He had it coming to him.
He talked too much. I never talk.

721
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:17,268
I never say a word. Word of honour.

722
00:49:17,478 --> 00:49:19,946
I wouldn't want anything
to happen to my kids.

723
00:49:20,038 --> 00:49:22,268
Okay. Just remember that.

724
00:49:23,478 --> 00:49:24,433
Now beat it.

725
00:49:24,598 --> 00:49:28,511
Sure, mister. Thanks.
I always knew you guys were...

726
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:31,352
Come on, scram.
And stay away from that bus.

727
00:49:31,478 --> 00:49:33,594
Sure. Anything you say.

728
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:36,870
- You wouldn't shoot me in the back?
- Lf you don't beat it...

729
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:38,152
I'm going.

730
00:49:52,478 --> 00:49:54,514
What's wrong?
Why do we have to leave the bus?

731
00:49:54,598 --> 00:49:56,429
Come on. Don't ask so many questions.

732
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:58,037
Why?

733
00:50:04,358 --> 00:50:07,350
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have
frightened him like that.

734
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:11,477
At the rate he's going, he's probably
crossed two state lines by this time.

735
00:50:12,198 --> 00:50:14,428
Why did we have to leave the bus?

736
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:18,068
When Shapeley stops running,
he's going to start thinking, isn't he?

737
00:50:19,878 --> 00:50:21,914
I've been doing a little thinking myself.

738
00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:25,471
The next town we come to,
you better wire your father.

739
00:50:25,558 --> 00:50:27,469
What's the matter, are you weakening?

740
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:32,234
No. I was just thinking of you.
A starvation diet may not agree with you.

741
00:50:32,398 --> 00:50:34,514
Did you give that child all your money?

742
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:37,158
I gave him nothing.
You were the big-hearted gal.

743
00:50:37,238 --> 00:50:39,433
All the money I had was that ten spot.

744
00:50:39,558 --> 00:50:42,311
So I've been thinking
you better wire your father.

745
00:50:42,598 --> 00:50:46,716
No, sir. I started out for New York
and I'm going to get there...

746
00:50:46,798 --> 00:50:49,107
...if I have to starve all the way.

747
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:50,234
Okay.

748
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:54,668
What is this strange power
this man Westley has over you women?

749
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:56,237
Here, take these.

750
00:50:56,838 --> 00:50:59,511
- Hold on to them. Get up on that log.
- That?

751
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,156
Get up on the log.

752
00:51:11,398 --> 00:51:13,275
I wish you'd stop being playful.

753
00:51:13,398 --> 00:51:18,188
So sorry. You know, this is the first time
in years I've ridden piggyback.

754
00:51:18,758 --> 00:51:20,077
This isn't piggyback.

755
00:51:20,158 --> 00:51:22,228
- Of course it is.
- You're crazy.

756
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,587
I remember distinctly my father
taking me for a piggyback ride.

757
00:51:26,678 --> 00:51:28,555
- And he carried you like this?
- Yes.

758
00:51:28,638 --> 00:51:31,516
Your father didn't know beans
about piggyback riding.

759
00:51:31,918 --> 00:51:35,831
My uncle has four children.
I've seen them ride piggyback.

760
00:51:35,918 --> 00:51:38,637
I'll bet there isn't a good
piggyback rider in your family.

761
00:51:38,718 --> 00:51:41,471
I never knew a rich man
who could piggyback ride.

762
00:51:42,518 --> 00:51:44,110
You're prejudiced.

763
00:51:45,078 --> 00:51:47,638
Show me a good piggy backer.
I'll show you a real human.

764
00:51:47,718 --> 00:51:50,790
Take Abraham Lincoln for instance.
A natural born piggy backer.

765
00:51:50,878 --> 00:51:54,268
Where do you get off with
that stuffed-shirt family of yours?

766
00:51:55,878 --> 00:51:58,346
My father was a great piggy backer.

767
00:51:59,718 --> 00:52:01,390
Here, hold this a minute.

768
00:52:05,118 --> 00:52:06,437
Thank you.

769
00:52:11,278 --> 00:52:14,554
How long does this keep up?
My feet are killing me.

770
00:52:27,918 --> 00:52:29,909
This looks like the best spot.

771
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:32,826
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?

772
00:52:32,998 --> 00:52:36,388
I don't know about you,
but I'm going to give a good imitation of it.

773
00:52:36,518 --> 00:52:37,553
Peter?

774
00:52:37,798 --> 00:52:38,913
What?

775
00:52:39,518 --> 00:52:41,236
I'm awfully hungry.

776
00:52:41,478 --> 00:52:42,911
It's just your imagination.

777
00:52:43,038 --> 00:52:44,437
No it isn't.

778
00:52:44,758 --> 00:52:47,431
I'm hungry and scared.

779
00:52:47,758 --> 00:52:50,318
You can't be hungry
and scared both at the same time.

780
00:52:50,398 --> 00:52:51,717
Well, I am.

781
00:52:51,798 --> 00:52:54,073
If you're scared,
it scares the hunger out of you.

782
00:52:54,158 --> 00:52:56,433
Not if you're more hungry than scared.

783
00:52:56,638 --> 00:52:59,436
All right, you win. Let's forget about it.

784
00:53:01,758 --> 00:53:04,147
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.

785
00:53:04,758 --> 00:53:08,387
Holy smoke!
Why did I ever get mixed up with you?

786
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:12,117
If I had any sense,
I'd be in New York by this time.

787
00:53:12,598 --> 00:53:14,236
What about your story?

788
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:16,957
Taking a married woman
back to her husband.

789
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:23,116
I turned out to be the prize sucker.

790
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:26,952
All right, come on. Your bed's all ready.

791
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:30,108
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.

792
00:53:30,198 --> 00:53:31,711
- Then take them off.
- What?

793
00:53:31,798 --> 00:53:35,871
All right, don't take them off.
Do what you please, but shut up about it.

794
00:54:05,198 --> 00:54:07,871
You're becoming awfully
disagreeable lately.

795
00:54:08,158 --> 00:54:11,389
You just snap my head off
every time I open my mouth.

796
00:54:14,238 --> 00:54:17,435
If being with me is so distasteful to you,
you can leave.

797
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:21,434
You can leave any time you see fit.

798
00:54:22,518 --> 00:54:24,554
Nobody's holding you here.

799
00:54:25,878 --> 00:54:27,675
I can get along.

800
00:54:33,158 --> 00:54:34,386
Peter?

801
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:38,107
Peter!

802
00:54:46,558 --> 00:54:48,594
- What's the matter?
- I was so scared!

803
00:54:48,678 --> 00:54:52,307
What's got into you? I left for a minute
to find you something to eat.

804
00:54:52,398 --> 00:54:53,513
I know but...

805
00:54:53,638 --> 00:54:55,594
Here, eat your head off.

806
00:54:55,718 --> 00:54:57,117
I don't want it now.

807
00:54:57,198 --> 00:54:59,666
- I thought you said you were hungry.
- I was, but...

808
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:01,026
But what?

809
00:55:01,118 --> 00:55:03,586
I was so scared, it scared the hunger...

810
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,909
Holy jumping catfish.
You drive a guy crazy.

811
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:50,354
It's liable to get chilly before morning.

812
00:55:50,558 --> 00:55:52,071
Better use this.

813
00:56:26,878 --> 00:56:28,357
What are you thinking about?

814
00:56:30,238 --> 00:56:32,798
By a strange coincidence,
I was thinking of you.

815
00:56:34,078 --> 00:56:35,989
- Really?
- Yeah.

816
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:40,515
I was just wondering what makes
dames like you so dizzy.

817
00:57:13,438 --> 00:57:15,668
What did you say
we're supposed to be doing?

818
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:16,947
Hitchhiking.

819
00:57:19,238 --> 00:57:22,753
You've given me a very good example
of the hiking.

820
00:57:23,078 --> 00:57:25,069
Where does the hitching come in?

821
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:27,547
It's a little early yet. No cars out.

822
00:57:29,878 --> 00:57:31,709
If it's the same to you...

823
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:35,870
...l'm going to sit right here
and wait until they come.

824
00:57:46,278 --> 00:57:47,597
You got a toothpick?

825
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:50,306
- What's the matter?
- I got hay in my teeth.

826
00:57:50,438 --> 00:57:53,828
No, I haven't got a toothpick.
Here, I got a penknife, though.

827
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:55,353
Now hold still.

828
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:57,872
- Be careful.
- All right. Where is it?

829
00:57:59,318 --> 00:58:00,956
All right, now hold still.

830
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:04,115
Here. Get it?

831
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:05,992
Thanks.

832
00:58:06,398 --> 00:58:09,868
You should have swallowed that.
You won't have any breakfast, you know?

833
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:11,630
You needn't rub it in.

834
00:58:15,638 --> 00:58:17,993
- What are you eating?
- Carrots.

835
00:58:18,118 --> 00:58:20,348
- Raw?
- Want one?

836
00:58:20,558 --> 00:58:24,631
No. Why didn't you get me
something I could eat?

837
00:58:24,718 --> 00:58:28,711
That's right, I forgot. The idea
of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews.

838
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:32,030
You don't think I'm going around
panhandling for you, do you?

839
00:58:32,118 --> 00:58:34,632
Have one of these.
Best thing for you, carrots.

840
00:58:34,718 --> 00:58:36,709
I hate the horrid things.

841
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:42,148
I wish you wouldn't talk so much.
Now we let a car get away.

842
00:58:42,278 --> 00:58:44,587
And suppose nobody stops for us?

843
00:58:44,758 --> 00:58:48,114
They'll stop all right. It's a matter
of knowing how to handle them.

844
00:58:48,198 --> 00:58:49,790
And you're an expert I suppose.

845
00:58:49,918 --> 00:58:53,593
Expert. And I'll write a book
about it. Call it "The Hitchhiker's Hail."

846
00:58:53,678 --> 00:58:56,431
There's no end to your accomplishments,
is there?

847
00:58:56,798 --> 00:58:58,470
- You think it's simple?
- No.

848
00:58:58,678 --> 00:59:01,636
Well, it is simple.
It's all in that old thumb, see?

849
00:59:01,918 --> 00:59:04,830
Some people do it like this. Or like this.

850
00:59:06,278 --> 00:59:07,950
All wrong. Never get anywhere.

851
00:59:08,038 --> 00:59:09,073
The poor things.

852
00:59:09,158 --> 00:59:12,753
But that old thumb never fails.
It's all a matter of how you do it, though.

853
00:59:12,878 --> 00:59:15,233
Now you take No. 1, for instance.

854
00:59:15,438 --> 00:59:18,908
That's a short jerky movement, like this.
That shows independence.

855
00:59:18,998 --> 00:59:21,558
You don't care if they stop or not.
You got money.

856
00:59:21,638 --> 00:59:24,755
- Clever.
- No. 2, that's a little wider movement.

857
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:27,068
Smile goes with this one, like this.

858
00:59:28,558 --> 00:59:31,630
That means you got a brand-new story
about the farmer's daughter.

859
00:59:33,118 --> 00:59:35,188
You figured that out all by yourself?

860
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:38,828
That's nothing. No. 3, that's a pip.
That's the pitiful one.

861
00:59:38,918 --> 00:59:41,478
When you're broke and hungry,
everything looks black.

862
00:59:41,558 --> 00:59:45,267
It's a long sweeping movement like this.
Gotta follow through, though.

863
00:59:46,198 --> 00:59:47,790
That's amazing.

864
00:59:47,998 --> 00:59:51,195
But it's no good,
if you haven't got a long face to go with it.

865
00:59:51,278 --> 00:59:52,552
Here comes a car.

866
00:59:52,638 --> 00:59:55,106
Okay. Now watch me.
I'm gonna use No. 1.

867
00:59:55,198 --> 00:59:58,270
Keep your eye on that thumb, baby,
and see what happens.

868
01:00:03,478 --> 01:00:05,787
I still got my eye on the thumb.

869
01:00:06,038 --> 01:00:08,791
Something must have gone wrong.
I'll try No. 2.

870
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:12,037
When you get to 100, wake me up.

871
01:00:50,158 --> 01:00:52,877
I don't think I'll write that book after all.

872
01:00:53,198 --> 01:00:55,348
Think of all the fun you had, though.

873
01:00:56,998 --> 01:00:58,795
You mind if I try?

874
01:00:59,558 --> 01:01:00,547
You?

875
01:01:01,718 --> 01:01:03,515
Don't make me laugh.

876
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:08,308
You're such a smart aleck.
Nobody knows anything but you.

877
01:01:08,878 --> 01:01:11,631
I'll stop a car and I won't use my thumb.

878
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:13,671
What are you gonna do?

879
01:01:14,078 --> 01:01:15,909
It's a system all my own.

880
01:01:35,678 --> 01:01:38,272
Aren't you going to give me a little credit?

881
01:01:38,478 --> 01:01:39,752
What for?

882
01:01:41,078 --> 01:01:44,707
I proved once and for all that
the limb is mightier than the thumb.

883
01:01:45,278 --> 01:01:48,748
Why didn't you take off all your clothes?
You could have stopped 40 cars.

884
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:51,193
I'll remember that when we need 40 cars.

885
01:01:51,918 --> 01:01:55,388
So, you're just married?
That's pretty good.

886
01:01:55,598 --> 01:02:00,592
But if I was young, that's the way
I'd spend my honeymoon. Hitchhiking.

887
01:02:00,838 --> 01:02:04,956
Yes, sir. "Hitchhiking down the highway

888
01:02:05,038 --> 01:02:08,872
"Of love on a honeymoon

889
01:02:09,038 --> 01:02:11,757
"Hitchhiking down the highway, down"

890
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:25,428
Aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?

891
01:02:25,558 --> 01:02:27,549
Tonsil? Me? No.

892
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:32,915
Me burn a tonsil? "My tonsils won't burn"

893
01:02:34,078 --> 01:02:36,433
All right, let it go.

894
01:02:36,638 --> 01:02:37,832
"Turn"

895
01:02:47,038 --> 01:02:48,266
How about a bite to eat?

896
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:50,866
- That would be lovely.
- No thanks, we're not hungry.

897
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:53,028
Young people in love are never hungry.

898
01:02:53,118 --> 01:02:53,914
No.

899
01:02:53,998 --> 01:02:56,671
"Young people in love

900
01:02:56,758 --> 01:03:00,546
"Are very seldom hungry

901
01:03:00,918 --> 01:03:05,912
"People in love are very seldom hungry"

902
01:03:06,678 --> 01:03:09,795
What were you going to do?
Gold dig that guy for a meal?

903
01:03:10,518 --> 01:03:13,032
Sure, I was. No fooling, I'm hungry.

904
01:03:13,438 --> 01:03:14,871
Eat a carrot.

905
01:03:15,598 --> 01:03:16,587
No.

906
01:03:17,758 --> 01:03:19,191
I'm going in to ask him.

907
01:03:19,278 --> 01:03:21,269
You do and I'll break your neck.

908
01:03:32,838 --> 01:03:35,432
Come on, let's get out of here.
Stretch our legs.

909
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:02,072
I'm sorry...

910
01:04:02,478 --> 01:04:03,991
That's all right.

911
01:04:15,238 --> 01:04:17,433
Hey! Come here!

912
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:20,588
You've got my suitcase!

913
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:43,716
What happened to you? I was worried.

914
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:45,993
- Get in.
- Look at your face! You've got a cut!

915
01:04:46,358 --> 01:04:47,916
Well, what happened?

916
01:04:47,998 --> 01:04:51,513
A road thief. Picks people up,
runs off with their things. What a racket.

917
01:04:51,598 --> 01:04:52,951
How'd you get the car?

918
01:04:53,038 --> 01:04:56,075
I gave him a black eye for it
and had to tie him up to a tree.

919
01:05:26,638 --> 01:05:28,868
Can't be much gas left in this thing.

920
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,349
Gotta start promoting some.

921
01:05:33,198 --> 01:05:35,996
Better take the things out
of the pocket of that coat.

922
01:05:36,718 --> 01:05:38,754
That'll be good for ten gallons.

923
01:06:12,638 --> 01:06:15,789
I haven't changed my mind, Westley.
I want you to understand that.

924
01:06:15,878 --> 01:06:18,438
I don't like you. Never have. Never will.

925
01:06:18,638 --> 01:06:20,356
Now that's clear enough, isn't it?

926
01:06:20,438 --> 01:06:22,998
You've made it evident
by your threats of annulment.

927
01:06:23,078 --> 01:06:24,830
It hasn't worried me for a minute.

928
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:27,347
Ellie and I got married
because we love each other.

929
01:06:27,478 --> 01:06:31,153
She's proving it. As far as I'm concerned,
there's going to be no annulment.

930
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:36,232
I see. You've got hold of a good thing
and you're going to hang on to it?

931
01:06:37,198 --> 01:06:41,589
All right, you win.
I'll just have to get used to you.

932
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:45,673
I admit, I'm licked.
But it's only because I'm worried.

933
01:06:46,558 --> 01:06:49,994
If I don't find her soon, I'll go crazy.

934
01:06:50,078 --> 01:06:53,832
I could have helped if it hadn't been
for you. I've been watched so closely...

935
01:06:53,918 --> 01:06:58,912
I know. Well, you can help now.
I've got a room full of reporters in there.

936
01:06:59,438 --> 01:07:01,474
Now, I want you to make a statement.

937
01:07:01,638 --> 01:07:05,313
Say that we've talked things over
and come to an understanding.

938
01:07:05,398 --> 01:07:08,913
And that if she returns
I won't interfere with your marriage.

939
01:07:19,398 --> 01:07:21,753
- All right?
- Yeah, that's quite all right.

940
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:22,907
Okay.

941
01:07:23,158 --> 01:07:25,718
I hope you and your wife
spend a pleasant week with us.

942
01:07:25,798 --> 01:07:28,187
So do I. Thank you. Goodnight.

943
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:29,597
Goodnight.

944
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,629
- All right, brat.
- Any luck?

945
01:07:33,718 --> 01:07:36,357
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us
have a cabin.

946
01:07:36,518 --> 01:07:37,746
What about the money?

947
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:40,955
I talked him out of that idea.
He thinks we're staying a week.

948
01:07:41,038 --> 01:07:43,677
- I must think something up before morning.
- That's swell.

949
01:07:43,758 --> 01:07:48,354
Yeah? I'm glad you think so.
If you ask me, I think it's foolish.

950
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:53,395
I told you there's no use in staying here.
We can make New York in three hours.

951
01:07:57,278 --> 01:07:59,746
I thought you were in a hurry to get back.

952
01:08:04,598 --> 01:08:07,954
Whoever heard of getting in
at 3:00 in the morning?

953
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:10,588
Everybody will be asleep.

954
01:08:15,878 --> 01:08:18,551
Okay. Cottage no. 6.

955
01:08:43,598 --> 01:08:47,750
There you go, trusting people again.
How many times did I tell you...

956
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:51,148
But he looked like a nice,
upright young fellow, Ma.

957
01:08:57,398 --> 01:08:58,990
We're on the last lap.

958
01:09:03,518 --> 01:09:06,078
Tomorrow morning,
you'll be in the arms of your husband.

959
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:07,307
Yeah.

960
01:09:09,558 --> 01:09:11,276
You'll have a great story, won't you?

961
01:09:11,798 --> 01:09:14,107
Yeah. Swell.

962
01:09:35,678 --> 01:09:36,872
Thanks.

963
01:10:10,518 --> 01:10:12,827
We certainly outsmarted your father.

964
01:10:14,438 --> 01:10:16,269
I guess you ought to be happy.

965
01:10:17,078 --> 01:10:19,194
Am I going to see you in New York?

966
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:22,633
Nope.

967
01:10:24,838 --> 01:10:26,066
Why not?

968
01:10:27,398 --> 01:10:30,595
I don't make it a policy
to run around with married women.

969
01:10:32,278 --> 01:10:34,712
There's no harm in your coming to see us.

970
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:37,597
Not interested.

971
01:10:41,398 --> 01:10:43,036
Won't I ever see you again?

972
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:45,949
What for? I've served my purpose!

973
01:10:46,078 --> 01:10:49,627
I brought you back to King Westley.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

974
01:11:24,438 --> 01:11:26,508
Have you ever been in love, Peter?

975
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:29,153
Me?

976
01:11:30,598 --> 01:11:31,474
Yes.

977
01:11:33,398 --> 01:11:35,832
Haven't you ever thought about it at all?

978
01:11:38,398 --> 01:11:41,913
It seems to me you could make
some girl wonderfully happy.

979
01:11:43,878 --> 01:11:46,676
Sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't?

980
01:11:50,518 --> 01:11:52,986
If I could ever meet the right sort of girl.

981
01:11:54,598 --> 01:11:56,031
Where are you gonna find her?

982
01:11:56,118 --> 01:11:58,427
Somebody that's real.
Somebody that's alive.

983
01:11:58,558 --> 01:12:00,594
They don't come that way anymore.

984
01:12:05,318 --> 01:12:07,229
Have I ever thought about it?

985
01:12:08,838 --> 01:12:11,830
I've even been sucker
enough to make plans.

986
01:12:17,278 --> 01:12:21,874
I saw an island in the Pacific once.
Never been able to forget it.

987
01:12:25,318 --> 01:12:26,910
That's where I'd like to take her.

988
01:12:29,118 --> 01:12:31,393
She'd have to be the sort of a girl...

989
01:12:31,598 --> 01:12:35,034
...who'd jump in the surf with me
and love it as much as I did.

990
01:12:40,878 --> 01:12:45,633
Nights when you,
the moon and the water all become one.

991
01:12:46,678 --> 01:12:49,829
You feel you're part
of something big and marvellous.

992
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:54,547
That's the only place to live.

993
01:12:55,638 --> 01:13:00,268
The stars are so close overhead you feel
you could reach up and stir them around.

994
01:13:05,918 --> 01:13:07,829
I've been thinking about it.

995
01:13:09,398 --> 01:13:12,788
Boy, if I could ever find a girl
who was hungry for those things.

996
01:13:20,358 --> 01:13:22,826
Take me with you, Peter.
Take me to your island.

997
01:13:22,918 --> 01:13:25,557
I want to do all those things
you talked about.

998
01:13:26,878 --> 01:13:28,948
You better go back to your bed.

999
01:13:29,878 --> 01:13:33,109
I love you. Nothing else matters.
But we can run away.

1000
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:36,793
Everything will take care of itself.
Please, Peter...

1001
01:13:37,478 --> 01:13:40,038
...I can't let you out of my life now.

1002
01:13:41,118 --> 01:13:43,552
I couldn't live without you.

1003
01:13:56,678 --> 01:13:58,748
You'd better go back to your bed.

1004
01:14:07,758 --> 01:14:09,111
I'm sorry.

1005
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:48,992
Did you mean that? Would you really go?

1006
01:15:27,478 --> 01:15:30,390
All I'm asking is enough gas
to get me to New York.

1007
01:15:30,518 --> 01:15:31,997
That bag's worth $25.

1008
01:15:32,918 --> 01:15:34,795
I got a bag. I got one for Christmas...

1009
01:15:34,878 --> 01:15:37,346
Here's what I'll do.
I'll come back in the morning...

1010
01:15:37,438 --> 01:15:39,508
...and buy it back from you
with a $10 profit.

1011
01:15:39,598 --> 01:15:41,793
- What do you say?
- I ain't got a hat.

1012
01:15:42,118 --> 01:15:43,995
- What?
- I ain't got a hat.

1013
01:15:44,518 --> 01:15:47,078
Well, you got one now.
Come on, fill her up.

1014
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:57,674
Where you been all this time?
Everybody's been asking about you.

1015
01:15:57,758 --> 01:16:01,387
Get me one drink.
Nobody disturbs me for the next half hour.

1016
01:16:01,478 --> 01:16:02,627
Sure, boss.

1017
01:16:05,278 --> 01:16:06,347
Hello, Agnes.

1018
01:16:06,438 --> 01:16:09,714
- Don't. He'll shoot you on sight.
- Haven't been shot at in days.

1019
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:12,596
- Get out of here! Get out!
- Now listen, Joe.

1020
01:16:12,678 --> 01:16:13,633
Don't "Joe" me.

1021
01:16:13,718 --> 01:16:15,117
All right, Joe. Listen.

1022
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:16,597
You know I've always liked you.

1023
01:16:16,678 --> 01:16:19,112
Anytime I could help you,
ran across a good story...

1024
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:22,076
...I came running to you with it.
I got one now.

1025
01:16:22,318 --> 01:16:24,627
The wires were on the level.
The biggest scoop ever.

1026
01:16:24,718 --> 01:16:26,390
- It's yours.
- About the Andrews kid?

1027
01:16:26,518 --> 01:16:29,794
I've got it all written up, ready to go.
All I want is a $1,000.

1028
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,510
A $1,000? Get out of here before...

1029
01:16:31,598 --> 01:16:33,589
Don't get sore. You gotta do this for me.

1030
01:16:33,678 --> 01:16:36,112
I need a $1,000 and I need it quick.
I'm in a jam.

1031
01:16:36,198 --> 01:16:37,790
What's the $1,000 for?

1032
01:16:37,878 --> 01:16:39,436
To tear down the walls of Jericho.

1033
01:16:39,518 --> 01:16:41,236
Never mind. If I told you that...

1034
01:16:41,318 --> 01:16:43,309
...Ellen Andrews will annul her marriage?

1035
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:45,309
- She'll marry somebody else.
- You're drunk.

1036
01:16:45,398 --> 01:16:47,229
Would such a story
be worth $1,000 to you?

1037
01:16:47,318 --> 01:16:50,037
- Lf it was on the level.
- I got it, Joe.

1038
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:55,150
- Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
- I am.

1039
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:58,350
- You?
- Yes.

1040
01:16:58,438 --> 01:17:01,555
Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home.
Don't annoy me anymore.

1041
01:17:01,638 --> 01:17:04,072
For heaven sakes!
Stop being an editor for a minute.

1042
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:06,752
We know each other.
You ought to know when I'm serious.

1043
01:17:06,838 --> 01:17:09,432
This is on the level.
I met her on a bus from Miami.

1044
01:17:09,518 --> 01:17:12,032
I've been with her every minute.
I'm in love with her.

1045
01:17:12,118 --> 01:17:14,632
You gotta get me this money now, quick.
Minutes count.

1046
01:17:14,718 --> 01:17:16,754
She's waiting for me outside Philadelphia.

1047
01:17:16,838 --> 01:17:19,750
I gotta get right back.
She doesn't even know I'm gone.

1048
01:17:19,878 --> 01:17:23,109
A guy can't propose to a gal
without a cent in the world, can he?

1049
01:17:23,318 --> 01:17:27,391
What a story. On her way
to join husband, Ellen Andrews...

1050
01:17:27,478 --> 01:17:28,911
That's it.

1051
01:17:30,718 --> 01:17:32,390
Let me see that a minute.

1052
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:36,027
Zeke!

1053
01:17:39,478 --> 01:17:42,356
I told you, you couldn't trust him.
He's gone.

1054
01:17:42,518 --> 01:17:43,348
Who?

1055
01:17:43,518 --> 01:17:47,113
The fella who was gonna stay a week.
He skipped and took the car with him, too.

1056
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:50,349
We wouldn't have known till morning
if I hadn't took that magnesia.

1057
01:17:50,438 --> 01:17:53,111
Get up, don't lay there.
Let's do something about it.

1058
01:17:53,198 --> 01:17:56,315
There ain't nothing we can do if he's gone.

1059
01:18:09,838 --> 01:18:11,351
See that? They're gone.

1060
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:14,515
Looks like it, don't it? What's this?

1061
01:18:15,638 --> 01:18:17,947
Ma! Here's the woman.

1062
01:18:18,438 --> 01:18:20,713
- What's the matter?
- Where's your husband?

1063
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:23,758
- Husband?
- Yes, if he is your husband.

1064
01:18:25,638 --> 01:18:28,675
- Isn't he here?
- No, he ain't. The car's gone, too.

1065
01:18:30,638 --> 01:18:32,310
You got any money?

1066
01:18:32,918 --> 01:18:34,556
- No.
- Then you'll have to git!

1067
01:18:34,638 --> 01:18:36,356
Yeah. You'll have to git.

1068
01:18:39,238 --> 01:18:41,798
Please, may I use your phone?
I've got to call New York.

1069
01:18:41,878 --> 01:18:43,869
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone call.

1070
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:48,156
Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter
mile down the road. They'll fix you up.

1071
01:18:49,798 --> 01:18:54,155
And listen, next time you better not come
back here. I run a respectable place.

1072
01:18:57,998 --> 01:19:01,035
- Thanks, you saved my life.
- Okay. So long kid and good luck.

1073
01:19:01,118 --> 01:19:05,031
Goodbye. You're beautiful.
All women are beautiful.

1074
01:19:05,398 --> 01:19:08,515
For my dough, he's still the best
newspaper man in the business.

1075
01:19:08,638 --> 01:19:11,152
Get Hank, quick. Boy, what a yarn.

1076
01:19:11,758 --> 01:19:12,986
Hold up the morning edition.

1077
01:19:13,078 --> 01:19:15,638
Break down the front page.
We'll have a new layout.

1078
01:19:15,718 --> 01:19:19,347
Send in a couple of rewrite men.
And Hank, listen. Don't do a thing.

1079
01:19:19,438 --> 01:19:23,511
I've got a story that'll make your hair curl.
Wait a minute. Don't annoy me, I'm busy.

1080
01:19:23,598 --> 01:19:27,830
Agnes, send Mike in here! Dig up
all the pictures on that Andrews kid.

1081
01:19:27,918 --> 01:19:32,309
And Hank, listen, get Haley out of bed.
I want a cartoon and I want it quick.

1082
01:19:32,918 --> 01:19:34,954
Westley's in it.
He's waiting at the church...

1083
01:19:35,038 --> 01:19:37,871
...with tears on his face.
The bride didn't show up.

1084
01:19:38,038 --> 01:19:40,074
Old Man Andrews is laughing his head off.

1085
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:43,707
Everything exaggerated.
Snap into it. What is it?

1086
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:48,228
Ellen Andrews? You're crazy.

1087
01:19:48,398 --> 01:19:51,947
I'm not. She phoned her father
from an auto camp asking him to come.

1088
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:54,950
He's getting a police escort
and Westley's going along.

1089
01:19:55,038 --> 01:19:57,393
Yes, she's been travelling by bus.

1090
01:19:57,478 --> 01:20:00,356
When she found out her father
and Westley made up, she phoned.

1091
01:20:00,438 --> 01:20:04,033
Okay, grab a car and stay with them.
Get Hank again.

1092
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:07,110
Agnes, get me a doctor,
I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.

1093
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:09,587
Hank, forget what I told you.
I'm having a nightmare.

1094
01:20:09,678 --> 01:20:13,193
Agnes, you call the police department.
Tell them to find Peter Warne.

1095
01:20:13,278 --> 01:20:15,951
Send out a general alarm.
I want that dirty crook pinched.

1096
01:20:16,038 --> 01:20:16,834
You want us?

1097
01:20:16,918 --> 01:20:19,955
Change the front page!
Ellen Andrews just phoned her father.

1098
01:20:20,038 --> 01:20:22,871
She's going home. She found
out Dad withdrew his objections.

1099
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:25,426
She gave herself up.
Spread it all over the place!

1100
01:20:25,518 --> 01:20:29,147
Play it up big! Major league!
"Love Triumphant." Go on, hop to it.

1101
01:20:29,318 --> 01:20:30,273
Okay.

1102
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:48,597
Come on, baby.
We gotta get there before she wakes up.

1103
01:20:58,998 --> 01:21:01,193
Can't you drive any faster?

1104
01:21:03,998 --> 01:21:09,789
"Young people in love are never hungry"

1105
01:21:18,678 --> 01:21:21,556
Come on, baby. We've got a police escort.

1106
01:21:31,878 --> 01:21:35,075
Come on, baby.
They can't make a sucker out of us.

1107
01:21:38,838 --> 01:21:41,830
All right, come on.
Step back. Give them room.

1108
01:21:41,918 --> 01:21:43,636
Come on, step back.

1109
01:21:45,678 --> 01:21:47,748
How about a picture for the paper,
Mr. Andrews?

1110
01:21:47,838 --> 01:21:50,716
Wait till she gets home.
Later, boys. Later.

1111
01:21:59,278 --> 01:22:04,272
"He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

1112
01:22:04,398 --> 01:22:08,550
"The daring young man
on the flying trapeze"

1113
01:22:21,678 --> 01:22:23,270
Get that thing out of the way!

1114
01:22:23,358 --> 01:22:27,112
Keep your britches on, we'll get it out.

1115
01:22:48,758 --> 01:22:50,476
Hey, you darn fool!

1116
01:23:53,638 --> 01:23:57,233
Ellen Andrews is going to marry
that Westley guy again.

1117
01:24:06,118 --> 01:24:07,676
Gordon's out back some place.

1118
01:24:07,798 --> 01:24:11,427
When he comes in, give him this.
Tell him I was just kidding.

1119
01:24:14,878 --> 01:24:17,676
- You can't get a thing done around here.
- Peter was just in.

1120
01:24:17,758 --> 01:24:19,111
- What?
- He left this money.

1121
01:24:19,198 --> 01:24:21,393
- He said he was just kidding.
- Where is he?

1122
01:24:21,478 --> 01:24:23,389
- There he goes.
- Hey, Pete!

1123
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:31,074
Hello. I'm sorry, it was just a little gag.
I thought I'd have some fun with you.

1124
01:24:31,158 --> 01:24:33,911
Yeah, sure you had me going
for a little while, too.

1125
01:24:33,998 --> 01:24:36,831
- It wouldn't have made a bad story at that.
- No, great.

1126
01:24:36,918 --> 01:24:40,069
But that's the way things go.
You think you've got a great yarn...

1127
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:44,754
...and then something comes along and
messes up the finish. And there you are.

1128
01:24:45,518 --> 01:24:48,032
Yeah. Where am I?

1129
01:24:53,358 --> 01:24:56,156
When you sober up,
come in and talk to me.

1130
01:24:57,318 --> 01:24:58,307
Thanks.

1131
01:25:22,558 --> 01:25:23,707
Ellie?

1132
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:25,512
Hello, Dad.

1133
01:25:25,598 --> 01:25:27,190
I knocked several times.

1134
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:30,718
I'm sorry. I must have been daydreaming.

1135
01:25:30,798 --> 01:25:34,711
Everything's set.
Creating quite a furore, too.

1136
01:25:35,318 --> 01:25:37,388
Great stunt King is going to pull.

1137
01:25:38,118 --> 01:25:38,914
Stunt?

1138
01:25:38,998 --> 01:25:41,114
Yeah, he's landing on the lawn
in an autogyro.

1139
01:25:44,518 --> 01:25:45,837
Yes, I heard.

1140
01:25:45,918 --> 01:25:47,829
Personally, I think it's silly, too.

1141
01:25:49,038 --> 01:25:50,835
You look lovely, child.

1142
01:25:50,918 --> 01:25:52,829
Are you pleased with the gown?

1143
01:25:54,078 --> 01:25:55,033
Ellie?

1144
01:25:57,438 --> 01:26:00,157
The gown. Yes, it's nice, isn't it?

1145
01:26:06,118 --> 01:26:07,756
What's the matter, child?

1146
01:26:10,758 --> 01:26:12,032
What's wrong?

1147
01:26:12,118 --> 01:26:13,267
Nothing.

1148
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:16,386
You haven't changed your mind
about King have you?

1149
01:26:16,518 --> 01:26:17,553
No.

1150
01:26:17,758 --> 01:26:21,910
Because if you have, it isn't too late.
You know how I feel about him.

1151
01:26:22,078 --> 01:26:25,229
Well, you gave me such a scare
when I couldn't find you.

1152
01:26:25,398 --> 01:26:28,117
You know,
the old pump isn't what it used to be.

1153
01:26:28,638 --> 01:26:32,995
I'm sorry, Father. I wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world. You know that.

1154
01:26:33,158 --> 01:26:34,830
What's the matter, child?

1155
01:26:36,078 --> 01:26:37,431
Aren't you happy?

1156
01:26:40,478 --> 01:26:42,150
I thought so.

1157
01:26:42,638 --> 01:26:45,311
I knew there was something on your mind.

1158
01:26:47,238 --> 01:26:48,956
There, now.

1159
01:26:51,078 --> 01:26:52,591
What's the matter?

1160
01:26:54,198 --> 01:26:57,235
You haven't fallen in love
with someone else, have you?

1161
01:26:59,078 --> 01:27:00,352
Have you?

1162
01:27:03,758 --> 01:27:06,511
I haven't seen you cry
since you were a baby.

1163
01:27:07,638 --> 01:27:09,674
This must be serious.

1164
01:27:10,958 --> 01:27:12,516
Where'd you meet him?

1165
01:27:14,478 --> 01:27:15,877
On the road.

1166
01:27:16,118 --> 01:27:18,916
Now don't tell me you've fallen in love
with a bus driver?

1167
01:27:19,038 --> 01:27:20,266
Oh, no.

1168
01:27:24,798 --> 01:27:25,947
Who is he?

1169
01:27:27,278 --> 01:27:29,428
I don't know very much about him.

1170
01:27:30,318 --> 01:27:32,195
Except that I love him.

1171
01:27:32,438 --> 01:27:35,555
If it's as serious as all that,
we'll move heaven and earth to...

1172
01:27:35,678 --> 01:27:38,909
No, it's no use. He despises me.

1173
01:27:39,358 --> 01:27:40,188
Come now.

1174
01:27:40,278 --> 01:27:43,236
Yes, he does.
He despises everything about me.

1175
01:27:43,398 --> 01:27:49,155
He says that I'm spoiled and selfish
and pampered and thoroughly insincere.

1176
01:27:49,518 --> 01:27:50,871
Ridiculous.

1177
01:27:51,318 --> 01:27:53,707
He doesn't think so much of you, either.

1178
01:27:53,838 --> 01:27:54,793
Well, l...

1179
01:27:54,878 --> 01:27:57,676
And he blames you for everything
that's wrong with me.

1180
01:27:57,918 --> 01:28:00,386
He says you raised me stupidly.

1181
01:28:00,878 --> 01:28:03,676
And now that's a fine man
to fall in love with.

1182
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:05,790
He's marvellous.

1183
01:28:06,038 --> 01:28:09,075
What are we going to do about it?
Where is he?

1184
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:12,956
- I don't know.
- I'd like to have a talk with him.

1185
01:28:13,118 --> 01:28:17,077
It wouldn't do any good.
I practically threw myself at him.

1186
01:28:17,798 --> 01:28:21,507
Under the circumstances, don't you think
we'd better call this thing off?

1187
01:28:22,838 --> 01:28:24,351
No, I'll go through with it.

1188
01:28:24,438 --> 01:28:27,271
But that's silly.
Seeing the way you feel about him.

1189
01:28:27,438 --> 01:28:30,475
No, it doesn't matter.
I don't want to stir up any more trouble.

1190
01:28:30,598 --> 01:28:32,748
I've done it all my life.

1191
01:28:32,838 --> 01:28:36,194
I've made your life miserable.
And mine, too.

1192
01:28:37,118 --> 01:28:42,112
I'm tired, father. I'm tired
of running around in circles.

1193
01:28:43,078 --> 01:28:46,434
He's right, that's what I've been doing
ever since I can remember.

1194
01:28:47,238 --> 01:28:48,910
I've got to settle down.

1195
01:28:49,878 --> 01:28:52,836
It doesn't matter how,
where, or with whom.

1196
01:28:54,398 --> 01:28:57,037
You've changed, Ellie.

1197
01:28:57,718 --> 01:29:02,155
I can't walk out on King now.
It would make us all look so ridiculous.

1198
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:06,189
Anyway, what difference does it make?

1199
01:29:07,278 --> 01:29:09,234
I'll never see Peter again.

1200
01:29:09,478 --> 01:29:11,116
Is that his name?

1201
01:29:12,918 --> 01:29:14,317
Peter Warne.

1202
01:29:15,478 --> 01:29:17,116
Peter Warne.

1203
01:29:19,878 --> 01:29:21,277
Why, do you know him?

1204
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:22,956
Why, no.

1205
01:29:23,238 --> 01:29:25,706
Father, you haven't heard from him,
have you?

1206
01:29:25,838 --> 01:29:28,830
- Don't be silly, of course.
- Please, what's that?

1207
01:29:41,158 --> 01:29:44,946
I guess that was his only interest in me,
wasn't it?

1208
01:29:45,078 --> 01:29:48,036
- The reward.
- I'm sorry you read it.

1209
01:29:48,118 --> 01:29:50,996
- Are you going to see him?
- I suppose so.

1210
01:29:52,118 --> 01:29:55,906
Certainly. Pay him off. He's entitled to it.
He did an excellent job.

1211
01:29:56,278 --> 01:30:00,351
He kept me thoroughly entertained.
It's worth every penny he gets.

1212
01:30:00,678 --> 01:30:03,272
Thank you, Mary.
That's just what I needed.

1213
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,434
Mr. Westley's on his way up.

1214
01:30:05,558 --> 01:30:07,230
Fine, have him come in.

1215
01:30:13,718 --> 01:30:15,197
I'll be going.

1216
01:30:26,038 --> 01:30:29,269
If it isn't the bridegroom himself.
You're just in time, King.

1217
01:30:29,358 --> 01:30:30,711
How are you, Ellie?

1218
01:30:31,518 --> 01:30:32,394
You happy?

1219
01:30:32,478 --> 01:30:34,912
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy?

1220
01:30:35,278 --> 01:30:37,269
Here we are, let's drink.

1221
01:30:37,358 --> 01:30:40,555
It's up to you now.
I want our life to be full of excitement.

1222
01:30:40,638 --> 01:30:43,789
We'll never let up, will we?
Never a dull moment.

1223
01:30:43,918 --> 01:30:46,307
We'll get on a merry-go-round
and never get off.

1224
01:30:46,878 --> 01:30:50,996
- Promise you'll never let me get off.
- Whatever you say, darling. It's a promise.

1225
01:31:06,838 --> 01:31:09,033
Yeah. Who?

1226
01:31:11,638 --> 01:31:13,151
Why can't I see you at your office?

1227
01:31:13,438 --> 01:31:16,714
I'm leaving for Washington tonight.
I may be gone several weeks.

1228
01:31:16,798 --> 01:31:19,835
I thought, perhaps,
you'd like to get this thing settled.

1229
01:31:19,998 --> 01:31:23,354
Yeah. But I don't like the idea
of butting in on your jamboree.

1230
01:31:23,438 --> 01:31:25,998
Between you and me,
those things give me a stiff pain.

1231
01:31:26,078 --> 01:31:29,229
You don't have to see anybody.
You can come directly to my study.

1232
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:31,747
No. Why do I wanna...

1233
01:31:34,798 --> 01:31:38,950
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I will come over. Yeah.

1234
01:31:39,318 --> 01:31:42,310
I'd like to get a load of
that three ring circus you're pulling.

1235
01:31:42,398 --> 01:31:44,912
I wanna see what love looks like
when it's triumphant.

1236
01:31:44,998 --> 01:31:47,148
I haven't had a good laugh in a week.

1237
01:31:49,958 --> 01:31:50,629
Mr. Warne?

1238
01:31:50,718 --> 01:31:51,833
Yeah.

1239
01:31:54,518 --> 01:31:56,748
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

1240
01:31:57,118 --> 01:32:00,872
I was surprised to get your note.
My daughter hadn't told me anything...

1241
01:32:00,958 --> 01:32:02,869
...about you. About your helping her.

1242
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:05,950
That's typical of your daughter.
Takes those things for granted.

1243
01:32:06,078 --> 01:32:08,467
Why did she think
I lugged her from Miami?

1244
01:32:08,678 --> 01:32:11,238
She thinks you're entitled
to anything you can get.

1245
01:32:11,318 --> 01:32:15,391
She does? Isn't that sweet of her?
You don't, I suppose.

1246
01:32:15,518 --> 01:32:19,796
Well, I don't know. I'll have to see
on what you base your claim.

1247
01:32:19,878 --> 01:32:21,675
I presume you feel justified.

1248
01:32:21,758 --> 01:32:25,068
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
I got it all itemised.

1249
01:32:27,638 --> 01:32:32,428
"Cash outlay, $8.60. Top coat, $15.

1250
01:32:32,518 --> 01:32:35,157
"Suitcase, $7.50. Hat, $4.

1251
01:32:35,238 --> 01:32:40,835
"Three shirts, $4.50. Total, $39.60.

1252
01:32:41,318 --> 01:32:44,276
"All of the above items had
to be sold to buy gasoline."

1253
01:32:44,438 --> 01:32:47,316
And I sold some shorts and socks, too.
I'm throwing those in.

1254
01:32:47,438 --> 01:32:50,589
- Yes, I know.
- What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough?

1255
01:32:50,878 --> 01:32:53,392
Trip like that'd cost you a $1,000,
maybe more.

1256
01:32:53,478 --> 01:32:58,472
Now, let me get this straight. You want
$39.60 in addition to the $10,000?

1257
01:32:58,878 --> 01:33:00,391
What 10,000?

1258
01:33:00,838 --> 01:33:02,191
The reward.

1259
01:33:02,918 --> 01:33:05,227
Who said anything about a reward?

1260
01:33:05,398 --> 01:33:08,037
I'm afraid I'm a little bit confused.
I assumed...

1261
01:33:08,118 --> 01:33:12,430
All I want is $39.60. If you give
me a check for it, I'll get out of this joint.

1262
01:33:12,598 --> 01:33:14,236
It gives me the jitters.

1263
01:33:15,038 --> 01:33:18,075
- You're a peculiar chap.
- We'll go into that some other time.

1264
01:33:18,158 --> 01:33:20,797
The average man would go
after the reward.

1265
01:33:20,878 --> 01:33:23,153
Did anybody ever make
a sucker out of you?

1266
01:33:23,238 --> 01:33:26,150
It's a matter of principle.
You probably wouldn't understand.

1267
01:33:26,238 --> 01:33:29,947
When anybody takes me for a buggy ride,
I don't like paying for the privilege.

1268
01:33:30,038 --> 01:33:31,869
Were you taken for a buggy ride?

1269
01:33:32,038 --> 01:33:35,713
Yes. With all the trimmings.
So how about the check, do I get it?

1270
01:33:36,358 --> 01:33:38,155
- Certainly.
- Thanks.

1271
01:33:52,078 --> 01:33:53,511
Here you are.

1272
01:33:53,838 --> 01:33:54,987
Thank you.

1273
01:33:56,278 --> 01:33:59,236
Do you mind if I ask you a question,
frankly?

1274
01:33:59,598 --> 01:34:01,475
Do you love my daughter?

1275
01:34:02,798 --> 01:34:05,676
Any guy in love with your daughter
should be examined.

1276
01:34:05,758 --> 01:34:07,077
Now that's an evasion.

1277
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:11,191
She picked herself a perfect running mate,
King Westley. The pill of the century.

1278
01:34:11,518 --> 01:34:15,227
She needs a guy that'd sock her once
a day whether it's coming to her or not.

1279
01:34:15,318 --> 01:34:18,230
If you were wiser,
you'd have done it yourself long ago.

1280
01:34:18,318 --> 01:34:19,467
Do you love her?

1281
01:34:19,558 --> 01:34:22,516
A normal man couldn't live
with her without going nutty.

1282
01:34:22,598 --> 01:34:23,917
She's my idea of nothing.

1283
01:34:23,998 --> 01:34:26,228
I asked you a simple question!
Do you love her?

1284
01:34:26,318 --> 01:34:30,311
Yes! Now don't hold that against me!
I'm a little screwy myself!

1285
01:34:32,478 --> 01:34:35,231
Here's to the merry-go-round.

1286
01:34:41,318 --> 01:34:43,786
Perfect. Now you look natural.

1287
01:34:49,038 --> 01:34:51,632
- I hope you got your money.
- You bet I did.

1288
01:34:51,758 --> 01:34:54,147
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Same to you.

1289
01:34:54,798 --> 01:34:57,676
Stay around and watch the fun.
You'll enjoy it immensely.

1290
01:34:57,758 --> 01:35:00,033
I would, but I've got a weak stomach.

1291
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:08,831
- I just had a long talk with him.
- I'm not interested.

1292
01:35:08,918 --> 01:35:10,192
Now just a minute, Ellie.

1293
01:35:10,278 --> 01:35:12,792
I don't want to hear
another word about him.

1294
01:35:25,038 --> 01:35:27,677
Come on, folks. King Westley has arrived.

1295
01:36:19,518 --> 01:36:21,713
Here they come, boys. Turn them over.

1296
01:36:49,198 --> 01:36:51,314
You're a sucker to go through with this.

1297
01:36:52,678 --> 01:36:54,669
That guy, Warne, is okay.

1298
01:36:54,998 --> 01:36:59,116
He didn't want the reward.
All he asked for was $39.60.

1299
01:36:59,198 --> 01:37:02,508
It's what he spent on you.
Said it was a matter of principle.

1300
01:37:02,598 --> 01:37:04,475
You took him for a ride.

1301
01:37:11,438 --> 01:37:14,316
He loves you, Ellie. He told me so.

1302
01:37:16,758 --> 01:37:19,636
You don't want to be married
to a mug like Westley.

1303
01:37:19,958 --> 01:37:22,233
I can buy him off for a pot of gold.

1304
01:37:25,998 --> 01:37:28,307
And you can make an old man happy.

1305
01:37:28,398 --> 01:37:30,958
And you won't do so bad for yourself.

1306
01:37:31,358 --> 01:37:34,350
If you change your mind,
your car's waiting at the back gate.

1307
01:37:45,158 --> 01:37:48,355
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God...

1308
01:37:48,438 --> 01:37:52,067
...and in the face of this company,
to join together this man and this woman...

1309
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:56,390
...in holy matrimony. If any man can show
just cause why they may not lawfully...

1310
01:37:56,478 --> 01:38:01,472
...be joined together, let him now speak
or else, hereafter forever, hold his peace.

1311
01:38:04,158 --> 01:38:08,834
King, will thou have this woman to thy
wedded wife so long as you both shall live?

1312
01:38:09,318 --> 01:38:10,273
I will.

1313
01:38:11,438 --> 01:38:14,874
Ellen, will thou have this man
to thy wedded husband...

1314
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:17,153
...so long as you both shall live?

1315
01:38:20,718 --> 01:38:21,707
Ellen!

1316
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:24,347
Ellie!

1317
01:38:53,318 --> 01:38:54,387
What happened?

1318
01:38:54,518 --> 01:38:56,509
I haven't the slightest idea.

1319
01:39:10,678 --> 01:39:14,637
Don't want to talk to you.
Don't want to talk to anybody.

1320
01:39:14,718 --> 01:39:16,231
Don't want to see anybody.

1321
01:39:16,318 --> 01:39:18,070
But it's King Westley on the phone.

1322
01:39:21,358 --> 01:39:27,354
Hello, my would be ex-son-in-law.
I've sent you a check for $100,000.

1323
01:39:27,838 --> 01:39:32,229
That's the smartest thing you ever did,
Westley, not to contest that annulment.

1324
01:39:32,598 --> 01:39:36,068
That's satisfactory, isn't it? It ought to be.

1325
01:39:36,318 --> 01:39:40,470
I'm not complaining.
Not complaining. It was dirt-cheap.

1326
01:39:41,558 --> 01:39:43,788
Don't fall out of any windows!

1327
01:39:45,158 --> 01:39:48,230
There's another wire from Peter.
They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.

1328
01:39:48,758 --> 01:39:52,228
"What's holding up the annulment,
you slowpoke.

1329
01:39:52,558 --> 01:39:55,550
"The walls of Jericho are toppling."

1330
01:39:57,078 --> 01:40:01,515
Send him a telegram right away.
Just say, "Let them topple."

1331
01:40:04,518 --> 01:40:06,474
- Funny couple, ain't they?
- Yeah.

1332
01:40:06,638 --> 01:40:08,833
If you ask me,
I don't believe they're married.

1333
01:40:08,918 --> 01:40:11,307
They're married, all right.
I just seen the license.

1334
01:40:11,798 --> 01:40:15,268
They made me get them a rope
and a blanket, on a night like this.

1335
01:40:15,398 --> 01:40:16,717
What do you reckon that's for?

1336
01:40:17,118 --> 01:40:19,268
Blamed if I know.
I just brought them a trumpet.

1337
01:40:19,358 --> 01:40:20,393
A trumpet?

1338
01:40:20,478 --> 01:40:22,833
A toy. They sent me to the store to get it.

1339
01:40:22,918 --> 01:40:25,193
What in the world do they want
a trumpet for?

1340
01:40:25,278 --> 01:40:26,393
Don't know.
