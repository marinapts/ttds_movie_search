Which encompasses love and desire

Meeting and also parting and a sense...

00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:25,380
Your family, this country has given me lots
and l took it all with all my heart

154
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:32,554
But today l've this one last wish,
will you fulfill it ?

155
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:39,257
lmmerse my ashes in my lndia,
dear child

156
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:46,799
l may be an orphan but l am an lndian,
that's my only identity

157
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,398
l told you about Kiritpur haven't l?
For us Sikhas....

158
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,138
it's a very important pilgrimage.
All my ancestors are there.

159
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:02,417
Just immerse me there.
l will get my refuge.

160
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,255
You'll do this for me?

161
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,723
No.

162
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,390
There's going to be no need
to do any such thing.

163
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,260
All our Visas to go to
Delhi are ready.

164
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:24,532
You just get well soon.
Then we'll both go to your Kiritpur

165
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,143
and you can pray there to
your heart's content

166
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,212
Bebe...

167
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:33,614
Now quickly drink this holy water

168
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,511
She was here in Rakistan
and you in lndia.

169
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,917
Then how and when did
the two of you meet?

170
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,490
Three...three days later...

171
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:29,133
and what an unusual meeting it was...

172
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,872
A bus had toppled over
in the mountains.

173
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:41,515
There were no serious casualties.
All passengers were rescued.

174
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:48,356
And l was on my way down
to bring the last girl up.

175
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:18,915
Rull us up.

176
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:28,555
lt wasn't that l'd never seen
a more beautiful girl than her.

177
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:33,731
But l don't know why
l couldn't take my eyes off her.

178
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,334
Her eyes were lowered
and she was breathing heavily.

179
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,577
She was very scared.

180
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,246
A tendril of hair was bothering
her right eye.

181
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:51,586
She was trying to move it, but the wind
was strong and the hair stayed there.

182
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,982
As l lifted my hand from
her waist to move the hair...

183
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,253
she looked at me in fear.

184
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:03,160
We looked at each other
for the first time.

185
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,096
She kept staring at me scared...

186
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:11,598
then she lowered her gaze, but...

187
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,940
l kept staring at her...
and then my dream was broken...

188
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,507
Stop... stop... stop.

189
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:21,619
Ranjit. Stop.

190
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,445
What happened?

191
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,185
What happened?
- My bag has fallen down.

192
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,792
Rlease take me down.
lt's only a bag ma'am let it go.

193
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,793
l can't let it go
that bag is very invaluable to me.

194
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,625
Not more valuable than all our lives?
- Yes it is.

195
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,428
Now will you please
take me down or should l go myself?

196
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:40,638
My bag.

197
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,136
Stop it.

198
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,304
Ranjit take it down.
- Veer have you gone mad?

199
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:45,999
Do as l say. Take us down.

200
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:57,647
Here.

201
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,679
Ranjit, pull us up.

202
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,535
You endangered the lives
of so many people for a little bag.

203
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:26,484
What kind are you? You know we risk
our lives everyday to save lives...

204
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:30,484
of people who are complete strangers,
who aren't related to us in any way

205
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,086
But still on our way home our hearts
swell with pride...

206
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:38,561
that we saved someone's
sister, wife, brother or mother...

207
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,989
gave someone a new life. But today
for the first time in so many years...

208
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,866
l'm doubting my work

209
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:49,102
For the first time sacrificing my life for
someone else is seeming worthless...

210
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,103
is seeming wrong

211
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,103
l'm sorry ma'am
but it was disgusting

212
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:07,289
Get out ! l don't want to see your face.
Who asked you to give Zaara your money?

213
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:13,558
You know l can't say no to Zaara.
Even if l did she would've taken it forcibly

214
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:17,064
And she's not off to the market
to buy bangles, but to lndia...

215
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:22,128
wasn't important enough to tell me?
She made me pledge our friendship

216
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,400
Rledge of friendship!
There's a limit to childishness.

217
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:31,612
Who got her onto the bus? Call Akram.
Call him immediately. How irresponsible.

218
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,248
Zaara... Zaara are you all right?

219
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,186
Ma, l'm perfectly all right,
please don't worry

220
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:44,861
What is this nonsense Zaara,
do you know what l'm going through?

221
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:49,456
Only when l was going to the police
that this godforsaken Shabbo told me

222
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,266
Just come back home right away
... come home immediately

223
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:57,874
Ma, the border closes at four thirty
and l haven't even reached Kiritpur yet

224
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:02,336
God, for what sin am l being punished
... now it's about to be evening...

225
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:08,279
Why did you go alone? l promised you
that l would send the ashes to lndia

226
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:12,445
l also promised Bebe
that l would take her ashes myself.

227
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:16,354
Zaara is this a little trip from Lahore to
Rindi that you just took off like that?

228
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:17,457
Have you gone mad?

229
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:18,686
l'm really sorry Ma.

230
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,792
But after all my explaining,
you were still unable to understand me

231
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,395
Until now, l've done nothing
really important in my life Ma

232
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,366
Nor will l be doing anything
great in the future

233
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:38,747
My life, like yours, will be spent
being a good wife and a good mother

234
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,851
But after doing this,
l will always be proud of myself...

235
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,323
That l helped someone attain salvation.

236
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:53,820
Ma, now that l've come so far, l will
return only after completing my work

237
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:58,324
But if you stay angry with me,
then my journey will get bad luck...

238
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:01,403
Stop it. Can a mother ever wish
bad luck on a daughter ?

239
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,936
l've been crying since eight hours,
you want me to cry some more ?

240
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,707
Relax Ma l'm cool.

241
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,006
Yes, you're the only one who's cool
and we're all fools

242
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:13,847
lf your father returns
before you do then...

243
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:14,882
Don't worry, Ma

244
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:19,015
Rapa's only back next week
and l'm back tomorrow.

245
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,020
Rlease

246
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,019
Ma l've to hang up now,
there's a long queue

247
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,197
Listen, take care of yourself,
and don't eat any junk

248
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:30,231
And don't talk to any strangers
and keep calling me... right ?

249
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:36,033
And don't be scared, my blessings
are with you... good bye...

250
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:36,764
Good bye

251
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:38,538
Yes how much money?

252
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,540
Why are you worrying?

253
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:44,909
Our Zaara is no less than any boy.
She can get her way anywhere

254
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,778
Thank God that she's safe,
this girl scared the life out of me

255
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,919
Why're you talking to me?
l told you to get out of my sight

256
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,457
You say that all the time.
Now cool it

257
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,323
Cool it my foot!
You godforsaken fool

258
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:04,328
Go do your work... what are you
standing like statues for? Go.

259
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,667
Ranjit, permission for my leave
has come from the base

260
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,940
Mom and Dad had asked me
to come home to celebrate Lodi

261
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,803
l'll leave from here in the morning,
that way l'll reach sooner

262
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,240
Negi will accompany you back

263
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,516
Okay, see you on Monday. Enjoy...
- Thank you. Here are the logs...

264
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,754
Mister, are there any buses
to Kiritpur from here?

265
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,922
No Ma'am, no buses leaving right now.
There's one for Kiritpur at seven am

266
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,057
Then is there a hotel
where l can spend the night?

267
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:36,723
Hotel ! Of course... look there's
Kake's Dhabha. Our five star hotel

268
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:40,066
For ten rupees you'll get a blanket
for twenty five rupees you'll get a cot

269
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,838
Ok Ma'am, please excuse me,
l'm getting late. Good night

270
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:27,209
You risk your life to save
the lives of strangers

271
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,986
There can't be nobler work than that

272
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:35,116
l would not like you to stop taking
pride in your work because of me

273
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,062
That's why l've come to tell you
the reason for my behaviour

274
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:41,796
These are the ashes of my Bebe

275
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,467
She was an lndian...

276
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:50,737
who spent her whole life in Rakistan
serving my family...

277
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:55,144
and never asked for anything in return.
Just one dying wish...

278
00:31:56,447 --> 00:32:00,679
that her ashes be immersed alongwith
her ancestors in Kiritpur

279
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,815
This is more important
to me than my life

280
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,259
Rerhaps you were not happy
saving my life

281
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:17,595
But l am sure you'll be proud that
you saved this urn that was in my bag

282
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,304
Rlease try and forgive me.

283
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,674
l'm sorry.

284
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,447
Sir, here's your buttermilk.
- Thanks.

285
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,857
lf only l'd drunk it in the morning,
l wouldn't have lost my temper then

286
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,491
Here's the bus

287
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,836
One by one...who has tickets?

288
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,674
l've got a ticket.

289
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:03,503
Ladies first.- No pushing.

290
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,512
Easy... easy...no crowding.

291
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:09,175
That's it. No more.
- But l've got a ticket.

292
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:13,118
Madam, here everyone has a ticket
but here it's first-come-first-sit

293
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,788
So then where do l go?
- You go up there...

294
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:25,199
Hey baldie, move on over there.
- Why should l move?

295
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,930
ls my wife your sister that you want to
sit beside her for the entire journey ?

296
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:35,144
Shove, before l break your teeth.
- Sir, l was just moving.

297
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,816
You must be wondering
what am l doing here...?

298
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:52,393
Can you see that bus over there?
Actually l should've been on that bus

299
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:59,969
But l noticed you and l saw how
graciously you took this wonderful seat

300
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:06,175
l thought to myself either you are
extremely brave or extremely foolish...

301
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:10,908
to do this long journey all by yourself.
Then l realised that...

302
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,982
although l'll reach my village,
l'll be bothered throughout my journey...

303
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,579
and probably my
entire life whether...

304
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:21,649
that silly Rakistani girl reached
her destination safe and sound

305
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,759
So please don't think that
l've come to help you

306
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:30,457
l'm simply ensuring your thoughts
don't bother me for the rest of my life

307
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:31,992
Thank you

These are last rites. lt is done before
the ashes are immersed in the river

348
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,320
So why aren't we doing it ?
- We aren't doing it because...

349
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,322
you are a Muslim.
And this is a temple of the Sikhs

350
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,685
And it's in our interest to quietly
immerse the ashes and leave from here

351
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:17,994
No, l want to immerse the ashes
with the complete rituals

352
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,899
Hey no, no Zaara. lt's like this...
some priests are fanatics

353
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,231
So you'll get insulted
and l'll get unnecessarily beaten up

354
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,671
Should l go and ask ?
- No, no you don't ask.

355
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,781
You wait here. l'll ask.
- You wait right here... please

00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,251
Dear God, it's all in your blessings

l'd told you about Kiritpur, right?
Just immerse me there. l'll get refuge''

ls your name Zaara?

00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:05,548
Yes...

360
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:06,781
You've come from Rakistan?

361
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:07,609
Yes...

362
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,750
l've been in this temple
since forty two years

363
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,192
But l have never seen
such devotion

00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:21,558
You've done more than
a real daughter would

365
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:25,364
lt would be an honour for me
to do the last rites for your Bebe

00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,568
Come child, come with me. Come...

367
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,637
Dear God, it's all in your blessings

368
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,131
Come here, please

369
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:09,473
Now what?

370
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:14,744
Rut your hand out and fulfill
Bebe's last wish with me

371
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,353
But how can l...?

372
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:22,247
Look here, neither
l nor you are Bebe's children. But...

373
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:28,690
But...if it weren't for you l wouldn't have
been able to get Bebe here so easily

374
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:33,262
Like me, now you too have formed
a bond with Bebe

375
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,771
So the right...

376
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,040
to perform this
final rite is just not mine, but yours too

377
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:38,933
Come...

378
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:14,003
Zaara... here's your bus ticket.
You'll reach Atari. And from there...

379
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,112
catch a train straight to Lahore.
And here's your change

380
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,682
Have you finished eating?

381
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:23,085
Anything else...?- No thanks

382
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:29,153
You've already done a lot for me.
l just don't know how to thank you

383
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,754
l'm very frank about these things.
lf you ask me...

384
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:36,194
l'll tell you what l really want...
- Tell me what l can do for you ?

385
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:40,960
Be careful, l will ask but
you will not be able to give it

386
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:46,538
You don't know what you've done for me.
Ask for anything you want

387
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,371
lt's a promise that l'll fulfill it

388
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,383
You are making a promise without
knowing the price... you might regret it

389
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,820
A Rakistani has made
a promise to an lndian

390
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:02,719
Now my country's honour is at stake.
Now even if l want to l can't back off

391
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:10,991
Rlease tell me what can l do for you?
- Give me this one day from your life...

392
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:14,598
What?

393
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:21,544
You drew me close into your life. You created
a bond between me and your Bebe

394
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:25,975
You're leaving me
with a lifetime of sweet memories

395
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:33,590
l want to share my world with you.
l too wish to give you memories...

396
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:36,586
that stay with you
for the rest of your life

397
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:45,165
l know a day is very precious to you.
But l promise that...

398
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:48,494
you'll never forget this day

399
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:59,110
l warned you that
you'd regret making this promise

400
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,226
So you fell in love with her?

401
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,573
What l felt...

402
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,942
l still can't understand...

403
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:37,145
Why l asked her for a day
l don't know... l just asked her

404
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:43,653
But yes at that time l did feel
that our acquaintance...

405
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:49,497
was not destined to end right here.
We hadn't met just to come till here

406
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:59,608
Our relationship was still incomplete,
there was still something more to happen

407
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:07,350
With this thought, the words blurted
out of my mouth...

408
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,521
and that poor girl
listened to me silently....

409
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,623
Did she come with you?

410
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:23,598
Saamiya... the honour of
your Rakistan was at stake

411
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,002
How could she not come?

412
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:42,307
Why have you made that strange face?
Your mother scolded you on the phone?

413
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:46,949
l'm scared of heights...
- Why didn't you tell me earlier?

414
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,418
You said this is a shorter route

415
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,989
The other way would take
half a day more...

416
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,689
so what could l do...?
- Does that mean...

417
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,628
you'll wear this scary expression
for the entire journey?

418
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:00,166
Rlease smile a little
or l'll get scared too

419
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,605
Okay look, eat some nuts.
lt'll take your mind off this

420
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,407
Hold out your hand...- No...

421
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:10,277
Okay open your mouth

422
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:16,342
More ?

423
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:38,297
Brother Veer has come.
And there's a girl with him.

424
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:43,071
Brother Veer has come.
And there's a girl with him

425
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,046
Hey Rappu's mother see our Veer has come
and has brought his fiancee with him.

426
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,310
Oh a girl won't come
just like that with her fiance.

427
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,887
Veeru must have married her,
she must be his wife.

428
00:49:54,591 --> 00:50:01,963
Maati... Maati...

429
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,604
Oh, what's happened, who died now?

430
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,401
Maati Veeru's here....

431
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:15,839
Veeru?- Yes.

432
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:19,709
And he's got his wife
along with him.- What rubbish?

433
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:23,044
My Veeru will never get married
without telling me.

434
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:26,950
l'm telling the truth Maati. The whole
village has come out to see them...

435
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:34,758
What the hell...let him come...
l'm not going to talk to him

436
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:41,427
Oh Chaudhry Sumer Singh where the hell
are you? Where's he gone now?

437
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,558
Bauji... Maati's calling you...
- Yeah right... l heard her...

438
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:14,063
She always calls me at the wrong time.
Come here son, l'll tell you something

439
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,703
Don't ever make the mistake of
getting married. lf you do...

440
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,407
you won't be able to score a goal
for the rest of your life

441
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:20,168
All right Sir.

442
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:25,508
Oh my dear one, how many times
do l've to tell you.

443
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:28,411
not to disturb me during a game.
- And how many times do l tell you...

444
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:31,617
if you want to die then lie down on
a bed and die... don't play...

445
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:35,656
with kids old enough to be your
grandchildren and get your bones broken

446
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:38,623
Let me tell you one thing.
ln this entire village...

447
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,693
there's not a single player
who can compete with Sumer Singh

448
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:44,529
Except your son,
look what he's been up to

449
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:49,137
Veeru's come? Where...?
- But not alone. He's got married

450
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,535
What are you saying?
- Look there...

451
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,420
How're you Kamli?- Fine...

452
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,684
l'll say hi to Bauji
... your blessings, Bauji....

453
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:14,796
You son of an ass...without asking
or telling us, you got married?

454
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,191
l'll thrash you!
- Married? Who told you that?

455
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:18,492
Then who's she, my wife?
- No no...

456
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:20,135
your wife is right here.
- l'll hit you

457
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,567
Then who's she?
- You're too much Maati

458
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:25,603
ls there only one kind of relationship
between a man and a woman?

459
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:30,012
She's our guest Bauji. After saving
her in a rescue operation...

460
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,140
l got her here to show her
our village and to make her meet you

461
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:41,890
Of course! l understood the moment
l saw her...

462
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:45,986
such a beautiful girl with
an ass like you...impossible!

463
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:50,263
What's your name dear?
- Zaara, Sir. Zaara Hayaat Khan

464
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,496
What a lovely name, where are you
from, child?

465
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:55,095
From Rakistan

466
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:56,772
Oh wow, that's fantastic

467
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:00,272
then you're our extra-special guest!
Look...

468
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,335
we've served the people
of our country a lot

469
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:06,072
But this is our first chance to be
hospitable to our neighbouring country

470
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,978
What would you like to eat?
Should l get some butter milk?

471
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,675
Some milk some...?
- Oh enough now

472
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,718
You come with me. lf you get caught up
in his chatter it'll be nightfall soon

473
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:14,656
Move aside...
- Okay, never mind me.

474
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,847
Make way.- Oh yes.

475
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:22,420
Oye Veeru, where're you going?
Wait a minute.

476
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:24,824
All of you get going...

477
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,525
Yes...one minute...- What?

478
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:31,540
Yes?- Well... have you got my things?

479
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,807
Yes ! Here's your bottle of rum.

480
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:37,639
Don't drink it all alone.- No way.

481
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,543
lf Maati catches you this time,
l'm not going to lie to her.

482
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:45,184
Just once more...
one last time...?- Okay last time.

483
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,219
Now go on... go.

484
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:51,954
Cheers to the neighbouring country.

485
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:04,672
Come, l'll do that.
- No, l'll manage.

486
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:09,271
The way you're making it, it's evident.
Someone else ties your hair at home.

487
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:14,845
Come, l'll make it for you.
Just feel at home. Come.

488
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,917
This's Veer's room, right?- Yes.

489
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:24,359
Whenever he'd get a medal or a photo
l'd hang it up here.

490
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,927
And when he's not at home,
then Bauji and l...

491
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:33,099
warm our eyes looking at them.
- There's a lot of love...

492
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:36,397
between the three of you.- Because
there's no one else

493
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:41,704
to share our love. His mother and father
passed away when he was really small

494
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:47,308
Since then we're the only ones for him.
We're actually his aunt and uncle.

495
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:54,213
But he calls us his father and mother.
We don't have any children of our own

496
00:54:55,158 --> 00:55:02,064
So it's just the three of us.
Look...your plait is ready

497
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:08,498
Hey! l look just like all of you.
- This is nothing.

498
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:12,230
You'll look like a true Runjabi girl
tonight... tonight's Lodi

499
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:15,070
And here we celebrate it
with a lot of pomp.

500
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:18,543
l'll take out the dress.
l wore for my first Lodi for you.

501
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:22,111
No Maati, l'll wear my own clothes.
- Hey, you call me mother...

502
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,086
and at the same time argue with me?
Look you've come to our house...

503
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:29,589
just for a day. For this one day
at least become one of us.

504
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,044
Are you comfortable?- Yes.

505
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:52,111
Like l was telling you...
when l was young...

506
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:55,183
l used to take Maati on a cycle
like this right till Amritsar.

507
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:59,346
Now she's so become so fat
that she doesn't fit on a cycle.

508
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:02,524
No Bauji, she's not fat at all...
- Oh you don't know... l know.

509
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,128
Veer was telling me that Maati and you
have built this village on your own

510
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:12,028
That's right. At first there were
just fields here.

511
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:15,467
Then after writing many letters
we arranged for electricity.

512
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,235
Do you see that hospital?- Yes.

513
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:20,841
That was a cow shed earlier.
... how are you Doctor?

514
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,443
Doing fine Sir.
- Very well friend.

515
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:27,547
And look, the children's school.
Maati and l were the first teachers here.

516
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:32,886
No one knew how to read or write.
Now the kids study here till eighth grade.

517
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:37,719
After that the boys are sent off
to Kartarpur, for further studies.

518
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:39,684
And what about the girls?
- lt's not possible for us...

519
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:43,196
to send the girls so far. And anyway
they have to learn to...

520
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,927
look after the household, so what use
is higher education for them ?

521
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,729
That's not fair Bauji.

522
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:57,006
Not fair ? What d'you mean by that?
- l hope you don't mind this Bauji...

523
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,170
what you and Maati have done
for this village...

524
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,145
would've have taken people
centuries to achieve

525
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,718
But while you made the men
capable of facing the world...

526
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:10,917
you disabled the women.That's why a
Veer has become an Air Force Rilot...

527
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,252
and the girls of the village remain
illiterate and unpolished

528
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:20,860
Girls today have reached the moon.
They walk shoulder to shoulder with men

529
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:26,234
With education perhaps a girl from
this village could've outdone Veer

530
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:27,706
Don't you think so Bauji?

531
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:33,141
Oh Chaudhry Sumer Singh...
where are you loitering?

532
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:35,943
Oh man... whenever l'm doing
something really important...

533
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:38,848
she comes and bugs me.
Yes Madam, now what?

534
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:42,283
lt's time to light the Lodi.
Come and get ready...

535
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,388
All right, l'm coming

536
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,195
Come, dear. Let's light the Lodi

537
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,145
Listen everybody...

538
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,748
come here... come on.

539
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,217
Coming Bauji.

540
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,317
Let's go there... coming

541
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:48,889
Listen everyone...
to what l have to say

542
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:54,223
The cricket pitch that was going
to be made here... will not happen now

543
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,226
Why...?- Why Bauji?

544
00:58:55,431 --> 00:59:00,164
Relax, l'm telling you... because now
we're building a Girls High School.

545
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,063
The girls are glad.

546
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,767
l promise you that once
this school is built...

547
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:11,869
the girls won't have to leave
the village for higher studies.

548
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:17,077
And one more thing, the first brick
for the school...

549
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:21,514
isn't going to be laid by Maati or me,
but will be laid by the girl...

550
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:25,586
because of whom this school
is being built. Miss Zaara Hayaat Khan

551
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:33,600
Come dear...

552
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:44,104
Bauji how can l...?- Why not?

553
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:48,481
When being so young
you've taught me such a big lesson

554
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:50,480
Then why can't you do
this little thing for me ?

555
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,514
Come dear, come.

556
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,409
Oye Kamli.

557
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:17,671
l, Ginda Singh... l really like you.

558
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,869
O'Soumitre...
l Darshan Singh Aulakh.

559
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:45,770
Will die for you.

560
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:59,549
Maati is this the custom of Lodi?
- No... this's your Bauji's custom

561
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:04,048
What d'you mean?
- ln our time...

562
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:09,830
romance was taboo. On top of that
l was from Madras and he from Runjab.

563
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:14,201
So one night during Lodi he asked
for my hand in front of everybody

564
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:18,073
My parents didn't know what to say.
And we got married

565
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,905
After that ever since we've come here
and started celebrating Lodi...

566
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:25,103
he's started this custom that
if a boy is in love with a girl...

567
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:29,114
he confesses his love in front of everyone.
lf the girl wants to refuse...

568
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:31,616
she quietly throws a fistful of sesame
into the fire

569
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:36,383
lf she wants to accept she calls out
the boy's name and breaks sugar cane

570
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:38,492
Then after that we get them married

571
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:41,127
Wow, this's such a
lovely custom...that means...

572
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:45,757
when the bride and the groom agree,
what's the need of a priest...?

573
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,833
Hey Saraswathi Kaur...

574
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:56,034
My lady from Madras...
l Chaudhry Sumer Singh...

575
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,974
ask for your hand in marriage
for the next seven lifetimes

576
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:10,421
Come on girl

577
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:13,355
l'll set him right

578
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,872
What... my proposal... rejected?

579
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:36,478
Maati... what're you doing?
Bauji doesn't stand a chance?

580
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:40,380
Tell him if he wants to spend
seven lifetimes with me...

581
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,922
he has to fulfill
certain promises. ls he ready?

582
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:45,788
Rromises? What promises Maati?

583
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,920
Sorry Bauji that's it.
Now drop the sugar cane

584
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,725
Okay, l'll drop it

585
01:02:53,002 --> 01:03:02,968
[ Skipped item nr. 585 ]

586
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:07,913
''l would sacrifice my life for you
if only l could know what you want''

587
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:11,917
''l would agree to everything,
my beautiful one''

588
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:28,965
''Hahn ! l know you, very very well''

589
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:33,973
''lf you want to be with me then,
you better fulfill what l ask of you''

590
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:51,092
''Hoye 'hoye 'hoye, you are my life''

591
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,858
''You are my beloved''

592
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,293
''The festival of
Lodi is here?- Aha''

593
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,663
''Take your partners?- Aha''

594
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,998
''Grasp the wrist of your beloved''

595

01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,739
''Never let it go''

597

''Every oath you swear,

600
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:20,153
''Oho...?
- Been broken by you''

601
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:27,285
''As soon as the sun sets every evening
You drink with your cronies''

602
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:32,160
''The sun goes down and you get drunk
What sort of life is this ?''

603
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:40,099
''You're perfectly right and
henceforth l shall keep it in mind''

604

''Just let me drink today,
from tomorrow l shall not touch a drop''

605
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:50,381
''Yes, now he will come
straight home at sundown''

606
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:54,682
''l would sacrifice my life for you''

607
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:59,020
''My dear one, my fair one,
my handsome one, my beloved''

608
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:03,961
''My life, O'dear one,
O'beautiful one''

609
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:23,176
''Everyday l see you playing cards.
More beloved than me...''

610
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:26,583
''are your fives, sixes and sevens?''

611
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:27,448
''Why?''

612
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:34,753
''My card playing foolishness
will end forever''

613
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:39,458
''Now there will be only two cards
in my life, the king and the queen''

614
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:45,298

if you give up these decks of cards''

627
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:36,188
''Whenever l ask you to bring something
you can never remember''''

''l asked you for some ribbons for my hair
and you bought sweets''

629
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:49,070
''Now l have this notebook
in which l will write...''

630
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:53,969

''Yes, slowly he will mend
his ways completely... yes ?''

632
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:03,618

you will always be mine''

you should be mine''

''Beloved, in every birth
l'm your worshipper''

638
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:49,823
''You were mine, you are mine
and you will always be mine''

639
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:55,402
''Yes without you he will be lost''

640
01:07:55,604 --> 01:08:00,507
''Now every desire of
your heart will be fulfilled''

641
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:22,490
''The festival of Lodi is here,
take your partners''

644
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:34,268
''Every oath you swear,
has been broken by you''

645
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:54,755
Here you are Bauji. God knows where all
Maati's sent me to look for you

646
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,330
Breakfast is getting cold. Come quickly.
l've got to leave. Come on

647
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,931
Come here son... sit

648
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:07,169
What happened Bauji?
What're you looking at?

649
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:15,177
l'm looking at my lifetime's
achievements... my legacy, my village

650
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:21,015
Up until now l was very proud of myself
that l have done great work...

651
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:26,354
that l've developed this village
from nothing. But yesterday...

652
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:30,694
that young girl asked me
an innocent question. And l realised.

653
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:35,703
that l haven't done much...
there's still a lot left to do

654
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:41,534
Son, in the few years left of my life,
how much can l really achieve ?

655
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:44,307
And after l die this village
will be orphaned

656
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:51,377
All the work will be left incomplete...
so l was seeing a dream and wondering...

657
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:56,889
if my dream will come true or not ?
- What dream, Bauji ?

658
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:06,127
l saw that after Maati and l are gone
you are here riding my bicycle

659
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:10,569
Your wife is sitting behind you;
the village is not orphaned

660
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:13,435
Nothing is left incomplete...
that's what l was seeing...

661
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:15,241
So why won't this dream come true ?

662
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:21,647
Now that you've become
Squadron Leader Veer Rratap Singh...

663
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:24,745
you'll settle in the city.
Why would you worry about the village?

664
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:27,286
No Bauji. l am your Veeru
first and foremost

665
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:31,423
And if you've seen a dream it will
come true. Only l won't be circling around...

666
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,129
on a cycle. l'll use a helicopter.
Will that do ? Okay come on now...

667
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:39,593
otherwise Maati's going to shout.
- Oh there's one more thing

668
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:50,103
ln my dream, l've also seen the girl
sitting behind you on the cycle

669
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:02,785
Looks like you've already had
some rum is morning Bauji she's a Rakistani

670
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:12,066
She's Rakistani, Chinese or Japanese,
l don't care. l can just see...

671
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:16,299
that when this girl sits behind
you on the cycle...

672
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:21,866
Their hand will rest on your shoulder,
she'll never let you fall...

673
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:28,650
She'll never let you take a wrong turn.
Come here, sit. Listen...

674
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:34,147
when the right woman comes
into a man's life...

675
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:39,154
that's when his life becomes complete.
l Chaudhry Sumer Singh am incomplete...

676
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:46,265
without your Maati. And you
Squadron Leader Veer Rratap Singh...

677
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:53,333
you will be incomplete without Zaara.
That's why... you first understand...

678
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:56,003
What your heart is telling you;
and then quickly tell her

679
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:58,512
Otherwise son, it'll be too late

680
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:04,443
Bauji tell me one thing...- Yes ?

681
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:07,187
Since it's your dream,
is it okay if the wife sits...

682
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:10,688
the front seat of the cycle ?
- Yes it's okay. Should l go tell her ?

683
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,684
No please only l will tell her...
- No, no l'll tell her...

684
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:16,695
No, l do the talking.
- She's downstairs? l'll tell her

685
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:19,367
Who's marrying ? You or l ?
- One and the same

686
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:24,267
One and the same...?
- Never mind. Hey lucky girl...

687
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,916
May l leave, Maati ?
- Oh are you leaving ?

688
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:40,620
l'll let you go only on one condition,
you have to promise to come back

689
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:46,925
Okay l promise.But in return you'll
give me permission for something ?

690
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:47,754
What ?

691
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:50,327
From now on...

692
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:52,998
may l call you Bebe ?

693
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:11,812
l think we should leave

694
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:15,957
Or it'll get late.
- l'm ready. l'll go get my bag

695
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:20,853
You're leaving ?- Yes Maati

696
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:25,191
You'd asked me to come here for Lodi
no matter what. So l came

697
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:29,303
But l've got leave for only two days.
l've to report at headquarters tonight

698
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:32,699
l'll put Zaara on a bus to Amritsar and...
- Absolutely not

699
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:36,641
You'll take Zaara to Atari
and see her onto her train. She's all alone...

700
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:41,546
what if something happens to her ?
- She's become your favourite in a day ?

701
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:45,713
You used to get upset when it was time
for me to leave and stop me

702
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:50,221
Today you want me to leave quickly ?
- l don't have time for your nonsense

703
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:54,321
l've made some laddoos for
you and Ranjit. Take them

704
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:03,167
Oh Ginda where've you been ?
- Veeru's getting late

705
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:05,670
Bauji l was filling up diesel.
- ls this any time to fill up ?

706
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,000
Let it be

707
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:08,835
Okay now bless me...

708
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:11,845
May you live long, son

709
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:14,507
Tell her, huh ?- Yes yes, l'll tell her

710
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:16,741
Shall l ?- Stop pressurizing me

711
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:17,884
Maati control him

712
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:19,711
Where are you going ?
What's in this?

713
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,514
Not for you.- No...? l see...

714
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,725
for your son...?
- Bauji...

715
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:30,697
What are you doing ?
Here girls don't touch the feet

716
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:34,192
But daughters ask for blessings before
they bid farewell to their fathers ?

717
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:37,201
May you live long my child

718
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:45,343
Give your parents a message from me

719
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:54,518
Tell them that a sixty year old lndian
salutes the values they've put into you

720
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,933
What d'you think ?
Will Veeru tell her ?

721
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:43,764
He's Chaudhry Sumer Singh's son,
why won't he tell her...

722
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,598
Didn't l tell you ?

723
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:50,241
Stop it...- What... where're you going ?
Listen...

724
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:02,053
Squadron Leader Veer Rratap Singh
thank you very much

725
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:03,417
For what ?

726
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:06,388
ln exchange for my one day...

727
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:11,559
you've given me a lifetime of
memories and relationships

728
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:16,729
lt was a promise from an lndian
to a Rakistani lf l didn't fulfill it...

729
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:19,469
my country's honour
would've been tarnished, no ?

730
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:24,812
l think getting Bebe's ashes here
was God's way to get me here

731
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:30,074
l was destined to meet all of you.
- Do you believe in destiny ?

732
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:31,910
Of course

733
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:36,385
Don't you ?- Not until now

734
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:38,751
But now l've begun to believe

735
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:47,532
Are you all right ?

736
01:16:58,113 --> 01:16:59,910
You aren't all right,
you're hurting ?

737
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:04,345
Look let's rest here for a while...
- No, l'll miss my train

738
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:07,681
You won't miss your train...

739
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:11,357
You lean on me... put your hand across

740
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:16,692
Your anklet

741
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:21,362
l'll keep it. l'll give it to you later

742
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:23,704
Come... hold on tight...

743
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,046
How many times are you going
to save my life ?

744
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:37,211
As many times you put yourself at risk...

745
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,095
Actually there's
a lot of hustle for seats

746
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:23,426
The festival of ldd is coming up.
At this time....

747
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:28,399
a lot of people go across the border.
But you don't worry, l'll find a way

748
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:59,165
Thank God you're all right.
l just got off the train from Lahore

749
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:02,099
l was finding out about Kiritpur,
when l saw you

750
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:10,444
Your father has returned. He sent me.
Let's call home and say you're fine.

751
01:19:10,645 --> 01:19:12,272
Then we'll prepare for our return

752
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:16,609
And you are...?

753
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:20,284
This's Veer.
Squadron Leader Veer Rratap Singh

754
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:26,522
Thanks to him, l've managed to get here.
This is Raza. Raza Shirazi, my fiance

755
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,119
The seats are done,
we should be leaving now...

756
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:07,559
So silly of me... l went on talking
about everything...

757
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:12,665
but l forgot to tell you of Raza
- You made a big mistake.

758
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:14,167
What !

759
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:19,471
You made a big mistake

760
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:33,719
Zaara l'm a very simple man. l speak
frankly and understand things simply

761
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:39,157
lt's the first time l started thinking
differently because of Bauji and Maati

762
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:45,336
The entire journey l kept thinking up
a way to stop you, not to let you go...

763
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:53,479
and tell you that l really like you
and if you think l'm okay then...

764
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:56,515
let's get married

765
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:02,679
And we'll breeze through life together
just like these past two days

766
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:06,223
But the guy up there has strange ways

767
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:10,589
He kept building my confidence
and then when we got here...

768
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:13,859
He changed the entire story

769
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:25,040
You must be wondering why
l'm telling you all this right now

770
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:32,676
Rlease don't get me wrong. l understand
that you belong to someone else...

771
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:39,885
and there's nothing between us
nor can there ever be...

772
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:46,733
but where ever...
whenever you need a friend...

773
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:52,569
just remember that there is a man
across the border...

774
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:55,575
Who will give his life for you

775
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:04,913
C'mon Zaara we must leave

776
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:06,579
Mr Veer...

777
01:22:08,356 --> 01:22:13,089
Zaara told me how you saved her life.
Now l'm indebted to you.

778
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:18,661
So tell me how may l repay you ?
- Just keep Zaara happy...

779
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:20,666
the debt will be repaid

780
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:23,428
Careful Mr Veer...

781
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:27,100
lest l get the impression
that you've fallen in love with Zaara

782
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:32,373
what is love... l don't know.
But yes...

783
01:22:34,316 --> 01:22:39,811
l do wish from the bottom of my heart
that Zaara never has tears in her eyes

784
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:42,115
That she always keeps smiling

785
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:47,959
lf that's what you call love,
then love it is

786
01:22:49,931 --> 01:22:56,803
Mr Veer, you're talking about
my fiancee to my face

787
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:03,408
l don't know whether to consider this
a compliment or an insult

788
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:09,076
lf you think of this as nothing,
it's better. For the truth is that...

789
01:23:10,185 --> 01:23:15,020
l'm nothing to her
and you are everything for her

790
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:22,655
Good Bye

791
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,657
Let's go

792
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:42,773
[ Skipped item nr. 792 ]

793
01:23:56,197 --> 01:24:01,157
''Just for two moments,
the caravans of our dreams made a stop''

794
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:06,671
''And then you went your way
and l went mine''

''Just for two moments
existed the story of our hearts''

''And then you went your way
and l went mine''

797
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:47,548
''Was that really you
or was it a luminous sunbeam''

798
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:52,884
''Was that you or was it a blossoming bud''

799
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:58,618
''Was that you or was that the
monsoon of my dreams''

800
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:03,728
''Was that you or was
that a cloud of happiness''

801
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:09,732
''Was that you or was it
a full blooming flower''

802
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:15,738
''Was that you or did l find a
beautiful new world''

01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,038
''Seven eighty six''

808
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:55,040
Dinner time

809
01:25:57,785 --> 01:26:01,551
And Ma'am your visiting time is over

810
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,287
You'll have to leave now

811
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:15,469
l'll come back tomorrow

812
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:20,201
Sorry, your story is left incomplete

813
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:21,740
Come on, Ma'am

814
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:37,321
And seven eighty six, l'm sending
someone to take the plate in ten minutes

815
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:40,652
Eat quickly or you'll have to sleep
on an empty stomach again

816
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:47,991
Have you ever wondered
why his number is seven eighty six ?

817
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:48,828
What...?

818
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:55,832
Have you ever wondered...?
From the thousands of prisoners here...

819
01:26:56,878 --> 01:27:01,508
how come this lone Hindu prisoner
has got Allah's holy number ?

820
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:09,179
This is not a mere coincidence,
this is God's great miracle...

821
01:27:10,491 --> 01:27:18,830
His way of telling all of you that this
This God's own man. Treat him with respect

822
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:23,562
Next time you speak to him
so rudely...

823
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,835
give a serious thought
to what l've just said.

824
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:35,107
These are Ladoos.
My mother sent them for you

825
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:41,441
Rlease have some.
She has sent them with her blessings

826
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:55,151
What happened ?
You don't like it ?

827
01:28:56,631 --> 01:29:04,697
No... no... these are just like
the ones Maati used to make

828
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:10,302
Things made by a mother's hands
are the same everywhere

829
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:14,446
May l have one more ?

830
01:29:15,249 --> 01:29:17,046
Yes please, these're all for you

831
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:28,318
Tell your mother she's filled
my entire childhood into this little box

832
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:30,255
Delicious

833
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:36,297
All night, l was telling
my mother your story

834
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,867
My mother cried a little
and went to sleep

835
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:45,009
But l stayed up waiting for dawn.
kept thinking how and why...

836
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:53,384
did you get here...? Kept wondering
why didn't this story end at that station ?

837
01:29:56,591 --> 01:30:04,896
This story couldn't have ended there.
Because so far this was only...

838
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:12,870
a tale of Veer's love.
Zaara's love had not yet begun

839
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:24,849
And without knowing what Zaara felt
Veer's story and Veer's life...

840
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:28,687
would both remain incomplete

841
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:37,960
Jehangir Hayaat Khan, Zaara's father
and the pride of Lahore

842
01:30:40,301 --> 01:30:45,637
Since the inception of Rakistan
the name of the Hayaat Khan family...

843
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:50,099
was synonymous with respect,
power and glory

844
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:57,607
Jehangir Hayaat Khan was taking
his first step into politics...

845
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:01,786
with the help of Abdul Shirazi...

846
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:06,991
another rich, respectable man
of Lahore...

847
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:10,389
he was Raza Shirazi's father

848
01:31:13,434 --> 01:31:16,892
Zaara and Raza's marriage
was no ordinary relationship

849
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:21,475
All these people's futures were
dependent on this alliance. ln this situation...

850
01:31:21,676 --> 01:31:27,740
Zaara's coming to lndia all by herself
was a very irresponsible act

851
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:33,910
And to forgive such an act
was not Jehangir Hayaat Khan's nature

852
01:31:35,289 --> 01:31:38,588
lt was a month since
Zaara had returned...

853
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:42,092
but her father had not
yet spoken with her

854
01:31:42,964 --> 01:31:47,298
God Ma'am, l'll burst with happiness
what an elegant outfit...

855
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:50,529
and look, l think this
jewellery set is an antique

856
01:31:50,738 --> 01:31:54,367
l think it belongs to
Mr Raza's ancestors

857
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:58,875
Our Zaara is very lucky. Mr Raza has
everything. Respectability, money

858
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:03,310
There's no doubt in that.
He has everything by God's grace

859
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:06,843
There could not be a better match
than this. Just pray for them

860
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:11,388
There's a man across the border
who will give his life for you

861
01:32:12,727 --> 01:32:17,187
Ma, can you give up your life
for Rapa?

862
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:22,028
Of course. He's my husband.
l can do anything for him

863
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:24,998
And would Rapa give up
his life for you?

864
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,367
What kind of a question is that !
Rray to God...

865
01:32:28,576 --> 01:32:29,372
such an
occasion does not arise

866
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:33,072
But if such an occasion were to arise?

867
01:32:34,415 --> 01:32:37,873
Then can you say for sure that
Rapa would give up his life for you?

868
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:39,310
Have you gone mad?

869
01:32:39,954 --> 01:32:42,479
Shabbo give me some lime
my hands have become sticky

870
01:32:42,757 --> 01:32:46,557
That means, you're not sure?

871
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:57,827
Listen baby, between a woman's love and
a man's love there's a huge difference

872
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:04,773
A woman loves with
all her heart and soul

873
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:11,582
Men do not have the strength
to love like that. l know why...

874
01:33:11,786 --> 01:33:16,917
you're asking me this question.
But don't expect this from Raza

875
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:23,124
Just give him your heart and soul
and fulfill your duties

876
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:27,527
And l am very sure that
he will fulfill his duties too

877
01:33:30,237 --> 01:33:31,829
But he won't give up his life
for me, no...?

878
01:33:32,673 --> 01:33:34,072
You're talking nonsense

879
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:36,900
Here Shabbo, you put it.
This girl is going to drive me mad

880
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:41,377
There's a man across the border
who will give his life for you''

881
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:48,586
But l know someone who will willingly
give up his life for me

882
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:58,992
A person whose eyes are honest
and whose words have honour...

883
01:34:01,202 --> 01:34:06,401
a man who can forsake everything
for a woman's love...

884
01:34:08,943 --> 01:34:17,476
a person to whom it makes no difference
that l'm a Rakistani and he's an lndian

885
01:34:20,888 --> 01:34:24,415
Who're you talking about?
What've you been up to?

886
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:26,888

before, was giving me...

the biggest news of my life.
She very simply told me that...

959

Zaara is in love with you and she's
about to get married

this step all by herself

She says that you can give
your life for her

01:44:52,252 --> 01:44:54,243
And then she asked me
one last question

964

How much do you love Zaara?

to that question then

is not permitted to come to Rakistan

you resigned knowing fully well
that you will never be able to rejoin

you left for Lahore...

Would you reach on time?

Would you meet Zaara?
Would Zaara come back with you?

she would stop me

01:53:52,492 --> 01:53:58,021
There's a very deep and a serious pact
behind it. lt's on this foundation...

1036
01:53:58,498 --> 01:54:03,299
that your husband's and after him
Raza's career rests

1037
01:54:04,838 --> 01:54:10,902
Raza is very well aware of this.
Now Zaara has to understand this...

1038
01:54:12,011 --> 01:54:13,979
if this wedding doesn't
take place tomorrow, then...

1039
01:54:14,681 --> 01:54:21,985
Jehangir Hayaat Khan's daughter's name
will be linked to an lndian man forever

1040
01:54:23,356 --> 01:54:25,824
Mr Khan's years of hard work
will be ruined...

1041
01:54:26,526 --> 01:54:31,088
he'd lose the elections for sure and
he'll face a lifetime of disgrace

1042
01:54:31,698 --> 01:54:38,331
He will not be able to bear
the weight of that shame...

1043
01:54:39,439 --> 01:54:44,172
he won't be able to bear it

1044
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:55,087
Rrepare for the wedding, Brother Abdul

1045
01:54:56,456 --> 01:55:00,756
Tomorrow there will be a wedding
in this house

1046
01:55:12,472 --> 01:55:13,598
Where're you going?

1047
01:55:15,475 --> 01:55:16,442
To Zaara's house....

1048
01:55:17,243 --> 01:55:20,110
Rlease don't go anywhere!
Let tonight pass

1049
01:55:20,647 --> 01:55:24,777
Raza is looking for you everywhere!
The house is completely silent

1050
01:55:25,151 --> 01:55:29,053
You can't go there and do anything.
Abbaji is in deep shock

1051
01:55:29,255 --> 01:55:32,622
l am the cause for the shock
and the solution

1052
01:55:34,394 --> 01:55:36,794
l hadn't come here just to see
Zaara's face

1053
01:55:38,498 --> 01:55:42,298
lf nobody speaks,
there's bound to be silence

1054
01:55:43,937 --> 01:55:51,469
Someone has to make the first move,
whether it brings on a storm or a wedding

1055
01:56:49,569 --> 01:56:55,667
My name is Mariam Hayaat Khan.
l'm Zaara's mother

1056
01:56:57,243 --> 01:57:02,545
But perhaps today l have lost
the right to call her my own...

1057
01:57:04,083 --> 01:57:06,381
because my daughter's
not mine anymore

1058
01:57:07,587 --> 01:57:11,216
She's yours now

1059
01:57:14,761 --> 01:57:17,229
l've come to ask you to give
my daughter back to me

1060
01:57:18,598 --> 01:57:24,400
Rlease give us back our daughter !
Otherwise her father will die

1061
01:57:29,609 --> 01:57:34,410
He won't be able to bear the shame,
he'll die

1062
01:57:37,717 --> 01:57:46,750
l've heard that you save lives...
you're the one who saved Zaara's life

1063
01:57:48,961 --> 01:57:53,421
So now please save her
father's life

1064
01:57:56,069 --> 01:58:01,439
l beg of you, please save his life

1065
01:58:04,143 --> 01:58:06,111
Else he'll die...

1066
01:58:08,481 --> 01:58:10,108
he'll die...

1067
01:58:13,419 --> 01:58:18,447
A mother never has to beg to her son,
she just has to order

1068
01:58:22,428 --> 01:58:26,330
Zaara has always and will
always belong to you

1069
01:58:30,503 --> 01:58:35,202
Did you think that l would've taken
Zaara away without your permission?

1070
01:58:39,178 --> 01:58:47,381
Reople say that love is blind,
so we were also blinded by our love

1071
01:58:48,988 --> 01:58:54,119
We could only see each other
We didn't see if we were harming anyone...

1072
01:58:55,495 --> 01:58:59,295
hurting anyone or...

1073
01:58:59,799 --> 01:59:01,426
if someone's life was at stake...

1074
01:59:03,870 --> 01:59:05,201
we couldn't see anything

1075
01:59:07,573 --> 01:59:09,165
But now everything's clear

1076
01:59:10,910 --> 01:59:19,841
Love can't be more important
than someone's life. Don't you worry...

1077
01:59:21,621 --> 01:59:27,184
Zaara will marry the person
of her parent's choice

1078
01:59:29,195 --> 01:59:32,722
You prepare for the wedding.
l'll talk to Zaara

1079
01:59:36,802 --> 01:59:43,366
l promise you that she will
willingly agree to the marriage

1080
01:59:52,418 --> 01:59:56,548
ls every son from
your country like you?

1081
01:59:59,759 --> 02:00:00,885
l don't know that

1082
02:00:02,528 --> 02:00:08,728
But yes every mother in my country
is exactly like you

1083
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:07,158
lf you think that l've made
a wrong decision...

1084
02:01:09,295 --> 02:01:15,325
then just tell me. No one will be able
to stop me from taking you to lndia

1085
02:01:22,541 --> 02:01:24,509
Your decision is absolutely right

1086
02:01:26,712 --> 02:01:29,180
This has happened because of
one silly mistake on my part

1087
02:01:30,883 --> 02:01:34,512
l'd made a promise to myself
that l won't break

1088
02:01:35,721 --> 02:01:37,848
lf only l'd been able to stop myself
when l saw you yesterday...

1089
02:01:38,057 --> 02:01:38,682
That...

1090
02:01:40,893 --> 02:01:44,522
one silly mistake of yours will help
get me through the rest of my life

1091
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:54,533
lf you'd taken that away from me
then what would l take back with me ?

1092
02:01:57,677 --> 02:01:59,542
Why is God doing this to us?

1093
02:02:00,413 --> 02:02:02,881
l've never done anything wrong
in my life

1094
02:02:03,749 --> 02:02:05,876
So why is he punishing me like this...?

1095
02:02:14,593 --> 02:02:18,791
l'm keeping two moments of
your life with me

1096
02:02:22,468 --> 02:02:24,402
And l'm giving two moments
of my life to you

1097
02:02:27,606 --> 02:02:29,574
These two moments are the symbol
of our love

1098
02:02:31,110 --> 02:02:32,907
These two moments make our love story

1099
02:02:36,449 --> 02:02:39,418
Now we'll live our lives on
these two moments...

1100
02:02:43,622 --> 02:02:48,491
but with a smile

1101
02:02:52,665 --> 02:02:54,599
Neither will our love weaken

1102
02:02:57,870 --> 02:02:59,462
Nor will our duties
remain unfulfilled

1103
02:03:05,745 --> 02:03:10,648
You'll honour your parents
by being a good wife

1104
02:03:12,585 --> 02:03:17,318
And l'll fulfill Bauji's dreams
back in the village

1105
02:03:21,694 --> 02:03:27,132
And after you've had
eight-ten children...

1106
02:03:28,234 --> 02:03:29,496
you bring everyone along
for a visit

1107
02:03:31,637 --> 02:03:38,475
l'll take you for a ride on a cycle
and show you a new village

1108
02:03:42,181 --> 02:03:46,311
But after having eight-ten kids
l won't be able to sit on a cycle

1109
02:03:49,388 --> 02:03:55,293
Yes, you've got a point.
Then l'll arrange for a tractor

1110
02:04:03,002 --> 02:04:12,968
[ Skipped item nr. 1110 ]

1111
02:04:31,330 --> 02:04:35,790
''Was that you or was that
just a fragrant wind''

1112
02:04:36,168 --> 02:04:40,969
''Was that you or were there
colours everywhere''

1113
02:04:42,107 --> 02:04:46,806
''Was that you or were those
shining pathways'

1114
02:04:47,012 --> 02:04:52,814
''Was that you or were those
songs resounding in the atmosphere''

1115
02:04:53,118 --> 02:04:57,851
''Was it you l found,
or was it my Destiny''

1116
02:04:58,057 --> 02:05:03,723
''Was it you or was there
magic in the air''

1117
02:05:04,163 --> 02:05:08,827
''Just for two moments,the caravans of
our dreams made a stop''

1118
02:05:09,068 --> 02:05:14,335
''And then you went your way
and l went mine''

1119
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:19,907
''Just for two moments existed
the story of our hearts''

1120
02:05:20,179 --> 02:05:36,688
''And then you went your way
and l went mine''

1121
02:06:13,899 --> 02:06:16,231
Today's my wedding day Abbaji

1122
02:06:19,271 --> 02:06:21,330
Aren't you going to give me away?

1123
02:06:22,541 --> 02:06:25,908
Aren't you going to put
your hand on my head and bless me?

1124
02:06:35,454 --> 02:06:37,479
Rlease forgive me, my child

1125
02:06:39,992 --> 02:06:46,022
l don't know whether this
is my obligation or my weakness

1126
02:06:50,803 --> 02:06:52,031
Rlease forgive me

1127
02:07:13,626 --> 02:07:17,926
This is a holy amulet.
This will protect you

1128
02:07:19,131 --> 02:07:22,862
The moment you cross the border,
take out the coins...

1129
02:07:23,636 --> 02:07:26,264
and give them to someone needy

1130
02:07:34,146 --> 02:07:38,446
My religion does not permit,
but still from now on...

1131
02:07:39,151 --> 02:07:46,455
l'll pray to Allah everyday and ask Him
to give you Zaara in every other birth

1132
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:09,306
l'm leaving...

1133
02:08:33,706 --> 02:08:34,502
Listen...

1134
02:08:38,711 --> 02:08:40,178
Sign here

1135
02:08:42,047 --> 02:08:43,014
What's this?

1136
02:08:46,051 --> 02:08:49,020
lt says here that my name
is Rajesh Rathore

1137
02:08:49,722 --> 02:08:54,022
l work for the lndian lntelligence RAW
... critical... political... secrecy...

1138
02:08:54,393 --> 02:08:57,123
sending Rakistani secrets to lndia...?
That's correct

1139
02:08:57,329 --> 02:09:01,095
No way. My name is Veer Rratap Singh,
ex-lndian Air Force

1140
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:05,301
l'd come here just two days ago to
visit somebody and now l'm going back

1141
02:09:05,904 --> 02:09:09,203
My passport's in my bag, you can check.
We've found this in your bag

1142
02:09:09,908 --> 02:09:12,809
Your name is written clearly
as Rajesh Rathore

1143
02:09:13,011 --> 02:09:13,875
Let me see

1144
02:09:14,079 --> 02:09:16,377
We have witnesses also
who can recognise you

1145
02:09:18,417 --> 02:09:21,386
What's going on,
why are you doing this?

1146
02:09:21,587 --> 02:09:23,885
Okay... you were just saying that
you were here to meet somebody

1147
02:09:24,757 --> 02:09:27,225
Tell us their names,
we'll call them

1148
02:09:27,426 --> 02:09:28,825
Yes... l'm...

1149
02:09:31,163 --> 02:09:32,528
l'm here...

1150
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:35,896
Tell us

1151
02:09:39,438 --> 02:09:40,564
l didn't come to meet anybody

1152
02:09:40,773 --> 02:09:42,741
Wow, what love

1153
02:09:43,642 --> 02:09:46,509
lf you take her name
she will be disgraced?

1154
02:09:53,218 --> 02:09:58,622
You'll ruin yourself
but won't let your love be damned

1155
02:09:59,958 --> 02:10:04,224
Yes Mr Veer, this's exactly
what l expected of you

1156
02:10:07,299 --> 02:10:11,167
Mr Veer, there's one thing that is
very special about both our countries

1157
02:10:15,140 --> 02:10:20,271
On the basis of power and money
anything is possible. lsn't that so?

1158
02:10:23,315 --> 02:10:26,648
What were you thinking?
That you could come here...

1159
02:10:27,419 --> 02:10:33,619
and declare your love for my wife-to-be
in front of everyone and leave...

1160
02:10:33,859 --> 02:10:38,421
and l'd stand aside
and watch the whole show...?

1161
02:10:42,167 --> 02:10:47,969
Mr Veer l'm about to live my life
with a woman...

1162
02:10:49,174 --> 02:10:51,472
who's in love with someone else

1163
02:10:52,845 --> 02:10:57,305
And it's my bad luck that l can't even
back off from this marriage

1164
02:10:59,852 --> 02:11:01,149
Can you imagine...

1165
02:11:02,187 --> 02:11:10,856
can you imagine...everyday of my life,
will be a living hell

1166
02:11:13,532 --> 02:11:20,495
You and Zaara were the ones who dared
to love... why should l be put to test

1167
02:11:27,379 --> 02:11:30,507
Either your life should
be a living hell...

1168
02:11:32,050 --> 02:11:33,847
or Zaara's,

1169
02:11:35,387 --> 02:11:36,354
Not mine

1170
02:11:43,729 --> 02:11:46,357
You take great pride
in your love, right?

1171
02:11:47,733 --> 02:11:49,860
So now you're being tested

1172
02:11:51,904 --> 02:11:58,207
l can make Zaara's life heaven or hell.
But it's all in your hands

1173
02:12:00,245 --> 02:12:05,205
As long as you sit silently
within the four walls of a prison...

1174
02:12:06,518 --> 02:12:10,716
till then Zaara's life
will be more beautiful than heaven

1175
02:12:12,758 --> 02:12:18,560
The moment you open your mouth
Zaara's life will become worse than hell

1176
02:12:22,768 --> 02:12:25,896
Veer Rratap Singh's identity
has to be destroyed...

1177
02:12:26,271 --> 02:12:29,240
in order to give Zaara a good life

1178
02:12:37,616 --> 02:12:41,245
Now this... is the true
test of love

1179
02:12:44,556 --> 02:12:45,523
l'll take your leave

1180
02:12:49,628 --> 02:12:51,095
lt's time for the wedding

1181
02:12:52,297 --> 02:12:55,755
Either you disgrace the names of Zaara
and her family and buy your freedom

1182
02:12:56,635 --> 02:13:00,435
Or else sign on those papers and ensure
life time of happiness for Zaara

1183
02:13:02,474 --> 02:13:03,805
The decision is in your hands

1184
02:13:05,811 --> 02:13:06,937
Goodbye

''Why is there a tradition of cruelty''

1187
02:13:27,199 --> 02:13:33,035
''Why is the society the way it is''

1188
02:13:33,839 --> 02:13:37,536
''These traditions of this world...
l am completely overwhelmed by them''

1189
02:13:41,713 --> 02:13:45,274
''Do not ask what my complaints are
Or why l've been given this unhappiness''

1190

''What can l tell you,
Why is love a crime''

1191

''Why does one cry
Why does this happen''

1192

''Why is everyone a stranger
to his heart''

Miss Zaara Hayaat Khan
daughter of Jehangir Hayaat Khan

1199
02:14:37,302 --> 02:14:40,100
Your marriage has been fixed
with Raza Shirazi...

1200
02:14:40,305 --> 02:14:44,435
son of Abdul Malik Shirazi at a dowry of...

1201
02:14:44,643 --> 02:14:51,446
five million Rupees.
Do you accept this marriage ?

1202
02:14:51,650 --> 02:14:59,113
''What turn has my story taken''

1203
02:14:59,658 --> 02:15:02,627
Do you accept that your name
is Rajesh Rathore or no?

1204
02:15:12,003 --> 02:15:12,799
l accept

1205
02:15:15,841 --> 02:15:16,466
l accept

1206
02:15:35,026 --> 02:15:39,986
The bus that left from Lahore met with
an accident before it reached lndia

1207
02:15:41,700 --> 02:15:42,826
Nobody survived

1208
02:15:44,202 --> 02:15:46,329
My name was also on the
passenger list

1209
02:15:48,373 --> 02:15:53,242
l was happy that Maati and Bauji
would hear about my death

1210
02:15:55,547 --> 02:15:57,276
lf they got the news
that l was missing...

1211
02:15:58,483 --> 02:16:02,886
then they wouldn't have been able
to live or die in peace

1212
02:16:04,556 --> 02:16:09,016
Now in lndia Veer Rratap Singh
was dead and in Rakistan...

1213
02:16:10,061 --> 02:16:12,029
there was no sign of
Veer Singh left

1214
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:18,529
Now his only identity was...

1215
02:16:20,572 --> 02:16:24,531
prisoner number seven eighty six

1216
02:16:35,287 --> 02:16:37,255
Rrisoner... number,

1217
02:16:38,356 --> 02:16:39,914
Seven eight six

1218
02:16:42,494 --> 02:16:45,554
My country owes you, twenty two years
of your life

1219
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:50,227
l can't bring back
these twenty two years

1220
02:16:53,872 --> 02:16:55,169
But l take a vow...

1221
02:16:56,541 --> 02:16:59,510
that l won't put flowers
on my father's grave until...

1222
02:16:59,711 --> 02:17:04,739
Veer Rratap Singh doesn't get his name,
his identity and his country back

1223
02:17:28,473 --> 02:17:30,600
So Miss Saamiya Siddiqui,
this is your first case?

1224
02:17:30,842 --> 02:17:32,434
Yes.- Congratulations

1225
02:17:32,644 --> 02:17:33,201
Thank you sir

1226
02:17:33,311 --> 02:17:36,109
And you're Defence Counsel on behalf
of the Human Rights Commission...?

1227
02:17:36,314 --> 02:17:38,282
That's right sir.
- Good that's good

1228
02:17:39,150 --> 02:17:42,278
No one representing the Rrosecution?
Well Sir they should be coming.

1229
02:17:42,487 --> 02:17:43,613
May l come in sir?

1230
02:17:44,489 --> 02:17:45,649
Oh it's you Mr Zakir...

1231
02:17:47,659 --> 02:17:50,127
Good morning sir.
- Morning. Come in, take a seat

1232
02:17:51,663 --> 02:17:52,789
That's Mr Zakir Ahmed

1233
02:17:53,498 --> 02:17:56,956
l know. l know him very well

1234
02:18:00,338 --> 02:18:03,307
Sorry Your Honour, you know
the traffic of Lahore...

1235
02:18:04,175 --> 02:18:08,475
Zakir sa'ab, are you presenting the case
on behalf of the Government of Rakistan?

1236
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:11,740
Yes Sir. Actually, l've not been
to court since many days

1237
02:18:12,017 --> 02:18:15,077
Reople may be thinking that Zakir Ahmed
has forgotten how to fight a case

1238
02:18:15,687 --> 02:18:17,746
And anyway, l think this case is
very interesting

1239
02:18:18,189 --> 02:18:19,213
What do you think Saamiya?

1240
02:18:21,693 --> 02:18:24,161
So you both know one another?

1241
02:18:24,362 --> 02:18:28,230
Of course ! Saamiya was working
for us earlier

1242
02:18:28,867 --> 02:18:31,097
But perhaps she didn't approve
of the way we worked...

1243
02:18:31,369 --> 02:18:33,030
so she went over
to the Human Rights camp

1244
02:18:33,705 --> 02:18:38,005
She's a very capable lady,
it'll be fun to fight the case opposite her

1245
02:18:40,378 --> 02:18:44,041
There was a special purpose
for calling both of you here

1246
02:18:45,717 --> 02:18:50,017
lt would be better if both the parties
can have an out of court settlement

1247
02:18:51,222 --> 02:18:52,849
Otherwise the court has fixed
the date for day after tomorrow

1248
02:18:53,892 --> 02:18:56,452
But yes, if the case does not start
day after tomorrow...

1249
02:18:57,228 --> 02:19:01,187
then the next date could be
after six months or maybe even a year

1250
02:19:01,399 --> 02:19:04,527
We're ready Sir. But if the Defence
needs more time then...

1251
02:19:04,736 --> 02:19:06,363
Defence is ready Sir.
- But Saamiya...

1252
02:19:07,405 --> 02:19:11,705
Sir you can fix it for day after tomorrow.
My client has waited...

1253
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:15,141
for twenty two years to get justice.
l can't make him wait any more

1254
02:19:15,413 --> 02:19:17,404
Okay then that's fixed

1255
02:19:19,417 --> 02:19:20,941
l thank you both for coming here

1256
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:23,614
Good day.
- Good day, Sir

1257
02:19:26,758 --> 02:19:31,752
Okay Saamiya l'll see you in court.
Good day

1258
02:19:37,769 --> 02:19:39,566
This was an impossible case
right from the start

1259
02:19:39,771 --> 02:19:42,433
And now with Zakir Ahmed's arrival
there's absolutely no chance

1260
02:19:43,441 --> 02:19:47,741
But this case is too small
for his portfolio...l don't know why

1261
02:19:47,879 --> 02:19:53,078
l can't understand anything. Listen, just
make any excuse and drop this case

1262
02:19:53,451 --> 02:19:57,979
This is your first case and the way
Zakir Ahmed insults the opposition...

1263
02:19:58,456 --> 02:20:01,084
he'll ruin your career.
That's exactly what he wants

1264
02:20:01,793 --> 02:20:04,261
What do you mean?
Saahil, do one thing,

1265
02:20:04,462 --> 02:20:06,760
you go back to
the office & make a list of the witnesses

1266
02:20:06,965 --> 02:20:08,091
l'll be there in a while...

1267
02:20:08,299 --> 02:20:10,324
But where're you going?
- To meet Zakir Ahmed

1268
02:20:11,469 --> 02:20:11,935
What...?

1269
02:20:15,473 --> 02:20:21,935
Miss Saamiya Siddiqui you'd sworn that
you'd never step into my office

1270
02:20:22,814 --> 02:20:24,941
Then how could you bear
to come here today?

1271
02:20:25,817 --> 02:20:30,777
There's nothing like that Sir, just
my principles differed from yours

1272
02:20:31,623 --> 02:20:34,990
And l thought that if l could not
respect working by your principles...

1273
02:20:35,326 --> 02:20:41,026
then it's better that l leave.
- lnteresting, very interesting

1274
02:20:42,167 --> 02:20:44,465
You've developed great principles
at a young age

1275
02:20:44,836 --> 02:20:47,304
My principles have been passed on
to me as my father's legacy

1276
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:50,034
Do you know that you're
the first person, Saamiya...

1277
02:20:50,842 --> 02:20:55,040
who refused to take a case
offered by Zakir Ahmed

1278
02:20:55,847 --> 02:20:59,146
Here people wait for years in the hope
of getting their first case

1279
02:21:00,185 --> 02:21:03,382
But l recognised your capability,
l chose you...

1280
02:21:04,189 --> 02:21:06,657
l ignored your age,
your inexperience...

1281
02:21:06,858 --> 02:21:10,817
and even the fact that you're a woman.
And what did you do inspite of that?

1282
02:21:11,362 --> 02:21:16,823
You threw the case back in my face.
lt would've set a criminal free, Sir

1283
02:21:17,702 --> 02:21:18,669
And according to me
that would've been wrong

1284
02:21:18,870 --> 02:21:23,000
lt's not a lawyer's job to decide
what's right or wrong. lt's the court's job

1285
02:21:23,208 --> 02:21:27,542
A lawyer's duty is to win the case
under any circumstance. Nothing else

1286
02:21:29,047 --> 02:21:30,947
Well, that's the difference
between you and me, Sir

1287
02:21:31,716 --> 02:21:35,550
Your principle is to fight to win
and my principle is to fight for the truth

1288
02:21:37,055 --> 02:21:43,290
lnteresting, very interesting!
So now you're giving me lessons in law

1289
02:21:44,229 --> 02:21:46,094
This was all that was left
for me to experience

1290
02:21:47,065 --> 02:21:51,866
Let's forget the past, otherwise we'll
keep opening up old wounds

1291
02:21:53,238 --> 02:21:56,036
lf you've taken the trouble
to come all the way here...

1292
02:21:56,241 --> 02:22:02,441
then it must be something important.
Sit. What can Zakir Ahmed do for you?

1293
02:22:06,918 --> 02:22:11,446
Look Sir, being my first case
it's obvious that...

1294
02:22:11,756 --> 02:22:12,882
l will make some mistakes...

1295
02:22:14,592 --> 02:22:17,459
and now that you're the opposition
the problems will increase

1296
02:22:18,763 --> 02:22:21,459
Because of some trifle on my part...

1297
02:22:22,100 --> 02:22:25,194
l don't want that lndian prisoner's
freedom to be revoked. Because...

1298
02:22:25,403 --> 02:22:31,000
he's completely innocent.
That's true. A great injustice...

1299
02:22:31,209 --> 02:22:34,736
has been done to him Sir
and he truly deserves his freedom

1300
02:22:38,283 --> 02:22:40,342
Finally you've stooped down
to our level

1301
02:22:41,619 --> 02:22:45,817
Basically you've come asking for help
to win your first case, right?

1302
02:22:48,293 --> 02:22:52,252
Defeating Zakir Ahmed takes your career
off to a flying start ! No...?

1303
02:22:53,298 --> 02:22:56,597
Have you forgotten that Zakir Ahmed
has never lost a case as yet?

1304
02:22:57,201 --> 02:22:59,431
And now it's very important for me
to win this case...

1305
02:23:00,305 --> 02:23:04,173
because l want to teach a lesson to
headstrong youngsters like yourself...

1306
02:23:04,809 --> 02:23:09,610
the repercussions of not following
Zakir Ahmed's principles

1307
02:23:12,483 --> 02:23:14,110
What's the matter
Miss Saamiya Siddique?

1308
02:23:14,986 --> 02:23:20,288
Lost faith in your principles of truth
that you come begging for a win?

1309
02:23:21,326 --> 02:23:25,194
Rlease forgive me Sir, for a while
l thought that you were almost human

1310
02:23:26,998 --> 02:23:28,727
l just came to discuss
if there's any possibility of...

1311
02:23:29,167 --> 02:23:32,295
giving this man his freedom
without taking this case to court

1312
02:23:32,670 --> 02:23:37,972
But you mistook my humanity
to be my weakness

1313
02:23:40,845 --> 02:23:45,407
Now we'll meet in court.
Be prepared to lose your first case...

1314
02:23:46,684 --> 02:23:51,815
because now prisoner 786
is being sent to lndia... and...

1315
02:23:52,023 --> 02:23:54,082
neither you nor the
State of Rakistan is stopping me

1316
02:24:00,031 --> 02:24:00,656
lnteresting

1317
02:24:01,966 --> 02:24:03,160
Very interesting

1318
02:24:08,206 --> 02:24:09,503
Can l ask you one question...?

1319
02:24:11,376 --> 02:24:13,571
You hadn't spoken to anyone
in all these years...

1320
02:24:14,712 --> 02:24:16,907
then why did you tell me your story?

1321
02:24:21,386 --> 02:24:24,685
You called me by my name

1322
02:24:25,890 --> 02:24:26,515
What...?

1323
02:24:28,559 --> 02:24:36,694
You're the first person
who didn't doubt my innocence...

1324
02:24:36,901 --> 02:24:38,869
that l am Veer Singh

1325
02:24:42,907 --> 02:24:48,368
The truth is that in all these years
l'd forgotten my own identity...

1326
02:24:51,749 --> 02:24:58,382
you reminded me of who l am, you gave me
respect by calling me by my name

1327
02:24:59,857 --> 02:25:03,816
Veer Rratap Singh

1328
02:25:09,434 --> 02:25:15,839
For a prisoner who has been insulted
for the last twenty two years...

1329
02:25:17,275 --> 02:25:20,904
this was a great thing!
Great thing

1330
02:25:31,789 --> 02:25:32,915
Now l'll eat some more, okay?

1331
02:25:39,297 --> 02:25:42,460
Tomorrow is our first day in court.
You remember your promise, don't you?

1332
02:25:44,135 --> 02:25:46,262
That you're going to change out of the
garb of seven eighty six and come as...

1333
02:25:46,471 --> 02:25:48,598
Squadron Leader Veer Rratap Singh

1334
02:25:50,808 --> 02:25:52,673
No. - What?

1335
02:25:54,145 --> 02:25:56,443
Do you remember your promise?
- Of course l remember it

1336
02:25:56,814 --> 02:25:59,942
Under no circumstances am l to mention
name of Zaara or the Hayaat Khan family

1337
02:26:01,152 --> 02:26:05,213
You keep your promise
and l'll keep mine

1338
02:26:32,683 --> 02:26:36,710
Your Honour, Defence would like
to call its first witness

1339
02:26:41,192 --> 02:26:43,057
Defence calls its first witness

1340
02:26:46,197 --> 02:26:47,994
Defence rests Your Honour

1341
02:27:48,726 --> 02:27:51,752
l call upon the Rrosecution
to present its case

1342
02:27:54,599 --> 02:27:55,224
Your Honour...

1343
02:27:56,934 --> 02:28:01,735
a man has been in prison
for the past twenty two years...

1344
02:28:03,107 --> 02:28:08,272
and that prison is in Rakistan.
And that man...

1345
02:28:08,613 --> 02:28:12,413
who was imprisoned in a Rakistani jail
since twenty two years is...

1346
02:28:13,517 --> 02:28:16,077
an lndian

1347
02:28:17,955 --> 02:28:25,259
Hearing this, you, me, and everyone
sitting in this courtroom...

1348
02:28:25,463 --> 02:28:29,695
will have tears in their eyes.
And we'll hope for some way...

1349
02:28:30,635 --> 02:28:34,696
that man can go back
to his country...to his home

1350
02:28:35,806 --> 02:28:39,264
Because we are human
and we've been taught...

1351
02:28:39,477 --> 02:28:43,277
to respect all human beings.
But Your Honour...

1352
02:28:44,649 --> 02:28:48,847
in a court of law what man can't
see the law can...

1353
02:28:49,654 --> 02:28:52,316
and according to the law
the State is bigger than the individual

1354
02:28:52,990 --> 02:28:55,788
And for a person who works against
the interests of the country...

1355
02:28:55,993 --> 02:28:58,985
even being sentenced to death
twenty two times is less

1356
02:29:06,337 --> 02:29:08,999
This case is as transparent as water

1357
02:29:09,674 --> 02:29:12,074
There's no question of any doubt

1358
02:29:12,843 --> 02:29:14,470
Rrosecution will in a matter
of just thirty minutes...

1359
02:29:14,679 --> 02:29:17,648
and with the help of just three witnesses
prove without a doubt...

1360
02:29:18,015 --> 02:29:19,983
that the defendant Rajesh Rathore
is not worthy...

1361
02:29:20,184 --> 02:29:22,812
of going back to his country
or his home until his dying day

1362
02:29:24,188 --> 02:29:25,212
That's all Your Honour

1363
02:29:26,857 --> 02:29:29,826
Now l call upon the Defence
to present their case

1364
02:29:32,697 --> 02:29:35,097
Ms Siddiqui, best of luck

1365
02:30:03,060 --> 02:30:06,860
Your Honour, Rrosecution Counsel
Mr Zaheer Khan was very quick to...

1366
02:30:07,064 --> 02:30:08,031
Zakir Ahmed

1367
02:30:08,232 --> 02:30:10,928
say that this case
is as transparent as water

1368
02:30:11,402 --> 02:30:13,700
But Mr Zaheer Khan forgets...
Ms Saamiya Siddique...

1369
02:30:13,904 --> 02:30:16,702
My name is Zakir Ahmed!
- Being called by another name once...

1370
02:30:16,907 --> 02:30:19,375
has infuriated you to such
an extent? Then just think...

1371
02:30:19,577 --> 02:30:22,045
if you were called by another name every
single day for twenty two years...

1372
02:30:22,246 --> 02:30:23,372
can you imagine, what would
it feel like then?

1373
02:30:28,252 --> 02:30:31,881
Your Honour this case is not being
fought to send an lndian back...

1374
02:30:32,089 --> 02:30:36,219
to his country or his home. This case
is being fought to give a man back...

1375
02:30:36,427 --> 02:30:40,557
his identity, his individuality...
Someone is asking you...

1376
02:30:40,765 --> 02:30:43,962
to give him back his name !
He's telling you that...

1377
02:30:45,536 --> 02:30:46,628
l am Veer Rratap Singh

1378
02:30:47,271 --> 02:30:50,399
ex-lndian Air Force Officer
Squadron Leader Veer Rratap Singh

1379
02:30:52,777 --> 02:30:54,904
Just give me back
the respectability of my name

1380
02:30:55,946 --> 02:30:57,311
l don't want anything else

1381
02:30:59,450 --> 02:31:02,112
Maybe not in thirty minutes
like the Rrosecution Counsel...

1382
02:31:02,453 --> 02:31:04,978
but l will definitely prove that
this man is not Rajesh Rathore...

1383
02:31:05,122 --> 02:31:07,886
but he is Veer Rratap Singh.
Then whether you send him to lndia...

1384
02:31:08,092 --> 02:31:11,789
or keep him in Rakistan,
that is in your hands

1385
02:31:12,396 --> 02:31:14,193
That's all Your Honour

1386
02:31:15,466 --> 02:31:17,661
Now Rrosecution may call upon
it's witnesses

1387
02:31:18,135 --> 02:31:23,767
l'd like to call upon my first witness
Rolice Officer Dilbaaz Khan...

1388
02:31:24,141 --> 02:31:31,479
who had arrested Rajesh Rathod
twenty two years ago

1389
02:31:31,816 --> 02:31:35,343
Could you tell the court without
any doubt or hesitation...

1390
02:31:36,153 --> 02:31:40,021
who this man is?
Yes Sir, l remember very well

1391
02:31:40,658 --> 02:31:44,458
This man is an lndian spy.
He's an agent of RAW, Rajesh Rathore

1392
02:31:45,496 --> 02:31:48,294
Some twenty two years ago,
Anwar Ali and myself...

1393
02:31:48,499 --> 02:31:51,627
we forced him to get off a bus going
from Lahore to lndia and arrested him

1394
02:31:52,503 --> 02:31:54,300
We had received an
intelligence report...

1395
02:31:54,839 --> 02:31:57,637
that this man was
conspiring against Rakistan.

1396
02:31:57,842 --> 02:31:58,467
Good

1397
02:31:58,576 --> 02:32:04,310
Mr Anwar Ali, can you tell me,
if you found in his bag...

1398
02:32:04,515 --> 02:32:06,983
a passport identifying him
as Rajesh Rathore...

1399
02:32:07,351 --> 02:32:11,310
then how is it possible that
this same man's ticket...

1400
02:32:11,522 --> 02:32:13,046
was booked in the name of
Veer Rratap Singh?

1401
02:32:13,858 --> 02:32:15,985
But Sir, that was the thing...

1402
02:32:16,694 --> 02:32:21,654
Honour, this person also had a passport
in the name of Veer Rratap Singh

1403
02:32:22,032 --> 02:32:25,331
And how could one person
have two passports?

1404
02:32:26,036 --> 02:32:29,062
For this reason our suspicion
changed to certainty

1405
02:32:29,540 --> 02:32:34,671
And after we questioned him,
he himself signed the affidavit...

1406
02:32:34,879 --> 02:32:36,676
l, Rajesh Rathore

1407
02:32:40,217 --> 02:32:41,741
l've being seeing him
for the last ten years

1408
02:32:42,553 --> 02:32:45,078
He was always quiet
and kept to himself

1409
02:32:45,389 --> 02:32:47,289
He never communicated with any one

1410
02:32:48,392 --> 02:32:53,557
But whenever a prisoner
was ill or upset...

1411
02:32:54,565 --> 02:32:57,557
he would go forth
to heal him and comfort him

1412
02:32:58,903 --> 02:33:03,101
l don't know if he is
Veer Rratap Singh or Rajesh Rathore...

1413
02:33:04,241 --> 02:33:07,540
for me he's just 786

1414
02:33:09,413 --> 02:33:10,380
God's own man

1415
02:33:13,083 --> 02:33:17,918
Yes Sir, this Hindu here is
Allah's noble servant

1416
02:33:18,923 --> 02:33:24,657
He spent twenty two years in prison.
Can't be greater punishment than this

1417
02:33:26,597 --> 02:33:31,227
Send him back to his homeland...

1418
02:33:32,269 --> 02:33:35,568
send him back

1419
02:33:35,773 --> 02:33:41,234
Looks like you, Mr Majid Khan, have no
great love for your country Rakistan

1420
02:33:42,279 --> 02:33:47,410
lf it were up to you then every person
who had spied upon Rakistan...

1421
02:33:47,618 --> 02:33:50,086
every conspirator, should be set
free by the court?

1422
02:33:50,621 --> 02:33:54,580
Sir, that's not what l meant...
Just reply with a yes or a no

1423
02:33:54,792 --> 02:33:56,953
Mr Majid Khan, only with
a yes or no

1424
02:33:59,630 --> 02:34:00,255
No.

1425
02:34:00,464 --> 02:34:00,930
Good

1426
02:34:01,632 --> 02:34:02,155
Your witness

1427
02:34:05,302 --> 02:34:06,496
No questions Your Honour

1428
02:34:13,644 --> 02:34:17,444
The next date for this
case is after a week,

1429
02:34:17,648 --> 02:34:20,617
Before me, on Monday, 21st March

1430
02:34:21,986 --> 02:34:23,783
On that day l will hear
the Defence's case

1431
02:34:24,655 --> 02:34:27,180
And immediately after that
l will give my judgement

1432
02:34:28,325 --> 02:34:29,849
Defence should be ready
with their case

1433
02:34:30,995 --> 02:34:33,122
Adjourned

1434
02:34:56,687 --> 02:34:58,086
l'll have to mention
Zaara's name...

1435
02:34:58,355 --> 02:34:59,049
No...

1436
02:34:59,523 --> 02:35:01,821
Rlease... for once...

1437
02:35:02,026 --> 02:35:05,154
let me bring Zaara or any one person
from the Hayaat family to the court...

1438
02:35:05,362 --> 02:35:07,193
and in a moment the verdict
will swing to our favour

1439
02:35:07,865 --> 02:35:08,729
Absolutely not...

1440
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:13,931
Why don't you try and understand?
We're losing this case

1441
02:35:14,872 --> 02:35:17,397
The court does not have time
for prisoners like you...

1442
02:35:19,877 --> 02:35:22,402
in this country there are
too many prisoners and too few courts

1443
02:35:23,881 --> 02:35:27,339
A lot of prisoners' cases
come up after they're dead

1444
02:35:29,053 --> 02:35:30,748
You'll never get
such an opportunity again

1445
02:35:32,056 --> 02:35:36,618
You'll die lying right here...
you'll die ! Don't you understand?

1446
02:35:45,235 --> 02:35:47,863
Zaara must be the mother
of two by now

1447
02:35:52,910 --> 02:35:59,440
She perhaps has a 21 year old daughter
and a 19 year old boy

1448
02:36:00,584 --> 02:36:03,917
She must've passed through all the
good and bad times of her life

1449
02:36:06,256 --> 02:36:11,558
Her days, her evenings must've
settled down to a fine rhythm

1450
02:36:15,432 --> 02:36:17,559
Must be a peaceful life now for Zaara

1451
02:36:23,774 --> 02:36:26,242
And tomorrow you'll drag her to court
and in front of everyone...

1452
02:36:26,443 --> 02:36:28,468
you'll ask her
who's Veer Rratap Singh ?

1453
02:36:29,613 --> 02:36:33,947
Questions will be raised, what is
the relationship between Veer and Zaara?

1454
02:36:34,618 --> 02:36:36,415
And no one will be able
to understand the answers...

1455
02:36:36,620 --> 02:36:38,679
no one will understand

1456
02:36:40,290 --> 02:36:42,190
ln an instant that Raza Shirazi
will divorce her. Zaara's life...

1457
02:36:42,393 --> 02:36:52,769
will be ruined. She must be
living peacefully

1458
02:36:56,974 --> 02:37:00,307
For the last twenty two years
l have been guarding her honour

1459
02:37:02,479 --> 02:37:08,179
Today how can l trample upon
her honour and go home?

1460
02:37:17,327 --> 02:37:18,624
l can't do this Saamiya

1461
02:37:18,829 --> 02:37:22,959
And l know you won't
be able to do it either

1462
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:38,312
l'm sorry, for a while being a
lawyer made me forget my humanity

1463
02:37:39,683 --> 02:37:40,581
l forgot...

1464
02:37:40,717 --> 02:37:45,245
That Veer and Zaara's names
can never be taken together

1465
02:37:51,195 --> 02:37:55,154
Now there's only one way out...
l'll have to go to lndia...

1466
02:37:59,369 --> 02:38:02,896
to bring Veer Rratap Singh's
identity from his country

1467
02:38:04,374 --> 02:38:05,170
Time is short

1468
02:38:06,276 --> 02:38:08,710
l'm leaving.
Take care

1469
02:38:13,717 --> 02:38:14,240
Saamiya...

1470
02:38:21,391 --> 02:38:27,023
Until now this amulet has protected me,
now it will protect you

1471
02:38:35,739 --> 02:38:36,535
lf l lose...

1472
02:38:38,141 --> 02:38:39,608
will you forgive me...?

1473
02:38:43,914 --> 02:38:44,812
On one condition...

1474
02:38:48,085 --> 02:38:49,313
every day you must bring me...

1475
02:38:50,354 --> 02:38:52,219
laddoos

1476
02:38:57,594 --> 02:38:58,151
Take care

1477
02:39:20,450 --> 02:39:21,576
Excuse me...

1478
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:33,589
can you show me where
Chaudhry Sumer Singh's house is?

1479
02:39:33,797 --> 02:39:36,095
Yes... the largest house
at the corner there...

1480
02:39:36,300 --> 02:39:38,268
that's Chaudhry saab's house.
- Thanks

1481
02:39:38,468 --> 02:39:42,427
But who're you looking for ?
For Mr Singh and his wife...

1482
02:39:43,473 --> 02:39:45,668
lt's been years since
both of them died...

1483
02:39:51,315 --> 02:39:54,478
But if you want to see the house
you're most welcome

1484
02:39:54,985 --> 02:39:56,009
That house is always open

1485
02:39:56,486 --> 02:39:59,785
l'm in a bit of a hurry,
please forgive me, goodbye

1486
02:40:49,039 --> 02:40:51,064
Zaara, oh Zaara...

1487
02:41:03,720 --> 02:41:04,744
l'm not sparing you

1488
02:41:28,412 --> 02:41:30,243
Hey who're you, what d'you want?

1489
02:41:33,417 --> 02:41:34,441
Hey why're you crying?

1490
02:41:38,922 --> 02:41:40,321
Say something, are you
deaf or what?

1491
02:41:43,927 --> 02:41:45,724
Hey Shabbo, look here's a visitor

1492
02:41:45,929 --> 02:41:47,453
And you Jassi... come here

1493
02:41:51,268 --> 02:41:52,997
Oh you'll be the death of me

1494
02:41:55,105 --> 02:41:56,129
l'll tell your Ma,
you aren't studying...

1495
02:41:58,608 --> 02:42:00,075
Yes... tell me...

1496
02:42:00,277 --> 02:42:01,744
what do you want?

1497
02:42:02,779 --> 02:42:04,804
You're Shabbo...?

1498
02:42:05,449 --> 02:42:06,746
Who else can l be?

1499
02:42:09,286 --> 02:42:11,015
And she's...

1500
02:42:11,221 --> 02:42:12,347
Zaara?

1501
02:42:13,623 --> 02:42:15,147
You came asking this?

1502
02:42:15,625 --> 02:42:17,923
ls she Zaara Hayaat Khan?

1503
02:42:20,464 --> 02:42:22,022
How do you know this name?

1504
02:42:22,632 --> 02:42:27,035
She's Jehangir Hayaat Khan's
daughter from Lahore?

1505
02:42:30,974 --> 02:42:31,941
Who are you?

1506
02:42:36,613 --> 02:42:41,312
After hearing about Veer's death,
Zaara called off the marriage

1507
02:42:44,287 --> 02:42:46,585
Abbaji himself got her divorced

1508
02:42:48,625 --> 02:42:53,653
Zaara came here to help Bauji and Maati
... to make Veer's dream come true

1509
02:42:56,133 --> 02:43:01,662
Raza settled overseas.
Abbaji left politics

1510
02:43:03,473 --> 02:43:11,676
He died two years afterwards,
a few years later Ma'am also died

1511
02:43:13,984 --> 02:43:16,885
The Hayaat Khan name
no longer existed

1512
02:43:19,823 --> 02:43:22,018
Today Bauji and Maati
are also no more

1513
02:43:23,660 --> 02:43:26,959
But she won't go back. She says...

1514
02:43:27,631 --> 02:43:34,560
My soul is embedded here.
Now l'll live and die here

1515
02:43:41,845 --> 02:43:43,574
Which century are these
people from Shabbo?

1516
02:43:45,182 --> 02:43:51,382
There's a Veer who so easily sacrificed
twenty two years of his life...

1517
02:43:52,856 --> 02:43:54,721
to protect Zaara's honour...

1518
02:43:56,193 --> 02:43:59,822
and there's Zaara who spent
twenty two years of her life...

1519
02:44:01,097 --> 02:44:06,399
in a strange land
to keep Veer's dream alive

1520
02:44:09,639 --> 02:44:15,077
Are they humans pretending to be Gods
or are they Gods disguised as humans?

1521
02:44:44,274 --> 02:44:44,797
This...

1522
02:44:47,277 --> 02:44:49,245
was my mother's

1523
02:44:52,282 --> 02:44:59,916
Twenty two years ago Mariam Hayaat Khan
had tied this amulet on an lndian...

1524
02:45:00,123 --> 02:45:03,183
while bidding him goodbye
so that it would protect him

1525
02:45:06,129 --> 02:45:10,793
That person did not reach lndia
but for twenty two years...

1526
02:45:11,034 --> 02:45:13,764
this charm has been protecting him

1527
02:45:16,973 --> 02:45:18,372
That person's name is...

1528
02:45:20,744 --> 02:45:21,438
Veer Rratap Singh

1529
02:45:29,653 --> 02:45:34,613
He's in prison, in a jail in Lahore

1530
02:45:36,993 --> 02:45:38,290
l am his lawyer

1531
02:45:40,497 --> 02:45:44,058
And l've come to take you to him

1532
02:45:55,011 --> 02:46:01,883
For the last twenty two years
God has been testing you both intensely

1533
02:46:04,688 --> 02:46:08,818
But now not even God
can separate Zaara and Veer

1534
02:46:10,360 --> 02:46:14,558
Not even God

1535
02:46:28,211 --> 02:46:32,238
Mr Saahil Farrouqi l'm asking you
where is the Defence Counsel?

1536
02:46:32,716 --> 02:46:34,183
Your Honour, she must be on her way

1537
02:46:34,384 --> 02:46:36,511
Looks like she has decided to
give up the case

1538
02:46:36,720 --> 02:46:38,017
Rlease begin with the proceedings

1539
02:46:38,221 --> 02:46:39,188
lrresponsible...

1540
02:46:40,056 --> 02:46:43,253
absolutely irresponsible of the
Defence Counsel not to have arrived

1541
02:46:44,394 --> 02:46:47,022
Mr Saahil Farrouqi, do you have
anything to say?

1542
02:46:47,897 --> 02:46:52,391
Your Honour, Saamiya... l mean my
learned colleague should be here soon

1543
02:46:52,902 --> 02:46:53,527
There's no problem...

1544
02:46:53,737 --> 02:46:56,865
There is a problem Mr Farrouqi,
there is a problem

1545
02:46:58,742 --> 02:47:02,041
lt's no small matter to waste
the court's time in this manner

1546
02:47:03,079 --> 02:47:05,547
Especially when
l had clearly specified...

1547
02:47:05,749 --> 02:47:08,217
that this day has been reserved
for the Defence's case...

1548
02:47:08,418 --> 02:47:10,784
then what is the reason
for her absence from the court?

1549
02:47:11,121 --> 02:47:13,885
lt's obvious that the
Defence does not have a case

1550
02:47:14,424 --> 02:47:18,554
Silence on the defendant's part and no
one appearing on behalf of the Defence...

1551
02:47:35,245 --> 02:47:45,211
[ Skipped item nr. 1551 ]

1552
02:48:13,316 --> 02:48:18,151
''For you, l have lived all these days''

1553
02:48:18,521 --> 02:48:22,150
''With my lips sealed''

1554
02:48:22,725 --> 02:48:31,099
''For you, l have lived all these days,
with my unshed tears''

1555
02:48:31,668 --> 02:48:36,503
''But in my heart,
the flames of love''

1556
02:48:37,207 --> 02:48:46,115
''Have always been burning for you,
only for you''

1557
02:49:43,173 --> 02:49:47,405
''Life has brought me...''

1558
02:49:47,844 --> 02:49:52,076
''A volume of old times''

1559
02:50:01,891 --> 02:50:10,492
''And l am surrounded by
countless memories''

1560
02:50:11,267 --> 02:50:19,675
''Unasked, l have now found
all the answers l sought''

1561
02:50:20,176 --> 02:50:22,201
''Look, what l yearned for''

1562
02:50:22,679 --> 02:50:24,772
''And what l got''

1563
02:50:25,415 --> 02:50:29,010
''But in my heart, the flames of love''

1564
02:50:29,219 --> 02:50:44,294
''Have always been burning for you,
only for you''

1565
02:51:03,119 --> 02:51:11,993
''How can l describe
the cruelty of this world''

1566
02:51:21,904 --> 02:51:30,505
''l was ordered that l have to live
but without you''

1567
02:51:31,247 --> 02:51:39,586
''Unwise are those who say that
to me you are unknown''

1568
02:51:40,156 --> 02:51:49,030
''So many ordeals, were heaped
on me by this world''

1569
02:51:49,232 --> 02:51:54,192
''But in my heart, the flames of love''

1570
02:51:55,071 --> 02:52:03,103
''Have always been burning for you,
only for you''

1571
02:52:03,313 --> 02:52:08,376
''For you, l have lived
all these days''

1572
02:52:08,751 --> 02:52:12,585
''With my lips sealed''

1573
02:52:12,955 --> 02:52:21,886
''For you, l have lived all these days,
with my unshed tears''

1574
02:52:22,098 --> 02:52:33,566
''But in my heart, the flames of love,
have always been burning for you''

1575
02:52:33,776 --> 02:52:45,916
''Only for you''

1576
02:53:00,470 --> 02:53:02,461
Zaara Hayaat Khan's testimony...

1577
02:53:04,474 --> 02:53:09,207
and photographs and documents
presented by her prove that...

1578
02:53:10,480 --> 02:53:15,474
this man is not Rajesh Rathore
but that he is Veer Rratap Singh

1579
02:53:17,153 --> 02:53:22,216
And to prevent disgracing
the honour of a Rakistani girl...

1580
02:53:23,493 --> 02:53:25,688
Veer Rratap Singh signed
that affidavit

1581
02:53:27,663 --> 02:53:33,966
Squadron Leader Veer Rratap Singh,
this court exonerates you

1582
02:53:42,178 --> 02:53:44,976
Go on Veer Rratap Singh, go on

1583
02:53:46,182 --> 02:53:49,481
You have the right to return to your
country with your head held high

1584
02:53:53,856 --> 02:53:59,158
And for the precious twenty two years
of your life wasted in prison...

1585
02:54:00,196 --> 02:54:04,826
the State of Rakistan and this court
asks your forgiveness

1586
02:54:07,036 --> 02:54:10,597
lf you wish to speak, you may

1587
02:54:29,392 --> 02:54:34,955
l prisoner number seven eighty six...

1588
02:54:35,898 --> 02:54:37,866
Look through the bars of the jail

1589
02:54:39,569 --> 02:54:43,528
l see days months years
change to eons

1590
02:54:45,908 --> 02:54:50,868
From the soil of this land comes
the fragrance of my Bauji's fields

1591
02:54:53,583 --> 02:54:58,043
This burning sun reminds me of
my Maati's cool buttermilk

1592
02:55:01,257 --> 02:55:05,660
This rain brings along with it
the swings of my seasons...

1593
02:55:07,263 --> 02:55:11,131
this winter fills me with the warmth
of the fires of my Lodi

1594
02:55:14,604 --> 02:55:22,067
They say that this is not your country
then why does it feel like mine''

1595
02:55:25,114 --> 02:55:31,485
He says that l am not like him
then why does he look like me...?''

1597
02:55:40,630 --> 02:55:44,498
l see an angel
who has come down from heaven

1598
02:55:46,135 --> 02:55:50,697
She calls herself Saamiya
and she calls me Veer''

1599
02:55:52,808 --> 02:55:57,302
She's a complete stranger
but treats me as her own''

1600
02:55:59,315 --> 02:56:03,775
Hearing her truthful words
l feel like living once more''

1601
02:56:06,155 --> 02:56:10,387
Hearing her promises and vows
l feel like doing something more''

1602
02:56:12,662 --> 02:56:19,192
They say that she is no one of mine
then why does she fight the world for me?''

1603
02:56:21,504 --> 02:56:27,306
He says that l'm not like her
then why does she look like me...?''

in the colours of my village

ln making my dreams come true
she has forgotten her own...''

1607

in serving my people
she has left behind her own''

1608
02:57:04,046 --> 02:57:08,574
Now l feel like filling her
being with happiness

1609
02:57:10,720 --> 02:57:15,384
l feel like living
another lifetime for her

1610
02:57:18,060 --> 02:57:25,125
They say that my country is not hers
then why is she staying in my home''

1611
02:57:26,402 --> 02:57:31,863
He says that l'm not like her
then why does she look like me...''

1613
02:58:32,301 --> 02:58:32,926
Saamiya

1614
02:58:35,304 --> 02:58:36,271
Congratulations

1615
02:58:38,808 --> 02:58:39,433
Thank you

1616
02:58:43,312 --> 02:58:44,540
This was my last case

1617
02:58:46,148 --> 02:58:48,343
l'm giving up law

1618
02:58:50,319 --> 02:58:54,449
Because you've taught me that
l'm not fit for this work

1619
02:58:56,158 --> 02:58:59,457
l always thought that
a country's progress is measured...

1620
02:59:00,062 --> 02:59:04,226
to it's judicial system.
But now l understand that...

1621
02:59:04,667 --> 02:59:09,036
the future of both these countries is
in the hands of youngsters like you...

1622
02:59:10,172 --> 02:59:15,974
who do not measure humans as
big-small, man-woman, Hindu-Muslim...

1623
02:59:18,180 --> 02:59:23,812
who don't rake up bitter war memories
of 1947-1965 and 1999 on every pretext

1624
02:59:25,254 --> 02:59:30,419
Who wish to address the future
with the truth and only the truth...

1625
02:59:32,027 --> 02:59:36,828
and there's no stopping a country
where Truth prevails

1626
02:59:40,369 --> 02:59:41,267
Thank you Saamiya

1627
02:59:42,371 --> 02:59:45,534
Thank you for teaching me
the value of truth and justice

1628
02:59:49,211 --> 02:59:53,671
Your father would've been proud of you,
he would've been very proud

1629
02:59:56,719 --> 02:59:57,310
l am

1630
03:00:01,690 --> 03:00:02,179
Goodbye

1631
03:00:46,101 --> 03:00:50,800
Veer had lost Zaara in Rakistan.
So Veer and Zaara...

1632
03:00:51,273 --> 03:00:52,604
will be joined together
on Rakistani soil

1633
03:00:59,949 --> 03:01:03,350
Here take this...
make our Zaara yours forever

1634
03:01:23,472 --> 03:01:28,273
You said, Veer and Zaara's names
can never be taken together

1635
03:01:28,978 --> 03:01:33,711
Now Veer and Zaara's names
have been joined together forever

1636
03:01:38,153 --> 03:01:39,450
What Veer says is true

1637
03:01:40,489 --> 03:01:44,789
You're an angel...
sent only for us by God

1638
03:01:49,498 --> 03:01:54,401
Go on...
look your country awaits you

1639
03:02:14,523 --> 03:02:15,217
Come Zaara

1640
03:02:17,860 --> 03:02:18,485
Let us go home

1641
03:02:25,123 --> 03:02:28,123
