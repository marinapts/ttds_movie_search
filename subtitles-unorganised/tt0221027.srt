1
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,384
That's a nice boy.

2
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:54,387
Go get him, Dulli.

3
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:56,389
Get in.

4
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:06,332
- We good?
- Oh, yeah.

5
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:11,326
Are we good? Yeah, we're good. We're beautiful. We're perfect.

6
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:16,331
This is grade-A. 100% pure Colombian cocaine, ladies and gentlemen.

7
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:19,345
Disco shit. Pure as the driven snow.

8
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,348
My name is George Jung...

9
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:25,351
federal inmate number 19225004.

10
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:30,356
I was born in New England...

11
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,359
Massachusetts, actually, in a town called Weymouth.

12
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:34,360
That's me.

13
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:37,363
And that's my best friend, Tuna.

14
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:40,366
My dad ran a plumbing and heating company.

15
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,359
He hard three trucks, ten employees and did big jobs.

16
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:46,372
- He was my hero.
- Did you do it?

17
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:49,375
- I didn't fall once.
- Attaboy. See you tonight, okay?

18
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:53,368
- Can I please come to work with you?
- Fred. Let's go. Say goodbye.

19
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:58,373
Clam it. I'll talk to my boy as long as I want to. Ya got a problem with that?

20
00:04:03,356 --> 00:04:05,324
You really want to some?

21
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,328
What the heck? All right.

22
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:14,322
- All right, get your boots.
- Thanks, Dad. Thanks.

23
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:19,327
Bill, what's your problem? Guess who's on clean up today. And buyin' lunch.

24
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:22,341
Money! M-O-N-E-Y! That's your job, not mine!

25
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,344
Dad worked hard, but didn't earn enough to please Mom.

26
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:27,346
Why do you think I married you?

27
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,348
She'd thought she'd married above her class.

28
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:32,351
He'd promised her the moon, but didn't deliver.

29
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:36,344
The true was, business got slow and we were broke.

30
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:38,357
Don't touch me! Look at your hands.

31
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:40,359
Please, not in front of the boy.

32
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:42,361
The boy, the boy! What about me, Fred?

33
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:44,363
- Where are you going?
- Go home, George!

34
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:46,365
Mom, where are you going?!

35
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,368
No matter how often my mother left...

36
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:53,361
no matter how many times she embarrassed him...

37
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:57,376
he always took her back.

38
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,378
He loved her.

39
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:01,312
God, he loved her.

40
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:06,319
Come here.

41
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:07,320
Are you okay?

42
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:09,322
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

43
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,329
Hi, George. I'm home.

44
00:05:16,363 --> 00:05:18,331
Come on, give me a hug.

45
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,339
Come on, Georgie.

46
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:28,341
Come to Mommy.

47
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:34,347
Come give your mother a hug.

48
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:43,356
For ten years...

49
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,349
my father worked his ass off 14 hours a day, 7 days a week.

50
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:51,353
He didn't care. As long as we were happy.

51
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:54,367
Okay, well, what do I have to do?

52
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:56,369
But in the end, he didn't make enough.

53
00:05:56,403 --> 00:06:01,306
Slowly but surely, we lost everything. We were bankrupt.

54
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:04,310
Let's get ice cream.

55
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:08,303
I don't care about ice cream right now. What're we going to do?

56
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:12,307
It'll be all right, George. It'll work out. It always does.

57
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:14,320
I'll find another job.

58
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:19,314
Look, this is how it goes. Sometimes you're flush, sometimes you're bust.

59
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:22,328
When you're up, it's never as good it seems.

60
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:26,321
When you're down, you never think you'll be up again. But life goes on.

61
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:30,325
Remember that. Money isn't real, George.

62
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,339
It doesn't matter. It only seems like it does.

63
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:36,342
Yeah, tell that to Mom.

64
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:40,346
Yeah. That's going to be a tricky one.

65
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:43,349
- Hey, Dad.
- What?

66
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:46,352
Will I be poor? I don't ever want to be poor.

67
00:06:46,386 --> 00:06:48,354
Then you won't.

68
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,359
I decided right then and there I wasn't going to live like that.

69
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:57,352
I needed to get as far away as possible.

70
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:06,294
I moved to California in the summer of 1968 with the Tuna.

71
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:09,308
We had 300 dollars and a black TR-3.

72
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:14,302
Sure was nothing like this back home. It was paradise.

73
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:18,317
We got a small apartment on the beach.

74
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:21,320
It wasn't much, but it had its perks.

75
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:33,332
You need some help?

76
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:43,342
California was like nothing I'd ever seen before.

77
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:45,344
Hey, where's the beer?

78
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:49,337
People were independent, full of new ideas.

79
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:54,342
They used words like "right on", "groovy", "solid".

80
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:57,356
The women were beautiful.

81
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,291
And they all seemed to share the same occupation.

82
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:02,294
I'm a stewardess.

83
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:04,296
I'm a stewardess.

84
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:08,300
On the airplane.

85
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:12,304
And everyone was getting stoned.

86
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:58,350
Oh, my God.

87
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:07,293
- I figured it out.
- Figured out what?

88
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:13,288
About what we were going to do for money, as we don't want to get jobs.

89
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,301
Chek this out.

90
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,308
Oregano?

91
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:24,310
- Tuna, this is crap.
- We're selling it.

92
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:27,313
We'll make up lids to sell on the beach.

93
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:31,306
If we move all that we got, like a hundred bucks.

94
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:33,319
And if we don't, well, we can smoke it.

95
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:35,321
You got ripped off, pal.

96
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:38,324
It's not a bad idea, man. I got the baggies.

97
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:42,317
If you want to score some dope, I got the guy.

98
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:47,322
The guy was Derek Foreal, a Manhattan Beach legend.

99
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:50,336
He owned 3 restaurants, 2 nightclubs, Laundromats.

100
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:55,774
But more importantly, he owned the 1% male hairsalon in southern California.

101
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:56,775
Barbie.

102
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:00,346
Maria.

103
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:08,354
So this is the new man, huh? He's cute.

104
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:12,358
- George.
- Tuna.

105
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:15,361
Hello, Tuna.

106
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:17,363
"Enchant", George.

107
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:25,360
Barbie, he is yummy. he looks just like a Ken doll.

108
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:30,365
Ken and Barbie. Oh, my god, it is so perfect.

109
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:35,370
Girls, give me about 5 minutes. I want to talk alone to the boys.

110
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,384
Have fun.

111
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:46,392
All right, everybody, shoo. Come on.

112
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:49,395
Chop, chop. Give us a few minutes.

113
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,399
Go blond, Ron. Very nice, Heather.

114
00:10:57,437 --> 00:11:00,338
What can I do for you guys?

115
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:05,344
We'd like to buy some pot.

116
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:07,346
I know what you want.

117
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:11,350
- But first, are you cops?
- No.

118
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:15,354
If you are, you've to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.

119
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:18,357
We're not. We're from Massachusetts.

120
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:21,360
Does he look like a cop?

121
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:24,363
Actually, no.

122
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,368
It's a good thing you're friends of Barbie's.

123
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:31,370
Because if you weren't...

124
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:36,375
I would never talk to you.

125
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,384
What the fuck is that?

126
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:48,387
It's your pot.

127
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:51,390
That's more than we had in mind.

128
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:54,393
I don't nickel-and-dime. You want it or not?

129
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:56,395
We'll take it.

130
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:14,335
Tuna and I became the kings of Manhattan Beach.

131
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,349
If you bought grass, you bought it from us.

132
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:22,343
I was making way more money than I could at a real job.

133
00:12:22,388 --> 00:12:24,356
I built a reputation for myself.

134
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,349
People even started calling me Boston George.

135
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:31,363
It was perfect.

136
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:37,369
This is it for me.

137
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:41,373
- What is it?
- Everything.

138
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:45,377
You, California, the beach.

139
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:47,379
This spot right here.

140
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:52,384
Finally feel like I belong somewhere.

141
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:54,386
I fell right.

142
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:57,389
You're happy.

143
00:12:58,424 --> 00:13:00,324
Yeah, I am.

144
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:02,327
Are you?

145
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:07,332
Good.

146
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,344
Look what the cat dragged in.

147
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:21,346
Holy shit, Dulli.

148
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:29,354
What the fuck are you doing out here?

149
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:32,357
I was walking down the beach. I was minding my business, right?

150
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:35,360
Who do I see? This fucking guy.

151
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:38,363
- I didn't know you were living here.
- What are you doing out here.

152
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:40,365
On vacation, man.

153
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,368
I'm on my way back to school.

154
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:45,370
This calls for a joint. You do the honors?

155
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:49,363
- No, man. I'm too fucked up.
- That's nice weed, huh?

156
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:51,376
Fuck, yeah.

157
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,379
I've never seen anything like this. I'm fucking wasted.

158
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:56,381
Right on.

159
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:05,324
I'm fucking stoned.

160
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:07,326
I'm fucking stoned.

161
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:11,330
I'm really stoned.

162
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:14,333
I'm fucking stoned, man. I'm really...

163
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:16,335
Stoned?

164
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:23,331
Man, I wish there was stuff like this back at home.

165
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:29,337
Fuck, yeah. Ya know how much money ya can make with this stuff back East?

166
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:32,351
- No shit, Kev?
- That's right.

167
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:35,354
When there's stuff to move, it's too easy not to.

168
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:39,347
Know how many colleges are within a sixty-mile radius?

169
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:42,361
- U. Mass, Amherst, B.U.
- Smith, Hampshire.

170
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:44,363
Right? And Holyoke.

171
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:47,366
100 thousand rich kids with their parents' money.

172
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,369
There's never anything. Nothing good, anyways.

173
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:53,372
I'm spending 400 bucks on shit.

174
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,312
The way I figure it, Barbara flies back East twice a week.

175
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:05,306
Two bags per flight. 25 pounds in each bag.

176
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:07,319
That's a 100 pounds a week.

177
00:15:07,353 --> 00:15:11,312
It's a lot of weight, but you can't get pot like this back home.

178
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:17,318
- I'm telling you, Derek, it'll sell.
- I don't know.

179
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:20,332
The best pot...

180
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,334
you can charge 500 a pound.

181
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:25,337
Come on. No one's going to pay that.

182
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:29,330
It's already been negotiated. The money's there waiting.

183
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,344
- Goodness.
- "Goodness" is right.

184
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,348
Listen...

185
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:42,343
I want you to be my partner on this thing. Fifty-fifty.

186
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:46,347
If you do the math, that's over 30 grand a week profit.

187
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:49,361
Fifteen thousand dollars a week for you.

188
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:52,364
In your pocket, free and clear.

189
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:56,357
- And just deal with you.
- Barbara and me. No one else.

190
00:15:56,402 --> 00:15:58,370
It's going to work, Derek.

191
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:06,300
I don't know. East Coast, airplanes. I'm paranoid.

192
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:09,314
- It seems really risky.
- Derek, she's a stewardess.

193
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:12,317
They don't check her bags.

194
00:16:57,396 --> 00:17:00,297
How've you been? More. I need more.

195
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:13,312
I need more. I need more.

196
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:18,306
What should I do? I can only carry 2 bags. I can't fly back here everyday.

197
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:21,320
I know, but I got a feeding frenzy on my hands. You tell George.

198
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:26,314
We're missin' out on some serious cash. Tell George. He'll think of somethin'.

199
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,327
- I will.
- Good.

200
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:53,352
20, 40...

201
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:55,354
60, 80, 9.

202
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:59,347
20, 40, 60, 80, a thousand. A 128 thousand dollars.

203
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:03,295
I'm getting a boner just looking at her.

204
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:05,297
You believe it, George?

205
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,302
What's the matter? Something wrong?

206
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:14,295
Yeah. Cheer up. Half of this is ours. We're fucking rich.

207
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,299
- It's not enough.
- What the fuck are you talkin' about?

208
00:18:18,344 --> 00:18:23,304
The setup is wrong. We do the legwork and we're still paying retail.

209
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:25,317
- We're getting fucking middled.
- So?

210
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:27,319
So we need to get to the source.

211
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:30,322
- Source? What about Derek?
- He's getting middled too.

212
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:35,316
And Derek's our partner. What's good for him is good for us.

213
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:39,320
So we need a source. Where do we start?

214
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:45,337
Either one of you guys speak Spanish?

215
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:57,338
Tuna! Get the fucker in here! Go on and play.

216
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:00,284
Viva la Mexico!

217
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:09,294
"Salud". Cheers.

218
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:11,296
"Como", marijuana?

219
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,301
Smoking? Smoke them?

220
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:18,303
Do you have some pot?

221
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:21,306
"Donde esta" pot?

222
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,309
Do you know where we can get pot?

223
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:26,311
"El" weed.

224
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:30,304
Do you know where we can find some marijuana?

225
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,319
Take a little off the top. You know?

226
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:38,323
Pot, man. Marijuana?

227
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,327
So you got anything?

228
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:44,329
- I haven't asked yet.
- What?

229
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:47,332
I didn't ask yet. Go ahead.

230
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:57,342
I'll be back.

231
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:19,364
Santiago.

232
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:47,392
Ramon says you're looking for some mota.

233
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:49,394
Yeah, I am.

234
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:58,403
For instance, something like this, eh?

235
00:20:59,438 --> 00:21:02,339
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that'll do it.

236
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:04,342
I'll take it.

237
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:13,340
You're funny. Really. How much will you be needing?

238
00:21:14,386 --> 00:21:16,354
All of it.

239
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:20,358
I'll come back in a week with a plane.

240
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:29,356
Maybe we're going too fast. You take a little, and then come back.

241
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:33,360
Yeah, but I don't need a little. I need a lot.

242
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:42,380
Hang on a minute. Listen.

243
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:45,383
Tell you what, "amigo".

244
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:49,376
What about I come back and I bring you, say...

245
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:51,389
fifty thousand dollars.

246
00:21:51,423 --> 00:21:54,392
That alleviate some of your concerns?

247
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:59,386
"Amigo", you bring me 50 thousand and I have no more concerns.

248
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:06,338
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.

249
00:22:06,372 --> 00:22:10,331
- Don't be such a pussy.
- We're not stealin'. We're borrowin' it.

250
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:12,344
Be cool. Got company here.

251
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:23,355
Come on, let's go. Tuna. Let's go.

252
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:28,360
Good luck. I'll see you in the desert.

253
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:30,362
You're sure you know what you're doing?

254
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:33,365
Relax. I've flown with my old man a million times.

255
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:38,359
It's not the taking off part you worry about, it's the landing.

256
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:19,333
Good to see you. You're a man of your word.

257
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:22,347
You know the 50 thousand I promised you?

258
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:24,349
I couldn't get it.

259
00:23:26,385 --> 00:23:29,354
So I brought you 75 instead.

260
00:23:56,415 --> 00:23:58,383
Merry Christmas, Derek.

261
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:05,323
It's beautiful.

262
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:13,320
You're a genius, George. Merry Christmas.

263
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:19,326
This would make a fabulous Christmas card. Get my camera, Sven.

264
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,343
Did you see the bedroom?

265
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:28,346
I love it. It's so pretty.

266
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,349
- Did you see it?
- Yeah, I saw it.

267
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:33,351
- Oh, my God.
- What do you think?

268
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:36,354
- Are you kidding?
- You want it?

269
00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:38,356
We'll take it.

270
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:54,372
It was a great time in our lives.

271
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:56,374
The seven ofus were like a family.

272
00:24:56,408 --> 00:25:02,313
We worked hard, we played hard, didn't have a care in the world.

273
00:25:02,347 --> 00:25:04,315
It was perfect.

274
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:27,338
I can't get over the size of that ring. I just love it.

275
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:30,341
Fred, tell me you don't love that ring.

276
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,343
I'm happy George found somebody he cares for.

277
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:37,337
Yes, of course. But I'm talking about the ring. It's something else.

278
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:39,350
George has exquisite taste.

279
00:25:39,384 --> 00:25:42,353
What is it? It's got to be at least two carats.

280
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:45,356
It's definitely two carats. Treasure it.

281
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,359
You might want to get that insured.

282
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:53,353
Hard to imagine being able to afford a ring like that on a construction salary.

283
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:56,367
Shut up, Fred. Shut your big fat mouth.

284
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:59,370
You don't buy it at once. It's layaway.

285
00:25:59,404 --> 00:26:01,304
- Layaway, shmayaway.
- Yes, layaway.

286
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,299
Something you wouldn't know anything about.

287
00:26:05,344 --> 00:26:07,312
You, you big old tightwad.

288
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:09,314
He still has his Communion money.

289
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:12,317
- Don't listen to her.
- George, tell your father--

290
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:16,321
You tell your father about layaway.

291
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:17,322
Layaway.

292
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:21,326
The boy's happy. don't be a killjoy.

293
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,319
- I'm not a killjoy.
- Oh, Jesus. Babe.

294
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:29,334
- Put your head back.
- My, Barbara.

295
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:31,336
- I'm so sorry.
- Take my napkin.

296
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,338
- Is she all right?
- I'll be okay.

297
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:37,331
- I'll get you ice. We need ice here.
- She's all right. You want to go?

298
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:39,344
Yeah, let's go.

299
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:42,779
- You haven't had your entre.
- No, it's okay. It's better.

300
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:44,338
I'll leave the tip.

301
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:47,352
Hope you feel better. Lovely to meet you.

302
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:50,355
Give your mother a call in the morning.

303
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:56,350
What a lovely girl. Is that all hundreds?

304
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,302
- You sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

305
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:08,295
Would you be bummed if I didn't go to Chicago with you?

306
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,309
No, not if you don't want.

307
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:15,313
Listen, I got to apologize about my parents.

308
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:19,306
They weren't that bad. They were kind of cute.

309
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:21,319
I'm not sure about that.

310
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:25,323
I want you to promise me something.

311
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:27,325
Promise me we'll never be like that.

312
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,318
I don't want to wind up like them.

313
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:36,334
We're going to wind up like us.

314
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:42,340
- I love you.
- Get in the car.

315
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:46,344
Hurry before they come out.

316
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:54,352
George Jung, you stand accused of possession...

317
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:59,346
of 660 pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute.

318
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:01,291
How do you plead?

319
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:06,286
Your Honor, I'd like to say a few words.

320
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:10,290
You'll have to stand up to address this court.

321
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:12,303
All right. Fine. Well...

322
00:28:13,338 --> 00:28:15,306
in all honesty...

323
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,308
I don't feel that what I've done is a crime.

324
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:22,302
It's illogical and irresponsible for you to sentence me to prison.

325
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:24,315
Because what did I really do?

326
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:28,308
I crossed an imaginary line with a bunch of plants.

327
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:31,322
"You say I'm an outlaw, you say I'm a thief

328
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:34,325
But where's the Christmas dinner for the people on relief?"

329
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:37,328
"You say you're looking for someone who's never weak but always strong

330
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:40,331
To gather flowers constantly whether you were right or wrong

331
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:43,334
But it ain't me, babe

332
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:47,327
No, it ain't me, babe, it ain't me you're looking for, babe."

333
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:49,340
You follow?

334
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:55,335
Gosh, you know. your concepts are really interesting, Mr. Jung.

335
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,348
Thank you.

336
00:28:57,382 --> 00:29:00,283
Unfortunately, the line you crossed was real...

337
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:03,287
and the plants you brought were illegal...

338
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:05,289
so your bail is $ 20,000.

339
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:08,292
Next case, Your Honor.

340
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:26,310
Hey, babe.

341
00:29:26,344 --> 00:29:28,312
What are you doing here?

342
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:31,315
Surprise.

343
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:34,318
You didn't have to come out here.

344
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:37,321
And miss all the fun? Not a chance.

345
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:41,325
So, what's the verdict?

346
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:45,329
The lawyer says he can...

347
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:48,332
plead it down to 5 years.

348
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:50,334
I'll serve two.

349
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,338
Two years.

350
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:56,340
Two years.

351
00:29:56,374 --> 00:29:59,343
George, I can't wait that long.

352
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:04,337
Are you kidding me? You won't wait for me? The fuck is that?

353
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:10,354
I don't have two years.

354
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:14,358
What?

355
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:27,371
No.

356
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:36,374
Losing Barbara to cancer change everything.

357
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:39,377
The old gang broke up.

358
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:43,370
Tuna stayed in Mexico. God only knows what happened to him.

359
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:46,384
Point is, we all lost touch.

360
00:31:46,418 --> 00:31:49,387
I'd skipped bail in Chicago to take care of Barbara...

361
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:52,390
and was now a fugitive on the run.

362
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:57,395
It'd been almost a year since I'd seen my parents.

363
00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:01,331
And believe it or not I actually missed them.

364
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:09,340
Hi, Ma.

365
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:16,347
Surprised to see me?

366
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:20,351
Take off your boots.

367
00:32:32,397 --> 00:32:35,366
- You're tan.
- Mexico.

368
00:32:37,402 --> 00:32:39,370
Yeah, I hear about it.

369
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:46,377
I want you to know I'm...

370
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:50,381
I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.

371
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:55,386
Yeah, Barbara. Nice girl.

372
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:57,388
Thank you.

373
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:11,335
Have you been getting the money I sent you?

374
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:14,338
What, you mean the drug money?

375
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:16,340
Yeah, I got it.

376
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:24,348
Oh, God.

377
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:33,346
What are you doing? What are you doing?

378
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:35,359
It's okay, Mom.

379
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:38,362
It's okay, Mom.

380
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:42,366
I thought I heard something. How are you?

381
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,368
- How are you?
- Good.

382
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:48,361
Son, come on in. How are you? Come on. You look good.

383
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:58,382
May the wind always be at your back...

384
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:00,316
and the sun upon your face.

385
00:34:00,352 --> 00:34:04,311
And may the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars.

386
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:07,325
- Cheers, Georgie.
- Cheers, Pop.

387
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:23,341
Are you all right?

388
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:30,337
- Just low. You know?
- You really loved her.

389
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:35,353
Yeah, Dad.

390
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:37,355
I really did.

391
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:47,365
Are you mad at me?

392
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:50,368
No.

393
00:34:50,402 --> 00:34:52,370
- Yeah, you are.
- No.

394
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:56,363
- I can tell by the way you look.
- I'm not mad, George.

395
00:34:57,409 --> 00:35:00,310
I just don't understand what you're doing.

396
00:35:00,345 --> 00:35:04,304
I don't understand your choices. The goddamn cops are looking for you.

397
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,317
I know.

398
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,329
I'm great at what I do, Dad.

399
00:35:19,364 --> 00:35:22,333
I mean, I'm really great at what I do.

400
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:27,338
Let me tell you something, George.

401
00:35:28,373 --> 00:35:32,332
You'd have been great at anything. Anything.

402
00:35:41,386 --> 00:35:43,354
Fuck! Damn.

403
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:49,360
Fuck them, fuck them, fuck!

404
00:36:07,345 --> 00:36:09,313
I had no choice.

405
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:15,308
- Don't look at me like that.
- Let's go.

406
00:36:15,353 --> 00:36:18,322
- What was I supposed to do?
- Jesus Christ.

407
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:20,324
- He's in our house!
- Shut up.

408
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:23,327
Was I supposed to be an accomplice?

409
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:27,320
You don't think people know you're a drug dealer?

410
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:30,334
Everyone knows you're a drug dealer! It's no secret.

411
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:33,337
How do you think that reflects on me?

412
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:37,341
Every time I go out, I'm humiliated.

413
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:40,344
So you go to jail. It's for your own good!

414
00:36:40,378 --> 00:36:43,347
You need to straighten your life out!

415
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:54,347
What are you looking at, Mrs. Gracie? Your son's no prize.

416
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:06,303
All right, stop.

417
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:08,305
Open up cell number 3!

418
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:14,311
Prisoner's in.

419
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:17,314
Close cell number 3.

420
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:28,314
Hello. My name's Diego Delgado. How do you do?

421
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:36,333
- Hey, George.
- What?

422
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:41,327
If you don't mind me asking why are you in this place?

423
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:45,342
I don't want to talk about it.

424
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:48,345
Oh, come on, George.

425
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,339
If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.

426
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:56,353
- I don't like a lot of conversation.
- Me, too.

427
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:59,356
Too much Blah-blah-blah. You know.

428
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:04,284
But we are roommates. And we must talk to each other.

429
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:09,300
I'm arrested for stealing cars.

430
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:12,303
For the grand-theft auto.

431
00:38:16,341 --> 00:38:17,308
Murder.

432
00:38:22,347 --> 00:38:23,314
Murder.

433
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,329
What do you got down there, Diego?

434
00:38:38,363 --> 00:38:41,332
Nothing. Just a little project.

435
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:46,337
What kind of little project.

436
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:51,342
Never mind. Not for you to worry.

437
00:38:54,379 --> 00:38:55,346
Come on.

438
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:00,283
Thought you said we're supposed to tell each other everything.

439
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:03,287
You have your intrigues, I have mine.

440
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:09,293
Today is a happy day for me, George.

441
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:13,286
In 9 months from today, I'll be in Medellin, sipping champagne.

442
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:16,300
In 9 months, I'm free.

443
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:21,305
I'm happy for you.

444
00:39:24,342 --> 00:39:28,301
- How much time do you have?
- Oh, let's see.

445
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:33,317
26 months.

446
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:40,324
26 months? For murder?

447
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:46,330
I must meet your lawyer.

448
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:51,335
I got to get out of here, Diego.

449
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:57,341
Only 2 ways I know to leave here early.

450
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:01,345
One... is to escape.

451
00:40:05,383 --> 00:40:07,351
Okay, what's the other?

452
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:14,358
- I guess me ought to open our books.
- Man, fuck you.

453
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:16,360
We ain't opening shit.

454
00:40:17,395 --> 00:40:20,364
You just the warden's little bitch.

455
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:22,366
Doing that shit to get some time cut off.

456
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,368
Why not?

457
00:40:24,402 --> 00:40:28,361
I want to get out of this shithole as quickly as possible.

458
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:31,375
But for me to walk early, some of you got to graduate.

459
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:34,378
You should forget it. You're hopeless.

460
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:36,380
Fuck you.

461
00:40:36,414 --> 00:40:38,382
See you in the shower.

462
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:43,376
The rest of ya might get diplomas and jobs when ya get back on the outside.

463
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:45,389
Shit, I'm in this bitch for life.

464
00:40:45,423 --> 00:40:50,383
Motherfucker, I'm a criminal. Ain't nobody giving me no job.

465
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,398
Let's learn some criminal shit too.

466
00:40:54,432 --> 00:40:57,401
Tell you what. I'll make you a deal.

467
00:40:58,436 --> 00:41:01,337
Half the time I teach you about George Washington...

468
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:05,331
the other half, I'll teach you how to smuggle drugs.

469
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:09,335
You don't know dick about smuggling no drugs.

470
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,347
Oh, no?

471
00:41:10,381 --> 00:41:14,340
I was arrested in Chicago with 660 pounds of grass.

472
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:16,353
I think that qualifies me.

473
00:41:16,387 --> 00:41:19,356
How'd you get 660 pounds of weed?

474
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:23,349
Flew in from Mexico on a single-engine Cessna.

475
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:25,362
So we got a deal or what?

476
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:32,369
What?

477
00:41:33,404 --> 00:41:37,363
I listened to what you say to the class today about the smuggling.

478
00:41:37,408 --> 00:41:40,377
Never believed you were a murderer.

479
00:41:40,411 --> 00:41:43,380
I knew you were a "magico".

480
00:41:43,414 --> 00:41:46,383
I'm tired, Diego. Go to bed.

481
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:49,386
Do you know, in my country, I'm a "magico"?

482
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:53,379
A man with a dream. A man on the rise.

483
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:57,394
To take nothing and make it something.

484
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:00,329
Do you have a dream, George?

485
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:03,333
I would if I could get some fucking sleep.

486
00:42:03,367 --> 00:42:05,335
You have a dream.

487
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,339
And maybe you will accomplish it.

488
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:13,343
But yet you failed. Why?

489
00:42:13,377 --> 00:42:16,346
- Because I got caught.
- No.

490
00:42:17,381 --> 00:42:19,349
You failed...

491
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:22,352
because you had the wrong dream.

492
00:42:31,395 --> 00:42:34,364
What do you know about cocaine?

493
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,359
First of all, what type of planes do you have?

494
00:42:40,404 --> 00:42:43,373
They're 4-passenger, single-engine Cessnas.

495
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:46,376
4 passengers. So that means how...

496
00:42:48,412 --> 00:42:51,381
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?

497
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:53,383
I don't know. Probably...

498
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:57,376
Danbury wasn't a prison. It was a crime school.

499
00:42:58,422 --> 00:43:01,323
I went in with a bachelor of marijuana...

500
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,328
came out with a doctorate of cocaine.

501
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:07,331
And after sixteen months...

502
00:43:07,365 --> 00:43:10,334
I was, once again, a free man.

503
00:43:10,368 --> 00:43:12,336
Well, not altogether free.

504
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:18,331
The conditions of my parole. To live at my parents' house and find a job.

505
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:20,344
Diego Delgado, please.

506
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:25,338
Boston George. Todayis the day. Are you out?

507
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:28,352
- Yeah, I'm out.
- Congratulations. I've been waiting.

508
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:30,354
- How we doing?
- Fine.

509
00:43:30,388 --> 00:43:33,357
Everything's perfect here. It's all set up.

510
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:35,359
Do we need a plane? How does this work?

511
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:40,353
Slow down. You need to come down here. Everybody meets everybody.

512
00:43:40,398 --> 00:43:44,357
We do one for good faith, then we talk about airplanes, okay?

513
00:43:44,402 --> 00:43:46,370
I can't go anyway, Diego.

514
00:43:46,404 --> 00:43:50,363
- It's nice and cold.
- All right, Pop. One minute.

515
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:52,376
I'm on parole. I can't leave the state.

516
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,379
George, you'll be back before they know you're gone.

517
00:43:55,413 --> 00:43:58,382
I just got released 5 minutes ago.

518
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:01,317
Are we going to do this or not?

519
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,328
My friend. How are you?

520
00:44:11,362 --> 00:44:13,330
- Fine.
- Good to see you.

521
00:44:15,366 --> 00:44:18,335
Okay, 15 kilos it is then, okay?

522
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:23,329
We receive 100 thousand dollars upon delivery.

523
00:44:23,374 --> 00:44:27,333
Not so fast. I would like to go over the details.

524
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:32,349
What details?

525
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:36,342
I put the coke in the false bottoms, and take it through customs.

526
00:44:36,387 --> 00:44:37,354
That's it.

527
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,358
Tell me about the suitcases.

528
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:43,792
Will there be clothes in the suitcase?

529
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:44,795
What?

530
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:46,363
Clothes.

531
00:44:47,398 --> 00:44:49,366
In the suitcase.

532
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:54,371
Well, yeah.

533
00:44:56,407 --> 00:45:01,310
- Let's try it. Why not?
- Whose clothes? Your clothes?

534
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:09,319
What the fuck is going on here?

535
00:45:09,353 --> 00:45:12,322
You pulled me down here to talk about clothes?

536
00:45:12,356 --> 00:45:14,324
I demand to know everything.

537
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:18,317
I don't trust 600,000 dollars of coca to someone I don't know.

538
00:45:18,362 --> 00:45:21,331
15 fucking kilos. I piss 15 kilos.

539
00:45:22,366 --> 00:45:24,334
Gentlemen, please.

540
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:27,337
There's no need to be impolite, okay?

541
00:45:35,379 --> 00:45:40,339
George, Cesar is just being thorough. And that's all, okay?

542
00:45:45,389 --> 00:45:47,357
Okay, very well.

543
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:51,350
But remember, Mr. Jung, I will be with you the whole way...

544
00:45:51,395 --> 00:45:53,363
and I will be watching.

545
00:46:20,357 --> 00:46:23,326
When you're carrying drugs across the border...

546
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,328
the idea is to remain calm.

547
00:46:25,362 --> 00:46:29,321
The way I do it is to think of something pleasant.

548
00:46:29,366 --> 00:46:33,325
A fun party, a moment of triumph, sexual encounter.

549
00:46:34,371 --> 00:46:36,339
I actually project myself to that place.

550
00:46:36,373 --> 00:46:40,332
A little transcendental meditation, if you will.

551
00:46:40,377 --> 00:46:43,346
The trick is to imagine every little detail.

552
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,339
Anythin' to keep your mind off the fact you're goin' to jail for a long time...

553
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:51,343
if they find the 15 kilos of blow in your suitcases.

554
00:46:51,388 --> 00:46:53,356
Passport, please.

555
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:57,349
- Nice flight?
- It was pretty good. Thanks.

556
00:46:58,395 --> 00:47:00,295
- On vacations?
- Yes.

557
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:05,302
On vacation for only one day.

558
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:12,298
My brother's wedding. It was a nice ceremony and everything. It was good.

559
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:14,311
Open your bag, please.

560
00:47:16,347 --> 00:47:17,314
Sure.

561
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:27,324
- Whose clothes are these?
- Mine.

562
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:30,327
And these?

563
00:47:31,362 --> 00:47:34,331
Old habits, you know. Hard to break.

564
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:40,337
Close it up.

565
00:48:00,324 --> 00:48:03,293
The trial period was over.

566
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,296
It was time to start moving some serious weight.

567
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:09,299
Commercial flights couldn't cut it any.

568
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,301
What we needed was a pilot.

569
00:48:11,335 --> 00:48:16,295
I'll fly down on a Friday, refuel in the Bahamas and then on to Medellin.

570
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:27,317
Please continue.

571
00:48:28,352 --> 00:48:32,311
We make the pickup, refuel once more in the Bahamas...

572
00:48:32,356 --> 00:48:35,325
and then fly back on Sunday with the mom-and-pop traffic.

573
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,327
Why are you speaking?

574
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:39,329
What?

575
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:43,322
You. Your responsibility is over. You're not a pilot, not a distributor.

576
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:46,336
You simply introduced us to Mr. Stevens. That is all.

577
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:50,329
You make a generous percentage. You're lucky to get that.

578
00:48:50,374 --> 00:48:51,341
I see.

579
00:48:54,378 --> 00:48:55,345
How much?

580
00:48:55,379 --> 00:49:00,282
"Padrino" will pay ten thousand per kilo for everyone. You, you and you.

581
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:03,286
3 million. That is all. There is no negotiation.

582
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,288
I want two.

583
00:49:06,323 --> 00:49:09,292
Come on, a million each had such a nice ring to it.

584
00:49:09,326 --> 00:49:10,293
No way.

585
00:49:10,327 --> 00:49:13,296
I'm doing all the work, I'm taking all the risk and it's my plane.

586
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:18,290
You guys don't do shit. You just collect your money.

587
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,303
Are you good with this?

588
00:49:45,362 --> 00:49:48,331
Do you have pictures of your kids?

589
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:50,333
- What?
- I need to see them.

590
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:52,335
I'll need their names and their schools.

591
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:57,329
With millions of dollars of coca on the line, no children, no deal.

592
00:50:05,382 --> 00:50:06,349
Fine.

593
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,359
Don't forget the pictures.

594
00:50:21,398 --> 00:50:25,357
George, come here! I need to talk to you! George!

595
00:50:27,404 --> 00:50:29,372
Yeah, yeah. What?

596
00:50:29,406 --> 00:50:31,374
- Come here. What's the matter?
- Nothing.

597
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:36,368
I mean, aside from the fact that we're moving 300 fucking kilos...

598
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:38,381
and we're making dog shit, nothing.

599
00:50:38,415 --> 00:50:41,384
A million dollars for our first run is not bad.

600
00:50:41,418 --> 00:50:43,386
It's fucking chump change.

601
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,389
May as well hauling suitcases across the border.

602
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:50,382
You know, George, this is a very small part of business. Very small.

603
00:50:50,427 --> 00:50:53,396
Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.

604
00:50:55,432 --> 00:50:59,391
The favor was to pick up 50 kilos of cocaine.

605
00:50:59,436 --> 00:51:03,338
Fifty. That's a hundred and ten pounds.

606
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:07,333
Not exactly a small favor. Not like bumming a cigarette, for example.

607
00:51:07,378 --> 00:51:09,346
But what the hell?

608
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:14,340
I had nothin' better to do. It's not like I was on parole or anythin'.

609
00:51:14,385 --> 00:51:18,344
How you doing? I'm George, friend of Diego's.

610
00:51:21,392 --> 00:51:23,360
Where's Diego?

611
00:51:23,394 --> 00:51:26,363
I don't know. He sent me. I'm George.

612
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,369
Well, that explains everything.

613
00:51:32,403 --> 00:51:35,372
Open your mouth, George.

614
00:51:35,406 --> 00:51:37,374
Get fucked.

615
00:51:37,408 --> 00:51:39,376
Open your fucking mouth.

616
00:51:44,415 --> 00:51:48,374
Now, you listen to me. You hearing me, huh?

617
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,389
I've been holding fifty keys for Diego for three weeks.

618
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:54,391
Tell him I don't appreciate it.

619
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:58,384
You tell him I want my money by Friday. Can you do that?

620
00:51:58,429 --> 00:52:00,329
I think so.

621
00:52:00,364 --> 00:52:02,332
I think so.

622
00:52:17,381 --> 00:52:20,350
Hello. May I speak to George, please?

623
00:52:20,384 --> 00:52:23,353
George, you have a phone call.

624
00:52:25,389 --> 00:52:27,357
Thank you.

625
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:29,359
Hello? This George?

626
00:52:30,394 --> 00:52:32,362
- Hey, how are you?
- How are you?

627
00:52:32,396 --> 00:52:34,364
- I'm fine.
- Where are you?

628
00:52:35,399 --> 00:52:38,368
Bad news, George. I'm in Colombia.

629
00:52:38,402 --> 00:52:39,369
Boy...

630
00:52:39,403 --> 00:52:44,363
I sure would like to see you. And so would some of your old friends.

631
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:49,368
George, it's a little bit hard to get away right now.

632
00:52:49,413 --> 00:52:53,372
I'm afraid you're on your own. I'm in jail.

633
00:52:54,418 --> 00:52:55,385
What?

634
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,319
What I'm doing here is measuring the purity.

635
00:53:07,364 --> 00:53:09,332
Pure coke, it melts away at about...

636
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:12,335
a hundred and eighty-five, hundred and ninety degrees.

637
00:53:12,369 --> 00:53:17,329
Cutting agents, they melt away at about a hundred.

638
00:53:17,374 --> 00:53:20,343
And quality product, well, that's...

639
00:53:20,377 --> 00:53:23,346
melting at around a hundred and forty.

640
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,349
Hundred and thirty. Good.

641
00:53:26,383 --> 00:53:29,352
A hundred and forty. Yes.

642
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:35,358
A hundred and fifty.

643
00:53:37,394 --> 00:53:40,363
Fuck me running! A hundred and sixty?

644
00:53:40,397 --> 00:53:42,365
Jesus Christ, a hundred and seventy!

645
00:53:42,399 --> 00:53:45,368
Hundred and eighty. A hundred and....

646
00:53:46,403 --> 00:53:49,372
A hundred and eighty-seven.

647
00:53:49,406 --> 00:53:51,374
Where did you get this stuff?

648
00:53:51,408 --> 00:53:53,376
Colombia.

649
00:53:57,414 --> 00:53:59,382
Well, do you mind if I do a line?

650
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:01,316
Yeah, go ahead.

651
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:03,319
Fuck it. Let's all do one.

652
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:21,337
What did I tell you?

653
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:26,331
It's great, but what am I supposed to do with all this?

654
00:54:26,376 --> 00:54:30,335
- Sell it.
- I don't see you in two years...

655
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:34,339
and you show up with a hundred and ten pounds of blow?

656
00:54:34,384 --> 00:54:36,352
Just fucking sell it, Derek.

657
00:54:36,386 --> 00:54:40,345
All right, but it's going to take me a year.

658
00:54:41,391 --> 00:54:43,359
I can't feel my face.

659
00:54:44,394 --> 00:54:48,353
I mean, I can touch it, but I can't feel it inside.

660
00:54:54,404 --> 00:54:56,372
Thirty-six hours. Thirty-six hours.

661
00:54:56,406 --> 00:55:00,308
I don't believe we got rid of it in 36 hours.

662
00:55:00,344 --> 00:55:03,313
You underestimated the market, Derek.

663
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:07,306
Right on. It'll take longer to count it than it did to sell it.

664
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:24,334
Greetings, Mr. George.

665
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:28,338
Here you go. One-point-three-five million.

666
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:30,340
Any place you'd like to count?

667
00:55:30,374 --> 00:55:32,342
On the plane.

668
00:55:32,376 --> 00:55:34,344
What fucking plane?

669
00:56:14,351 --> 00:56:15,318
Thanks.

670
00:56:16,353 --> 00:56:18,321
What the fuck is going on?

671
00:56:18,355 --> 00:56:20,323
- Good to see you.
- I thought you were in jail.

672
00:56:20,357 --> 00:56:22,325
Pablo used his influence.

673
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:24,327
Watch what you say, okay?

674
00:56:24,361 --> 00:56:26,329
Everybody hears everything.

675
00:56:28,365 --> 00:56:31,334
Well, let's just say this isn't America.

676
00:56:31,368 --> 00:56:34,337
Life is cheap here. No offense, but you know what I'm saying.

677
00:56:34,371 --> 00:56:37,340
All right, I'll keep my mouth shut.

678
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:42,334
Who's this person in California, the connection?

679
00:56:42,379 --> 00:56:44,347
- It's a friend.
- Who?

680
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:47,350
A fucking friend. I'm not telling you.

681
00:56:47,384 --> 00:56:49,352
- Who?
- A friend! I ain't telling you no more.

682
00:56:49,386 --> 00:56:52,355
Okay, we'll talk about it later.

683
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,358
Look, that's Pablo.

684
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:14,310
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

685
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:24,309
"El Padrino" was Seor Pablo Escobar.

686
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:28,313
And for those of you living on the moon for the last twenty years...

687
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:29,325
he was it.

688
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,328
The boss of it all. "El Mgico".

689
00:57:34,364 --> 00:57:36,332
He will see you now.

690
00:57:36,366 --> 00:57:38,334
- Okay, let's go.
- Not you.

691
00:57:56,386 --> 00:57:58,354
- What?
- Never mind. You go.

692
00:57:58,388 --> 00:58:00,288
- Yeah, you go.
- No, wait.

693
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:02,291
- You go, George.
- Momento.

694
00:58:03,326 --> 00:58:06,295
I'm not going over there. You got to do all the talking.

695
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:10,732
He says Seor Escobar only wants to see you. Not me. You go.

696
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:13,292
- This way, please.
- Yeah, right.

697
00:58:13,336 --> 00:58:16,305
Take it easy. It'll be fine.

698
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:20,309
All right, fuck it.

699
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:29,318
So....

700
00:58:29,352 --> 00:58:33,311
you're the man? Who takes fifty kilos...

701
00:58:33,356 --> 00:58:36,325
and make them disappear in one day.

702
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:39,328
Actually, it was three days.

703
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:42,331
"EI Magico". Greetings, Mr. George.

704
00:58:42,365 --> 00:58:44,333
Welcome to Colombia.

705
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:49,338
Oh, this man.

706
00:58:49,372 --> 00:58:51,340
He was full of courage.

707
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:54,343
Informant?

708
00:58:55,378 --> 00:59:00,281
He would have run, fled the country, gone to the "polica".

709
00:59:00,317 --> 00:59:04,276
But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends....

710
00:59:04,321 --> 00:59:06,289
Many people would die.

711
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:14,297
Well....

712
00:59:14,331 --> 00:59:18,290
thank you for inviting me to your beautiful country.

713
00:59:18,335 --> 00:59:20,303
Beautiful, yes. But, poor.

714
00:59:21,338 --> 00:59:25,741
Coffee, bananas, these are our main export along with mota.

715
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:30,303
We've been overrun by the fucking "comunistas", but that is another story.

716
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:35,318
Our business here today is cocaine, yes?

717
00:59:36,353 --> 00:59:38,321
"Si". Yes, it is.

718
00:59:39,356 --> 00:59:43,315
I need to find an "Americano" who I can trust.

719
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,329
One with honor...

720
00:59:46,363 --> 00:59:47,762
intelligence...

721
00:59:47,797 --> 00:59:51,324
You need an "Americano" with balls, Seor Escobar.

722
00:59:51,368 --> 00:59:54,337
Yes. And balls, Mr. George.

723
00:59:55,372 --> 00:59:59,331
Well, look. I can do several things for you.

724
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:05,337
I can transport the cocaine from here to the U.S., starting with California.

725
01:00:05,382 --> 01:00:07,350
I got pilots and planes standing by.

726
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:09,352
Good, good.

727
01:00:09,386 --> 01:00:13,345
But I need more details. What is the cost?

728
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:17,360
I'd have to talk to Diego...

729
01:00:17,394 --> 01:00:21,353
but let's just say roughly ten thousand per kilo.

730
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:25,368
How much can you transport?

731
01:00:25,402 --> 01:00:29,361
Again, that I would have to discuss with my partner...

732
01:00:29,406 --> 01:00:32,375
but three hundred kilos....

733
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:35,378
So that's three million dollars.

734
01:00:36,413 --> 01:00:40,372
This I understand. But please, "tu" remove.

735
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:45,388
This complications with Diego.

736
01:00:45,422 --> 01:00:48,391
The stolen cars, the "crcel".

737
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:50,393
This causes me much inconvenience.

738
01:00:50,427 --> 01:00:53,396
The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.

739
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:55,398
I don't like problems.

740
01:01:03,373 --> 01:01:06,342
With all due respect, "El Padroni"...

741
01:01:06,376 --> 01:01:08,344
Diego is my partner.

742
01:01:09,379 --> 01:01:11,347
So I won't negotiate without him.

743
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:14,350
I won't do business without him.

744
01:01:14,384 --> 01:01:16,352
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

745
01:01:28,398 --> 01:01:30,366
Let's us speak no more of this business.

746
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,368
We have many other things to talk about.

747
01:02:03,366 --> 01:02:04,765
I've made a decision.

748
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:08,328
We going into business together. Right away.

749
01:02:10,373 --> 01:02:14,332
Cocaine exploded upon the American culture like an atomic bomb.

750
01:02:14,377 --> 01:02:17,346
It started in Hollywood and moved East.

751
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:21,339
Everyone was doing it. I mean, everyone.

752
01:02:36,399 --> 01:02:38,367
We invented the marketplace.

753
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:43,361
In fact, if you snorted cocaine in late seventies or early eighties...

754
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:48,377
Three million. I counted it twice.

755
01:02:48,411 --> 01:02:51,380
Two-point-five. Two-point-five, I'm sure.

756
01:02:51,414 --> 01:02:53,382
I'm calling it three.

757
01:02:54,417 --> 01:02:56,385
Then we're half a million off?

758
01:02:56,419 --> 01:03:00,321
- Fuck it. I'm not counting it again.
- Weigh it.

759
01:03:00,356 --> 01:03:03,325
Sixty pounds is three million. Fifty is two-point-five.

760
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:06,328
I don't give a shit. It's close enough.

761
01:03:06,362 --> 01:03:08,330
Where do I put it?

762
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:11,333
Try the back bedroom.

763
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:16,338
No room.

764
01:03:17,373 --> 01:03:19,341
Try the closet.

765
01:03:21,377 --> 01:03:23,345
We'll need a bigger boat.

766
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:29,340
The Colombians recommended Noriega's bank in Panama City.

767
01:03:29,385 --> 01:03:33,344
It was that or launderit in the States for a 60% surcharge.

768
01:03:33,389 --> 01:03:38,349
What? Keep only 40% of my money? No, thanks.

769
01:03:38,394 --> 01:03:42,353
- Congratulations, gentlemen.
- Even Pablo kept his money there.

770
01:03:42,398 --> 01:03:44,366
- I love it.
- Who'd fuck with us?

771
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,367
I'm sorry?

772
01:03:45,401 --> 01:03:51,362
I give you thirty million dollars and you give me this little book.

773
01:04:27,377 --> 01:04:29,345
- I'm married.
- I know.

774
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:31,347
Can you believe I'm married?

775
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:34,350
- Lucky man. I'm proud of you.
- I love you.

776
01:04:34,384 --> 01:04:37,353
I love you too, my brother.

777
01:05:02,345 --> 01:05:04,313
Do I know you?

778
01:05:05,348 --> 01:05:07,316
I don't think so.

779
01:05:09,352 --> 01:05:11,320
Why are you smiling?

780
01:05:11,354 --> 01:05:13,322
Why are you smiling?

781
01:05:13,356 --> 01:05:15,324
I don't know.

782
01:05:18,361 --> 01:05:20,329
I'm George.

783
01:05:20,363 --> 01:05:22,331
I know who you are.

784
01:05:23,366 --> 01:05:27,325
Mr. Jung. I see you've met my fiance, Mirtha.

785
01:05:30,373 --> 01:05:33,342
Augusto would like to see you immediately.

786
01:05:33,376 --> 01:05:36,345
Augusto would like to see you.

787
01:05:39,382 --> 01:05:41,350
In a minute.

788
01:05:53,396 --> 01:05:56,365
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

789
01:06:06,342 --> 01:06:09,311
Please join us. Have a drink.

790
01:06:09,345 --> 01:06:12,314
- How you doing?
- Remember Mr. George?

791
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:15,317
Congratulations on conquering the West Coast.

792
01:06:15,351 --> 01:06:17,319
Thank you very much.

793
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:20,322
- How much bigger can we get?
- Sky's the limit.

794
01:06:20,356 --> 01:06:25,316
If it's accepted by actors and musicians, everyone else will follow.

795
01:06:28,364 --> 01:06:30,332
Very good. Diego.

796
01:06:30,366 --> 01:06:34,325
We were discussing George's West Coast operation.

797
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:36,338
Yeah, George's mystery man.

798
01:06:37,373 --> 01:06:39,341
What is this mystery man?

799
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:41,343
- When do we meet him?
- You can't.

800
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:43,345
George keeps him a secret.

801
01:06:43,379 --> 01:06:47,338
He meets everybody, goes to Colombia, meets Pablo...

802
01:06:47,383 --> 01:06:51,342
but still he keeps his secret, even from his brother.

803
01:06:51,387 --> 01:06:53,355
We're all in this together.

804
01:06:53,389 --> 01:06:55,357
- There's plenty for everybody.
- No.

805
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:57,359
You know, I think that....

806
01:06:57,393 --> 01:07:00,294
I think "El Padroni's" happy with the current situation.

807
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:02,298
Don't you?

808
01:07:07,337 --> 01:07:09,305
Excuse me.

809
01:07:09,339 --> 01:07:10,306
You go.

810
01:07:51,381 --> 01:07:54,350
Breaking up a Colombian marriage was a serious thing.

811
01:07:54,384 --> 01:07:57,353
A lot of people were pissed off.

812
01:07:57,387 --> 01:08:00,288
Didn't matter. I was Escobar's guy.

813
01:08:01,324 --> 01:08:03,292
I was untouchable.

814
01:08:28,351 --> 01:08:33,311
Mirtha became my running partner. Beautiful, passionate...

815
01:08:33,356 --> 01:08:35,324
and as crazyas I was.

816
01:08:35,358 --> 01:08:39,317
She could party like a man and love like a woman.

817
01:08:39,362 --> 01:08:41,330
There was only one problem.

818
01:08:41,364 --> 01:08:44,333
I'd always be a gringo to the cartel.

819
01:08:44,367 --> 01:08:48,326
Mirtha could change all that with two choice words.

820
01:08:48,371 --> 01:08:49,338
I do.

821
01:08:50,373 --> 01:08:52,341
So do I.

822
01:08:53,376 --> 01:08:56,345
We had the world by the short-and-curlies.

823
01:08:56,379 --> 01:08:59,348
We were young, rich and in love.

824
01:08:59,382 --> 01:09:01,282
Nothing could stop us.

825
01:09:02,318 --> 01:09:04,286
It was perfect.

826
01:09:09,325 --> 01:09:11,293
Holy Mother of God.

827
01:09:16,332 --> 01:09:19,301
Put that shit away. You're pregnant.

828
01:09:19,335 --> 01:09:22,304
Don't be such a fucking hypocrite.

829
01:09:22,338 --> 01:09:24,306
I quit smoking, didn't I?

830
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:28,310
Put it away. My parents are here.

831
01:09:32,348 --> 01:09:34,316
It's beautiful, isn't it?

832
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:36,318
Oh, God, it's enormous!

833
01:09:36,352 --> 01:09:40,311
- Like it?
- Look.

834
01:09:41,357 --> 01:09:43,325
Look at this credenza.

835
01:09:46,362 --> 01:09:48,330
Oh, yes. What, it's Spanish?

836
01:09:49,365 --> 01:09:52,334
How much is one of these? It's got to cost a fortune.

837
01:09:52,368 --> 01:09:55,337
- Family heirloom, Ma.
- These don't come cheap.

838
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:58,340
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.

839
01:09:58,374 --> 01:10:01,343
- "Papi", do you like it?
- Very nice.

840
01:10:01,377 --> 01:10:04,346
- I'll show you the rest of the house.
- Oh, great.

841
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:08,339
George mentioned a Jacuzzi. I've always wanted a Jacuzzi.

842
01:10:08,384 --> 01:10:11,353
- Oh, and one of those bidets.
- Cocktail?

843
01:10:11,387 --> 01:10:13,355
Business has been pretty good.

844
01:10:13,389 --> 01:10:16,358
I got an import-export thing down in Miami.

845
01:10:16,392 --> 01:10:20,351
And that's been very profitable for me. I got my investments.

846
01:10:20,396 --> 01:10:22,364
Don't bullshit me, George.

847
01:10:22,398 --> 01:10:26,357
I don't want to waste time. I don't see you much.

848
01:10:27,403 --> 01:10:30,372
Ya come from my body, remember? You're my baby boy.

849
01:10:31,407 --> 01:10:36,367
Same kid who'd jump off a mountain if someone told him he couldn't.

850
01:10:36,412 --> 01:10:40,371
You haven't changed that much. Have you?

851
01:10:48,424 --> 01:10:50,392
I know what you're up to.

852
01:10:51,427 --> 01:10:54,396
Not everything, but I get the picture.

853
01:10:55,431 --> 01:10:59,390
And I don't care. I don't like it.

854
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:03,337
It's not what I would've chosen for you.

855
01:11:04,373 --> 01:11:06,341
But it's your life.

856
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:09,344
It's got nothing to do with me.

857
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:15,339
I couldn't stop you if I wanted to, could I?

858
01:11:15,384 --> 01:11:17,352
- Probably not.
- No.

859
01:11:19,388 --> 01:11:21,356
It's good.

860
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:23,358
Got a family.

861
01:11:23,392 --> 01:11:26,361
It's good if it makes you happy.

862
01:11:27,396 --> 01:11:30,365
It's nice to have nice things, George.

863
01:11:33,402 --> 01:11:35,370
Are you happy?

864
01:11:37,406 --> 01:11:40,375
Yeah, at the moment, I am happy, Dad.

865
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:50,385
Three years?

866
01:11:50,419 --> 01:11:53,388
How long have we been in business? Three years?

867
01:11:53,422 --> 01:11:56,391
Does she get to meet your connection?

868
01:11:57,426 --> 01:12:00,327
Shut up. They'll be here any minute.

869
01:12:00,363 --> 01:12:04,322
- I'm trying to concentrate.
- I'm very angry with you, George.

870
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:08,326
You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?

871
01:12:08,371 --> 01:12:10,339
It was you and me who started this.

872
01:12:10,373 --> 01:12:13,342
What do you need my connection for?

873
01:12:14,377 --> 01:12:19,337
Nothing. It's for the principle. It's for peace of mind.

874
01:12:19,382 --> 01:12:22,351
I ain't telling you, it's business. Now shut up. You're driving me crazy.

875
01:12:22,385 --> 01:12:25,354
I'm driving you fucking crazy?

876
01:12:25,388 --> 01:12:27,356
You're driving me crazy.

877
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:30,359
We had a dream. What happened to our dream?

878
01:12:30,393 --> 01:12:32,361
- Go inside. Go on.
- Shit.

879
01:12:39,402 --> 01:12:43,361
I give you everythin'. I give you everybody. What do ya give me, George?

880
01:12:43,406 --> 01:12:45,374
What do you give me?

881
01:12:49,412 --> 01:12:52,381
No problem. We'll count the shit later.

882
01:13:01,357 --> 01:13:04,326
You embarrassed me, George. You made me look very bad.

883
01:13:05,361 --> 01:13:06,328
Nothing.

884
01:13:07,363 --> 01:13:09,331
Everything is not right! I bring you in...

885
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:13,324
- and you slap my face.
- This is not the time.

886
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:16,338
No, no, no, no, no.

887
01:13:17,373 --> 01:13:19,341
Listen. "Todo esta bien".

888
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:21,343
Take the keys and go.

889
01:13:32,388 --> 01:13:34,356
Oh, fuck.

890
01:13:43,399 --> 01:13:46,368
Everything's all right. No problem.

891
01:13:46,402 --> 01:13:48,370
Okay? Never happened.

892
01:13:49,405 --> 01:13:52,374
Nobody has to know about this.

893
01:13:52,408 --> 01:13:57,368
I want you to very calmly tell these nice gentlemen where the cocaine is.

894
01:13:57,413 --> 01:13:59,381
Do it now.

895
01:14:06,355 --> 01:14:09,324
Nice doing business with you. Good-bye.

896
01:14:15,364 --> 01:14:17,332
Derek Foreal!

897
01:14:19,368 --> 01:14:20,335
What?

898
01:14:20,369 --> 01:14:24,328
Derek Foreal. Derek fucking Foreal, all right?!

899
01:14:24,373 --> 01:14:26,341
Answer to all your fucking dreams.

900
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:28,343
Happy now?

901
01:14:40,389 --> 01:14:43,358
Derek Foreal, Diego Delgado.

902
01:15:14,356 --> 01:15:18,315
I'm happy to see you two. Look at you. You're about to burst.

903
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,327
I am.

904
01:15:23,365 --> 01:15:26,334
Tell her not to drink too much.

905
01:15:26,368 --> 01:15:28,336
- So glad to see you.
- Me too.

906
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,338
- We have a lot to talk about.
- Where's Diego?

907
01:15:30,372 --> 01:15:32,340
He's not here.

908
01:15:32,374 --> 01:15:35,343
Where is he? And who the fuck is Norman Cay?

909
01:15:35,377 --> 01:15:40,337
Everybody's talkin' about him. N. Cay this, N. Cay that, you know him?

910
01:15:40,382 --> 01:15:42,350
He's not a person.

911
01:15:42,384 --> 01:15:46,343
Norman's Cay is an island. In the Bahamas.

912
01:15:46,388 --> 01:15:48,356
From what they say, it's very peaceful...

913
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:50,358
and that's where Diego has his new home.

914
01:15:50,392 --> 01:15:53,361
I understand he's bought a hundred sixty acres.

915
01:15:53,395 --> 01:15:56,364
A hotel, a marina and an airstrip.

916
01:15:56,398 --> 01:16:00,300
He's doin' multiple runs right now usin' the island as a jump-off point.

917
01:16:01,337 --> 01:16:07,298
And Jack Stevens is already a very busy man, along with many others.

918
01:16:10,346 --> 01:16:12,314
Aw, shit.

919
01:16:28,364 --> 01:16:30,332
Hey, am I wearing lipstick?

920
01:16:30,366 --> 01:16:33,335
I said, am I wearing lipstick?

921
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:35,337
When I'm fucked, I want my face pretty.

922
01:16:35,371 --> 01:16:37,339
Look, I can't be in the middle ofthis.

923
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:41,332
- That's between you and Diego.
- I bring you into-- Hang on.

924
01:16:41,377 --> 01:16:43,345
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

925
01:16:43,379 --> 01:16:46,348
I bring you in, this is how you pay me back?

926
01:16:46,382 --> 01:16:50,341
It's nothing personal. I love you. This is business.

927
01:16:51,387 --> 01:16:53,355
I got to go, George.

928
01:16:57,393 --> 01:16:59,361
What's wrong?

929
01:17:02,331 --> 01:17:04,299
- What?
- Nothing.

930
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,301
Happy New Year.

931
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:28,323
Welcome, my friend.

932
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:32,316
- It's been a long time.
- Don't touch me.

933
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:41,336
Happy to see you, George. My brother.

934
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:43,338
No more brothers, Diego.

935
01:17:45,374 --> 01:17:47,342
Why do you say that?

936
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:52,347
Of course we are brothers.

937
01:17:52,381 --> 01:17:54,349
You fucked me.

938
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:56,351
I did not.

939
01:17:57,386 --> 01:17:59,354
Yeah, you did.

940
01:17:59,388 --> 01:18:02,289
You went behind my back. You fucked me.

941
01:18:02,324 --> 01:18:03,291
Me? No.

942
01:18:04,326 --> 01:18:06,294
Never, George.

943
01:18:07,329 --> 01:18:08,296
Never.

944
01:18:12,334 --> 01:18:14,302
I talked to Derek.

945
01:18:24,346 --> 01:18:25,313
Well...

946
01:18:27,349 --> 01:18:29,317
maybe you're right.

947
01:18:30,352 --> 01:18:32,320
Maybe I did betray you...

948
01:18:32,354 --> 01:18:34,322
a little bit.

949
01:18:44,366 --> 01:18:48,325
Yeah, I stole your California connection.

950
01:18:50,372 --> 01:18:53,341
Who introduced you to Pablo Escobar?

951
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:55,343
Me. Me.

952
01:18:56,378 --> 01:19:00,280
Who introduced you to your fucking Colombian wife?

953
01:19:00,315 --> 01:19:02,283
Me. Who protected you...

954
01:19:02,317 --> 01:19:07,277
when my friend, Cesar Rosa wanted to slice your fucking throat out?

955
01:19:08,323 --> 01:19:09,290
Me.

956
01:19:10,325 --> 01:19:14,284
Who made you make millions and millions of dollars?

957
01:19:14,329 --> 01:19:15,296
Me.

958
01:19:16,331 --> 01:19:19,300
And what do I get in return?

959
01:19:19,334 --> 01:19:20,301
This.

960
01:19:21,336 --> 01:19:23,304
Accusations.

961
01:19:26,341 --> 01:19:30,300
I have always given you everything, George. Always.

962
01:19:30,345 --> 01:19:31,312
But...

963
01:19:36,351 --> 01:19:38,319
that is over now.

964
01:19:41,356 --> 01:19:45,315
Yeah, this is my operation, my dream. So go home.

965
01:19:47,362 --> 01:19:49,330
Go back home.

966
01:19:49,364 --> 01:19:52,333
Go back to your stupid little life.

967
01:19:52,367 --> 01:19:55,336
Go back and sell half grams to your fucking relatives--

968
01:19:58,373 --> 01:20:02,332
Because you're out. And don't be so emotional, George.

969
01:20:02,377 --> 01:20:05,346
We are brothers. We are brothers.

970
01:20:12,387 --> 01:20:15,356
Next time it's fucking loaded.

971
01:20:17,392 --> 01:20:19,360
Bye. Bye.

972
01:20:32,407 --> 01:20:36,366
- Say hello to your pretty wife for me.
- Sure.

973
01:21:45,414 --> 01:21:48,383
- Jesus Christ.
- It's all right, honey.

974
01:21:49,418 --> 01:21:52,387
- Look at you.
- It's okay.

975
01:21:52,421 --> 01:21:55,390
It's okay, baby. It's over.

976
01:21:56,425 --> 01:21:59,394
I quit the business. I'm out.

977
01:22:00,362 --> 01:22:02,330
It's all over.

978
01:22:03,365 --> 01:22:05,333
And I'm not going back.

979
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:11,339
It's just you and me and the baby.

980
01:22:12,374 --> 01:22:16,333
And there's nothing else. There's just us.

981
01:22:17,379 --> 01:22:19,347
You know...

982
01:22:20,382 --> 01:22:22,350
fuck it.

983
01:22:24,386 --> 01:22:26,354
Fuck them.

984
01:22:29,391 --> 01:22:31,359
Fuck them.

985
01:22:33,395 --> 01:22:35,363
Come here.

986
01:22:39,401 --> 01:22:40,368
I did.

987
01:22:40,402 --> 01:22:44,361
I quit the business. Got out completely.

988
01:22:44,406 --> 01:22:47,375
I mean, what the fuck? Why not?

989
01:22:47,409 --> 01:22:51,368
I'd made 60 million dollars and I was out clean.

990
01:22:52,414 --> 01:22:56,373
Well...maybe I jumped the gun on "clean."

991
01:22:56,418 --> 01:22:59,387
Georgie, let's go! The baby's coming!

992
01:22:59,421 --> 01:23:01,321
I'm coming! I'm coming.

993
01:23:01,356 --> 01:23:03,324
Jesus Christ.

994
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:05,326
George, hurry up!

995
01:23:10,365 --> 01:23:12,333
Georgie, let's go!

996
01:23:12,367 --> 01:23:14,335
Right! Right! Right!

997
01:23:14,369 --> 01:23:16,337
What the fuck?

998
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,348
I'll be right down.

999
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:40,361
Watching my baby girl being born did something to me.

1000
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:45,355
They talk about religious experiences. I didn't believe in religion.

1001
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,368
I didn't even particularly like kids.

1002
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:50,371
But when Kristina Sunshine Jung came into the world,

1003
01:23:50,405 --> 01:23:52,373
somethin' in me changed.

1004
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:55,376
I knew what I was put on the planet for.

1005
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:58,379
It was the greatest feeling I everhad...

1006
01:23:58,413 --> 01:24:03,316
followed very abruptly by the worst feeling I everhad.

1007
01:24:05,354 --> 01:24:09,313
Call the cardiologist. I think he's having a heart attack.

1008
01:24:16,365 --> 01:24:19,334
The official toxicity limit for humans is between one...

1009
01:24:19,368 --> 01:24:22,337
and one-and-a-half grams of cocaine, depending on body weight.

1010
01:24:22,371 --> 01:24:26,330
I was averaging five grams a day, maybe more.

1011
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:29,344
I snorted ten grams in ten minutes once.

1012
01:24:29,378 --> 01:24:31,346
I guess I had high tolerance.

1013
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:34,349
George, I'm not here to give you lectures.

1014
01:24:34,383 --> 01:24:38,342
I have no moral interest in what you do or don't do.

1015
01:24:38,387 --> 01:24:40,355
But take it easy, George.

1016
01:24:40,389 --> 01:24:42,357
Stay with us a while.

1017
01:24:42,391 --> 01:24:44,359
You have a daughter now.

1018
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:52,367
A daughter.

1019
01:25:13,355 --> 01:25:15,323
I came home and cleaned up my act.

1020
01:25:15,357 --> 01:25:19,316
I didn't do anything. No drink, no nothing.

1021
01:25:19,361 --> 01:25:21,329
Sober as a judge.

1022
01:25:21,363 --> 01:25:24,332
My life was all about Kristina.

1023
01:25:24,366 --> 01:25:27,335
Being with her, taking care ofher.

1024
01:25:27,369 --> 01:25:30,338
I wanted to be a father, a good father...

1025
01:25:30,372 --> 01:25:33,341
just like my old man was to me.

1026
01:26:11,346 --> 01:26:15,305
After five years of laying low, still sober...

1027
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:18,319
Mirtha needed to have some fun.

1028
01:26:18,353 --> 01:26:21,322
So on my 38th birthday, she threw a little party...

1029
01:26:21,356 --> 01:26:23,324
and invited some old friends.

1030
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,328
Happy birthday, George.

1031
01:26:28,363 --> 01:26:30,331
Mirtha invited me.

1032
01:26:30,365 --> 01:26:32,333
Yeah, she told me.

1033
01:26:34,369 --> 01:26:37,338
Look, I'm sorry about everything.

1034
01:26:37,372 --> 01:26:40,341
You were right. I did fuck you.

1035
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:44,334
And Diego fucked me. Cut me out too.

1036
01:26:44,379 --> 01:26:46,347
Yeah, I heard about it.

1037
01:26:46,381 --> 01:26:49,350
I lost sight of everything, George.

1038
01:26:50,385 --> 01:26:53,354
Forgot who my friends were.

1039
01:26:54,389 --> 01:26:57,358
Well, fuck it. It's in the past.

1040
01:26:58,393 --> 01:27:00,293
Forget about it. I'm out of the business...

1041
01:27:00,328 --> 01:27:04,287
- so we'll just move on.
- Yeah.

1042
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:07,301
Good to see you, Derek.

1043
01:27:07,335 --> 01:27:09,303
You too.

1044
01:27:11,339 --> 01:27:15,298
- Let's get a drink.
- Who's cutting your hair?

1045
01:27:15,343 --> 01:27:18,312
That's fucking funny, motherfucker!

1046
01:27:18,346 --> 01:27:21,315
Let's have some fucking fun!

1047
01:27:21,349 --> 01:27:23,317
Jesus, is that Mirtha?

1048
01:27:23,351 --> 01:27:28,311
Christ almighty, George. What does she weigh, 80 pounds?

1049
01:27:28,356 --> 01:27:31,325
Yeah, give or take. Come on.

1050
01:27:31,359 --> 01:27:35,318
Happy birthday to you

1051
01:27:35,363 --> 01:27:39,322
Happy birthday to you

1052
01:27:40,368 --> 01:27:44,327
Happy birthday to you

1053
01:27:46,374 --> 01:27:49,343
Happy birthday...

1054
01:27:49,377 --> 01:27:51,345
to you

1055
01:27:58,386 --> 01:28:00,286
Freeze!

1056
01:28:00,322 --> 01:28:02,290
Waiters.

1057
01:28:03,325 --> 01:28:07,284
I'm the only guy on the planet gets busted by fucking waiters.

1058
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:12,289
Why the feds decided to bust me on that particular night, I'll never know.

1059
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:15,303
Maybe it was the Porsches and the Maseratis in the driveway...

1060
01:28:15,337 --> 01:28:19,296
my Colombian guest list or the cocaine buffet.

1061
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:23,300
Whatever it was, they were just waiting forme to slip up.

1062
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:26,314
And I did.

1063
01:29:08,323 --> 01:29:12,282
- What's this?
- Your statement. How it was all yours.

1064
01:29:12,327 --> 01:29:14,295
The cocaine was for personal use.

1065
01:29:14,329 --> 01:29:16,297
None of the guests had any idea it was there.

1066
01:29:16,331 --> 01:29:18,299
Yeah, right.

1067
01:29:23,338 --> 01:29:28,298
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now. No fucking around.

1068
01:29:28,343 --> 01:29:32,302
My wife and my daughter on a plane tonight.

1069
01:29:32,347 --> 01:29:35,316
I sign this when I know they're safe.

1070
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:39,309
- No fucking way.
- Well, fuck you. I sign nothing, then.

1071
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:45,326
Do it.

1072
01:29:49,364 --> 01:29:51,332
- One more thing.
- What?

1073
01:29:51,366 --> 01:29:53,334
Get me a six-pack.

1074
01:29:53,368 --> 01:29:55,336
Yeah, right.

1075
01:30:01,376 --> 01:30:05,335
There was no way in the world I was going back to prison.

1076
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:09,339
So I signed the deal, took the rap and posted bail.

1077
01:30:09,384 --> 01:30:13,343
Once again, I would become a fugitive on the run.

1078
01:30:18,393 --> 01:30:21,362
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, George.

1079
01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:28,369
Ermine, your son is here.

1080
01:30:28,403 --> 01:30:31,372
Tell him I don't want to see him.

1081
01:30:31,406 --> 01:30:34,375
Tell him he's not welcome here.

1082
01:30:34,409 --> 01:30:37,378
- Mom--
- Don't ya dare step foot in this house.

1083
01:30:37,412 --> 01:30:40,381
You're not my son. You hear me?

1084
01:30:40,415 --> 01:30:43,384
I don't have a son anymore.

1085
01:30:47,422 --> 01:30:51,381
She's angry, George. It's been all over the news.

1086
01:30:57,432 --> 01:31:00,333
I just wanted let you guys know...

1087
01:31:00,368 --> 01:31:03,337
I'll be going away for a while.

1088
01:31:06,374 --> 01:31:09,343
- You're not going to go to trial?
- No.

1089
01:31:28,396 --> 01:31:30,364
So this is it.

1090
01:31:33,401 --> 01:31:35,369
I hope not, Pop.

1091
01:31:37,405 --> 01:31:38,372
Me too.

1092
01:31:55,423 --> 01:31:57,391
I've got to go, Pop.

1093
01:31:57,425 --> 01:32:00,326
- Take care of yourself.
- You too.

1094
01:32:21,382 --> 01:32:23,350
I wish to present Seor Rodriguez.

1095
01:32:23,384 --> 01:32:26,353
He's the president of our bank.

1096
01:32:29,390 --> 01:32:33,349
I am afraid that there is a problem, Mr. Jung.

1097
01:32:33,394 --> 01:32:37,353
The banks have gone through a change. Nationalization.

1098
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:40,367
I am afraid that...

1099
01:32:41,402 --> 01:32:46,362
your funds have been appropriated by the Panamanian government.

1100
01:32:47,408 --> 01:32:49,376
Please forgive me.

1101
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:53,369
Someone should have called you from the bank earlier.

1102
01:32:53,414 --> 01:32:55,382
My apologies, please.

1103
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:01,320
What are we going to do?

1104
01:33:03,358 --> 01:33:06,327
- What're we goin' to do for money?!
- Mirtha, please.

1105
01:33:06,361 --> 01:33:09,330
I'll talk to Augusto. I'll work for him.

1106
01:33:09,364 --> 01:33:11,332
Tell me! Answer the fucking question!

1107
01:33:11,366 --> 01:33:16,326
What do we spend? What? How will we live?

1108
01:33:16,371 --> 01:33:20,330
- Not in front of the kid.
- Don't give me that shit.

1109
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:23,344
You just better do something.

1110
01:33:37,392 --> 01:33:41,351
Everything's going to be okay. Don't be upset.

1111
01:33:41,396 --> 01:33:43,364
What's happening to us?

1112
01:33:46,401 --> 01:33:48,369
I don't know.

1113
01:33:49,404 --> 01:33:51,372
Are we going to get split up?

1114
01:33:51,406 --> 01:33:54,375
No, Jesus. God, don't even say that.

1115
01:33:55,410 --> 01:33:58,379
Listen to me. I love your mother.

1116
01:33:59,414 --> 01:34:01,314
But she's upset right now.

1117
01:34:04,352 --> 01:34:06,320
And you're my heart, kid.

1118
01:34:08,356 --> 01:34:11,325
Now, could I live without my heart?

1119
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:13,327
I hope not.

1120
01:34:16,364 --> 01:34:20,323
Take it easy. There's a fucking cop right behind us.

1121
01:34:20,368 --> 01:34:25,328
- Just fucking drive.
- What is your fucking problem?

1122
01:34:26,374 --> 01:34:29,343
We're broke. That's my fucking problem.

1123
01:34:30,378 --> 01:34:33,347
- And you are a fucking spy.
- What?

1124
01:34:35,383 --> 01:34:39,342
That's right. Always spying, always judging.

1125
01:34:39,387 --> 01:34:44,347
Everyone's laughing at you in your face, you fucking pussy.

1126
01:34:44,392 --> 01:34:47,361
You let Diego fuck you in the ass.

1127
01:34:47,395 --> 01:34:51,354
Maybe because you like it. Maybe because you are a faggot.

1128
01:34:51,399 --> 01:34:53,367
That's what I think you are.

1129
01:34:53,401 --> 01:34:57,360
I think you fuck him. You don't fuck me. You must fuck somebody else.

1130
01:34:58,406 --> 01:35:00,306
- Mirtha, come on.
- Why's that?

1131
01:35:00,341 --> 01:35:04,300
- Why don't you fuck me anymore?
- Take it easy.

1132
01:35:04,345 --> 01:35:08,304
- Why? Why don't you fuck me anymore?
- Get over there.

1133
01:35:17,358 --> 01:35:20,327
Don't you ever put your hands on me, motherfucker!

1134
01:35:20,361 --> 01:35:23,330
Don't you ever touch me again! Asshole!

1135
01:35:23,364 --> 01:35:26,333
- Relax.
- Get your hands off me!

1136
01:35:27,368 --> 01:35:30,337
He's a fugitive and a fucking cocaine dealer!

1137
01:35:30,371 --> 01:35:33,340
He has a kilo in his trunk right now!

1138
01:35:35,376 --> 01:35:38,345
Take this sorry motherfucker to jail!

1139
01:36:19,353 --> 01:36:21,321
I'm divorcing you, George.

1140
01:36:22,356 --> 01:36:25,325
I'm getting custody of Kristina.

1141
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:30,319
And when you get out next week, you're going to pay support.

1142
01:36:30,364 --> 01:36:32,332
And that's the end of it.

1143
01:36:36,370 --> 01:36:38,338
There's someone else.

1144
01:36:39,373 --> 01:36:41,341
I don't think you care...

1145
01:36:43,377 --> 01:36:45,345
but I wanted to tell you.

1146
01:36:48,382 --> 01:36:50,350
Say something.

1147
01:36:51,385 --> 01:36:54,354
What do you want me to say?

1148
01:36:54,388 --> 01:36:56,356
I'm in prison.

1149
01:36:58,392 --> 01:37:03,295
- Ya should know, ya put me in here.
- I knew ya'd say somethin' like that.

1150
01:37:04,332 --> 01:37:07,301
Always thinking about yourself.

1151
01:37:19,347 --> 01:37:21,315
- Say hello to your father.
- My God.

1152
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:24,318
- No.
- Now. Say hello.

1153
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:33,327
Hello, sweetheart.

1154
01:37:35,363 --> 01:37:38,332
I thought you couldn't live without your heart.

1155
01:38:10,331 --> 01:38:15,291
Every single day in the joint I thought of one thing.

1156
01:38:15,336 --> 01:38:17,304
One thing only.

1157
01:38:17,338 --> 01:38:19,306
My baby girl.

1158
01:38:20,341 --> 01:38:23,310
I needed to get my heart back.

1159
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:31,318
Bye, guys.

1160
01:38:46,367 --> 01:38:47,334
Hi, honey.

1161
01:38:47,368 --> 01:38:49,336
What are you doing here?

1162
01:38:50,371 --> 01:38:55,331
I wanted to let you know I was out and I wanted to see you.

1163
01:38:57,378 --> 01:38:59,346
How you doing?

1164
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:03,282
George, you just can't show up like this.

1165
01:39:03,317 --> 01:39:05,285
Why don't you try calling me Dad?

1166
01:39:05,319 --> 01:39:08,288
I don't want to, all right? Now leave me alone.

1167
01:39:08,322 --> 01:39:11,291
Wait. Honey, listen. Kristina...

1168
01:39:12,326 --> 01:39:14,294
I'm sorry.

1169
01:39:15,329 --> 01:39:19,288
I want to make everything okay. You know?

1170
01:39:20,334 --> 01:39:23,303
What do you want from me?

1171
01:39:25,339 --> 01:39:28,308
I want to be your dad again.

1172
01:39:29,343 --> 01:39:33,302
I just want to walk with you, if you don't mind.

1173
01:39:33,347 --> 01:39:36,316
I want to make everything okay.

1174
01:39:39,353 --> 01:39:43,312
If you could go anywhere in the world...anywhere...

1175
01:39:43,357 --> 01:39:45,325
where would you want to go?

1176
01:39:45,359 --> 01:39:47,327
I was making headway.

1177
01:39:47,361 --> 01:39:51,320
Kristina and I walked to and from school everyday.

1178
01:39:51,365 --> 01:39:53,333
Things were starting to look up.

1179
01:39:53,367 --> 01:39:57,326
California? Well, you can go anywhere in the world.

1180
01:39:57,371 --> 01:40:02,331
You can go to India, Tibet, Israel, France, whatever.

1181
01:40:02,376 --> 01:40:05,345
You'd still choose California?

1182
01:40:07,381 --> 01:40:09,349
Hey, Mom.

1183
01:40:09,383 --> 01:40:13,342
All right. Well, look, go on inside.

1184
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:20,349
- Bye, Dad. See you in the morning.
- Okay, I'll be here.

1185
01:40:22,396 --> 01:40:24,364
Hey, Mom.

1186
01:40:24,398 --> 01:40:27,367
I'm going to go inside and do my homework.

1187
01:40:27,401 --> 01:40:30,370
Okay. I'll be there in a minute.

1188
01:40:36,410 --> 01:40:38,378
What do you want?

1189
01:40:39,413 --> 01:40:41,381
A truce.

1190
01:40:41,415 --> 01:40:44,384
I don't want to fight with you anymore.

1191
01:40:44,418 --> 01:40:47,387
I just want to get along with you.

1192
01:40:47,421 --> 01:40:49,389
Be civil.

1193
01:40:52,426 --> 01:40:55,395
You know I've been seeing Kristina?

1194
01:40:55,429 --> 01:40:57,397
Yeah, she told me.

1195
01:40:57,431 --> 01:40:59,399
You walk her to school.

1196
01:41:03,371 --> 01:41:05,339
Anyway, I've been thinking....

1197
01:41:09,377 --> 01:41:11,345
I love her. You know that.

1198
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:16,339
I was thinking I'd kind of like to have her.

1199
01:41:18,386 --> 01:41:22,345
I've been away for such a long time, you know.

1200
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:25,359
I just want to be with her.

1201
01:41:27,395 --> 01:41:30,364
I haven't seen one dollar from you.

1202
01:41:30,398 --> 01:41:33,367
You haven't paid me one cent.

1203
01:41:34,402 --> 01:41:36,370
Child support, alimony.

1204
01:41:40,408 --> 01:41:44,367
You start helping us we'll see what will happen.

1205
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:50,384
All right. That's it.

1206
01:41:51,419 --> 01:41:54,388
That's all I wanted to say.

1207
01:41:55,423 --> 01:41:57,391
Take care.

1208
01:41:57,425 --> 01:41:59,393
You too.

1209
01:42:04,365 --> 01:42:05,332
George.

1210
01:42:11,372 --> 01:42:13,340
Are you okay?

1211
01:42:20,381 --> 01:42:23,350
Hello? Derek, hey. George.

1212
01:42:25,386 --> 01:42:30,346
Look. I need to do something. I want to put together a crew.

1213
01:42:30,391 --> 01:42:32,359
Know anybody?

1214
01:42:33,394 --> 01:42:37,353
It's a four-man operation. Two on the ground, two in the air.

1215
01:42:37,398 --> 01:42:39,366
Who's the copilot?

1216
01:42:40,401 --> 01:42:42,369
You're looking at him.

1217
01:42:42,403 --> 01:42:45,372
We'll provide the plane, transportation costs...

1218
01:42:45,406 --> 01:42:48,375
U.S. landing spot, wherever you want it to go.

1219
01:42:48,409 --> 01:42:52,368
You provide the pickup point and you're responsible for payment.

1220
01:42:52,413 --> 01:42:55,382
You also assume all bust risk.

1221
01:42:55,416 --> 01:42:58,385
We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees...

1222
01:42:58,419 --> 01:43:01,320
ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses.

1223
01:43:01,355 --> 01:43:06,315
And this is not a negotiation, so if it's okay with you, we can talk further.

1224
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,328
If not, forget we had this conversation.

1225
01:43:08,362 --> 01:43:11,331
No, no, no. Everything sounds good.

1226
01:43:11,365 --> 01:43:14,334
I must meet everybody involved, though.

1227
01:43:15,369 --> 01:43:18,338
They're right there at the table.

1228
01:43:20,374 --> 01:43:22,342
Gentlemen, this is George.

1229
01:43:23,377 --> 01:43:25,345
What do you say?

1230
01:43:25,379 --> 01:43:27,347
- Oh, my God, Dulli.
- Oh, my God.

1231
01:43:27,381 --> 01:43:30,350
Jesus. It's been years, man.

1232
01:43:30,384 --> 01:43:32,352
You look great.

1233
01:43:32,386 --> 01:43:37,346
This is my friend. I've known this guy for thirty years.

1234
01:43:37,391 --> 01:43:40,360
- Have my seat.
- Nice to see you.

1235
01:43:40,394 --> 01:43:42,362
Heard you got married.

1236
01:43:43,397 --> 01:43:45,365
Honey, you know what?

1237
01:43:45,399 --> 01:43:46,366
What?

1238
01:43:47,401 --> 01:43:50,370
I'm getting out of town this week.

1239
01:43:50,404 --> 01:43:52,372
Well, where are you going?

1240
01:43:52,406 --> 01:43:55,375
I don't know. Maybe California.

1241
01:43:55,409 --> 01:43:56,376
Liar.

1242
01:43:57,411 --> 01:44:00,312
Check it out, see what it's like.

1243
01:44:00,347 --> 01:44:04,306
I got a few things I have to take care of first, but maybe Thursday...

1244
01:44:04,351 --> 01:44:06,319
Thursday, after school.

1245
01:44:06,353 --> 01:44:09,322
You know I can't. Mom will never let me go.

1246
01:44:09,356 --> 01:44:11,324
Let me take care of your mother.

1247
01:44:11,358 --> 01:44:13,326
Just pack your bags, okay?

1248
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:15,328
But I've got school.

1249
01:44:15,362 --> 01:44:19,321
I know. But a friend of mine told me they got schools in California too.

1250
01:44:19,366 --> 01:44:21,334
- You swear?
- Yeah.

1251
01:44:21,368 --> 01:44:25,327
Three o'clock, Thursday, at your mother's. You and me?

1252
01:44:25,372 --> 01:44:28,341
- It's a date.
- I don't believe you.

1253
01:44:31,378 --> 01:44:34,347
I swear on my life, scout's honor.

1254
01:44:34,381 --> 01:44:36,349
Swear on my life.

1255
01:44:41,388 --> 01:44:43,356
I swear on your life.

1256
01:45:08,349 --> 01:45:10,317
All right!

1257
01:45:12,353 --> 01:45:14,321
That's a nice boy.

1258
01:45:14,355 --> 01:45:16,323
Go get him, Dulli.

1259
01:45:18,359 --> 01:45:19,326
Get in.

1260
01:45:27,368 --> 01:45:29,336
Are we good?

1261
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:33,329
Are we good? Yeah, we're good. We're fucking beautiful.

1262
01:45:33,374 --> 01:45:35,342
We're perfect.

1263
01:45:35,376 --> 01:45:40,336
This is grade-A, 100% pure Colombian cocaine, ladies and gentlemen.

1264
01:45:40,381 --> 01:45:43,350
Disco shit. Pure as the driven snow.

1265
01:45:44,385 --> 01:45:46,353
Good fucking riddance.

1266
01:45:47,388 --> 01:45:50,357
- You saved my life.
- No, I didn't.

1267
01:45:50,391 --> 01:45:54,350
No shit. You'll never know. Really. All you guys.

1268
01:45:54,395 --> 01:45:55,362
Really.

1269
01:45:55,396 --> 01:45:59,355
And being as how I'm feeling so fucking generous tonight...

1270
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:01,300
you just got a raise.

1271
01:46:02,336 --> 01:46:04,304
A raise?

1272
01:46:04,338 --> 01:46:08,297
Instead of ten percent, you're going to get fifteen.

1273
01:46:08,342 --> 01:46:10,310
Jesus, George.

1274
01:46:10,344 --> 01:46:12,312
That's an extra two hundred grand.

1275
01:46:12,346 --> 01:46:16,305
That's right. Do whatever you want with it. Have a nice life.

1276
01:46:16,350 --> 01:46:20,309
I'm out. "Finito". Last fucking party.

1277
01:46:20,354 --> 01:46:25,314
I'm going out to California. Start a new life with my kid.

1278
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:27,327
Here's to it.

1279
01:46:27,361 --> 01:46:30,330
- Cheers.
- Here's to you, Georgie.

1280
01:46:32,366 --> 01:46:36,325
- Here's to you, George.
- Cheers. All right, fellas.

1281
01:46:37,371 --> 01:46:41,330
Another round? I'm going to hit the head.

1282
01:46:42,376 --> 01:46:45,345
I feel like a fucking kid today.

1283
01:47:00,327 --> 01:47:03,296
- What?
- I feel bad.

1284
01:47:04,331 --> 01:47:05,298
Me too.

1285
01:47:07,334 --> 01:47:12,294
I like him too, but what's done is done. So let's not get all sentimental.

1286
01:47:21,348 --> 01:47:24,317
Dulli, you know what I was thinking?

1287
01:47:24,351 --> 01:47:27,320
I was remembering that time we flew into Mexico.

1288
01:47:27,354 --> 01:47:30,323
You remember that landing strip?

1289
01:47:31,358 --> 01:47:33,326
Fucking nuts.

1290
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:35,328
You're much better now.

1291
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:45,338
What's going on?

1292
01:47:45,372 --> 01:47:49,331
What the fuck? What's with the long faces?

1293
01:47:56,383 --> 01:47:58,351
Where's my fucking knife?

1294
01:48:32,352 --> 01:48:34,320
Let's do it.

1295
01:48:49,369 --> 01:48:51,337
I was busted.

1296
01:48:51,371 --> 01:48:56,331
Set up by the FBI and the DEA. That didn't bother me.

1297
01:48:56,376 --> 01:49:00,278
Set up by Kevin Dulli and Derek Foreal to save their own asses.

1298
01:49:00,314 --> 01:49:02,282
That didn't bother me.

1299
01:49:02,316 --> 01:49:05,285
Sentenced to sixty years at Otisville.

1300
01:49:05,319 --> 01:49:07,287
That didn't bother me.

1301
01:49:10,324 --> 01:49:12,292
I'd broken a promise.

1302
01:49:14,328 --> 01:49:17,297
Everything I love in my life goes away.

1303
01:49:32,346 --> 01:49:34,314
What's going on?

1304
01:49:39,353 --> 01:49:41,321
- You all right?
- I'm good.

1305
01:49:44,358 --> 01:49:45,325
Fuck.

1306
01:49:50,364 --> 01:49:53,333
- What do you got?
- Bad news.

1307
01:49:54,368 --> 01:49:58,327
Tried to get you furloughed, but your mom squashed it.

1308
01:50:00,374 --> 01:50:03,343
Said would only upset him.

1309
01:50:04,378 --> 01:50:07,347
So doesn't look good.

1310
01:50:14,388 --> 01:50:16,356
How's he doing?

1311
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:20,349
Not good. He's out of the hospital. He's home.

1312
01:50:20,394 --> 01:50:21,361
But...

1313
01:50:22,396 --> 01:50:25,365
there's nothing anyone can do.

1314
01:50:25,399 --> 01:50:28,368
I think it's just a matter oftime.

1315
01:50:31,405 --> 01:50:34,374
Got you a tape recorder. I thought...

1316
01:50:34,408 --> 01:50:40,369
he might want to hear your voice. If you want to say somethin' to him.

1317
01:50:41,415 --> 01:50:43,383
I'll give you five.

1318
01:51:14,381 --> 01:51:16,349
Hello, Dad.

1319
01:51:20,387 --> 01:51:22,355
You know, I remember a lifetime ago...

1320
01:51:22,389 --> 01:51:26,348
I was about three and a half feet tall...

1321
01:51:26,393 --> 01:51:31,353
weighing all of sixty pounds, but every inch your son.

1322
01:51:32,399 --> 01:51:35,368
Those Saturday mornings goin' to work with my dad.

1323
01:51:35,402 --> 01:51:39,361
And we'd climb into that big green truck.

1324
01:51:39,406 --> 01:51:44,366
I thought that truck was the biggest truck in the universe, Pop.

1325
01:51:45,412 --> 01:51:48,381
I remember how important the job we did was.

1326
01:51:48,415 --> 01:51:53,375
How, if it weren't for us people would freeze to death.

1327
01:51:55,422 --> 01:51:59,381
I thought you were the strongest man in the world.

1328
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:05,320
Remember those home movies when Mom would dress up like Loretta Young?

1329
01:52:05,365 --> 01:52:09,324
Ice creams and football games? Waino, the Tuna....

1330
01:52:09,369 --> 01:52:14,329
Day I left for California only to come home with the FBI chasing me.

1331
01:52:14,374 --> 01:52:19,334
When that FBI agent had to get on his knees to put my boots on, ya said...

1332
01:52:19,379 --> 01:52:25,340
That's where you belong, you son of a bitch. Putting on Georgie's boots.

1333
01:52:25,385 --> 01:52:27,353
That was a good one, Dad.

1334
01:52:28,388 --> 01:52:30,356
That was really something.

1335
01:52:30,390 --> 01:52:32,358
You remember that?

1336
01:52:35,395 --> 01:52:38,364
And when you told me money wasn't real?

1337
01:52:39,399 --> 01:52:41,367
Well, old man...

1338
01:52:41,401 --> 01:52:46,361
I'm forty-two years old, and I finally realize...

1339
01:52:46,406 --> 01:52:51,366
what you were trying to tell me so many years ago.

1340
01:52:52,412 --> 01:52:54,380
I finally understand.

1341
01:52:59,419 --> 01:53:01,319
You're the best, Dad.

1342
01:53:02,355 --> 01:53:07,315
I just wish I could've done more forya. I wish we had more time.

1343
01:53:09,362 --> 01:53:10,329
Anyway...

1344
01:53:14,367 --> 01:53:17,336
"May the wind always be at your back..."

1345
01:53:17,370 --> 01:53:20,339
"and the sun always upon your face..."

1346
01:53:20,373 --> 01:53:26,334
"and the winds of destiny to carry ya aloft to dance with the stars."

1347
01:53:34,387 --> 01:53:36,355
I love you, Dad.

1348
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:39,358
Love, George.

1349
01:54:01,348 --> 01:54:05,307
George, come on. You have a visitor.

1350
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:35,348
Hello, sweetheart.

1351
01:54:39,386 --> 01:54:41,354
Hi, Daddy.

1352
01:54:44,391 --> 01:54:46,359
God, you're so big.

1353
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,368
Daddy's a fuckup.

1354
01:54:57,404 --> 01:54:58,371
No.

1355
01:55:08,348 --> 01:55:12,307
You're the only thing in my life ever meant anything.

1356
01:55:12,352 --> 01:55:14,320
- You swear?
- I swear, baby.

1357
01:55:16,356 --> 01:55:18,324
I swear.

1358
01:55:19,359 --> 01:55:21,327
I love you, Kristina.

1359
01:55:22,362 --> 01:55:25,331
You're the only good thing in my life.

1360
01:55:25,365 --> 01:55:29,324
The only thing that ever meant anything to me.

1361
01:55:29,369 --> 01:55:31,337
I love you.

1362
01:55:41,381 --> 01:55:43,349
Come on, let's go.

1363
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:53,359
So tell me about your life.

1364
01:55:53,393 --> 01:55:57,352
- What do you want to know?
- Everything.

1365
01:55:57,397 --> 01:56:00,298
What do you do? You go to school?

1366
01:56:00,333 --> 01:56:02,301
Sometimes.

1367
01:56:02,335 --> 01:56:04,303
Just like the old man.

1368
01:56:08,341 --> 01:56:11,310
Let's go. It's getting dark.

1369
01:56:11,344 --> 01:56:14,313
Come on. It's getting late.

1370
01:56:17,350 --> 01:56:19,318
Come on, let's go.

1371
01:56:23,356 --> 01:56:25,324
Let's go.

1372
01:56:26,359 --> 01:56:28,327
I got a visitor.

1373
01:56:28,361 --> 01:56:31,330
Not today, George. It's time to go back.

1374
01:56:33,366 --> 01:56:38,326
Yeah, but I... I want to put her on the list for tomorrow.

1375
01:56:38,371 --> 01:56:40,339
My daughter.

1376
01:56:42,375 --> 01:56:45,344
My daughter's going to visit me tomorrow.

1377
01:56:45,378 --> 01:56:48,347
So in the end, was it worth it?

1378
01:56:48,381 --> 01:56:51,350
- It's lockdown time.
- Jesus Christ.

1379
01:56:51,384 --> 01:56:55,343
How irreparably changed my life has become.

1380
01:56:55,388 --> 01:56:58,357
It's always the last day of summer, and I'm left out in the cold...

1381
01:56:58,391 --> 01:57:01,292
with no door to get back in.

1382
01:57:01,328 --> 01:57:05,287
I'll grant you, I've had more than my share of poignant moments.

1383
01:57:05,332 --> 01:57:10,292
Life passes most people by while they're making grand plans for it.

1384
01:57:10,337 --> 01:57:15,297
Throughout my lifetime, I've left pieces of my heart here and there...

1385
01:57:15,342 --> 01:57:19,301
and now there's almost not enough to stay alive.

1386
01:57:19,346 --> 01:57:23,305
But I force a smile, knowing that my ambition...

1387
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:25,318
far exceeded my talent.

1388
01:57:26,353 --> 01:57:31,313
There are no more white horses or pretty ladies at my door.
