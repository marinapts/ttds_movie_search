1
00:00:52,424 --> 00:00:56,424
Sometimes when I wake up

2
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:59,448
me cry.

3
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:04,472
A dream I had never could I remember.

4
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:06,496
But...

5
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,420
But...

6
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:10,444
there is a feeling that I was missing something

7
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:14,468
lingering long after I woke up.

8
00:01:22,492 --> 00:01:24,492
I'm always looking for

9
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:27,416
something, someone.

10
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,440
This feeling came over me which I think has been since that day ...

11
00:01:33,464 --> 00:01:36,464
The day when the stars fall.

12
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:38,488
It was almost like ...

13
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:41,412
like a scene from a dream.

14
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,436
Less like

15
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,460
... a beautiful view. / ... a beautiful view.

16
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:51,484
How I wish the trip words

17
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:58,408
Up to the end of the world

18
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:03,432
without disappearing

19
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:09,456
Then what becomes of those words?

20
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:15,480
To promise that will not fade Let us say in a matter of 3

21
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:29,404
Your wish may be realized on several levels

22
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:34,428
My eyes could not see this greeting

23
00:02:34,452 --> 00:02:37,452
Since when and why? I do not know

24
00:02:37,476 --> 00:02:43,476
At which point the rain begins and ends, where the rainbow begins and ends

25
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,400
Place where my life fades,

26
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:49,424
I always believe that there is something being chased

27
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:58,448
One day we would go to all living beings never been there,

28
00:02:58,472 --> 00:03:03,472
Give tos and kiss at an unprecedented feeling, unexplored

29
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:09,496
Although all five dimensions of teasing but I still see you

30
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,420
Let's make a gesture to say "Nice to meet you"

31
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:18,444
And chased your name

32
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:30,968
Terjemahan & Sync  IrfanZM (Otakunime-ind.blogspot.com)

33
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:47,492
Such. Such.

34
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,416
Do not you remember me?

35
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
My name is...

36
00:03:57,464 --> 00:03:59,464
Mitsuha!

37
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:35,888
Mitsuha, what are you doing?

38
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:38,812
It ... feels like a real ...

39
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:44,836
What? "Mitsuha"? / In fact ngelindur? Breakfast!

40
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,860
Hurry!

41
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:08,884
What? What?

42
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:11,808
What?

43
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:20,832
Grandma had leftovers from last night?

44
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:22,856
You can eat it.

45
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,880
Good morning. / Good morning.

46
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:28,804
Mitsuha, you're late! / Tomorrow I'll make breakfast.

47
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:36,828
Is this the most? Maybe.

48
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:39,852
You normally today.

49
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:43,876
You crazy yesterday. / Are you talking about?

50
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Good morning, everyone.

51
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:52,824
This announcement from City Hall Itomori.

52
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:56,848
In connection with the election of mayor

53
00:05:57,872 --> 00:06:01,872
which will be held the 20th of next month, the selection committee ...

54
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:10,896
A comet with an orbital period of 1,200 years will pass within a month.

55
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,820
The comet will be seen by naked eye for a few days ...

56
00:06:15,844 --> 00:06:17,844
Just make it up with him.

57
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:19,268
This is adult business.

58
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:22,869
... JAXA is preparing space observations show this century.

59
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:41,893
We're leaving now!

60
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:03,817
Study hard!

61
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:10,841
Mitsuha!

62
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:13,865
Pagi, Sayaka, Tessie. / Pagi.

63
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:16,889
Come down. / Why? Stingy.

64
00:07:16,913 --> 00:07:18,213
You is heavy. / Coarse really.

65
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:19,814
You two are a peaceful stroll.

66
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:21,838
No!

67
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,862
Your hair looks okay today.

68
00:07:26,886 --> 00:07:28,186
What?

69
00:07:28,187 --> 00:07:31,887
Ya, apa nenekmu habis merukyahmu? / Merukyah?

70
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:33,811
Kamu kaya kerasukan it!

71
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:38,835
Do not be ridiculous. Mitsuha just stress, right?

72
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,859
Huh? You're talking about?

73
00:07:41,883 --> 00:07:43,883
You do not remember it?

74
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:46,807
The most important,

75
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:51,831
improve the city's finances to continue the revitalization project!

76
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:54,855
Only when this is achieved

77
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,879
can create a safety and security of the people!

78
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:00,803
As the incumbent mayor ...

79
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:03,827
Besides, she will be elected again.

80
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,851
I heard he distributes pork.

81
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,875
Hey, Miyamizu. / Good morning.

82
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:12,899
So the mayor and his son contractors also walk together.

83
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:14,923
That one.

84
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:20,847
Mitsuha!

85
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:22,871
Walk more confident!

86
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:26,895
He firmly with his family. / I'm impressed.

87
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:29,819
Very humiliating. / Damn if I were him.

88
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,843
Mitsuha.

89
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:34,867
In front of many people...

90
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:40,891
"Who are you?"

91
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:54,815
"Tasokare" means "Who is it" and says his home is "Tasogare-doki".

92
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,839
Twilight, it's not a day or night.

93
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:03,863
When the nebulous world and people might see something that is not human.

94
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:07,887
Length of expression including "karetaso-doki"

95
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:11,811
dan "kawatare-doki".

96
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:14,835
Tanya! Bukan "kawatare-doki"?

97
00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:18,859
Kawatare-doki? Guess that accent the locals.

98
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:21,883
I heard the elders Itomori still use the classical language.

99
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:24,807
However, we in the woods.

100
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:25,831
"Who are you?"

101
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:28,855
Good, then, Mitsuha.

102
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,879
Ya.

103
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,803
Oh, you finally remember your name today.

104
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,827
You do not remember?

105
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:44,851
Yesterday you forget the location of benches and cupboards lockermu.

106
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,875
Your hair is disheveled and not wear the ribbon.

107
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:52,899
What? Impossible! Is that true?

108
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:54,823
It looks like that time you again amnesia.

109
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:59,847
Well, I've been feeling lately I had a strange dream ...

110
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:02,871
Dreams about the lives of others?

111
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:06,895
I do not remember clearly.

112
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,819
I know! It is...

113
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:10,843
Your life before!

114
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:14,867
Or maybe your subconscious is connected to the group nature of the parallel Everett ...

115
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:19,891
Do not say that. / Oh! Tessie, you who write in my book?

116
00:10:20,815 --> 00:10:22,815
Nothing.

117
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,839
But Mitsuha, you are indeed a bit strange yesterday.

118
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:29,863
Do you feel okay?

119
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:33,887
It was really weird. I feel fine.

120
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:37,811
Maybe it was because of stress. Habit could arise, is not it?

121
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:39,835
Oh, do not remind me!

122
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:42,859
I can not stand in this town again.

123
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:48,883
The city is too small and crowded. I want to graduate and go to Tokyo.

124
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:53,807
I do not blame you. Indeed, there was nothing in this town.

125
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:57,831
Trains come every 2 hours.

126
00:10:57,855 --> 00:10:59,855
The store closes at 9 pm.

127
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,879
There is no bookstore, a dentist.

128
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:03,903
But two pubs for some reason.
[PUB MOTHER & PUB EYE-Cats]

129
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:05,827
There are no jobs.

130
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:08,851
There is no bride. / Sunlight short.

131
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,875
Give me a chance! / What?

132
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:16,899
I mean ... what if we popped into the cafe?

133
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:18,823
Café? / Really?

134
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:20,847
Where?

135
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:24,871
Halo.

136
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:26,895
Halo.

137
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:34,819
Is this a cafe? / Weve no such things here ?.

138
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:37,843
Mitsuha to return tuh.

139
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:40,867
I bet he experienced something heavy.

140
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:43,891
Well, he lives in the middle of the hill.

141
00:11:43,915 --> 00:11:45,915
Ya.

142
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,839
Hey, Tessie.

143
00:11:49,863 --> 00:11:51,863
What?

144
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:53,887
What are your plans after graduation?

145
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:57,811
Why? You inquire about my future?

146
00:11:58,835 --> 00:12:04,835
Nothing special. I would probably still live a normal life in the city.

147
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,859
I also prefer to do that.

148
00:12:22,883 --> 00:12:24,883
You're not ready, Yotsuha.

149
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:26,907
Listen to the sound of the string.

150
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,831
When you embroider like that,

151
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:34,855
emotions will slowly begin to flow between yourselves and thread it.

152
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,879
Knitting do not talk.

153
00:12:36,903 --> 00:12:38,803
What he means, "Concentrate".

154
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:44,827
1,000 years of history reflected in the webbing Itomori us.

155
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:47,851
Listen, 200 years ago ...

156
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,875
He started again.

157
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:56,899
Mayugoro bathroom slippers maker on fire and burn all of these areas.

158
00:12:57,823 --> 00:13:00,823
Temples and old documents were all destroyed

159
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,847
and this is known as ...

160
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:04,871
Kebakaran Hebat Mayugoro.

161
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,895
Fire called by his name? Mayugoro poor.

162
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:14,819
Then the significance of the festival we be unknown and only live performances.

163
00:13:15,843 --> 00:13:19,843
But although the term is lost, the tradition must be inherited.

164
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:24,867
It's our job which is important in Miyamizu Temple.

165
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,891
But the foolish law ...

166
00:13:31,815 --> 00:13:35,815
As if leaving the Shinto clergy and the house is not enough,

167
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,839
Now politics? He can not be expected.

168

Why not sell just kuchikamisake lot and use the money to go to Tokyo?

196

00:27:54,578 --> 00:27:57,578
I really do not remember.

337
00:27:57,602 --> 00:27:59,502
Oh right, right now?

338
00:27:59,526 --> 00:28:01,526
Excuse me.

339
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,550
Hello friends. / Hi.

340
00:28:06,574 --> 00:28:08,574
We made were good.

341
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:10,598
They, Taki?

342
00:28:13,522 --> 00:28:15,522
MONDAY, 12 SEPTEMBER

343
00:28:20,546 --> 00:28:23,546
"Mitsuha, who are you? What are you?

344
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,570
You do not hold-hold your breasts today.

345
00:28:26,594 --> 00:28:29,594
Breakfast is ready! Quick!

346
00:28:32,518 --> 00:28:34,518
Breast?

347
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:38,542
Good morning.

348
00:28:43,566 --> 00:28:46,566
Why are all staring at me?

349
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,590
Gini, acting rather strange yesterday.

350
00:28:49,614 --> 00:28:51,514
Huh?

351
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:52,938
TUESDAY, 12 SEPTEMBER

352
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,939
{\ AN3} "Stay alive for drawing"

353
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:55,563
Did you see election posters?

354
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:58,587
It does not matter who wins. All just a matter of how to manage the funds.

355
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,511
Shh! A person's livelihood depends on this.

356
00:29:02,535 --> 00:29:05,535
What they mean I'm right?

357
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,559
Mm, ya.

358
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,583
Hey, Mitsuha!

359
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:23,507
Wha ... What ...? What is this?

360
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,531
Mitsuha?

361
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:37,555
What is this ... what this might ...

362
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:42,579
What might be "we" really ...

363
00:29:42,603 --> 00:29:45,503
In dreams "we", the guy was and I ...

364
00:29:45,527 --> 00:29:47,527
In dreams "we", the girl was and I ...

365
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:51,551
PASSING PLACE?

366
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:09,575
So you've finally awakened,

367
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,599
then why can not you see with your eyes?

368
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:18,523
You're late, you sputter,

369
00:30:20,547 --> 00:30:24,547
but I have been trying to get here as well

370
00:30:24,571 --> 00:30:27,571
I began to understand what was going on.

371
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:31,595
Taki is a guy my age who lives in Tokyo.

372
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:34,519
I swapped places with Mitsuha randomly,

373
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:36,543
several times a week unexpectedly.

374
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:40,567
Sleep is triggered. The cause is still a mystery.

375
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:45,591
My memory is not clear after I woke up.

376
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:49,515
But we certainly swap places.

377
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:53,539
It was clear from the reactions of people around us. So...

378
00:30:53,563 --> 00:30:57,563
So we set some rules to protect each individual lifestyle.

379
00:30:58,587 --> 00:31:03,587
All the things that happened during the "exchange areas" and a list of "prohibited".

380
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:07,511
We also agreed to write a report on our smartphones.

381
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:12,535
To work together to solve this mysterious phenomenon.

382
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,559
But...

383
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,583
But...

384
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:18,407
That girl! / That guy!

385
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:58,531
{\ AN6} "SO NOT!"

386

387

{\ AN6} "DO WASTES! DO NOT USE dialect! DO NOT be late!"

388
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:23,503
From the beginning of life-before I began to investigate you

389
00:31:23,527 --> 00:31:28,527
I'm getting used to laugh awkward

390
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:33,551
If you're missing missing missing like dust in space

391
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:37,575
The guy looked at! See the skirt! Really, this is not it wonderful!

{\ AN6} "Pake KALO hati2 ROK!"

Or will create a natural we start from zero again

394
00:31:41,547 --> 00:31:45,547
Do not spend my money! / It's your body, and I also work!

395
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:48,571
Knitting ... I can not do this!

396
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:51,595
Schedule your work too much! / For ye are wasteful!

397
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:55,519
Can we do it better?

398
00:31:56,543 --> 00:32:00,543
Our future, untold misery?

399
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:05,567
What I did not tell you?

400
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:11,591
Together we can smile and reply

401
00:32:11,615 --> 00:32:16,515
Coffee with Miss Okudera. You two do the fun!

402
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:19,539
Mitsuha, do not change my relationship!

403
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:23,563
Taki, why a girl in love with me?

404
00:32:23,587 --> 00:32:26,587
You are more popular when I was you.

405
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,511
Do not be yourself completely! Do as you're together cewekmu!

406
00:32:29,535 --> 00:32:30,935
You do not have a girlfriend guy!

407
00:32:30,936 --> 00:32:32,936
I I...

408
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,560
{\ AN6} "foolish"

409
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,584
I'm single because my will!

410
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,508
I do not have to obey "him".

411
00:33:02,532 --> 00:33:04,532
Do you really believe like breasts.

412
00:33:04,556 --> 00:33:07,556
We're leaving now! Be prepared!

413
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,580
Tiamat comet has been visible invisible for several days.

414
00:33:14,604 --> 00:33:16,504
When and where the comet could be seen?

415
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:22,528
{\ AN6} "Comet Tiamat reach Point Tracks"

416
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:22,552
Tiamat comet moves from east to west seem to follow the sun.

417
00:33:22,576 --> 00:33:24,576
So this is visible above Venus ...

418
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,500
Why wear a uniform?

419
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:39,524
Grandma, why the temple of the god we are very far away?

420
00:33:40,548 --> 00:33:43,548
Aku tak tahu penyebab Mayugoro.

421
00:33:43,572 --> 00:33:46,572
Who is that? / What? He's famous!

422
00:33:55,596 --> 00:33:57,596
Here, the grandmother.

423
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,520
Whoa, Mitsuha.

424
00:34:14,544 --> 00:34:18,544
Mitsuha, Yotsuha, kalian ahu "Musubi"?

425
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:25,568
Musubi? / Musubi adalah cara lama untuk memanggil dewa penjaga lokal.

426
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:28,592
This term has a very broad sense.

427
00:34:29,516 --> 00:34:34,516
Knitting yarn is Musubi. Connecting with people is Musubi.

428
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,540
Aliran waktu adalah Musubi.

429
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:40,564
It's all the power of gods.

430
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:44,588
So we make knitted

431
00:34:44,612 --> 00:34:49,512
is the art of god and represent the flow of time itself.

432
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:53,536
They connect and create a form.

433
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
They rolled up, tie

434
00:34:56,584 --> 00:35:00,584
sometimes decompose, break up, then connect again.

435
00:35:01,508 --> 00:35:04,508
Musubi ... mengikat. Itulah waktu.

436
00:35:08,532 --> 00:35:10,532
Drink. / Thank you.

437
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:15,556
I want too! / It also Musubi.

438
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,580
Whether it's the shape of water, rice, or sake,

439
00:35:19,604 --> 00:35:24,504
if a person consumes something and fused with his soul, that Musubi.

440
00:35:24,528 --> 00:35:27,528
So the show today

441
00:35:27,552 --> 00:35:33,552
is an important habit that connects gods and men.

442
00:35:34,576 --> 00:35:36,576
Hey, I saw it!

443
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Ituk Tubh Deva skilled Miamizu?

444
00:36:01,524 --> 00:36:04,524
Above this location is "kakuriyo".

445
00:36:05,548 --> 00:36:07,548
Which means hell.

446
00:36:08,572 --> 00:36:10,572
This is hell!

447
00:36:13,596 --> 00:36:17,596
In exchange for returning to this world, you have to leave

448
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,520
whatever's important to you.

449
00:36:22,544 --> 00:36:24,544
Kuchikamisake.

450
00:36:25,568 --> 00:36:27,568
Kuchikamisake?

451
00:36:27,592 --> 00:36:30,592
You give it to the body of a god.

452
00:36:30,616 --> 00:36:34,516
Half of you.

453
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,540
Half of Mitsuha ...

454
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:58,564
Ini sudah senja "kataware-doki".

455
00:36:58,588 --> 00:37:00,588
Kataware-doki?

456
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:12,512
Oh ya,

457
00:37:12,536 --> 00:37:14,536
maybe I could see kometnya.

458
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,560
Comet?

459
00:37:17,584 --> 00:37:20,584
Oh, Mitsuha,

460
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:24,508
Now you're dreaming, right?

461
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:37,532
Tears? Why?

462
00:37:40,556 --> 00:37:42,556
{\ AN3} "I'm almost there, wait!"

463
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,580
Nona Okudera? Dia bicara apa?

464
00:37:47,504 --> 00:37:49,504
Mitsuha what has been done this time?

465
00:37:51,528 --> 00:37:53,528
Date?

466
00:38:00,552 --> 00:38:03,552
A date with Miss Okudera tomorrow!

467
00:38:03,576 --> 00:38:05,576
Meet at 10:30 am at the station!

468
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,500
... itulah yang akan kurencanakan, tapi ...

469
00:38:23,524 --> 00:38:25,524

470
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:30,548
Sorry, what you've been waiting long? / Yes No...

471
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:32,572
A...

00:38:40,596 --> 00:38:44,596
I just got here. / Good. Let's go.

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,520
He was lucky. They now have probably already shared ...

00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:55,544
Hey?

475
00:38:58,568 --> 00:39:00,568
I...

476
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:03,592
Why?

477
00:39:08,516 --> 00:39:11,516
I want to go on this date,

478
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:16,540
but when that occurs, eventually you are going, you'd better enjoy it!

479
00:39:21,564 --> 00:39:25,564
However I'm sure you never go on a date before,

480
00:39:27,588 --> 00:39:29,588
I do not know what to say ...

481
00:39:29,612 --> 00:39:34,512
So below are links to help you, you're a slow learner.

482
00:39:34,536 --> 00:39:36,536
Seriously?

483
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,560
"You can also get the girl!"

484
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:42,584
"I suffer from anxiety but can be a girl! What can and can not be on SMS."

485
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:44,808
"He" pranking.

You're like a different person today.

489
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:33,581
Um, Miss Okudera, you hungry? How about dinner ...

490
00:40:35,505 --> 00:40:37,505
Leave off today.

Taki, you ... I'm sorry if I'm wrong.

493
00:40:45,554 --> 00:40:49,554
You had a little crush on me right?

494
00:40:50,578 --> 00:40:53,578
But now you're like everyone else.

495
00:40:55,502 --> 00:40:57,502
No, I'm not anyone else!

496
00:40:57,526 --> 00:41:00,526
Very? / No! That's not true at all.

00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,550
I am curious.

We were worried about you. / Huh?

You can not go alone. What if this action is counter?

So I decided to go see Mitsuha directly.

I want to see him, but ...

I'm not planning a tour! / Oh yes, we'll help you find him.

Really annoying. / Oh, he's moving!

554
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:19,518
So however this is impossible ... / What? After all the trouble we've been through?

555
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:24,542
You did not do anything.

00:58:19,824 --> 00:58:23,824
sometimes unraveled and then connected again ...

663
00:58:24,848 --> 00:58:28,848
Musubi ... mengikat. Itulah waktu.

664
00:58:39,872 --> 00:58:41,872
That's the spot!

665
00:58:42,896 --> 00:58:44,896
The place is really there!

666
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,920
It was not just a dream!

667
00:59:18,844 --> 00:59:21,844
From here is hell.

668
00:59:44,868 --> 00:59:47,868
This sake that we carry.

669
00:59:48,892 --> 00:59:52,892
Which is owned by his sister, and that's mine.

670
00:59:55,816 --> 01:00:01,816
Before the comet ... So Mitsuha I know is derived from three years ago?

671
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,840
Our timeline is not aligned.

672
01:00:07,864 --> 01:00:10,864
Half her ...

673
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:27,388
Musubi.

674
01:00:27,412 --> 01:00:30,312
If time could be turned back,

675
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,336
Give me one more chance ...

676
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,360
A comet!

677
01:01:54,384 --> 01:01:57,384
Your name is Mitsuha.

678
01:02:04,308 --> 01:02:06,308
You two are my precious.

679
01:02:06,332 --> 01:02:08,332
You are now an elder.

680
01:02:08,356 --> 01:02:11,356
"As soon recover, mother."

681
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:14,380
I'm sorry, dear.

682
01:02:15,304 --> 01:02:19,304
Dad, when the mother can go home?

683
01:02:20,328 --> 01:02:23,328
I could not save him. / And be yourself!

684
01:02:23,352 --> 01:02:25,352
Who cares about the temple?

685
01:02:25,376 --> 01:02:30,376
You are the son-lift! / I love my wife Futaba, not Temple Miyamizu.

686
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,400
Get out of here!

687
01:02:34,324 --> 01:02:36,324
Mitsuha, Yotsuha,

688
01:02:36,348 --> 01:02:40,348
from now on you with my grandmother.

689
01:02:44,372 --> 01:02:47,372
Who am I? No, who are you?

690
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:50,396
Do not be yourself completely. Not like you were with cewekmu.

691
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:54,320
He was lucky. They must have been together now ...

692
01:02:56,344 --> 01:02:57,344
I...

693
01:02:57,368 --> 01:02:59,368
I will go to Tokyo. / What? Hey, Mitsuha!

694
01:03:02,392 --> 01:03:06,392
Grandma, can you help me?

695
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:09,316
Oh yeah, the comet.

696
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:13,340
Today the most shining peak ...

697
01:03:13,364 --> 01:03:15,364
Mitsuha! Do not just stand there!

698
01:03:16,388 --> 01:03:21,388
Mitsuha, get out of there before the comet hit!

699
01:03:23,312 --> 01:03:25,312
Mitsuha, go out from there!

700
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:28,336
Mitsuha! Mitsuha!

701
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,360
Mitsuha!

702
01:03:49,384 --> 01:03:52,384
I Mitsuha! He is still alive!

703
01:04:03,308 --> 01:04:05,308
Mitsuha, apa kau menyentuh ...

704
01:04:08,332 --> 01:04:10,332
My sister!

705
01:04:11,356 --> 01:04:14,356
Yotsuha!

706
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,380
Mitsuha finally mad.

707
01:04:19,404 --> 01:04:22,304
I left without him.

708
01:04:22,328 --> 01:04:24,328
He's crazy.

709
01:04:24,352 --> 01:04:27,352
He's so crazy.

710
01:04:27,376 --> 01:04:28,776
Scary.

711
01:04:28,777 --> 01:04:33,377
Tiamat comet has been visible to the naked eye for a few days now.

712
01:04:33,401 --> 01:04:37,301
Tonight comet finally reached the point of its trajectory around the clock 7:40,

713
01:04:37,325 --> 01:04:40,325
and will achieve maximum light.

714
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:42,349
Happened tonight. There is still time.

715
01:04:43,373 --> 01:04:45,373
Good morning, Mitsuha.

716
01:04:45,397 --> 01:04:47,397
Oh...

717
01:04:48,321 --> 01:04:51,321
Kamu bukan Mitsuha 'kan?

718
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:55,345
You know, Grandma?

719
01:04:55,369 --> 01:05:01,369
No, look at the acting lately trigger some memories.

720
01:05:03,393 --> 01:05:08,393
I also remember seeing a strange dream when I was young.

721
01:05:09,317 --> 01:05:15,317
Although now I've forgotten what life I dreamed of.

722
01:05:16,341 --> 01:05:17,741
Forgot...

723
01:05:17,742 --> 01:05:22,342
Valuable experience. The dream will disappear after you wake up.

724
01:05:22,366 --> 01:05:27,366
At some time your mother and I had a similar experience.

725
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:32,390
Maybe the dream was experienced by people Miyamizu

726
01:05:32,414 --> 01:05:35,314
is about what will happen today.

727
01:05:36,338 --> 01:05:38,338
Grandma, listen.

728
01:05:38,362 --> 01:05:43,362
A comet will hit Itomori tonight and everyone will die.

729
01:05:50,486 --> 01:05:55,486
"No one will believe it"? It was the usual answer is surprising, grandma.

730
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:58,410
Will not let them die!

731
01:05:59,434 --> 01:06:01,434
Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

732
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:06,458
Ram ... hair!

733
01:06:06,482 --> 01:06:08,482
Oh, this. Previous look better, huh?

734
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,406
Oh, that's it?

735
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:14,430
Enough already! If you do not do anything, everyone will die tonight!

736
01:06:17,454 --> 01:06:19,454
If we have to act!

737
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,480
Why are you not in school?

738
01:06:25,504 --> 01:06:30,404
Uh ... we must save this city.

739
01:06:32,428 --> 01:06:36,428
Without a system of community-cable? / Yes, the speakers, you see everywhere.

740
01:06:36,452 --> 01:06:39,452
"Superimposition, the frequency"

741
01:06:40,476 --> 01:06:44,476
I know! It could work! You are wonderful, Tessie!

742
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,400
Hey! Do not get too close!

743
01:06:47,424 --> 01:06:49,424
What, shame huh? Hey, hey!

744
01:06:49,448 --> 01:06:52,448
Stop! You have a big girl!

745
01:06:53,472 --> 01:06:55,472
"Clubs Terminated - No Closer"

746
01:06:54,496 --> 01:06:57,496
You are a good man!

747
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,420
Can already be. It kembalianmu.

748
01:07:02,444 --> 01:07:04,444
Maaf, Sayaka.

749
01:07:04,468 --> 01:07:06,468
It's fine.

750
01:07:06,492 --> 01:07:08,492
Really cheap wages. / Just accept it.

751
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:14,416
How about you? Did you create evacuation plans?

752
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,440
What? Bomb?

753
01:07:20,464 --> 01:07:24,464
We had a water gel explosives for construction in our warehouse.

754
01:07:24,488 --> 01:07:26,488
Plowing broadcasting?

755
01:07:26,512 --> 01:07:31,412
No-cable system the city is easily hijacked by using the startup frequency.

756
01:07:31,436 --> 01:07:35,436
So we could broadcast a warning evacuation of the school.

757
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:40,460
Schools are outside the disaster area, so people can be evacuated here.

758
01:07:41,484 --> 01:07:43,484
This ... this is really a crime!

759
01:07:43,508 --> 01:07:45,408
You are doing the broadcasting.

760
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:48,432
Why? / You come broadcasting club.

761
01:07:48,456 --> 01:07:52,456
I was responsible for the bombing. / I'll talk to the mayor.

762
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,480
At the end, the city council has mengevakusai everyone.

763
01:07:56,504 --> 01:07:59,404
I was her daughter. I can persuade him.

764
01:07:59,428 --> 01:08:01,428
It's a perfect plan.

765
01:08:03,452 --> 01:08:07,452
Oh, whatever. This is merely an illusion "if", right?

766
01:08:07,476 --> 01:08:10,476
What? Gini ...

767
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,400
No need! Do you know what Itomori lake formed?

768
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:18,424
{\ AN6} "A meteor crater lake was formed 1,200 years ago."

769
01:08:14,448 --> 01:08:20,448
It's a meteor crater! So meteor ever hit this area thousands of years ago!

770
01:08:20,472 --> 01:08:22,472
Oh! So that's why ...

771
01:08:22,496 --> 01:08:24,496
You're right, Tessie!

772
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:30,420
Let's do it together!

773
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:36,444
What actually are you talking about?

774
01:08:38,468 --> 01:08:42,468
I said we should mengevakusai everyone in this town before dinner or ...

775
01:08:42,492 --> 01:08:44,492
Shut up.

776
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,460
"The comet will break up and crash into this city"?

777
01:08:53,484 --> 01:08:55,484
{\ AN6} CENTER CITY ITOMORI

778
01:08:53,484 --> 01:08:55,484
"More than 500 people will die"?

779
01:08:56,408 --> 01:08:58,408
How dare you spit that shit?

780
01:08:59,432 --> 01:09:02,432
If you are serious, then you're crazy.

781
01:09:03,456 --> 01:09:05,456
Madness must have come from the Miyamizu.

782
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:11,480
I'll call people to take you to the hospital in the city.

783
01:09:11,504 --> 01:09:15,404
I listened to your words after the doctor will examine you.

784
01:09:19,428 --> 01:09:21,428
Dasar kau bring ...!

785
01:09:29,452 --> 01:09:32,452
Mitsuha! Tidak ...

786
01:09:33,476 --> 01:09:35,476
Who...

787
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,400
Who are you?

788
01:09:52,424 --> 01:09:54,424
See you at the festival.

789
01:09:54,448 --> 01:09:55,848
Let's meet at the temple.

790
01:09:55,849 --> 01:09:57,449
Do not be late. / Dah!

791
01:09:57,473 --> 01:09:59,473
Bye. / See you later.

792
01:10:00,497 --> 01:10:02,497
You can not go there!

793
01:10:02,521 --> 01:10:04,521
Go away from this town. Tell your friends.

794
01:10:04,545 --> 01:10:07,445
This you say what? / Mitsuha!

795
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:09,469
What was that? / Let's go.

796
01:10:09,493 --> 01:10:11,493
What are you doing?

797
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:14,417
Can Mitsuha ...

798
01:10:14,441 --> 01:10:18,441
Can he persuade them? Is this a fault?

799
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:22,465
Youtsuha, leave this city with grandmother before nightfall.

800
01:10:22,489 --> 01:10:24,489
You will die if it stays here!

801
01:10:24,513 --> 01:10:26,413
This you say what?

802
01:10:26,437 --> 01:10:31,437
Yesterday you suddenly go to Tokyo. What is wrong with you?

803
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:34,461
Tokyo?

804
01:10:34,485 --> 01:10:36,485
Hey, Mitsuha!

805
01:10:39,409 --> 01:10:41,409
How to deal with your father?

806
01:10:43,433 --> 01:10:45,433
Hey, Mitsuha?

807
01:10:45,457 --> 01:10:47,457
Why him?

808
01:10:47,481 --> 01:10:49,481
I have no idea.

809
01:10:58,405 --> 01:11:00,405
Are you there?

810
01:11:01,429 --> 01:11:03,429
There is something there?

811
01:11:03,453 --> 01:11:05,453
Here I borrow your bike.

812
01:11:05,477 --> 01:11:06,877
Hey, what are you ...

813
01:11:06,878 --> 01:11:10,478
Hey, Mitsuha! What about our plans?

814
01:11:10,502 --> 01:11:12,502
Prepare according to plan!

815
01:11:12,526 --> 01:11:14,526
Please!

816
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:42,450
I Taki again.

817
01:11:46,474 --> 01:11:48,474
What do Taki here?

818
01:11:58,498 --> 01:12:01,498
The city is ... gone.

819
01:12:11,422 --> 01:12:14,422
At that point ... what I've ...

820
01:12:17,446 --> 01:12:19,446
die?

821
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:32,470
Such. Such.

822
01:12:34,494 --> 01:12:36,494
Do not you remember me?

823
01:12:49,418 --> 01:12:52,418
I went to Tokyo. / What? Now?

824
01:12:52,442 --> 01:12:54,442
Why?

825
01:12:54,466 --> 01:12:55,866
Date.

826
01:12:55,867 --> 01:12:57,467
You have a girlfriend in Tokyo?

827
01:12:57,491 --> 01:12:59,491
Not a date.

828
01:13:01,415 --> 01:13:03,415
I'll be home tonight.

829
01:13:06,439 --> 01:13:10,439
If I suddenly appear, what I'm going to interrupt him? Surprise him?

830
01:13:10,463 --> 01:13:14,463
He may not like.

831
01:13:21,487 --> 01:13:25,487
The number you call is not active ...

832
01:13:25,511 --> 01:13:27,411
There was no way we could meet.

833
01:13:27,435 --> 01:13:29,435
But what if we met?

834
01:13:30,459 --> 01:13:34,459
What should I do? What would I ignored him? What will be awkward?

835
01:13:34,483 --> 01:13:36,483
{\ AN6} "Comets Approaching Earth Tomorrow will Tiamat"

Or maybe...

837
01:13:38,431 --> 01:13:41,431
he was quite happy to see me?

838
01:13:42,455 --> 01:13:46,455
The number you call is not active ...

839
01:13:47,479 --> 01:13:50,479
There was no way we could meet.

840
01:13:51,403 --> 01:13:53,403
But...

841
01:13:53,427 --> 01:13:56,427
one thing is certain.

842
01:13:57,451 --> 01:14:01,451
If we meet, we'll know.

843
01:14:02,475 --> 01:14:05,475
If you're the one that is in me.

844
01:14:06,499 --> 01:14:09,499
If I'm the one who is in you.

845
01:14:09,523 --> 01:14:11,523
Sorry.

846
01:14:42,447 --> 01:14:44,447
Excuse me.

847
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:20,471
At that time three years ago, before I knew you ...

848
01:15:23,495 --> 01:15:25,495
Such.

Such.

851
01:15:31,467 --> 01:15:33,467
Um ... it's me.

852
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:38,491
Do not you remember me?

853
01:15:39,415 --> 01:15:41,415
Who are you?

854
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:48,439
Sorry.

855

But he is Taki.

856
01:15:57,487 --> 01:15:59,487
Strange girl.

857
01:16:08,411 --> 01:16:10,411
Hey!

858
01:16:10,435 --> 01:16:12,435
What is your name?

859
01:16:12,459 --> 01:16:14,459
Mitsuha!

860
01:16:14,483 --> 01:16:16,483
Namaku Mitsuha!

861
01:16:23,307 --> 01:16:29,407
It was 3 years ago, you came ...

862
01:16:29,431 --> 01:16:31,431

Mitsuha!

867
01:17:12,451 --> 01:17:16,451
You are here right? In my body!

Such!

869
01:17:19,499 --> 01:17:21,499
Taki, where are you?

01:17:21,523 --> 01:17:23,523
Itu Mitsuha.

871

I can hear it, but ...

872

Taki, where are you?

873

Taki! / I came to see.

881
01:18:51,487 --> 01:18:55,487
It is not easy because you're so far.

882
01:18:55,511 --> 01:19:00,411
But how? At that moment, I ...

883
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:02,435
Aku meminum kuchikamisake milikmu.

884
01:19:06,459 --> 01:19:08,459
You drink it?

885
01:19:10,483 --> 01:19:12,483
You are stupid! Very rude!

886
01:19:12,507 --> 01:19:15,407
Oh yes, and you touch-touch your breasts!

887

How do you know?

888

Yotsuha beholder.

889
01:19:19,479 --> 01:19:23,479
Oh! Sorry, I can not stand! It was only once.

890
01:19:23,503 --> 01:19:25,503
Just once?

891
01:19:26,427 --> 01:19:28,427
It does not matter how many times! Fuck.

892
01:19:29,451 --> 01:19:31,451
Sorry.

893

Oh, this ...

894
01:19:33,499 --> 01:19:37,499
Oh. Really, why do you want to see before I know you?

895
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:39,423
There was no way I could have known you.

896
01:19:39,447 --> 01:19:43,447
This. I've kept it for 3 years.

897
01:19:44,471 --> 01:19:46,471
Now you save.

898

Not bad. / You're lying!

901
01:20:02,467 --> 01:20:04,467
No, I'm ... sorry.

You are so ...!

903

Mitsuha, there are still things you must do. Listen.

Already arrived.

905

Do not worry. You still have time.

Yes, I'll try.

Hey, Mitsuha. So we remember when we wake ...

Let each write our names. This.

I want to tell you.

915

Wherever you are in this world, I will find you.

916

To save him. I want him to stay alive.

Yes! Saw it with my own eyes!

01:27:34,101 --> 01:27:36,001
Remain in place, they said.

997
01:27:36,025 --> 01:27:38,025
What happened? / So we silent?

998
01:27:39,049 --> 01:27:44,049
Come on, you all had to evacuate! Itomori ensconced in high school!

999
01:27:44,073 --> 01:27:46,073
Katsuhiko!

1000
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:51,097
What are you doing?

1001
01:27:54,021 --> 01:27:56,021
Maaf aku, Mitsuha.

1002
01:27:57,045 --> 01:27:59,045
All is over.

1003
01:28:01,069 --> 01:28:04,069
Meteor actually split!

1004
01:28:10,393 --> 01:28:12,393
Look at that! / Wow!

1005
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:15,317
Let me see! Kometnya split into 2

1006
01:28:15,341 --> 01:28:17,341
and the meteor fall!

1007
01:28:17,365 --> 01:28:19,365
Nobody predicted this.

1008
01:28:19,389 --> 01:28:21,389
We see here a mystical scenery.

1009
01:28:21,413 --> 01:28:23,413
So the comet nucleus split?

1010
01:28:23,437 --> 01:28:25,337
What is the impact of tidal waves ...

1011
01:28:25,361 --> 01:28:30,361
Comets are not within the Roche limit so the point itself certainly ...

1012
01:28:30,385 --> 01:28:33,385
In the past, Comet Shoemaker = Levy 9 smashed and crashed into Jupiter in 1994.

1013
01:28:33,409 --> 01:28:37,309
At least 21 fractions.

1014
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:39,333
I'm going to see it!

1015
01:28:39,357 --> 01:28:43,357
It is likely to melt before reaching the ground

1016
01:28:43,381 --> 01:28:47,381
and the possibility of a small residential area meteor crashing ...

1017
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:49,305
To predict the areas ...

1018
01:28:49,329 --> 01:28:52,329
Being a witness to extraordinary events space, and ...

1019
01:28:52,353 --> 01:28:55,353
When we witnessed this firsthand

1020
01:28:55,377 --> 01:29:00,377
is very fortunate for us that live in the present.

1021
01:29:03,301 --> 01:29:05,301
Hey, who are you?

1022
01:29:10,325 --> 01:29:12,325
Who? Who?

1023
01:29:12,349 --> 01:29:14,349
Who is that?

1024
01:29:14,373 --> 01:29:18,373
Were a man who loves me, not to be forgotten, I do not want to forget!

1025
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:24,397
Who? Who? Who are you?

1026
01:29:25,321 --> 01:29:27,321
What is your name?

1027
01:29:34,345 --> 01:29:36,345
Kometnya already broken!

1028
01:29:54,369 --> 01:29:59,369
So we do not forget when we wake up, let's write our names respectively.

1029
01:30:08,393 --> 01:30:11,393
"I love you"

1030
01:30:11,417 --> 01:30:16,317
Even the way you love, already smelled of scent

1031
01:30:17,341 --> 01:30:24,341
Even the way you walk, it sounded like laughter

1032
01:30:25,365 --> 01:30:27,165
The day before you disappear from this world

1033
01:30:27,189 --> 01:30:31,389
I can not remember your name with this ...

1034
01:30:33,313 --> 01:30:40,313
Better so my job than my right

1035
01:30:40,337 --> 01:30:44,337
To burn a whole into my eyes

1036
01:30:44,361 --> 01:30:46,361
Father!

1037
01:30:48,385 --> 01:30:50,385
Mitsuha! / Mitsuha!

1038
01:30:50,409 --> 01:30:52,409
Do you again ...

1039
01:30:55,333 --> 01:30:58,333
It was almost like a scene from a dream.

1040
01:30:58,357 --> 01:31:03,357
Less is more like a beautiful view.

1041
01:31:04,381 --> 01:31:12,381
Let us fall in love on the spot

1042
01:31:12,405 --> 01:31:19,305
where words like destiny and the future of reach

1043
01:31:19,329 --> 01:31:27,329
Taking a hand movement as they glance view us

1044
01:31:27,353 --> 01:31:35,353
A kind of world would we live, the lives we live,

1045
01:31:35,377 --> 01:31:41,377
all about life

1046
01:32:35,301 --> 01:32:41,301
What am I doing here?

1047
01:33:13,325 --> 01:33:16,325
I always find something.

1048
01:33:17,349 --> 01:33:21,349

1049
01:33:23,373 --> 01:33:25,373
I apply for a job because ...

1052

So I helped build the scenery was left touching memories ...

How many interviews did you do?

1054
01:33:43,393 --> 01:33:44,793
I did not set the path.

I, too, do not really remember the first time events.

1074
01:34:56,327 --> 01:35:00,327
Maybe we clashed, two others returned to Tokyo without me.

1075
01:35:01,351 --> 01:35:04,351
I spent the night alone on a mountain.

1156
01:43:35,838 --> 01:43:40,838
Especially when you're near me

1157
01:43:40,862 --> 01:43:45,862
A little longer, a little longer,

1158
01:43:46,886 --> 01:43:50,886
Will you...

1159
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:57,810
A little longer, a little longer,

1160
01:43:57,834 --> 01:44:01,834
Let's stay together

1161
01:44:06,858 --> 01:44:11,858
We are aviator-time, I know who you are

1162
01:44:11,882 --> 01:44:19,882
Long before I learned my name

1163
01:44:24,806 --> 01:44:29,806
There must be some sense in the world without you

1164
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:35,830
But without you the world as of August without a summer holiday

1165
01:44:35,854 --> 01:44:41,854
like Santa Claus without a smile

1166
01:44:41,878 --> 01:44:46,878
How sad the world as it is

1167
01:45:15,802 --> 01:45:20,802
We are aviator-time, we are climbers time

1168
01:45:20,826 --> 01:45:26,826
Do not want to get lost in this game of hide-and-seek

1169
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:31,850
It's not okay, yeah this was a small

1170
01:45:31,874 --> 01:45:33,874
I'm on the way

1171
01:45:35,898 --> 01:45:40,898
We are aviator-time, we are climbers time

1172
01:45:40,922 --> 01:45:47,822
Do not want to get lost in this game of hide-and-seek

1173
01:45:47,846 --> 01:45:52,846
You're crying loudly, hoping I could stop you

1174
01:45:52,870 --> 01:45:59,870
But when I saw the tears I know I rejected

1175
01:45:59,894 --> 01:46:03,894
I wept when I'm happy I laugh when sad

1176
01:46:03,918 --> 01:46:08,818
Because my heart is overtaken

1177
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:39,800
