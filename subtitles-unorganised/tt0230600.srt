This story started
many thousands of years ago...

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,357
but it was all over
in just seven days.

00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,277
All that long, long time ago...

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,356
none of the things
we can see now--

00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,358
the sun, the moon,
the stars, the earh...

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,029
the animals and plants--
not a single one existed.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,957
only God existed...

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,514
and so only He
could have created them.

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,152
And He did.

MRS. MILLS: Simpson.
what a character he was.

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,710
I wonder
whatever became of him?

he's dead like all the rest.

we've come about the--

Oh, yes, of course.

Come in.

28
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,676
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

29
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,634
You are...?

30
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,193
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.

31
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,390
And this is Edmund Tuttle.

32
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,032
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

33
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,752
You must be the gardener.

34
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,030
That's right. The gardener.

35
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,914
And this young lady
is called Lydia.

36
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,315
Have you had
much experience in service?

37
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,432
Oh, don't let that angel face
fool you, ma'am.

38
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,471
She's older than she looks.

39
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,317
Can you iron?

40
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,550
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,673
She can't talk, ma'am.

42
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,312
The poor little mite's a mute.

43
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,793
Oh.

44
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,319
Oh, but she's
a good little worker.

45
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,509
I can promise you that.

46
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,994
All right.

47
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,474
All right. The other girl
I had spoke too much, anyway.

48
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,114
Follow me.
Mrs. Mills, you and the girl...

49
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,799
will sleep in the attic room
at the top of the stairs.

50
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,071
-And you, Mr...
-Tuttle, ma'am.

51
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,477
You could sleep in the shed
around the back.

52
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,751
As you can see, the housework
has been rather neglected...

53
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,109
since the servants disappeared
almost a week ago.

54
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,196
You mean they just vanished?

55
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,913
GRACE: Into thin air.

56
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,110
No notice, nothing. They didn't
even collect their wages.

57
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,913
They... they just left us.

58
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,110
MRS. MILLS:
What a strange thing to do.

59
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,071
GRACE: You'll soon find out
there are times...

60
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,476
when this house is not
exactly an ideal home.

61
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,158
Hence my advertisement
in the newspaper...

62
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,510
requesting honest,
hard-working people.

63
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,199
There's nobody more honest
or hard-working than us.

64
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,514
Isn't that right, Mr Tuttle?

65
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,630
Oh, aye, we're very honest.

66
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,672
And, um, very hard-working.

67
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,715
The kitchen.

68
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,557
I have breakfast at 8:00...

69
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,556
the children at 9:00.

70
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,672
Lunch will be served at 1:00
and dinner at 7:30.

71
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,950
MRS. MILLS:
And the master, ma'am?

72
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,829
The master went off to war...

73
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,677
a year and a half ago.

74
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,508
I've had no news
since the war ended.

75
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,959
Which of you does the cooking?

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,275
MRS. MILLS:
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

77
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,311
Which of you does the cooking?

78
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,157
You'll notice what I'm doing.

79
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,590
In this house,
no door must be opened...

80
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,676
without the previous one
being closed first.

81
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,280
It is vital
that you remember this.

82
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,276
It's not as easy
as it may seem.

83
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,278
There are 15 different keys
for all of the 50 doors...

84
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,596
depending on which area of
the house you're in at the time.

85
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,108
Mrs. Mills,
from tomorrow onwards...

86
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,515
I will be leaving
a set of keys in your charge.

87
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,959
Yes, ma'am.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,877
The music room.

89
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,150
That old piano was already here
when we moved in.

90
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,159
Please do not let
the children thump away on it.

91
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,838
It sets off my migraine.

92
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,351
Silence is something that we
prize very highly in this house.

93
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,960
That is why you will not find
a telephone, a radio...

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,116
or anything else
that makes a racket.

95
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,310
Oh, we don't have
electricity, either.

96
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,590
During the war, the Germans
kept cutting it off...

97
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,108
so we learned to live
without it. Let's continue.

98
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,674
Ma'am, there's no need
to show us the whole house.

99
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,869
GRACE: Yes!

100
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,878
Yes, there is.

Most of the time,
you can hardly see your way.

It's often difficult
to make out...

103
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,392
if there is a table, a chair,
a door, a sideboard...

104
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,319
or one of my children
playing hide and seek.

105
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,318
What do you mean, ma'am?

106
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,272
Perhaps I should introduce you
to the children.

Mr Tuttle,
you can see to the garden now.

00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,114
You'll find tools in the shed.

00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,752
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,234
You two can start closing
the curtains.

All of them.

I'll wake them.
You wait here.

Whatever you do,
don't open the curtains.

doth close.

How do you do, children?

[Keys jingle]

142

The doctors were never able
to find a cure.

143
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,157
For what?

144
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,430
Their condition.

145
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,792
The children have
a very serious allergy to light.

146
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,070
They are photosensitive
and must never be exposed...

147

to any light
much stronger than this.

otherwise,
in a matter of minutes...

149
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,392
they will break out
in sores and blisters...

and begin to suffocate.

151
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,079
It would eventually be fatal.

152
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,350
MRS. MILLS: Good heavens.

153
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,998
I don't like this toast.

It tastes funny.

I liked it better before.

157

That's because before,
somebody else made it.

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,957
I know, but he's in France.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,118
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.

166
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,550
Are you going to leave us, too?

167
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,876
Of course not!

168
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,638
Why should I leave you?

169
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,636
The others
said they wouldn't...

170
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,591
but they did,
and then it happened.

171
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,517
Be quiet!

172
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,710
What do you mean, Anne?
What happened?

173
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,799
Mummy went... mad.

174
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,513
-Nothing happened.
-Yes, it did.

175
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,437
-No, it didn't!
-Yes, it did!

176
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,550
GRACE: Be quiet.

177
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,232
What's going on?
I want those plates empty...

178
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,475
in less than a minute.
Is that clear?

179
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,790
Mrs. Mills, would you
come outside a moment?

180
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,796
I'd like a word with you.

181
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,913
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,439
The postman usually
comes every Wednesday.

183
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,879
But I just checked
the letter-box...

184
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,115
and this week he hasn't.

185
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,071
I'm afraid
I don't follow, ma'am.

186
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,951
This letter
should have been collected...

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,560
and delivered to
the newspaper five days ago.

188
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,999
It's an advertisement
for servants.

189
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,234
Since it was never published...

190
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,874
would you explain
what you're doing here?

191
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,718
Oh, I understand.

192
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,718
Ma'am, that's what
I was going to say to you...

193
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,193
when you opened the door to us.

194
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,629
The truth is
that we just come by...

195
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,875
on the off chance.

196
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,433
A big house like this...

197
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,948
is always in need of someone
who knows the ropes.

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,798
You've served in a house
like this one before?

199
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,354
This may come as a surprise
to you, ma'am, but...

200
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,029
We, in fact,
used to work here.

201
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,349
Here?

202
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,678
Oh, now,
'twas a few years ago.

203
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,553
If you don't mind
my saying so, ma'am...

204
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,229
they were the best years
of my life.

205
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,477
That's why we come by,
because this house...

206
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,351
means a lot to us.

207
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,233
Perhaps I'd best show you
our references, ma'am.

208
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,953
No, no, no. Don't bother.
There's no need.

209
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,070
So you say
you know the house well?

210
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,475
MRS. MILLS:
Like the back of my hand.

211
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,512
That is assuming the walls
haven't sprouted legs...

212
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,471
and moved in the meantime.

213
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,557
GRACE: The only thing
that moves here is the light.

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,992
[Sighs]
But it changes everything.

215
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,994
It's rather difficult,
to say the least.

216
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,239
One might
almost say... unbearable.

217
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,750
The only way of enduring it
is by keeping a cool head.

218
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,995
Oh, yes, ma'am.

219
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,600
I don't like fantasies.

220
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,915
Strange ideas.
Do you know what I mean?

221
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,918
I think so, ma'am.

222
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,748
My children sometimes
have strange ideas.

223
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,473
But you mustn't pay
any attention to them.

224
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,398
Children will be children.

225
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,715
Yes, of course, ma'am.

226
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,550
All right. You can stay.

227
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,554
Thank you very much, ma'am.

228
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,630
It did happen.

229
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,038
NICHOLAS: "The Roman governor
tried to make them...

230
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,832
"change their minds
afterwards..."

231
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,031
"To make them change
their minds." Full stop.

232
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,991
-"Afterwards..."
-Mm-hmm.

233
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,553
"He ordered them
to be beaten.

234
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,559
"But Justus and Pastor,
far from being afraid...

235
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,034
"rejoiced and showed themselves
willing to die for Christ.

236
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,718
"When he saw this...

237
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,557
"the Roman governor
was filled with rage...

238
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,158
"and ordered their heads
to be cut off."

239

[giggles]

240
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,837
[Snickers]

241
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,838
What do you find so amusing?

242
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,279
Well...

243
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,197
Well, what?

244
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,629
Those children
were really stupid.

245
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,636
Why?

246
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,398
Because they said
they only believed in Jesus...

247
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,000
and then
they got killed for it.

248
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,190
And what would you have done,
deny Christ?

249
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,639
ANNE: Well, yes.

250
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,511
Inside I would have
believed in him...

251
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,279
but I wouldn't have told
the ROMANS that.

252
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,791
Is that what you think, too,
Nicholas?

253
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,715
I see.

254
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,150
So you would have lied
to the point of denying Christ.

255
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,432
You'd have saved your heads
from the ROMANS, that's true.

256
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,118
But what would have
happened afterwards?

257
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,309
When?

258
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,510
In the next life.

259
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,596
The one waiting for us
after we die.

260
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,517
Where would you have gone?

261
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,709
Ahh.

262
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,273
Where, Nicholas?

263
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,799
To the children's limbo.

264
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,717
GRACE: What is
the children's limbo, Anne?

265
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,796
One of the four Hells.

266
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,193
Which are?

267
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,839
[gasps]

ANNE: Me, me, me! Me!

269
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,549
GRACE: No. Let him answer.
which are?

270
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,160
There's the Hell
where the damned go...

271
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,156
then there's Purgatory...

272
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,474
Yes.

273
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,112
And the bosom of Abraham
where the just go...

274
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,832
and limbo where children go.

275
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,199
At the center of the earth.

276
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,152
Where it's very, very hot.

277
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,679
That's where children
go who tell lies...

278
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,711
but they don't just go
there for a few days.

279
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,113
Oh, no.

280
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,709
No, they're damned. Forever.

281
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,070
Think about it.

282
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,636
Try to imagine
the end of eternity.

283
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,910
Close your eyes.

284
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,350
Close your eyes
and try to imagine it.

285
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,799
Forever.

286
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,876
Pain... forever.

287
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,197
I'm getting dizzy. Heh.

288
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,196
Now do you understand...

289
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,198
why Justus and Pastor
told the truth?

290
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,673
[Sighs] All right.

291
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,156
Open your readers
at lesson six.

292
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,428
ANNE: Can't we play?

293
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,152
You most certainly cannot.

294
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,553
First you're going
to read the lesson...

295
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,670
then you're going
to learn it by hear.

296
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,869
All of it?

297
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,114
Any more protests...

298
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,628
and there'll be
no playing at all today.

299
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,070
In fact, I think you can
study in separate rooms.

300
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,759
-CHILDREN: No, no, no!
-GRACE: Yes, yes, yes!

if we're separated!

302
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,472
GRACE: Scared? As if you weren't
used to this house by now.

303
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,397
NICHOLAS:
What if we see a ghost?

304
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,352
Has your sister been telling you
one of her stories?

305
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,072
I haven't told him anything!

306
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,519
If you see a ghost
you say "Hello"...

307
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,959
and continue on studying.

308
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,070
-Come to the music room.
-Why me?

309
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,997
Because I say so!
Now come on.

310
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,871
Take your book.

311
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,478
Nicholas, I want to see
that lesson learned...

312
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,748
in less than an hour.

-Mummy...
- What?

Give me a kiss.

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,359
ANNE: "give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss."

316
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,356
Anne, wait for me outside.

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,995
You know I can't.

318

Over there.

close all the curtains.

and your fear will go away.

- It won't.
- Yes, it will. Honestly.

when you do that...

I'd tell you.

No. It was that boy.

The boy that was here
a moment ago.

386

I told him to let me study...

to leave the house.

GRACE: Oh, did he, now?
And why was he crying?

391
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,312
Because he doesn't
like this house...

- Yes.

00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,397
Victor told me she's a witch.

647
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,793
What does she ask you?

648
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,717
Things.

649
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,278
Her breath smells.

650
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,110
We have to open
all the curtains.

651
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,310
I don't want any dark corners
where someone could hide.

652
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,634
Yes, ma'am.

653
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,069
You both search the right side,
and I'll take the left.

654
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,917
Then we'll search upstairs.

NICHOLAS:
Perhaps they're ghosts...

Who lived
in this house before.

658
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,309
Don't be stupid.
I've already told you.

659
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,873
Ghosts go about
in white sheets...

660
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,514
and carry chains
and go "OOO. "

661
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,788
MRS. MILLS: Now, Anne.

662
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,274
Why do you make up
such stories?

663
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,311
ANNE: I don't.
I read them in books.

664
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,191
Well, you shouldn't
believe everything...

665
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,389
that you read in books.

666
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,919
That's what our mother says.

667
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,350
She says all this stuff
about ghosts is rubbish...

668
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,277
and then she expects us...

669
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,390
to believe everything
written in the Bible.

670
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,873
And don't you believe it?

671
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,069
I believe some things.

672
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,350
But, for example,
I don't believe...

673
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,914
that God made the world
in seven days.

674
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,552
And I don't believe
that Noah...

675
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,716
got all those animals
into one boat...

676
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,228
or the Holy Spirit is a dove.

677
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,475
No, I don't
believe that, either.

678
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,192
ANNE:
Doves are anything but holy.

679
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,753
They poo on our windows.

680

[Chuckles]

681
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,789
Have you mentioned
any of this to your mother?

682
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,358
Oh.

[Knocking]
MRS. MILLS: Ma'am.

684
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,232
Yes?

685
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,475
They've searched
everywhere, ma'am.

686
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,033
There's no one.

687
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,752
I see.

688
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,393
Mrs. Mills.

689
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,953
Yes, ma'am?

690
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,753
Do you have any idea
what this might be?

691
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,477
'Tis a photograph album, ma'am.

692
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,953
No, but look.
They're all asleep.

693
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,991
Look.

694
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,600
They're not asleep, ma'am.
They're dead.

695
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,949
'Tis a book of the dead.

696
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,831
In the last century,
I believe...

697
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,711
they used to take
photographs of the dead...

698
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,591
in the hopes
that their souls...

699
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,313
would go on living
through the portraits.

700
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,195
There are even
group portraits.

701
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,152
[gasps] And children!

702
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,839
Oh, it's macabre!

703
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,073
How could these people
be so superstitious?

704
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,315
Grief over the death
of a loved one...

705
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,399
can lead people to do
the strangest things.

706
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,478
GRACE: get rid of it.
I don't want it in the house.

707
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,317
MRS. MILLS: Yes, ma'am.

708
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,996
Mrs. Mills, it's cold.

709
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,156
Why don't you come
and sit by the fire?

710
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,237
Thank you very much, ma'am.

711
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,989
So... tell me about
when you worked here before.

712
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,156
Did you have
to look after children then?

713
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,432
No, I was in charge of
organizing the housework.

714
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,040
Hmm.
were there many servants?

715
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,834
Oh, about fifteen.

716
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,074
Though in the end...

717
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,270
there were just
the three of us left.

718
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,594
Why?

719
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,790
My employers moved to London.

720
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,628
They came here
less and less...

721
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,796
it being
so out of the way like.

722
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,038
So gradually the house
just became empty.

723
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,676
Everybody ends up leaving
this damned island.

724
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,871
My family left
in the summer of 1940....

725
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,196
just before the invasion.

726
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,435
That was the last
I've heard of them.

727
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,838
Ohh.

728
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,440
I don't blame them.

729
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,870
Actually, we left, too.

730
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,592
Although, you know...

731
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,631
sometimes when
you leave a place...

732
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,037
it's like it's there
with you all the time.

733
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,629
I always felt like I
never left this house.

734
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,830
Why did you leave?

735
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,075
Oh,'twas on account
of the tuberculosis.

736
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,237
The whole area was evacuated.

737
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,589
Ohh.

738
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,835
Was that when Lydia went dumb?

739
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,678
Yes, I think so...

740
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,429
though my memory's
a bit rusty these days, ma'am.

741
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,072
What happened to her?

742
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,078
It was suddenly one day.

743
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,954
She just... stopped talking.

744
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,833
There must've been a reason.

745
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,269
People don't just stop talking.

746
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,673
These things
are always the result...

747
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,792
of some sort of trauma.

748
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,831
Something
must've happened to her.

749
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,558
Did your employers
treat you well?

750
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,477
Oh, they were always
very kind to us.

751
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,432
They treated us
just like family.

752
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,871
You know, ma'am,
I think I will go to bed.

I'll never be able
to get up in the morning.

Daddy went
because he's very brave...

he wasn't prepared...

I've always believed

with the world of the living.

But it's impossible.

The Lord would never allow
such an aberration.

The living and the dead...

There are going to be
some big surprises.

as if nothing had happened.

What about her daughter?

Oh, she's not so stubborn.

983
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,832
The children will be
easier to convince.

No, it's the mother who's going
to cause us problems.

00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,554
Do you think her husband
suspects anything?

986
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,151
No. I don't think
he even knows where he is.

ohh, look what
a pretty daughter I've got.

-You can take it off now.
-No.

This dress has to be spotless
for your First Communion.

I promise I won't dirty it.

Just let me wear it
for a little longer.

I'll be back shortly.

01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:43,196
Then I heard your laughter
in the bedroom.

1467
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:46,118
Ahh.

1468
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:47,513
You were playing
with the pillows...

1469
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,869
as if nothing had happened.

1470
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:58,272
And I thought
the Lord in His great mercy...

1471
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:03,997
was giving me another chance...

1472
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:08,352
telling me, "Don't give up."

1473
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,952
"Be strong."

1474
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,318
"Be a good mother."

1475
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:19,959
"For them."

1476
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:28,749
But now...

1477
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,313
now...

1478
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,511
what does all this mean?

1479
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,233
Where are we?

1480
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,548
MRS. MILLS: Young Lydia
said the very same thing...

1481
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:49,070
when she realized
the three of us were dead.

1482
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,312
And that was the last time
she ever spoke.

1483
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,113
But I couldn't tell you
that before now.

1484
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:05,716
Shall I make us
a nice cup of tea, ma'am?

1485
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,471
The intruders are leaving...

1486
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,750
but others will come.

1487
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:15,756
Now, sometimes we'll sense them.

1488
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:19,236
Other times, we won't.

1489
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:22,477
But that's the way
it's always been.

1490
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,628
Ma'am.

1491
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,320
NICHOLAS: Mummy...

1492
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,590
Daddy died in the war,
didn't he?

1493
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,073
GRACE: Yes.

1494
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,792
Will we ever see him again?

1495
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:40,673
I don't know.

1496
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:45,316
If we're dead, where's limbo?

1497
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,998
I don't know
if there even is a limbo.

1498
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,833
I'm no wiser than you are.

1499
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:02,913
But I do know that I love you.

1500
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,633
I've always loved you.

1501
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:11,198
And this house is ours.

1502
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:15,797
You say it with me.

1503
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,034
This house is ours.

1504
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:18,559
NICHOLAS:
This house is ours.

1505
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,670
This house is ours.

1506
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:23,598
[All repeating]

1507
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,870
Mummy, look.
It doesn't hurt any more.

1508
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:57,113
No one can make us
leave this house.

1509
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:23,712
Come along, Victor.

1510
