No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

- What kind of shapes can you make?

Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1105
01:37:59,557 --> 01:38:02,393
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

1106
01:38:02,393 --> 01:38:06,022
- Gotham's entire water supply is laced.
- Why haven't we felt the effects?

1107
01:38:06,022 --> 01:38:08,482
Must be a compound that
has to be absorbed through the lungs.

How do you feel?

1110
01:38:23,204 --> 01:38:24,664
Where are we?

1111
01:38:25,206 --> 01:38:29,001
- Why did you bring me here?
- lf I hadn't, your mind would be lost.

1112
01:38:29,001 --> 01:38:31,211
- You were poisoned.
- It was...

1113
01:38:31,211 --> 01:38:34,965
- It was Dr. Crane.
- Rest. Gordon has Crane.

Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

I don't have the luxury of friends.

1116

I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

- What are they?
- The antidote.

One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

Mass production?

Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1122

When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1123
01:39:27,888 --> 01:39:30,975
...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1124
01:39:30,975 --> 01:39:33,644
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

- It's not.
- What would you call that?

- Damn good television.
- It's a miracle no one was killed.

I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

You're getting lost inside

I'm using this monster to help

For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

to anyone, including himself.

It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

I need you to take her home.

Well, we both care for Rachel, but what
you're doing has to be beyond that.

All kinds of funds and brokerages.

It's a bit technical.

- I already have.

How long would it take

1167
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:09,036
Weeks. Why?

1168
01:42:09,036 --> 01:42:12,414
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1169
01:42:13,415 --> 01:42:16,501
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1170
01:42:17,377 --> 01:42:18,837
What?

1171
01:42:18,837 --> 01:42:21,548
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1172
01:42:21,548 --> 01:42:24,550
...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

1173

A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

Misplaced?

1175

too many questions about it.

Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

01:42:47,238 --> 01:42:48,906
I suppose not.

You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1185
01:43:10,259 --> 01:43:11,594
I watched him die.

1186
01:43:11,594 --> 01:43:14,805
DUCARD:
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1187
01:43:17,516 --> 01:43:20,018
Are his methods supernatural?

1188
01:43:24,522 --> 01:43:28,984
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1189
01:43:30,778 --> 01:43:35,324
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1190
01:43:35,324 --> 01:43:37,492
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

There's a thing about being a Wayne...

Amusing.

But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

So Crane was working for you.

His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1220
01:45:26,008 --> 01:45:28,052
He was able to weaponize it.

01:45:28,052 --> 01:45:30,221
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1222
01:45:30,221 --> 01:45:34,933
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

But really, you are gonna release

This is not how man

The League of Shadows has been

...for thousands of years.

1231
01:46:12,468 --> 01:46:16,221
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

Burned London to the ground.

Give me more time.

Time to play.

When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1241

But I believed in you.

1242
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:59,511
I took away your fear,
and I showed you a path.

1243
01:46:59,761 --> 01:47:02,013
You were my greatest student.

1244
01:47:02,347 --> 01:47:05,516
It should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1245
01:47:06,309 --> 01:47:08,894
I'll be standing where I belong.

1246
01:47:09,562 --> 01:47:12,648
Between you
and the people of Gotham.

1247
01:47:14,358 --> 01:47:16,943
No one can save Gotham.

1248
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:24,951
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1249
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:30,873
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

The movement back to harmony

- You attacked Gotham before?
- Of course.

1252

Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1253
01:47:40,048 --> 01:47:43,092
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1254
01:47:43,468 --> 01:47:48,222
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1255
01:47:48,597 --> 01:47:50,808

The company went public a week ago.

1412
02:05:43,541 --> 02:05:45,126
And I bought most of the shares.

1413
02:05:45,543 --> 02:05:48,963
Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.

1414
02:05:48,963 --> 02:05:52,341
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1415
02:05:52,591 --> 02:05:55,844
...is that my company's future
is secure.

1416
02:05:56,219 --> 02:05:57,679
Right, Mr. Fox?

1417
02:05:57,679 --> 02:05:59,681
FOX:
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1418
02:06:01,891 --> 02:06:03,434
Didn't you get the memo?

1419
02:06:22,410 --> 02:06:25,580
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
- No. No, Bruce...

1420
02:06:25,580 --> 02:06:27,164
...I'm sorry.

1421
02:06:27,999 --> 02:06:30,709
The day that Chill died, I...

1422
02:06:32,586 --> 02:06:34,171
I said terrible things.

1423
02:06:34,713 --> 02:06:36,465
But true things.

1424
02:06:37,048 --> 02:06:38,883
I was a coward with a gun...

1425
02:06:38,883 --> 02:06:42,845
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1426
02:06:43,930 --> 02:06:46,599
I never stopped thinking about you.

1427
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:49,727
About us.

1428
02:06:50,311 --> 02:06:52,271
And when I heard you were back, I...

1429
02:06:53,147 --> 02:06:55,315
I started to hope.

1430
02:07:19,421 --> 02:07:22,090
But then I found out about your mask.

1431
02:07:23,299 --> 02:07:26,093
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1432
02:07:26,761 --> 02:07:28,429
No. This...

1433
02:07:29,597 --> 02:07:31,265
...is your mask.

1434
02:07:33,225 --> 02:07:36,812
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1435
02:07:37,646 --> 02:07:39,648
The man I loved...

1436
02:07:40,315 --> 02:07:41,816
...the man who vanished...

1437
02:07:43,026 --> 02:07:45,153
...he never came back at all.

1438
02:07:49,615 --> 02:07:52,326
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1439
02:07:54,453 --> 02:07:58,206
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1440
02:07:59,249 --> 02:08:01,209
...I'll see him again.

1441
02:08:12,261 --> 02:08:15,138
- Proved me wrong, you know.
- About what?

1442
02:08:17,974 --> 02:08:20,477
Your father would be very proud of you.

1443
02:08:20,685 --> 02:08:22,270
Just like me.

1444
02:08:49,295 --> 02:08:51,171
RACHEL:
What will you do?

1445
02:08:52,548 --> 02:08:54,132
Rebuild it.

1446
02:08:54,967 --> 02:08:57,385
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1447
02:09:04,183 --> 02:09:05,476
Just the way it was, sir?

1448
02:09:07,561 --> 02:09:08,771
Yeah, why?

1449
02:09:08,771 --> 02:09:11,815
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1450
02:09:11,815 --> 02:09:14,443
...improving the foundations.

1451
02:09:14,443 --> 02:09:17,571
- In the southeast corner?
- Precisely, sir.

1452
02:09:33,252 --> 02:09:36,129
- Nice.
- I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1453
02:09:37,088 --> 02:09:39,758
BATMAN: Well, sergeant?
- It's "lieutenant" now.

1454
02:09:40,133 --> 02:09:41,593
You really started something.

1455
02:09:41,593 --> 02:09:43,761
Bent cops running scared.

1456
02:09:43,761 --> 02:09:45,388
Hope on the streets.

1457
02:09:45,596 --> 02:09:49,266
- But?
- The Narrows is lost.

1458
02:09:49,725 --> 02:09:53,604
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1459
02:09:54,313 --> 02:09:55,897
We will.

1460
02:09:56,106 --> 02:09:57,774
We can bring Gotham back.

1461
02:09:57,774 --> 02:10:00,485
- What about escalation?
- Escalation?

1462
02:10:00,485 --> 02:10:04,947
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1463
02:10:04,947 --> 02:10:09,451
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1464
02:10:09,451 --> 02:10:12,913
- And?
- And you're wearing a mask...

1465
02:10:13,330 --> 02:10:15,207
...and jumping off rooftops.

1466
02:10:16,666 --> 02:10:18,668
Now, take this guy.

1467
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:21,004
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1468
02:10:21,004 --> 02:10:24,382
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1469
02:10:24,632 --> 02:10:26,592
Leaves a calling card.

1470
02:10:32,514 --> 02:10:34,349
I'll look into it.

1471
02:10:37,769 --> 02:10:39,270
I never said thank you.

1472
02:10:44,358 --> 02:10:46,444
And you'll never have to.

1473
02:17:53,445 --> 02:19:55,445
