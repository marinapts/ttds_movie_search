1
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:36,244
Next subject, Kowalski, Leon.

2
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,488
Engineer, waste disposal.

3
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:41,842
Five section, new employee, six days.

4
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,280
Come in.

5
00:04:57,891 --> 00:04:58,926
Sit down.

6
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,199
Care if I talk?

7
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,402
I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.

8
00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:09,243
Just please don't move.

9
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:11,599
Oh, I'm sorry.

10
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:18,204
I already had an IQ test this year.
I don't think I've ever had one of these.

11
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,805
Reaction time is a factor in this,
so please, pay attention.

12
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:22,961
Now answer as quickly as you can.

13
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:24,567
Sure.

14
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,609
1187 Hunterwasser.

15
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:28,766
That's the hotel.

16
00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:29,647
What?

17
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:30,925
Where I live.

18
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:31,927
Nice place?

19
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:34,730
Yeah, sure, I guess.
Is that part of the test?

20
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:37,126
No. Just warming up. That's all.

21
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:39,763
It's not fancy or anything.

22
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:44,130
You're in a desert walking along
in the sand when all of a sud...

23
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,121
Is this the test, now?

24
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,566
Yes. You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand...

25
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:48,845
...when all of a sudden you look down...

26
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:49,966
What one?

27
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,406
What desert?

28
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:54,409
Doesn't make any difference what desert.
It's completely hypothetical.

29
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:56,447
- But how come I'd be there?
- Maybe you're fed up, maybe you...

30
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:58,806
...want to be by yourself. Who knows?

31
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:01,528
You look down and you see a tortoise,
Leon.

32
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,648
- It's crawling towards you...
- A tortoise? What's that?

33
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:09,886
- You know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

34
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:11,166
Same thing.

35
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:13,289
I've never seen a turtle.

36
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:17,364
But I understand what you mean.

37
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:20,523
You reach down and you flip the tortoise
over on its back, Leon.

38
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:22,522
Do you make up these questions,
Mr. Holden?

39
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,727
Or do they write them down for you?

40
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:27,571
The tortoise lays on its back,
its belly baking in the hot sun...

41
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,848
...beating its legs, trying to turn itself over,
but it can't.

42
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:33,525
Not without your help.
But you're not helping.

43
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:35,010
What do you mean I'm not helping?

44
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:36,843
I mean, you're not helping.

45
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:38,450
Why is that, Leon?

46
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:48,208
They're just questions, Leon.

47
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:51,764
In answer to your query,
they're written down for me.

48
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:55,287
It's a test designed to provoke
an emotional response.

49
00:06:58,411 --> 00:06:59,810
Shall we continue?

50
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:05,610
Describe, in single words, only the good
things that come into your mind...

51
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,683
...about your mother.

52
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:09,284
- My mother?
- Yeah.

53
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,322
Let me tell you about my mother.

54
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:32,600
A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.

55
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:34,802
The chance to begin again...

56
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:37,729
...in a golden land of opportunity
and adventure.

57
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:16,645
A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.

58
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:19,884
The chance to begin again
in a golden land...

59
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:22,439
...of opportunity and adventure.

60
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:26,411
Let's go to the colonies.

61
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:31,169
This announcement has been brought
to you by the Shimago-Domnguez Corp.

62
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:34,604
Helping America into the new world.

63
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,685
Give me four.

64
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:58,482
No. Four. Two, two, four.

65
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,644
And noodles!

66
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:28,326
He say you're under arrest, Mr. Deckard.

67
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:30,769
Got the wrong guy, pal.

68
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,523
He say you "Blade Runner."

69
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:38,964
Tell him I'm eating!

70
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,643
Captain Bryant...

71
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:45,044
Bryant?

72
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:10,804
Now on glide path.
Mark course, over the landing threshold.

73
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:31,290
- Hiya, Deck.
- Bryant.

74
00:11:32,211 --> 00:11:35,601
You wouldn't have come
if I just asked you to. Sit down, pal.

75
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,368
Come on, don't be an asshole, Deckard.

76
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:41,011
I've got four skin-jobs walking the streets.

77
00:11:56,771 --> 00:12:00,081
They jumped the shuttle Off-world.
Killed the crew and passengers.

78
00:12:00,171 --> 00:12:02,731
We found the shuttle drifting
off the coast two weeks ago...

79
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:04,688
...so we know they're around.

80
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:06,966
Embarrassing.

81
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:10,805
No. Not embarrassing because no one's
ever going to find out they're down here.

82
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:13,041
'Cause you're gonna spot them
and you're gonna air 'em out.

83
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:14,849
I don't work here anymore.

84
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,250
Give it to Holden.

85
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:18,161
He's good.

86
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,161
I did.

87
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:22,369
He can breathe okay,
as long as nobody unplugs him.

88
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:25,280
He's not good enough.
Not as good as you.

89
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:27,364
I need you, Deck.

90
00:12:27,531 --> 00:12:29,761
This is a bad one. The worst yet.

91
00:12:30,531 --> 00:12:33,204
I need the old Blade Runner.
I need your magic.

92
00:12:35,611 --> 00:12:38,079
I was quit when I come in here, Bryant.

93
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:40,923
I'm twice as quit now.

94
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:43,889
Stop right where you are!
You know the score, pal.

95
00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:46,721
You're not cop, you're little people.

96
00:12:58,251 --> 00:12:59,604
No choice?

97
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:02,324
No choice, pal.

98
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:05,843
I already had an IQ test this year.
I don't think...

99
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:08,244
...I've ever had one of these.

100
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:10,799
Reaction time is a factor in this,
so please, pay attention.

101
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,086
- Now answer as quickly as you can.
- Yeah, sure.

102
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:15,446
1187 Hunterwasser.

103
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:18,449
- That's the hotel.
- What?

104
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,120
Where I live.

105
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:21,087
Nice place?

106
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:22,570
Yeah, sure, I guess.

107
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:25,165
There was an escape from
the Off-world colonies two weeks ago.

108
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:27,719
Six Replicants: three male, three female.

109
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:30,524
They slaughtered 23 people
and jumped a shuttle.

110
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:32,602
An aerial patrol spotted
the ship off the coast.

111
00:13:32,691 --> 00:13:34,409
No crew, no sight of them.

112
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:37,964
Three nights ago they tried to break
into the Tyrell Corporation.

113
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,246
One of them got fried running
through an electrical field.

114
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:41,810
We lost the others.

115
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,681
On the possibility they might try
to infiltrate as employees...

116
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:50,605
...I had Holden go over and run
Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers.

117
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,842
Looks like he got himself one.

118
00:13:53,011 --> 00:13:56,242
So you look down and you see a tortoise;
it's crawling towards you.

119
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:58,083
A tortoise? What's that?

120
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:00,802
- Know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

121
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:02,119
Same thing.

122
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:04,368
I've never seen a turtle.

123
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:09,042
I don't get it. Why do they risk
coming back to earth for?

124
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:12,651
What do they want
out of the Tyrell Corporation?

125
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:13,686
Now you tell me, pal.

126
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:15,602
That's what you're here for.

127
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,680
- What's this?
- Nexus 6.

128
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:29,886
Roy Batty.

129
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:31,808
Incept date, 2016.

130
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:34,600
Combat model. Optimum self-sufficiency.

131
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:37,330
Probably the leader.

132
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,650
This is Zhora.

133
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:45,524
She's trained for an Off-world
kick murder squad.

134
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:47,882
Talk about Beauty and the Beast.

135
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:49,239
She's both.

136
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:56,961
The fourth skin-job is Pris.
A basic pleasure model.

137
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:00,482
A standard item for military
clubs in the outer colonies.

138
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:06,005
They were designed to copy humans
in every way, except their emotions.

139
00:15:06,091 --> 00:15:08,924
But the designers reckoned
that after a few years...

140
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:11,844
...they might develop their own
emotional responses.

141
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:14,001
Oh, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

142
00:15:14,491 --> 00:15:16,288
So they built in a fail-safe device.

143
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:17,565
Which is what?

144
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:19,290
Four-year life span.

145
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:28,643
Now there's a Nexus 6
over at the Tyrell Corporation.

146
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:31,009
I want you to go put the machine on it.

147
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:33,047
And if the machine doesn't work?

148
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:03,090
Do you like our owl?

149
00:17:05,811 --> 00:17:07,130
It's artificial?

150
00:17:08,371 --> 00:17:09,724
Of course, it is.

151
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:13,290
Must be expensive.

152
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,087
Very. I'm Rachael.

153
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:19,520
Deckard.

154
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:25,008
It seems you feel our work
is not a benefit to the public.

155
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:30,524
Replicants are like any other machine.
They're either a benefit or a hazard.

156
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:33,079
If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.

157
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:35,761
May I ask you a personal question?

158
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:38,687
Sure.

159
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,680
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?

160
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:48,647
No.

161
00:17:49,131 --> 00:17:50,769
But in your position, that is a risk.

162
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:52,762
Is this to be an empathy test?

163
00:17:54,171 --> 00:17:57,163
Capillary dilation of the so-called
blush response?

164
00:17:57,771 --> 00:18:00,365
Fluctuation of the pupil.

165
00:18:01,691 --> 00:18:04,159
Involuntary dilation of the iris.

166
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:08,247
We call it Voight-Kampff for short.

167
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:11,602
Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

168
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:13,359
Demonstrate it.

169
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:16,450
I want to see it work.

170
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:17,441
Where's the subject?

171
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,044
I want to see it work on a person.

172
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,691
I want to see a negative,
before I provide you with a positive.

173
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:23,409
What's that gonna prove?

174
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:25,839
Indulge me.

175
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:27,566
On you?

176
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:29,406
Try her.

177
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:36,329
It's too bright in here.

178
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:14,369
Do you mind if I smoke?

179
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:16,763
It won't affect the test.

180
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:21,363
All right.
I'm gonna ask you a series of questions.

181
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:24,210
Just relax and answer them
as simply as you can.

182
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:35,403
It's your birthday.
Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.

183
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:37,044
I wouldn't accept it.

184
00:19:37,571 --> 00:19:40,563
I'd report the person
who gave it to me to the police.

185
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,604
You've got a little boy.
He shows you his butterfly collection...

186
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:47,647
...plus the killing jar.

187
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:53,003
I'd take him to the doctor.

188
00:19:58,331 --> 00:19:59,605
You're watching television.

189
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:02,364
Suddenly you realize there's a wasp
crawling on your arm.

190
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,600
I'd kill it.

191
00:20:07,491 --> 00:20:09,561
You're reading a magazine.
You come across a full-page...

192
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:11,084
...nude photo of a girl.

193
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:14,243
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

194
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:16,401
Just answer the questions, please.

195
00:20:20,891 --> 00:20:25,089
You show it to your husband. He likes it
so much he hangs it in your bedroom.

196
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:28,244
I wouldn't let him.

197
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:30,806
Why not?

198
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:32,803
I should be enough for him.

199
00:20:36,891 --> 00:20:38,324
One more question.

200
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:42,403
You're watching a stage play,
a banquet is in progress.

201
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,528
The guests are enjoying
an appetizer of raw oysters.

202
00:20:47,131 --> 00:20:49,201
The entre consists of boiled dog.

203
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:08,445
Would you step out for a few moments,
Rachael?

204
00:21:17,251 --> 00:21:18,320
Thank you.

205
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:22,327
She's a Replicant, isn't she?

206
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,924
I'm impressed.

207
00:21:24,211 --> 00:21:26,930
How many questions
does it usually take to spot one?

208
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:28,126
I don't get it, Tyrell.

209
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:29,610
How many questions?

210
00:21:29,691 --> 00:21:31,761
Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.

211
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:34,883
It took more than a hundred for Rachael,
didn't it?

212
00:21:34,971 --> 00:21:36,324
She doesn't know?

213
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:38,888
She's beginning to suspect, I think.

214
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:41,405
Suspect! How can it not know what it is?

215
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:44,091
Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell.

216
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:46,481
"More human than human" is our motto.

217
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:49,080
Rachael is an experiment. Nothing more.

218
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:54,843
We began to recognize in them
a strange obsession.

219
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:58,248
After all, they are emotionally
inexperienced with only a few years...

220
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:01,289
...in which to store up the experiences
which you and I take for granted.

221
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:04,920
If we gift them with a past,
we create a cushion...

222
00:22:05,851 --> 00:22:09,730
...or a pillow for their emotions and
consequently we can control them better.

223
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:13,008
Memories. You're talking about memories!

224
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:26,171
Reaction time is a factor in this,
so please, pay attention.

225
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:27,969
- Now answer as quickly as you can.
- Sure.

226
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:29,882
1187 Hunterwasser.

227
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:31,366
- That's the hotel.
- What?

228
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:32,930
- Where I live.
- Nice place?

229
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:34,922
Yeah sure, I guess. Is that part of the test?

230
00:22:35,011 --> 00:22:35,807
No.

231
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:51,684
Time?

232
00:24:52,331 --> 00:24:53,286
Enough.

233
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:13,006
Did you get your precious photos?

234
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:18,010
Someone was there.

235
00:25:19,171 --> 00:25:20,206
Men?

236
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:26,167
Policemen?

237
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:58,365
"Fiery the angels fell...

238
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:02,210
"...deep thunder roared
around their shores...

239
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:05,205
"...burning with the fires of Orc."

240
00:27:08,691 --> 00:27:10,090
You not come here!

241
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:11,525
Illegal!

242
00:27:17,411 --> 00:27:20,369
Cold! Those are my eyes! Freezing!

243
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,970
Questions.

244
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:59,246
Morphology? Longevity? Incept dates?

245
00:28:00,051 --> 00:28:01,245
Don't know.

246
00:28:01,411 --> 00:28:03,208
I don't know such stuff.

247
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:09,444
I just do eyes. Just eyes.
Just genetic design.

248
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:11,804
Just eyes.

249
00:28:13,971 --> 00:28:15,290
You Nexus?

250
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:18,528
I designed your eyes.

251
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:24,606
If only you could see
what I've seen with your eyes.

252
00:28:26,091 --> 00:28:27,001
Now...

253
00:28:28,131 --> 00:28:29,325
...questions.

254
00:28:30,051 --> 00:28:31,723
I don't know answers.

255
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:33,200
Who does?

256
00:28:37,371 --> 00:28:40,010
Tyrell! He knows everything.

257
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:43,369
Tyrell Corporation?

258
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:45,207
He big boss.

259
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:48,727
Big genius. He design your mind.
Your brain.

260
00:28:51,571 --> 00:28:52,526
Smart.

261
00:28:54,611 --> 00:28:56,169
Very cold.

262
00:28:58,851 --> 00:29:01,319
Not an easy man to see...

263
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:04,205
Very cold.

264
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,805
...I guess?

265
00:29:14,091 --> 00:29:15,160
Sebastian.

266
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:17,680
He take you there. He take you there.

267
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:20,410
Sebastian who?

268
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:25,726
J.F. Sebast...

269
00:29:30,851 --> 00:29:32,204
Now...

270
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:37,161
...where would we find this...

271
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:42,043
...J.F. Sebastian?

272
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:45,483
Let's continue, shall we?

273
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,209
Describe, in single words...

274
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:52,125
...only the good things that come into
your mind about your mother.

275
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,644
- My mother?
- Yeah.

276
00:29:54,331 --> 00:29:56,242
I'll tell you about my mother.

277
00:30:17,211 --> 00:30:20,169
Voice print identification.
Your floor number, please.

278
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:23,010
- Deckard, 97.
- 97. Thank you.

279
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,203
I wanted to see you.

280
00:30:51,411 --> 00:30:52,924
So I waited.

281
00:30:53,571 --> 00:30:54,890
Let me help you.

282
00:30:58,251 --> 00:30:59,889
What do I need help for?

283
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:04,366
I don't know why he told you what he did.

284
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:05,600
Talk to him.

285
00:31:05,891 --> 00:31:07,324
He wouldn't see me.

286
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:21,404
You want a drink?

287
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,161
You think I'm a Replicant, don't you?

288
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:40,527
Look.

289
00:31:42,051 --> 00:31:43,643
It's me with my mother.

290
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:46,367
Yeah?

291
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:55,009
Remember when you were six?

292
00:31:55,891 --> 00:31:59,122
You and your brother snuck into an empty
building through a basement window.

293
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:01,008
You were gonna play doctor?

294
00:32:02,451 --> 00:32:05,966
He showed you his, and when it got
to be your turn, you chickened and ran.

295
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:07,245
Remember that?

296
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:13,247
Did you ever tell anybody that?
Your mother? Tyrell? Anybody?

297
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:19,840
You remember the spider that lived
in the bush outside your window?

298
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:21,762
Orange body, green legs?

299
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:24,886
Watched her build a web all summer?

300
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:27,566
Then one day, there's a big egg in it.

301
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:29,244
The egg hatched...

302
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:31,043
- The egg hatched...
- And?

303
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,840
...and a hundred baby spiders came out.

304
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:37,804
And they ate her.

305
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:43,120
Implants.

306
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:45,164
Those aren't your memories!

307
00:32:45,251 --> 00:32:48,129
They're somebody else's.
They're Tyrell's niece's.

308
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,449
Okay. Bad joke.

309
00:33:00,451 --> 00:33:01,884
I made a bad joke.

310
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:03,769
You're not a Replicant.

311
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:05,449
Go home. Okay?

312
00:33:08,771 --> 00:33:10,966
No, really. I'm sorry.

313
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:13,160
Go home.

314
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,565
Want a drink?

315
00:33:29,171 --> 00:33:30,684
I'll get you a drink.

316
00:33:31,931 --> 00:33:33,284
I'll get a glass.

317
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:16,570
You forgot your bag.

318
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,605
I'm lost.

319
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:32,402
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

320
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:37,439
What's your name?

321
00:37:37,531 --> 00:37:38,327
Pris.

322
00:37:38,411 --> 00:37:40,083
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

323
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

324
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:47,849
Oh, where were you going?

325
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:51,040
Home?

326
00:37:52,931 --> 00:37:54,284
I don't have one.

327
00:37:58,011 --> 00:37:59,967
We scared each other pretty good,
didn't we?

328
00:38:00,051 --> 00:38:01,200
We sure did.

329
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:08,450
I'm hungry, J.F.

330
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:11,649
I've got stuff inside.

331
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,844
Do you wanna come in?

332
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,082
I was hoping you'd say that.

333
00:38:49,171 --> 00:38:51,127
Do you live in this building all by yourself?

334
00:38:51,211 --> 00:38:53,805
Yeah,
I live here pretty much alone right now.

335
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:56,921
No housing shortage around here.

336
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:01,367
Plenty of room for everybody.

337
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:12,369
Watch out for the water.

338
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:16,762
You must get lonely here, J.F.

339
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:21,042
Not really. I make friends.

340
00:39:21,931 --> 00:39:24,968
They're toys. My friends are toys.
I make them.

341
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:27,726
It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer.

342
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:29,643
Do you know what that is?

343
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:30,687
No.

344
00:39:33,051 --> 00:39:33,961
Ma'am?

345
00:39:39,051 --> 00:39:40,530
Yoo-hoo, home again!

346
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:50,087
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.
Good evening, J.F.!

347
00:39:50,891 --> 00:39:52,324
Evening, fellas.

348
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:05,806
They're my friends. I made them.

349
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,850
Where are your folks?

350
00:40:08,251 --> 00:40:09,809
I'm sort of an orphan.

351
00:40:10,411 --> 00:40:12,003
What about your friends?

352
00:40:12,091 --> 00:40:14,286
I have some, but I have to find them.

353
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,680
I'll let them know where I am tomorrow.

354
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:22,682
Can I take those things for you?

355
00:40:23,251 --> 00:40:24,650
They're soaked, aren't they?

356
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:05,250
Enhance 224 to 176.

357
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:23,569
Enhance. Stop.

358
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:39,280
Move in.

359
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:41,007
Stop.

360
00:42:42,171 --> 00:42:43,729
Pull out, track right.

361
00:42:44,131 --> 00:42:45,007
Stop.

362
00:42:47,011 --> 00:42:48,569
Center and, pull back.

363
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:52,447
Stop.

364
00:42:54,131 --> 00:42:55,610
Track 45 right.

365
00:42:57,731 --> 00:42:58,607
Stop.

366
00:42:59,091 --> 00:43:00,365
Center and stop.

367
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:08,646
Enhance 34 to 36.

368
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:20,482
Pan right and pull back.

369
00:43:21,971 --> 00:43:22,847
Stop.

370
00:43:28,771 --> 00:43:30,284
Enhance 34 to 46.

371
00:43:41,971 --> 00:43:43,040
Pull back.

372
00:43:43,851 --> 00:43:45,648
Wait a minute. Go right.

373
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:48,047
Stop.

374
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:50,610
Enhance 57-19.

375
00:43:52,971 --> 00:43:54,370
Track 45 left.

376
00:43:56,691 --> 00:43:57,567
Stop.

377
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:01,962
Enhance 15 to 23.

378
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:15,247
Give me a hard copy right there.

379
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:10,841
Fish?

380
00:45:26,171 --> 00:45:28,287
I think it was manufactured.

381
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:29,806
Look.

382
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:36,086
Finest quality. Superior workmanship.

383
00:45:38,651 --> 00:45:40,846
There is the maker's serial number.

384
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:43,326
990-69-47...

385
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:47,249
...X/B71.

386
00:45:48,131 --> 00:45:49,359
Interesting.

387
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:53,409
Not fish. Snake scale.

388
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:55,286
Snake?

389
00:45:55,571 --> 00:45:59,007
Try Abdul Ben Hassan.
He make this snake!

390
00:46:43,371 --> 00:46:44,850
Abdul Hassan.

391
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:49,208
I'm a police officer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

392
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:52,568
Artificial snake license X/B71? That's you?

393
00:46:53,331 --> 00:46:56,050
This is your work? Who did you sell it to?

394
00:46:56,171 --> 00:46:58,890
My work?
Not too many could afford such quality.

395
00:46:59,051 --> 00:47:00,848
- How many?
- Very few.

396
00:47:00,971 --> 00:47:02,689
How few? Look, my friend.

397
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:06,123
Taffey Lewis'.
Down in the Fourth Sector. Chinatown.

398
00:47:20,211 --> 00:47:21,280
Bartender.

399
00:47:25,411 --> 00:47:26,605
Taffey Lewis?

400
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:33,246
Taffey.

401
00:47:34,571 --> 00:47:36,721
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

402
00:47:37,011 --> 00:47:38,000
Blow.

403
00:47:40,251 --> 00:47:42,401
Do you ever buy any snakes
from the Egyptian, Taffey?

404
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:43,890
All the time, pal.

405
00:47:46,891 --> 00:47:48,643
Did you ever see this girl?

406
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:51,289
Never seen her. Buzz off.

407
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:53,242
Your licenses in order, pal?

408
00:47:53,691 --> 00:47:55,522
Hey, Louie. The man is dry.

409
00:47:56,771 --> 00:47:59,080
Give him one on the house, okay? See ya.

410
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:41,121
Hello?

411
00:48:43,731 --> 00:48:46,723
I've had people walk out on me before,
but not when...

412
00:48:47,331 --> 00:48:49,128
...I was being so charming.

413
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:52,403
I'm in a bar, here now,
down in the Fourth Sector.

414
00:48:54,651 --> 00:48:55,845
Taffey Lewis' on the line.

415
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:58,525
Why don't you come down here
and have a drink?

416
00:48:59,171 --> 00:49:01,162
I don't think so, Mr. Deckard.

417
00:49:02,971 --> 00:49:04,643
That's not my kind of place.

418
00:49:04,731 --> 00:49:06,130
Go someplace else?

419
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,127
Ladies and gentlemen...

420
00:49:23,571 --> 00:49:27,803
...Taffey Lewis presents
Miss Salome and the snake.

421
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:32,924
Watch her take the pleasure
from the serpent...

422
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:36,049
...that once corrupted Man!

423
00:50:17,491 --> 00:50:20,130
Excuse me, Miss Salome,
can I talk to you for a minute?

424
00:50:20,211 --> 00:50:23,123
I'm from the American Federation
of Variety Artists.

425
00:50:23,731 --> 00:50:25,005
Oh yeah?

426
00:50:25,371 --> 00:50:28,966
I'm not here to make you join.
No, ma'am. That's not my department.

427
00:50:29,051 --> 00:50:30,120
Actually...

428
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:36,568
...l'm from the Confidential Committee
on Moral Abuses.

429
00:50:38,171 --> 00:50:39,889
Committee of Moral Abuses?

430
00:50:40,611 --> 00:50:42,647
There's been some reports
that the management...

431
00:50:42,731 --> 00:50:44,926
...has been taking liberties
with the artists in this place.

432
00:50:45,011 --> 00:50:46,126
I don't know nothin' about it.

433
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:49,009
Have you felt yourself to be
exploited in any way?

434
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:51,488
How do you mean, "exploited"?

435
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:53,841
Well, like to get this job.

436
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:58,040
I mean did you do,
or were you asked to do anything that's...

437
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:01,487
...lewd or unsavory, or...

438
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:04,489
...otherwise repulsive to your person?

439
00:51:07,971 --> 00:51:09,370
Are you for real?

440
00:51:10,811 --> 00:51:13,723
I'd like to check your dressing room,
if I may.

441
00:51:14,331 --> 00:51:16,401
- For what?
- For holes.

442
00:51:16,931 --> 00:51:17,761
Holes?

443
00:51:17,851 --> 00:51:20,001
You'd be surprised what a guy
would go through...

444
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:22,480
...to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

445
00:51:26,651 --> 00:51:27,766
No, I wouldn't.

446
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,204
Well, little...

447
00:51:30,131 --> 00:51:31,644
...dirty holes...

448
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:34,962
...they drill in the wall
so they can watch a lady undress.

449
00:52:07,171 --> 00:52:08,763
Is this a real snake?

450
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:10,200
Of course it's not real.

451
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:14,603
Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake?

452
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:31,051
So, if somebody tries to exploit me,
who do I go to about it?

453
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:31,802
Me.

454
00:52:31,891 --> 00:52:34,166
You're a dedicated man. Dry me.

455
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:18,041
Move!

456
00:55:18,131 --> 00:55:19,564
Get out of the way!

457
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:02,159
Deckard.

458
00:57:02,571 --> 00:57:04,084
B26354.

459
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:12,845
Move on. Move on.

460
00:57:24,091 --> 00:57:25,206
A minute.

461
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,169
Yeah, what do you want?

462
00:57:29,251 --> 00:57:30,400
Tsin-Tao.

463
00:57:38,131 --> 00:57:39,359
Is this enough?

464
00:57:49,691 --> 00:57:50,680
Bryant.

465
00:58:11,011 --> 00:58:14,401
Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad
as that skin-job you left on the sidewalk.

466
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,719
I'm going home.

467
00:58:16,211 --> 00:58:17,724
You could learn from this guy, Gaff.

468
00:58:17,811 --> 00:58:20,962
He's a goddamn one-man slaughterhouse,
that's what he is.

469
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:23,759
Four more to go. Come on, Gaff, let's go.

470
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:25,201
Three.

471
00:58:27,131 --> 00:58:28,610
There's three to go.

472
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:29,965
There's four.

473
00:58:31,131 --> 00:58:34,248
Now there's that skin-job you V. -K.'d
at the Tyrell Corporation.

474
00:58:34,331 --> 00:58:37,641
Well, Rachael disappeared. Vanished.
She didn't know she was a Replicant.

475
00:58:37,731 --> 00:58:40,529
Something to do with a brain implant,
says Tyrell.

476
00:58:41,091 --> 00:58:42,285
Come on, Gaff.

477
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:44,009
Drink some for me, pal.

478
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:27,761
Leon!

479
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:29,525
How old am I?

480
00:59:33,691 --> 00:59:34,885
I don't know!

481
00:59:37,571 --> 00:59:40,529
My birthday's April 10th, 2017.
How long do I live?

482
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:41,846
Four years.

483
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:50,485
More than you!

484
00:59:55,011 --> 00:59:57,320
It's painful to live in fear, isn't it?

485
01:00:03,251 --> 01:00:06,482
Nothing is worse than having
an itch you can never scratch.

486
01:00:07,091 --> 01:00:08,240
Oh, I agree!

487
01:00:19,011 --> 01:00:20,922
Wake up! Time to die.

488
01:00:54,891 --> 01:00:56,324
Shakes?

489
01:00:58,011 --> 01:00:59,205
Me, too.

490
01:01:03,691 --> 01:01:05,090
I get 'em bad.

491
01:01:10,731 --> 01:01:12,449
It's part of the business.

492
01:01:19,651 --> 01:01:21,289
I'm not in the business.

493
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:35,688
I am the business.

494
01:03:05,331 --> 01:03:06,764
What if I go north?

495
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:11,685
Disappear.

496
01:03:16,811 --> 01:03:18,449
Would you come after me?

497
01:03:19,851 --> 01:03:20,920
Hunt me?

498
01:03:30,171 --> 01:03:31,763
No, I wouldn't.

499
01:03:37,611 --> 01:03:38,805
I owe you one.

500
01:03:53,331 --> 01:03:55,287
But somebody would.

501
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:13,603
You know those files on me?

502
01:04:15,211 --> 01:04:16,803
The incept date?

503
01:04:16,971 --> 01:04:19,690
The longevity? Those things?

504
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:23,210
You saw them?

505
01:04:26,811 --> 01:04:29,484
They're classified.

506
01:04:29,931 --> 01:04:31,649
But you're a policeman.

507
01:04:32,571 --> 01:04:34,129
I didn't look at them.

508
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:41,171
You know,
that Voight-Kampff test of yours...

509
01:04:41,771 --> 01:04:44,160
...did you ever take that test yourself?

510
01:07:21,491 --> 01:07:23,163
I dreamt music.

511
01:07:28,371 --> 01:07:30,441
I didn't know if I could play.

512
01:07:32,371 --> 01:07:34,441
I remember lessons.

513
01:07:35,971 --> 01:07:39,281
I don't know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.

514
01:07:44,211 --> 01:07:45,769
You play beautifully.

515
01:08:53,531 --> 01:08:55,283
Now, you kiss me.

516
01:08:57,331 --> 01:09:00,368
- I can't rely on my mem...
- Say, "kiss me."

517
01:09:04,091 --> 01:09:05,365
Kiss me.

518
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:18,443
I want you.

519
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:23,004
I want you.

520
01:09:23,411 --> 01:09:24,321
Again.

521
01:09:25,171 --> 01:09:26,763
I want you.

522
01:09:29,651 --> 01:09:31,721
Put your hands on me.

523
01:10:50,571 --> 01:10:51,481
What'cha doing?

524
01:10:51,571 --> 01:10:52,640
I'm sorry.

525
01:10:52,811 --> 01:10:53,960
Just peeking.

526
01:10:57,491 --> 01:10:58,890
How do I look?

527
01:10:58,971 --> 01:11:00,290
You look better.

528
01:11:00,691 --> 01:11:01,840
Just better?

529
01:11:03,491 --> 01:11:05,004
You look beautiful.

530
01:11:08,411 --> 01:11:09,366
Thanks.

531
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:17,570
How old are you?

532
01:11:19,851 --> 01:11:21,000
Twenty-five.

533
01:11:21,851 --> 01:11:24,570
- What's your problem?
- Methuselah syndrome.

534
01:11:25,091 --> 01:11:26,240
What's that?

535
01:11:26,331 --> 01:11:28,845
My glands, they grow old too fast.

536
01:11:30,371 --> 01:11:32,089
Is that why you're still on earth?

537
01:11:32,171 --> 01:11:34,287
Yeah. I couldn't pass the medical.

538
01:11:37,091 --> 01:11:39,446
Anyway, I kind of like it here.

539
01:11:42,611 --> 01:11:43,805
I like you...

540
01:11:44,611 --> 01:11:46,249
...just the way you are.

541
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:49,840
Hi, Roy.

542
01:11:52,371 --> 01:11:55,329
Gosh, you really got some nice toys here.

543
01:11:56,411 --> 01:11:58,925
This is the friend I was telling you about.

544
01:11:59,211 --> 01:12:01,600
This is my savior, J.F. Sebastian.

545
01:12:04,531 --> 01:12:06,806
I like a man that stays put.

546
01:12:08,371 --> 01:12:10,646
You live here all by yourself, do you?

547
01:12:11,851 --> 01:12:12,681
Yes.

548
01:12:23,731 --> 01:12:25,403
How about some breakfast?

549
01:12:26,131 --> 01:12:28,440
I was just gonna make some. Excuse me.

550
01:12:36,371 --> 01:12:37,247
Well?

551
01:12:40,091 --> 01:12:41,080
Leon...

552
01:12:41,531 --> 01:12:42,805
What's going on?

553
01:12:47,251 --> 01:12:49,003
There's only two of us now.

554
01:12:51,131 --> 01:12:53,281
Then we're stupid and we'll die.

555
01:12:58,211 --> 01:12:59,803
No, we won't.

556
01:13:32,371 --> 01:13:33,167
No.

557
01:13:33,251 --> 01:13:35,367
Knight takes Queen, see?

558
01:13:36,051 --> 01:13:37,279
It won't do.

559
01:13:45,891 --> 01:13:47,927
Why are you staring at us, Sebastian?

560
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:51,048
'Cause you're so different.

561
01:13:53,171 --> 01:13:54,729
You're so perfect.

562
01:13:57,531 --> 01:13:58,361
Yes.

563
01:13:59,451 --> 01:14:01,089
What generation are you?

564
01:14:09,851 --> 01:14:10,840
Nexus 6.

565
01:14:11,371 --> 01:14:12,884
Ah, I knew it!

566
01:14:13,051 --> 01:14:16,282
'Cause I do genetic design work
for the Tyrell Corporation.

567
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:18,163
There's some of me in you.

568
01:14:19,771 --> 01:14:21,170
Show me something.

569
01:14:21,651 --> 01:14:22,720
Like what?

570
01:14:23,371 --> 01:14:24,520
Like anything.

571
01:14:27,211 --> 01:14:30,169
We're not computers, Sebastian.
We're physical.

572
01:14:33,371 --> 01:14:35,282
I think, Sebastian...

573
01:14:35,651 --> 01:14:37,209
...therefore, I am.

574
01:14:38,011 --> 01:14:40,241
Very good, Pris. Now show him why.

575
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,771
- We've got a lot in common.
- What do you mean?

576
01:15:09,851 --> 01:15:11,204
Similar problems.

577
01:15:11,331 --> 01:15:13,208
Accelerated decrepitude.

578
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:18,808
I don't know much about bio-mechanics,
Roy. I wish I did.

579
01:15:20,291 --> 01:15:22,566
If we don't find out soon...

580
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:25,042
...Pris hasn't got long to live!

581
01:15:25,971 --> 01:15:27,484
We can't allow that.

582
01:15:29,851 --> 01:15:31,045
Is he good?

583
01:15:31,731 --> 01:15:32,561
Who?

584
01:15:32,971 --> 01:15:33,767
Your opponent.

585
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:35,125
Oh, Dr. Tyrell?

586
01:15:36,171 --> 01:15:38,321
I've only beaten him once in chess.

587
01:15:38,971 --> 01:15:40,165
He's a genius.

588
01:15:41,931 --> 01:15:43,250
He designed you.

589
01:15:44,891 --> 01:15:46,370
Maybe he could help?

590
01:15:47,691 --> 01:15:50,000
I'd be happy to mention it to him.

591
01:15:52,411 --> 01:15:54,641
Better if I talk to him in person.

592
01:15:58,611 --> 01:16:02,047
From what I understand,
he's a sort of hard man to get to.

593
01:16:03,691 --> 01:16:04,646
Yes.

594
01:16:05,531 --> 01:16:06,486
Very.

595
01:16:10,051 --> 01:16:11,404
Will you help us?

596
01:16:13,051 --> 01:16:14,006
I can't.

597
01:16:14,491 --> 01:16:16,209
We need you, Sebastian.

598
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:18,562
You're our best and only friend.

599
01:16:31,851 --> 01:16:34,001
We're so happy you found us.

600
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:40,283
I don't think there is another human being
in the world that would've helped us.

601
01:17:27,131 --> 01:17:29,281
66,000 Prosser & Ankopitch.

602
01:17:31,771 --> 01:17:32,726
Trade.

603
01:17:33,371 --> 01:17:34,326
Trade at two...

604
01:17:34,411 --> 01:17:36,003
Blue entry.

605
01:17:36,851 --> 01:17:39,524
Mr. J.F. Sebastian.

606
01:17:40,211 --> 01:17:42,486
1-6-4-1-7.

607
01:17:44,971 --> 01:17:46,404
At this hour?

608
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:49,246
What can I do for you, Sebastian?

609
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:54,962
Queen to Bishop six. Check.

610
01:17:59,771 --> 01:18:01,204
Nonsense!

611
01:18:01,891 --> 01:18:03,404
Just a moment.

612
01:18:06,971 --> 01:18:10,327
Queen to Bishop six? Ridiculous!

613
01:18:16,891 --> 01:18:17,880
Queen...

614
01:18:20,131 --> 01:18:21,359
...Bishop six.

615
01:18:26,971 --> 01:18:28,086
Knight...

616
01:18:29,291 --> 01:18:31,361
...takes Queen.

617
01:18:38,011 --> 01:18:39,967
What's on your mind, Sebastian?

618
01:18:40,571 --> 01:18:42,402
What are you thinking about?

619
01:18:43,571 --> 01:18:46,290
Bishop to King seven. Checkmate.

620
01:18:48,091 --> 01:18:50,559
Bishop to King seven. Checkmate, I think.

621
01:18:51,931 --> 01:18:53,967
Got a brainstorm, Sebastian?

622
01:18:54,891 --> 01:18:56,927
Milk and cookies kept you awake?

623
01:18:57,611 --> 01:18:59,442
Let's discuss this.

624
01:19:00,091 --> 01:19:02,002
You better come up, Sebastian.

625
01:19:18,811 --> 01:19:19,926
Mr. Tyrell?

626
01:19:24,091 --> 01:19:25,524
I brought a friend.

627
01:19:31,811 --> 01:19:34,803
I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.

628
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:44,930
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.

629
01:19:46,131 --> 01:19:47,962
And what can he do for you?

630
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:51,846
Can the maker repair what he makes?

631
01:19:52,811 --> 01:19:55,484
Would you like to be modified?

632
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:57,685
Stay here.

633
01:20:02,891 --> 01:20:05,530
I had in mind something more radical.

634
01:20:06,971 --> 01:20:08,086
What...

635
01:20:08,811 --> 01:20:10,767
What seems to be the problem?

636
01:20:11,811 --> 01:20:12,926
Death.

637
01:20:13,051 --> 01:20:13,961
Death?

638
01:20:15,131 --> 01:20:17,964
Well, I'm afraid that's a little
out of my jurisdiction. You...

639
01:20:18,051 --> 01:20:20,281
I want more life...

640
01:20:21,211 --> 01:20:22,644
...Fucker!

641
01:20:26,971 --> 01:20:28,643
The facts of life...

642
01:20:30,611 --> 01:20:32,567
To make an alteration in the...

643
01:20:33,211 --> 01:20:35,679
...evolvement of an organic life
system is fatal.

644
01:20:35,771 --> 01:20:39,480
A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.

645
01:20:39,771 --> 01:20:40,408
Why not?

646
01:20:40,491 --> 01:20:43,767
Because, by the second day of incubation,
any cells...

647
01:20:43,931 --> 01:20:46,923
...that have undergone reversion
mutations give rise...

648
01:20:47,491 --> 01:20:50,688
...to revertant colonies,
like rats leaving a ship.

649
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:52,643
Then, the ship sinks.

650
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,240
What about E.M.S. recombination?

651
01:20:56,851 --> 01:20:58,330
We've already tried it.

652
01:20:58,411 --> 01:21:01,209
Ethyl Methane Sulfonate
is an alkylating agent...

653
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:05,250
...and a potent mutagen.
It created a virus, so lethal...

654
01:21:05,571 --> 01:21:08,768
...the subject was dead
before he left the table.

655
01:21:09,011 --> 01:21:12,208
Then a repressor protein,
that blocks the operating cells.

656
01:21:12,291 --> 01:21:16,045
It wouldn't obstruct replication, but it
does give rise to an error in replication.

657
01:21:16,131 --> 01:21:20,329
So that newly formed DNA strand
carries a mutation...

658
01:21:20,771 --> 01:21:22,762
...and you've got a virus again.

659
01:21:23,651 --> 01:21:25,482
But, this, all of this is...

660
01:21:28,331 --> 01:21:29,525
...academic.

661
01:21:29,931 --> 01:21:32,320
You were made
as well as we could make you.

662
01:21:32,411 --> 01:21:33,730
But not to last.

663
01:21:34,731 --> 01:21:37,882
The light that burns twice as bright,
burns half as long.

664
01:21:38,051 --> 01:21:41,123
And you have burned so very brightly, Roy.

665
01:21:42,811 --> 01:21:43,960
Look at you.

666
01:21:44,571 --> 01:21:46,482
You're the prodigal son.

667
01:21:47,331 --> 01:21:49,526
You're quite a prize.

668
01:21:56,131 --> 01:21:57,530
I've done...

669
01:21:57,651 --> 01:21:59,243
...questionable things.

670
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,083
Also, extraordinary things.

671
01:22:01,691 --> 01:22:03,249
Revel in your time.

672
01:22:07,771 --> 01:22:11,241
Nothing the god of bio-mechanics
wouldn't let you in heaven for.

673
01:23:53,011 --> 01:23:57,243
The body identified with Tyrell
is a 25-year-old male Caucasian.

674
01:23:57,371 --> 01:23:59,760
Name, Sebastian. J.F. Sebastian.

675
01:24:00,131 --> 01:24:04,409
Address: Bradbury Apartments,
Ninth Sector, N.F. 46751.

676
01:24:05,411 --> 01:24:07,686
Now, I want you to go down there and...

677
01:24:10,691 --> 01:24:13,922
This sector's closed to ground traffic.
What are you doing here?

678
01:24:14,011 --> 01:24:15,569
I'm workin'. What are you doin'?

679
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:17,130
Arresting you, that's what I'm doing.

680
01:24:17,211 --> 01:24:20,726
I'm Deckard. Blade Runner.
26354. I'm filed and monitored.

681
01:24:22,091 --> 01:24:23,524
Hold on. Checking.

682
01:24:27,331 --> 01:24:29,925
Okay. Checked and cleared.
Have a better one.

683
01:24:41,411 --> 01:24:42,446
Hi. J.F. there?

684
01:24:42,531 --> 01:24:45,443
- Who is it?
- This is Eddie, an old friend of J.F.'s.

685
01:24:50,131 --> 01:24:52,122
That's no way to treat a friend.

686
01:27:45,891 --> 01:27:47,802
Good evening, J.F.

687
01:31:28,331 --> 01:31:31,084
Not very sporting to fire
on an unarmed opponent.

688
01:31:33,291 --> 01:31:35,680
I thought you were supposed to be good.

689
01:31:37,851 --> 01:31:40,365
Aren't you the good man?

690
01:31:44,891 --> 01:31:47,689
Come on! Oh, Deckard!

691
01:31:49,691 --> 01:31:50,760
Show me...

692
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:54,009
...what you're made of!

693
01:32:05,851 --> 01:32:07,762
Proud of yourself, little man?

694
01:32:15,211 --> 01:32:16,690
This is for Zhora!

695
01:32:18,451 --> 01:32:19,804
This is for Pris.

696
01:32:26,651 --> 01:32:28,004
Come on, Deckard.

697
01:32:28,691 --> 01:32:31,410
I'm right here,
but you've gotta shoot straight.

698
01:32:32,811 --> 01:32:35,200
Straight doesn't seem to be good enough!

699
01:32:35,451 --> 01:32:36,804
Now it's my turn!

700
01:32:38,491 --> 01:32:41,085
I'm gonna give you a few seconds
before I come.

701
01:32:42,651 --> 01:32:45,040
One. Two...

702
01:32:57,451 --> 01:33:00,011
Three. Four...

703
01:34:22,611 --> 01:34:24,203
I'm coming!

704
01:34:30,771 --> 01:34:31,965
Four, five!

705
01:34:35,371 --> 01:34:37,009
How to stay alive!

706
01:35:00,171 --> 01:35:01,365
I can see you!

707
01:35:25,531 --> 01:35:28,125
Deckard, not yet!

708
01:36:06,811 --> 01:36:07,641
Yes.

709
01:36:15,611 --> 01:36:17,124
You better get it up!

710
01:36:17,811 --> 01:36:19,722
Or I'm gonna have to kill you!

711
01:36:20,091 --> 01:36:21,570
Unless you're alive...

712
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:24,245
...you can't play! And if you don't play...

713
01:36:33,491 --> 01:36:35,288
Six. Seven!

714
01:36:35,971 --> 01:36:37,689
Go to hell or go to heaven!

715
01:36:41,811 --> 01:36:43,290
Go to hell!

716
01:36:45,011 --> 01:36:46,763
Good! That's the spirit.

717
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:27,610
That hurt!

718
01:37:31,131 --> 01:37:33,122
That was irrational of you.

719
01:37:35,211 --> 01:37:36,564
Not to mention...

720
01:37:37,171 --> 01:37:38,923
...unsportsmanlike.

721
01:37:43,131 --> 01:37:44,610
Where are you going?

722
01:40:53,371 --> 01:40:56,010
Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?

723
01:40:58,331 --> 01:41:00,526
That's what it is to be a slave.

724
01:41:58,051 --> 01:42:00,770
I've seen things...

725
01:42:00,891 --> 01:42:03,769
...you people wouldn't believe.

726
01:42:05,611 --> 01:42:09,604
Attack ships on fire
off the shoulder of Orion.

727
01:42:12,571 --> 01:42:14,607
I watched C-beams...

728
01:42:15,131 --> 01:42:18,009
...glitter in the dark
near the Tannhuser Gate.

729
01:42:22,451 --> 01:42:25,807
All those moments will be lost...

730
01:42:27,891 --> 01:42:29,370
...in time...

731
01:42:31,491 --> 01:42:34,051
...like tears...

732
01:42:36,851 --> 01:42:38,523
...in the rain.

733
01:42:42,251 --> 01:42:44,560
Time to die.

734
01:43:48,091 --> 01:43:50,241
You've done a man's job, sir.

735
01:43:56,371 --> 01:43:58,248
I guess you're through, huh?

736
01:44:00,691 --> 01:44:01,840
Finished.

737
01:44:23,291 --> 01:44:25,521
It's too bad she won't live.

738
01:44:27,251 --> 01:44:29,207
But then again, who does?

739
01:45:01,691 --> 01:45:02,646
Rachael?

740
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:11,960
Rachael?

741
01:45:26,011 --> 01:45:27,000
Rachael?

742
01:46:31,691 --> 01:46:33,044
Do you love me?

743
01:46:34,411 --> 01:46:35,560
I love you.

744
01:46:37,011 --> 01:46:38,364
Do you trust me?

745
01:46:39,851 --> 01:46:41,204
I trust you.

746
01:46:50,811 --> 01:46:51,800
Rachael?

747
01:47:30,531 --> 01:47:32,840
It's too bad she won't live.

748
01:47:33,371 --> 01:47:35,248
But then again, who does?
