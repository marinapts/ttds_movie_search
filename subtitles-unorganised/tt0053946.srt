00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:10,135

It was good for little David

It was good for little David

12
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:55,547
and it's good enough for me

13
00:01:56,048 --> 00:02:01,186
Oh, give me that old time religion

It was good for old Jonah

18
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:25,828
It was good for old Jonah

19
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:30,332
It was good for old Jonah

20
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:35,337
and it's good enough for me

It was good for the Hebrew children

It was good for the Hebrew children

00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:49,351
It was good for the Hebrew children

24
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:55,858
and it's good enough for me

00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:15,627
It's good enough for me

00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:27,523
Uh, Good morning, young ladies and gentlemen.

30
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:29,024
[Door opening]

31
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,531
Good morning, visitors.

32
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,543
For our science lesson for today,

33
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:51,547
We will continue our discussion of Darwin's theory

34
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:53,549
of the descent of man.

35
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,051
Now, as I told you yesterday,

36
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:57,553
Darwin's theory tells us

37
00:03:57,553 --> 00:04:00,556
that man evolved from a lower order of animals,

38
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:04,059
from the first wiggly protozoa here in the sea

39
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:08,564
to the ape and finally to man.

40
00:04:08,564 --> 00:04:10,682
Say now some of you fellas out there are probably going to

41
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:12,684
that's why some of us act like monkeys.

42
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:14,186
[Laughing]

43
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:16,188
But what Mr. Charles Darwin
was trying to tell us,

44
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:17,689
in his own way--

45
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:19,191
Bertram T. Cates

46
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:21,193
come off it, Sam.

47
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:23,195
You've known me all my life.

48
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:26,198
Bert, you're charged

49
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:29,201
with violation of public act 31428,

50
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:32,704
volume 37, statute no. 31428 of the state code,

51
00:04:32,704 --> 00:04:34,206
which makes it unlawful

52
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:35,707
for any teacher of the public schools

53
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:37,709
to teach any theory that denies the creation of man 

54
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,211
as taught in the bible,

55
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:41,713
and to teach instead that man has descended 

56
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:44,716
from the lower order of animals.

57
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:48,220
Bertram Cates, I hereby place you under arrest.

58
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:00,983
Monkey trial!

59
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:01,984
Here's another one--

60
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:04,486
"Monkey shines in Hillsboro."

61
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:06,488
The whole world's laughing at us.

62
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:07,990
Look, from Chicago--

63
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,491
"Heavenly Hillsboro--

64
00:05:09,992 --> 00:05:11,493
"does it have a hole in its head."

65
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:12,995
"or its head in a hole"

66
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:15,497
I'm telling you, we've gone too far.

67
00:05:15,497 --> 00:05:16,999
Let 'em laugh.

68
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,500
we're fightin' the lord's battle, ain't we, Reverend.

69
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,003
Well, I'd a sight rather have some
heathen a-laughin' at me

70
00:05:21,003 --> 00:05:23,005
than to have my sons a-laughin' at my bible.

71
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:25,007
Well, they mocked the lord, too, didn't they

72
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:26,508
and they smote him and they spat upon him,

73
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:28,010
and he turned to them his other cheek.

74
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,011
Amen.

75
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:31,513
Look, Reverend, we don't want to smite 'em back.

76
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:33,515
We just want to make 'em stop.

77
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:34,516
Tom, you're prosecuting attorney.

78
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:36,018
Isn't there something we can do?

79
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:38,020
Well, in view of my position,

80
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,522
I...hardly think it ethical for me
to express my opinion

81
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:42,024
then you'd better go back to law school.

82
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:43,525
Gentlemen, I ask you--

83
00:05:44,026 --> 00:05:46,528
what do we care what a bunch of foreigners and city slickers think

84
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:49,031
Frank, you ever had a frenchman stayin' at your hotel

85
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:50,032
Now look, you're missing the--

86
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:52,034
and how long since you sold a pound of grits

87
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:53,535
to some smart aleck from New York

88
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,537
Heaven has chosen us to show the way,

89
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:56,538
to light the road for others,

90
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,541
back to the shepherd, back to the fold.

91
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,043
We're not sheep, Reverend.

92
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:03,545
Well, I'd a sight rather be a sheep than a Judas goat.

93
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:05,547
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

94
00:06:06,548 --> 00:06:08,050
As mayor of Hillsboro,

95
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,551
I stand to uphold the laws of this community,

96
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:12,554
No Matter how it may affect my political future.

97
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:15,057
Now, I shall just ignore these-- these slanders

98
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:17,059
just like water off a duck's back.

99
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:19,561
Now look, you only got 2 months more to go as mayor anyway,

100
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:22,064
and you shouldn't have been elected in the first place.

101
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:23,565
You've been a lousy mayor.

102

[Everyone talking at once]

103
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:27,569
My friends,

104
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:31,073
as you all know, I deal with figures--

105
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:33,575
accounts, checks, balances.

106
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:36,578
My bank operates on the principle of practical reality

107
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:38,080
and so do I.

108
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,581
Are you aware, my friends,

109
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:42,084
that the great big universities throughout the country

110
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:45,087
will consider student applicants from our state

111
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:47,589
ineligible because of this law

112
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,091
Now, I don't know whose idea it was

113
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:51,593
to hang a shingle on Hillsboro

114
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:53,095
spelling "horse-and-buggy,"

115
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:56,598
but as for me, I won't invest in antiquity.

116
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:58,600
I want my bank holding credit

117
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,604
with New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois,

118
00:07:02,604 --> 00:07:06,108
and I may want my son to go to Yale.

119
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:09,111
Now, I believe in--
just as much as anyone in this room--

120
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:12,614
in a basic fundamentalist interpretation of the bible,

121
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:15,617
but we can't close our eyes to all progress,

122

It'll be bigger than the Chautauqua
at Chattanooga,

And people are gonna have to have
some place to stay...

Let us give thanks to the lord.

136

Let us pray.

You better start praying, son.

139
00:07:58,243 --> 00:08:00,245

but my Pa did.

Ahh, you got a present for Bert, huh

168
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:27,582
Mort, don't let my father know
I came here.

169
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:29,584
Well, the Reverend don't tell me his business.

170
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:32,087
I don't see why I should tell him mine

171
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:33,088
Is Bert all right

172
00:09:33,588 --> 00:09:34,589
Oh, of course he's--

173
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,092
The safest place in the world's in the jail.

174
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:39,594
Come on in. Come on.

175
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:53,108
Tell them you're sorry.

176
00:09:53,108 --> 00:09:55,610
Tell them it was all a mistake.

177
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,112
Please te--

178
00:09:58,613 --> 00:10:00,115
tell them if they let my body out of jail

179
00:10:00,615 --> 00:10:02,117
I'd lock up my mind

180
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,622
Could you stand that, Rachel

181
00:10:07,622 --> 00:10:08,623
at least we'd be together.

182
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:10,625
It wouldn't be the...

183
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:14,629
It wouldn't be the same.

184
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:27,642
Rachel, do you remember

185
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:31,646
those warm, dark nights down by the riverbank,

186
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:35,650
just watching the water,

187
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,154
wondering about the...the
miracle of it,

188
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:41,656
wondering what the stars were for...

189
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:45,160
what's on the other side of the moon

190
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,662
There'd be no more of that, Rach.

191
00:10:47,662 --> 00:10:49,164
We could still have that.

192
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:50,665
No, we couldn't.

193
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,667
That would be in the locked-off part...

194
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,169
for both of us.

195
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:55,670
[Man]
Well...

196
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:02,677
So, this is where the fate of learning

197
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:05,180
will be decided for the next 10,000 years.

198
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,682
O tempora, o mores.

199
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:11,186
Well, I see we have

200
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:14,689
both beauty and biology on our side.

201
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:15,690
Who are you

202
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,192
This your writing

203
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:18,193
Yes.

204
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:19,694
This is mine.

205
00:11:19,694 --> 00:11:21,196
Hornbeck. E.K. Hornbeck,

206
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:22,697
Baltimore Herald.

207
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:23,698
I've been waiting to hear from you.

208
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:25,700
Read it.

209
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,202
My typewriter's been singing

210
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:30,705
a sweet, sad song about the
Hillsboro heretic--

211
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:33,208
B. Cates, latter-Day Dreyfus

212
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,710
Ok. Romeo with a biology bo

213
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:38,213
want a bite

214
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:39,714
Oh, don't worry.

215
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:40,715
I'm not the serpent, little eva.

216
00:11:41,216 --> 00:11:43,218
This isn't from the tree of knowledge.

217
00:11:43,218 --> 00:11:44,719
Oh, no.

218
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:45,720
You won't find one growing

219
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:48,223
in "Heavenly Hillsboro."

220
00:11:48,223 --> 00:11:49,724
A few ignorance bushes, perhaps,

221
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:52,227
but no tree of knowledge.

222
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:54,229
Ask adam.

223
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:56,731
You make me sound like a martyr.

224
00:11:56,731 --> 00:11:58,233
You could be.

225
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:59,734
Martyrs always have a point to prove,

226
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:01,236
and so do you,

227
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:04,239
but you haven't won your halo yet.

228
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:06,241
that won't come until they've tossed you

229
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:09,244
into the arena...
with the lion.

230
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:11,246
You mean Brady

231
00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:13,248
I don't want Bert to be a martyr.

232
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:15,250
What are you trying to prove, anyway

233
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,252
Rach, I'm not trying to prove anything.

234
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:18,753
All I want to do is teach my students

235
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:20,755
that man just wasn't planted here

236
00:12:20,755 --> 00:12:22,757
like a Geranium in a flowerpot

237
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:24,759
that life comes from a long miracle.

238
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,261
It just didn't take 7 days.

239
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:27,762
But it's against the law.

240
00:12:28,263 --> 00:12:30,265
a schoolteacher's a public servant.

241
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:33,768
He should do what the law and the school board want him to.

242
00:12:33,768 --> 00:12:36,271
Has the accused anything to say in his own defense

243
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:40,775
If not, I sentence you to life as a public servant,

244
00:12:40,775 --> 00:12:43,778
a silent butler in the service of
your school board.

245
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:47,782
Wastebaskets for ideas on sale in the outer lobby.

246
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:50,785
I don't see anything funny in this, Mr. Hornbeck.

247
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:52,787
Objection sustained. 
Neither do I.

248
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:55,290
Then why don't you just leave us alone

249
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,291
You newspaper people

250
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,793
have stirred up enough trouble for Bert.

251
00:12:58,793 --> 00:13:01,296
what do you want, anyway

252
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:04,799
I came to tell boy Socrates here

253
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,802
that the Baltimore Herald is opposed to Hemlock,

254
00:13:08,303 --> 00:13:09,804
and will provide a lawyer.

255
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:11,806
Who

256
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:12,807
Who

257
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:15,310
I don't know yet, but what's the difference

258
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,311
A new lawyer with old tricks,

259
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:17,812
An old lawyer with new tricks.

260
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:21,566
Wake up, Copernicus.

261
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,069
The law is still on the side of the lawmakers,

262
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,072
and everything revolves around their terra firma.

263
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,574
Then why bother, you and your newspaper

264
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,078
Because I know that the sunrise

265
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,579
is an optical illusion.

266
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,083
My teacher told me so.

267
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,585
You don't seem like the kind of person who'd want to bother.

268
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:41,586
You seem so--

269
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:43,588
cynical.
True, true

270
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,091
That's part of my fascination

271
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,092
I do hateful things

272
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,593
for which people love me

273
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:51,596
and I do lovable things for which they hate me.

274
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:54,099
I'm admired for my detestability.

275
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:59,104
Now, don't worry, little Eva.

276
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,606
I may be rancid butter,

277
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,109
but I'm on your side of the bread.

278
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:16,421

Matthew Harrison Brady...

331
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:18,042
as mayor of Hillsboro,
may I say that this municipality

332
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:20,545
is proud to have within its city limits

You know why I have come here.

376
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:12,006
It is not merely to prosecute a lawbreaker,

377
00:18:12,006 --> 00:18:15,510
a young man who has spoken out against the revealed word.

378
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,011
I have come here

379
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:19,013
because what has happened in a schoolroom in your town

380
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:20,515
has unloosed a wicked attack

381

from the big cities of the north.

382
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:25,520
We did not seek this struggle.

383
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,522
We are simple folk,

384
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:30,525
who seek only to live in brotherhood and peace,

385

to cherish our loved ones,

to teach our children the ways of righteousness

387
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,031
and of the lord.

388
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:40,535
But what would they teach them, these idolaters,

389

these priests of "evil-ution"

390

what would they have them do

391
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:47,041
they would have them measure the distance between the stars

392
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,794
and forget him who holds the
stars in his hands.

For, I tell you, if man believes he is descended from the beasts,

395
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,302
he must remain a beast!

Pa, ever since I was a little girl,

501
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:33,494
I'd wake up in the middle of the night

502
00:23:33,494 --> 00:23:34,996
afraid of the dark,

503
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,998
like the house was upside down,

and if I didn't hang onto the Mattress,

505
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,502
I'd fall out into the sky--

506
00:23:41,502 --> 00:23:43,004
Forgive her, Mother,

507
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,505
Forgive her, dear God...

508

I wanted to run to you,

to have you tell me that I was safe,

that everything was all right,

511

00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:50,124
Mr. drummond, is the defense ready to proceed

666
00:31:50,624 --> 00:31:53,127
with the selecti on of the next juror

667
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:54,128
Defense is ready, your honor.

668
00:31:54,628 --> 00:31:57,631
Col. Brady, is the prosecution ready?

669

Prosecution is ready, your honor.

670
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:00,634
All right, Mort, call a venireman

to fill the 12th and last seat on the jury.

Order in the court!

I want to warn the spectators

681
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:22,156
that the court will not tolerate

682
00:32:22,656 --> 00:32:25,159
any undue disturbance at any time.

[Judge] Now, I thought I made myself plain.

00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:31,665
I'm not going to warn you again about those photographs,

00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:47,681
the legion of the unwashed and holy

692
00:32:48,182 --> 00:32:50,184
have been rivering out of the rustic back ways

693
00:32:50,684 --> 00:32:54,188
to listen to their plump messiah coo and bellow.

Matthew Harrison Brady

and belching platitudes

00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:12,706
Your honor, before we continue,

702
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:14,708
will the court entertain a motion

703
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:16,710
on a Matter of procedure

704
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:20,714
Will the learned prosecutor state the motion

705
00:33:21,215 --> 00:33:22,716
It has been called to my attention

706
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:24,218
that the temperature in this courtroom

707
00:33:24,718 --> 00:33:28,722
is now 97 degrees fahrenheit

708

and it may get hotter!

[Crowd]
Ha ha! Amen! Amen!

710
00:33:35,729 --> 00:33:38,732
I do not think the dignity of this court will suffer

711
00:33:38,732 --> 00:33:42,236
if we remove a few superfluous outer garments

712
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:45,739
Does the, uh, defense have any objection

713
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:48,242
to Col. Brady's motion

714
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:51,245
Well, I don't know if the dignity of this court can be upheld

with these galluses I've got on.

We'll, uh, take that chance, 
uh, Mr. Drummond.

Glad you asked me that.

I brought these along special.

No questions. Not acceptable.

00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:24,087
Does Mr. Drummond refuse this man a place on the jury

747
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:26,089
simply because he believes in the bible

749

you can refuse him.

rejecting a worthy citizen

752
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:37,100
Without so much as asking
him a question

753
00:35:39,603 --> 00:35:41,605
All right, I'll ask him a question.

I object to the note of levity

764
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:20,894
which the counsel for the defense

765
00:36:20,894 --> 00:36:22,896
is introducing into these proceedings.

766
00:36:22,896 --> 00:36:25,399
The court agrees with you in spirit, Col. Brady.

767
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:28,402
And I object to all this Col. Brady talk.

768
00:36:28,402 --> 00:36:32,406
I am not familiar with Mr. Brady's military record.

769
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:34,408
Well, he was made honorary colonel

770
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:37,911
in our state militia the day he arrived in Hillsboro.

771
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:40,914
Well, the use of the title prejudices the case of my client.

772
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:43,917
It calls up a picture of the prosecution

773
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:45,419
a stride a white horse

774
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:49,423
a blaze in the uniform of a military colonel

775

marshaled behind him.

777
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,931
Well, we certainly want to give you

778
00:36:57,931 --> 00:36:59,433
a fair hearing in this courtroom.

779
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:03,437
We don't want anything prejudicial to your client.

780
00:37:03,937 --> 00:37:05,939
What do you suggest we do, counselor

781
00:37:05,939 --> 00:37:08,942
Break him. Make him a private.

782
00:37:08,942 --> 00:37:10,444
I have no serious objection

783
00:37:10,444 --> 00:37:12,446
to the honorary title of Private Brady.

Oh, Mr. drummond.

788
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:38,972
You know our mayor, Mr. Drummond.

00:37:38,972 --> 00:37:39,973
Yes.

790
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:41,975
I believe he has a suggestion to make

791
00:37:41,975 --> 00:37:45,979
By, uh, by authority of, uh...

792

well, I'm sure the governor won't have
any objection--

793

I hereby appoint you, Mr. Drummond,

Well...

796
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,992
Well, gentlemen, what can I say

797
00:37:59,993 --> 00:38:01,495
it certainly is not every day

798
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:03,497
that a man attains the exalted position

799

of temporary honorary colonel.

800
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:07,501
I thank you.

Well, I guess I'm as religious as the next fellow.

00:39:00,053 --> 00:39:02,055
what would you think if that sweet child

818
00:39:02,055 --> 00:39:03,557
came home from school

and told you that a godless teacher-

Objection! We're supposed to be
selecting jury members.

821
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:10,564
The prosecution is denouncing the defendant

822
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:12,566
before the trial has even begun.

823
00:39:13,683 --> 00:39:15,185
Objection sustained.

824
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:19,189
Mr. Sillers, do you have any personal opinions

825
00:39:19,689 --> 00:39:21,191
with regard to
the defendant

826
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:24,194
that might prejudice you on his behalf

828
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:26,196
Hmm.

829
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:28,698
I don't hardly know the man.

830
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,701
Though he bought some peat moss from me one time.

831
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:33,453
H-he paid his bill.

832
00:39:33,453 --> 00:39:34,955
Mr. Sillers impresses me

833
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:38,458
as an honest, god-fearing man. 
I accept him.

834
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,460
Thank you,
Col. Brady.

835
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,212
Col. Drummond

836
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:50,220
Now, Mr. Sillers,

837
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,723
You, ah, you have just said that, ah, you were a religious man.

838
00:39:53,723 --> 00:39:55,225
Do you work at it very hard

839
00:39:55,725 --> 00:39:58,728
Well, I'm pretty busy down at the feed store

840
00:39:58,728 --> 00:40:00,730
My wife tends the religion for both of us.

841
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,232
Oh, I see, I see.

842
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:04,734
You take care of this life,

843
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:06,736
and she takes care of the next
one, is that it

844
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:09,739
that is objected to as immaterial
and argumentative.

845
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,741
[Judge] objection sustained.

846
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:14,744
Now, tell me, Mr. Sillers,

847
00:40:14,744 --> 00:40:17,247
While your wife has been taking care of the religion for the family

848
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:19,499
have you ever heard of a fellow called Charles Darwin

849
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,002
Oh, not till recent.

850
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,004
Well, tell me something.

851
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:25,755
From what you've heard of this fellow Darwin,

852
00:40:25,755 --> 00:40:26,756
do you think he's the kind of a man 

853
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:28,258
you might invite up for Sunday dinner

854
00:40:28,758 --> 00:40:31,761
Your honor, my worthy opponent from Chicago

855
00:40:32,262 --> 00:40:34,264
is cluttering up the issue with hypothetical questions.

856
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:36,266
I have already established

857
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:38,768
that Mr. Sillers is not working very hard at religion.

858
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:40,270
Now, for your sake

859
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,771
I'm trying to establish

860
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:44,407
that he is not
working at evolution.

861
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:46,409
Oh, I'm just working at the feed store.

862
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:47,911
[Laughing]

863
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:49,663
[Gavel pounding]

864
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:52,165
Mr. Sillers, do you think you can render impartial--

865
00:40:52,165 --> 00:40:54,668
Objection! The prosecution has already accepted this man.

866
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:56,169
But all I want is a fair trial.

867
00:40:56,169 --> 00:40:57,170
So do I.

868
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,171
Unless the state of mind

869
00:40:58,171 --> 00:40:59,172
of the members of the jury

870
00:40:59,172 --> 00:41:01,675
conforms to the laws and patterns of society--

871
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:04,177
Oh, conform, conform. what
do you want to do

872
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:05,679
run the jury through a meat grinder

873
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:07,681
to have them all come out the same

874
00:41:07,681 --> 00:41:09,683
Take a box seat there, Mr. Sillers

875
00:41:09,683 --> 00:41:12,185
Your honor! Your honor! this is ludicrous!

876
00:41:12,185 --> 00:41:14,187
Gentlemen, you are both out of order.

877
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:17,190
The bench rules that the jury has been selected.

878
00:41:19,192 --> 00:41:20,694
Due to the excessive heat

879
00:41:20,694 --> 00:41:23,697
court is adjourned until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

880
00:41:23,697 --> 00:41:26,199
[Chattering]

881
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:28,201
Ah, one moment, please. one moment

882
00:41:29,703 --> 00:41:31,705
Order in the court

883
00:41:32,205 --> 00:41:34,207
Rev. Brown has asked me to announce

884
00:41:34,207 --> 00:41:37,210that there will be a prayer meeting tonight at the picnic grounds.

885
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:41,081
"Pray for justice and guidance." All are invited.

886
00:41:41,581 --> 00:41:44,084
Your honor, I object to that commercial announcement.

887
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,837
commercial announcement

888
00:41:47,837 --> 00:41:49,339
of the Rev. brown's product.

889
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:50,340
Why don't you announce

890
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,342
that there's going to be an evolution meeting

891
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:54,844
I have no knowledge of such a meeting.

892
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:56,846
That's quite understandable.

893
00:41:56,846 --> 00:41:57,847
It isn't enough

894
00:41:57,847 --> 00:41:59,849
that everybody who comes into this courtroom

895
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:02,852
has to pass under a sign which says
read your bible.

896
00:42:02,852 --> 00:42:04,854
I want that sign taken down, your honor.

897
00:42:04,854 --> 00:42:06,856
[Crowd]
No! No!

898
00:42:08,858 --> 00:42:10,860
Or else I want another sign put up

899
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,363
just as big with just as big letters

900
00:42:13,363 --> 00:42:14,864
which says read your Darwin.

901
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:17,867
[Cheering and booing]

902
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:21,871
That's what I mean about this man.

903
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:23,873
[Judge] order!

904
00:42:23,873 --> 00:42:25,875
Your honor, your honor, we want the learned counsel from the North

905
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:28,378
to get every fairness and consideration

906
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:29,879
in this trial.

907
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:31,881
We must not forget that he is our guest.

908
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:33,883
Guest, hell! I'm a lawyer in a courtroom.

909
00:42:34,384 --> 00:42:35,885
Then behave like a lawyer.

910
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:36,886
Stop using this courtroom

911
00:42:36,886 --> 00:42:38,888
as a platform for your obscene ideas

912
00:42:38,888 --> 00:42:41,274
trying to dirty the minds of our young people here.

913
00:42:41,274 --> 00:42:44,277
You are both out of order. Court is adjourned.

914
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:47,280
My conduct in this courtroom is not under question,

915
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,281
and certainly not by you!

916
00:42:48,281 --> 00:42:49,783
Well, your language is!

917
00:42:49,783 --> 00:42:52,285
I don't swear just for the hell of it!

918
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:54,788
Language is a poor enough means of communication.

919
00:42:55,288 --> 00:42:57,290
I think we should use all the words we've got.

920
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:00,794
Besides, there are damned few words that anybody understands!

921
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:08,501
Henry Drummond, atheist!

922
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:12,505
You! what are you going to say in your paper now

923
00:43:12,505 --> 00:43:16,009
"He that sups with the devil must
have a long spoon."

924
00:43:19,012 --> 00:43:21,514
[Chattering]

925
00:43:26,903 --> 00:43:28,404
[Man] Let's go.

926
00:43:28,404 --> 00:43:29,906
Let's go folks, clear the floor.

927
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,913
We'll fix you, Cates. we'll run you out of town.

928
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:41,417
Well, anyway,

929
00:43:41,417 --> 00:43:43,920
the Baltimore Herald is with you...

930
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,922
right up to the lynching.

931
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:54,430
Bert...

932
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:58,434
Bert, you've got to call the whole
thing off now.

933
00:43:58,434 --> 00:43:59,936
who are you, young lady

934
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:01,938
This is Rachel Brown. We're engaged.

935
00:44:01,938 --> 00:44:03,439
Brown Rev. Brown's daughter

936
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,942
Don't you see what's happening, Bert

937
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:08,945
They're using you as a weapon against your own people.

938
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:11,948
What you think or believe isn't the point anymore.

939
00:44:11,948 --> 00:44:13,449
You're helping something bad.

940
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:15,451
No, young lady, it's not as simple as all that--

941
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:18,454
good or bad, black or white , day or night.

942
00:44:18,454 --> 00:44:20,456
do you know that at the top of the world

943
00:44:20,456 --> 00:44:22,458
the twilight is 6 months long

944
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,961
Bert and I don't live on top of the world.

945
00:44:24,961 --> 00:44:26,462
We live in Hillsboro.

946
00:44:26,462 --> 00:44:28,464
and when the sun goes down, it's dark.

947
00:44:28,464 --> 00:44:30,967
And why do you have to come here to make it different

948
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:32,969
I didn't come here to make Hillsboro different.

949
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:35,471
I came here to defend his right to be different.

950
00:44:35,972 --> 00:44:37,473
And that's the point.

951
00:44:37,974 --> 00:44:38,975
How about it, boy

952
00:44:39,475 --> 00:44:42,478
I don't know what the point is anymore.

953
00:44:42,478 --> 00:44:44,981
I tried to open their kids'
minds...their kids.

954
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:47,483
I tried to give them knowledge they could use.

955
00:44:47,483 --> 00:44:49,986
they're using it-- as a stranglehold on me.

956
00:44:50,486 --> 00:44:51,988
[Hornbeck]
You're learning, Cates.

957
00:44:51,988 --> 00:44:54,991
Disillusionment is what little heroes are made of

958
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:57,994
Where do I finish dead with a paper
medal on my chest

959
00:44:57,994 --> 00:45:00,496
"Bert Cates, world's biggest chump-- he died fighting."

960
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:04,000
Let's face it-- to him, I'm a headline. To you, I'm a cause.

961
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,002
And to yourself

962
00:45:06,002 --> 00:45:07,503
All right, let's face it.

963
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:10,506
Now, you chose to get into this
by yourself.

964
00:45:10,506 --> 00:45:12,508
You didn't get into it because of his headline

965
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:14,010
or because of my cause,

966
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,513
or maybe even because of their kids.

967
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:19,515
You got in to it because of yourself--

968
00:45:19,515 --> 00:45:22,018
Because of something you believed in
for yourself.

969
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:24,020
I didn't believe it would happen this way.

970
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,521
It can get worse.

971
00:45:25,521 --> 00:45:28,024
Those people are in a lean and hungry mood.

972
00:45:28,024 --> 00:45:30,026
They look at me as if I was a murderer.

973
00:45:30,026 --> 00:45:31,527
[Chuckling] In a way, you are.

974
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:34,030
You know, you-- you kill one of their fairy-tale notions,

975
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,531
and they'll bring down

976
00:45:36,032 --> 00:45:39,535
the wrath of god, Brady and the state legislature on you every time.

977
00:45:39,535 --> 00:45:41,537
You make a joke out of everything.

978
00:45:41,537 --> 00:45:43,039
Young lady

979
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,042
I know what Bert is going through.

980
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:48,044
It's the loneliest
feeling in the world.

981
00:45:48,544 --> 00:45:50,046
It's like walking down an empty street

982
00:45:50,546 --> 00:45:54,050
listening to your own footsteps.

983
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:57,053
But all you have to do is to knock on any door

984
00:45:57,553 --> 00:45:59,555
and say, "if you'll let me in,

985
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:01,557
"I'll live the way you want me to live,

986
00:46:01,557 --> 00:46:04,560
and I'll think the way "you want me to think,"

987
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,062
and all the blinds will go up,

988
00:46:06,062 --> 00:46:07,563
and all the doors will open,

989
00:46:07,563 --> 00:46:10,566
and you'll never be lonely, ever again.

990
00:46:12,568 --> 00:46:14,570
Now, it's up to you, Cates.

991
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:17,573
You just say the word, and we'll change the plea--

992
00:46:17,573 --> 00:46:21,077
th-that is, of course, if you honestly believe that the law is right

993
00:46:21,077 --> 00:46:23,079
and you're wrong.

994
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:24,580
Now, if that's the case, just tell me,

995
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,582
and I'll pack my bag and go back to Chicago

996
00:46:26,582 --> 00:46:29,085
where it's a nice, cool 100
in the shade.

997
00:46:29,085 --> 00:46:31,087
Bert, I've gone to my father's church

998
00:46:31,587 --> 00:46:34,090
every sunday as long as I can remember.

999
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:36,092
This is where I live.

1000
00:46:36,092 --> 00:46:38,594
This is where my children will be born.

1001
00:46:38,594 --> 00:46:40,596
What kind of a life could we have

1002
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:45,351
Well, what kind of a life could we have if I gave up now

1003
00:46:46,853 --> 00:46:47,854
your father's kind

1004
00:46:47,854 --> 00:46:49,856
Hallelujah, and ignorance, here we come

1005
00:46:50,356 --> 00:46:51,858
Rach, what goes on in this town is not necessarily

1006
00:46:51,858 --> 00:46:53,860
the christian religion everyplace else.

1007
00:46:59,232 --> 00:47:01,734
Rach, I can't live the way you want me to

1008
00:47:03,236 --> 00:47:05,238
You're the one who's got to decide.

1009
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,241
It's his church or our house.

1010
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:09,742
You can't live in both.

1011
00:47:12,745 --> 00:47:14,247
[Mort] sorry, Bert.

1012
00:47:14,747 --> 00:47:16,749
I have to take you back now.

1013
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:38,271
You ever been in love, Hornbeck

1014
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:41,274
Only with the sound of my own words, thank God.

1015
00:47:44,277 --> 00:47:46,279
I have been to their cities

1016
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:49,282
and I have seen the altars upon which they sacrifice

1017
00:47:49,282 --> 00:47:52,285
the futures of their children to the gods of science.

1018
00:47:53,286 --> 00:47:54,787
And what are their rewards

1019
00:47:54,787 --> 00:47:56,789
confusion and self-destruction.

1020
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,792
New ways to kill each other in wars

1021
00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:02,795
I tell you, gentlemen, the way of scientism is the way of darkness

1022
00:48:02,795 --> 00:48:05,798
Now, Mr. Brady, do you, ah, believe
seriously

1023
00:48:05,798 --> 00:48:07,800
that the majority of the American people

1024
00:48:08,301 --> 00:48:10,303
hold with your views

1025
00:48:10,303 --> 00:48:13,306
not just the views
of Matthew Harrison
Brady, Mr. Hornbeck.

1026
00:48:13,306 --> 00:48:15,308
There isn't one state in the union

1027
00:48:15,308 --> 00:48:17,810
where the evolutionists are in the majority.

1028
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:21,314
It'll be the people themselves of our great land who will speak.

1029
00:48:21,314 --> 00:48:23,816
Mr. Brady, how do you account for the unfortunate comment

1030
00:48:23,816 --> 00:48:25,818
that your crusade has aroused

1031
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:29,322
the attacks upon me stem from a vociferous minority

1032
00:48:29,322 --> 00:48:31,824
which happens to control the press.

1033
00:48:31,824 --> 00:48:34,327
I hope you gentlemen-- 
madam--

1034
00:48:34,327 --> 00:48:37,330
will not be influenced by this same negative bias.

1035
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:39,332
Pardon me.

1036
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,835
Thank you, O lord, dear father,

1037
00:48:42,835 --> 00:48:45,338
from whom all blessings flow, for thy bounty,

1038
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:48,341
make us worthy of thy grace, amen.

1039
00:48:48,341 --> 00:48:51,844
Go ahead, Henry. I said grace
for you, too.

1040
00:48:51,844 --> 00:48:53,846
God may be a Matter of indifference

1041
00:48:53,846 --> 00:48:54,847
to the evolutionists,

1042
00:48:55,348 --> 00:48:57,350
and the life beyond hold no charms for them...

1043
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:58,851
[Whispers] Sarah.

1044
00:48:58,851 --> 00:49:01,354
[Brady] But the mass of mankind will continue to worship.

1045
00:49:02,855 --> 00:49:03,856
Here, sit with me.

1046
00:49:03,856 --> 00:49:04,857
Thank you.

1047
00:49:04,857 --> 00:49:06,359
He'll be busy for a while.

1048
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,862
Well, where is it, where is it

1049
00:49:09,862 --> 00:49:11,364
The hat with the little blue feather

1050
00:49:11,864 --> 00:49:13,366
Blue feather

1051
00:49:13,366 --> 00:49:16,369
You used to wear it to all the conventions. it was much too becoming.

1052
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:18,871
[Chuckling]
Oh, Henry!

1053
00:49:18,871 --> 00:49:20,373
And whatever happened

1054
00:49:20,373 --> 00:49:22,875
to that skinny black tie you used to wear

1055
00:49:23,376 --> 00:49:26,129
Not very attractive... like an old shoelace.

1056
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,132
It's back in the shoe.

1057
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:31,634
how are you, Sarah
how are you

1058
00:49:31,634 --> 00:49:34,637
a little grayer, Henry. And you

1059
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:36,139
A little grimmer.

1060
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,141
I don't believe it. I watched you in court today.

1061
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,776
You seemed to be enjoying it as much as ever.

1062
00:49:40,776 --> 00:49:44,280
That's Matt. He brings out the worst in me.

1063
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,282
We've missed you, Henry.

1064
00:49:46,282 --> 00:49:49,785
You don't make many good friends in a lifetime.

1065
00:49:49,785 --> 00:49:53,289
I never dreamed our ideas would separate us.

1066
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,791
[Brady] I have reason to be.

1067
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:57,293
I have messages of encouragement

1068
00:49:57,293 --> 00:49:58,794
from the governors of 22 states.

1069
00:49:58,794 --> 00:50:00,796
He still has a loud voice.

1070
00:50:00,796 --> 00:50:03,299
He still has something to say, Henry.

1071
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:05,801
You mean about how everybody else should live

1072
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:08,804
Oh, don't be cynical.

1073
00:50:08,804 --> 00:50:11,807
I think every man longs to be his brother's keeper

1074
00:50:11,807 --> 00:50:14,810
and to be cared for in return.

1075
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:17,813
It sounds more convincing coming from you.

1076
00:50:17,813 --> 00:50:19,815
He doesn't have a blue feather in his hat, that's all.

1077
00:50:20,316 --> 00:50:21,317
[Chuckling]

1078
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:23,319
You know, looking back,

1079
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:26,822
I don't think Matt would have made a great president,

1080
00:50:26,822 --> 00:50:29,825
But I would have voted for him for king..

1081
00:50:29,825 --> 00:50:32,328
just to have you for queen.

1082
00:50:32,328 --> 00:50:33,696
and what would you have been

1083
00:50:33,696 --> 00:50:35,698
Your majesty's loyal opposition.

1084
00:50:35,698 --> 00:50:38,584
[Brady] "...of our belief in the written word of the bible.

1085
00:50:38,584 --> 00:50:41,587
I believe that Hillsboro..."
Pardon me,

1086
00:50:41,587 --> 00:50:43,089
"...will become the shrine

1087
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:45,091
of all" those millions upon millions

1088
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:47,093
"who find a rallying point

1089
00:50:47,093 --> 00:50:50,096
"for their expression of God's will."

1090
00:50:50,596 --> 00:50:52,598
Now, that's all for today, gentlemen.

1091
00:50:53,883 --> 00:50:55,885
Hearken to the word!

1092
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:58,387
Hearken to the word!

1093
00:50:58,387 --> 00:50:59,889
The word tells us

1094
00:51:00,389 --> 00:51:03,392
that the world was created in 6 days.

1095
00:51:03,392 --> 00:51:06,896
In the beginning, the earth
was without form, and void,

1096
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:09,899
and the lord said, "Let there be light."

1097
00:51:09,899 --> 00:51:10,900
[Crowd] Yeah! Yeah!

1098
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,902
And there was light!

1099
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:14,403
Amen!

1100
00:51:14,403 --> 00:51:16,906
And the lord saw the light, and the light saw the lord

1101
00:51:16,906 --> 00:51:18,908
And the light said, am I good, lord

1102
00:51:19,408 --> 00:51:21,911
And the lord said, thou art good.

1103
00:51:22,411 --> 00:51:23,412
[Cheering]

1104
00:51:23,913 --> 00:51:26,916
And the evening and the morning
were the 1st day.

1105
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:28,918
and the lord said, "Let there be
a firmament."

1106
00:51:29,418 --> 00:51:30,920
And even as he spoke, it was so.

1107
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:35,424
And the evening and the morning were the 2nd day!

1108
00:51:35,424 --> 00:51:36,425
On the 3rd day,

1109
00:51:36,926 --> 00:51:38,311
Brought he forth the dry land,

1110
00:51:38,311 --> 00:51:40,313
and the grass, and the fruit tree,

1111
00:51:40,313 --> 00:51:43,316
and on the 4th day, the sun, the moon and the stars,

1112
00:51:43,316 --> 00:51:46,068
and he pronounced them good.

1113
00:51:46,068 --> 00:51:48,571
The 5th day peopled he the
sea with fish

1114
00:51:48,571 --> 00:51:50,072
and the air with fowl,

1115
00:51:50,072 --> 00:51:52,575
and made he the great whale,

1116
00:51:52,575 --> 00:51:56,078
and he blessed them all!

1117
00:51:56,078 --> 00:51:57,580
[Crowd cheering]

1118
00:51:59,081 --> 00:52:01,083
But...

1119
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:04,587
on the morning of the 6th day,

1120
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:09,592
the lord rose, and his eye was dark,

1121
00:52:09,592 --> 00:52:12,094
and the scowl lay across his face.

1122
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:14,096
Why

1123
00:52:14,597 --> 00:52:15,598
Why was the lord troubled

1124
00:52:16,098 --> 00:52:17,099
Why tell us!

1125
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:18,601
Tell us the troubles of the lord!

1126
00:52:19,101 --> 00:52:20,603
Tell us the troubles of the lord!

1127
00:52:21,103 --> 00:52:23,606
The lord looked around him, did the lord, at all his handiwork

1128
00:52:23,606 --> 00:52:26,108
Bowed down before him, and he said,

1129
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:28,110
"It is not good! It is not enough!

1130
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:30,112
It is not finished!"

1131
00:52:30,613 --> 00:52:33,115
"I shall make me...

1132
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:35,234
a man!"

1133
00:52:35,234 --> 00:52:36,736
[Crowd cheering]

1134
00:52:38,371 --> 00:52:39,372
Do we believe

1135
00:52:39,372 --> 00:52:40,373
[All]
Yes!

1136
00:52:40,373 --> 00:52:41,741
Do we believe the word

1137
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:42,875
Yes!

1138
00:52:43,376 --> 00:52:44,377
Do we believe the truth of the word

1139
00:52:44,377 --> 00:52:45,494
Yes!

1140
00:52:45,494 --> 00:52:47,496
Do we curse the man who denies the word

1141
00:52:47,496 --> 00:52:48,497
Yes!

1142
00:52:48,497 --> 00:52:50,499
Do we call down hellfire

1143
00:52:50,499 --> 00:52:52,501
on the man who has sinned against the word

1144
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:54,003
Yes!

1145
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:56,005
Whatever happened to silent prayer

1146
00:52:56,505 --> 00:53:00,009
O lord of the tempest and the thunder,

1147
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:02,511
strike down this sinner

1148
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:04,513
as thou did thine enemies of old

1149
00:53:04,513 --> 00:53:06,015
in the days of the pharaohs.

1150
00:53:06,015 --> 00:53:09,518
Let him know the terror of thy sword!

1151
00:53:09,518 --> 00:53:13,522
Let his soul for all eternity

1152
00:53:13,522 --> 00:53:17,526
writhe in anguish and damnation!

1153
00:53:17,526 --> 00:53:18,527
No!

1154
00:53:18,527 --> 00:53:19,528
No, Pa!

1155
00:53:20,029 --> 00:53:21,530
Don't pray to destroy Bert!

1156
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:25,034
Lord, we ask the same curse

1157
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:27,536
for those who ask grace for this sinner

1158
00:53:27,536 --> 00:53:31,040
though they be blood of my blood
and flesh of my flesh!

1159
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:36,545
Rev. Brown, Rev-
Rev. Brown, I know it's the great zeal of your faith

1160
00:53:36,545 --> 00:53:39,048
which makes you utter this prayer,

1161
00:53:39,048 --> 00:53:41,300
but it is possible to be overzealous,

1162
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,302
to destroy that which you hope to save

1163
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:46,305
so that nothing is left but emptiness.

1164
00:53:46,305 --> 00:53:47,807
remember the wisdom of solomon

1165
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,308
in the book of proverbs--

1166
00:53:49,308 --> 00:53:52,311
"he that troubleth
his own house"

1167
00:53:52,311 --> 00:53:54,814
shall inherit the wind."

1168
00:53:56,315 --> 00:53:59,819
The bible also tells us that God forgives his children,

1169
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:04,824
and we as children of God should forgive each other

1170
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,827
My good friends, return to your homes.

1171
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:09,829
Go home.

1172
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:12,331
The blessings of the lord be with you all.

1173
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:32,101
We'll take you home, my dear.

1174
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:35,104
I can't go home. He hates me.

1175
00:54:35,104 --> 00:54:37,106
He doesn't hate you.

1176
00:54:37,106 --> 00:54:40,609
He damned me. My own father damned me to hell.

1177
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,112
No man has the power to damn.

1178
00:54:43,112 --> 00:54:45,114
He's always done it.

1179
00:54:45,114 --> 00:54:48,117
He did it to Bert and the little Stebbins boy.

1180
00:54:49,118 --> 00:54:51,120
Stebbins boy

1181
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:55,124
That's how the whole thing started.

1182
00:54:55,124 --> 00:54:58,127
the Stebbins boy was just an innocent child.

1183
00:54:58,127 --> 00:55:00,629
[Mr. Brady] God has no wrath for the innocent, my dear.

1184
00:55:02,631 --> 00:55:05,134
That's what Bert said.

1185
00:55:05,634 --> 00:55:09,138
He u--he used to say that when we-- when we were together.

1186
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:14,143
I-if I could justexplain it clearly,

1187
00:55:14,143 --> 00:55:16,645
then you'd understand.

1188
00:55:16,645 --> 00:55:18,147
Mr. Brady, please, I--

1189
00:55:18,647 --> 00:55:20,149
We'll do all we can to help you.

1190
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:22,151
Come. Now, let's go home.

1191
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:50,230
I'll be right up, Sarah.

1192
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:51,731
All right, Matt.

1193
00:55:52,232 --> 00:55:53,233
Good night, Henry.

1194
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:55,235
[Drummond] good night.

1195
00:56:06,246 --> 00:56:07,747
You're up late.

1196
00:56:08,248 --> 00:56:09,749
Too hot to sleep.

1197
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:14,754
No use trying to fool ourselves, Henry

1198
00:56:14,754 --> 00:56:17,257
We're just not the men we used to be.

1199
00:56:17,257 --> 00:56:19,259
Ha ha!

1200
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:21,761
By the size of that meal you packed away tonight,

1201
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:23,763
I'd say you hadn't changed in 40 years.

1202
00:56:24,264 --> 00:56:26,766
[Laughing]

1203
00:56:33,773 --> 00:56:35,275
Funny how 2 people

1204
00:56:35,275 --> 00:56:37,277
can start from the same point and...

1205
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:40,280
drift apart.

1206
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:45,285
It's the nature of the life process.

1207
00:56:45,285 --> 00:56:47,787
There used to be a mutuality of understanding and...

1208
00:56:48,788 --> 00:56:51,291
admiration between us, Henry.

1209
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:56,296
Why is it, my old friend, that you've...

1210
00:56:56,296 --> 00:56:58,798
you've moved so far away from me

1211
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:00,800
Well, all motion is relative, Matt.

1212
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,803
Maybe it's you who have moved away by standing still.

1213
00:57:04,804 --> 00:57:05,805
Hmm.

1214
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:09,809
If progress means abandoning God

1215
00:57:11,311 --> 00:57:13,313
abandoning the faith of our fathers--

1216
00:57:13,313 --> 00:57:15,315
I saw a demonstration of that faith tonight.

1217
00:57:15,315 --> 00:57:17,317
it's a pretty deadly instrument, I'd say.

1218
00:57:17,317 --> 00:57:18,818
What you saw was a reflection

1219
00:57:18,818 --> 00:57:20,320
of the violence and hate

1220
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:23,823
in the world around them,
Henry-- your world

1221
00:57:23,823 --> 00:57:25,325
But they're driven to it

1222
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:27,827
because their faith was challenged.

1223
00:57:27,827 --> 00:57:30,830
These are simple people, Henry, poor people.

1224
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,332
they work hard

1225
00:57:32,332 --> 00:57:33,833
and they need to believe in something...

1226
00:57:34,834 --> 00:57:36,836
something beautiful.

1227
00:57:36,836 --> 00:57:38,338
They're seeking for something

1228
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:40,340
more perfect than what they have

1229
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,841
Window shopping for heaven.

1230
00:57:42,342 --> 00:57:43,843
why do you want to take it away from them, Henry

1231
00:57:43,843 --> 00:57:45,345
it's all they have...

1232
00:57:45,845 --> 00:57:47,847
like a golden chalice of hope.

1233
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:50,850
[Chuckling] Ah.

1234
00:57:51,851 --> 00:57:53,853
Like my golden dancer.

1235
00:57:56,356 --> 00:57:57,357
Your what?

1236
00:57:57,357 --> 00:57:59,859
Golden dancer.

1237
00:57:59,859 --> 00:58:01,361
She stood in the big side window

1238
00:58:01,861 --> 00:58:03,363
in the general store in Wakeman, Ohio.

1239
00:58:03,863 --> 00:58:05,865
I'd stand out on the street and say to myself,

1240
00:58:05,865 --> 00:58:09,369
"if I had golden dancer, I'd have everything in the world I ever wanted."

1241
00:58:09,869 --> 00:58:12,872
I was about 7 years old
at the time and a great
judge of rocking horses.

1242
00:58:14,874 --> 00:58:17,877
Golden dancer had a bright-red mane, blue eyes,

1243
00:58:17,877 --> 00:58:20,380
and she was gold all over with purple spots.

1244
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,382
And when the sun hit her stirrups,

1245
00:58:22,382 --> 00:58:25,885
She was a dazzling sight to behold.

1246
00:58:25,885 --> 00:58:28,888
But she was a week's wages for my father,

1247
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:31,891
So golden dancer and I

1248
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:35,395
always had a big plate-glass window between us.

1249
00:58:38,398 --> 00:58:39,399
And then...

1250
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,402
Let's see...

1251
00:58:42,402 --> 00:58:44,404
It couldn't have been christmas.

1252
00:58:44,404 --> 00:58:46,906
It must have been my birthday.

1253
00:58:46,906 --> 00:58:48,408
I woke in the morning,

1254
00:58:48,408 --> 00:58:49,909
and there was golden dancer

1255
00:58:49,909 --> 00:58:51,411
at the foot of my bed.

1256
00:58:51,911 --> 00:58:53,413
Mom had skimped on the groceries,

1257
00:58:53,413 --> 00:58:56,416
and my father had worked nights for a month.

1258
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:57,917
I jumped into the saddle,

1259
00:58:57,917 --> 00:58:59,919
and I started to rock...

1260
00:59:01,421 --> 00:59:02,922
and it broke.
No

1261
00:59:02,922 --> 00:59:05,425
Split in 2. The wood was rotten.

1262
00:59:05,425 --> 00:59:07,427
The whole thing was put together

1263
00:59:07,427 --> 00:59:09,429
with spit and sealing wax.

1264
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:12,932
All shine and no substance,

1265
00:59:13,433 --> 00:59:17,437
And that's how I feel about that demonstration I saw tonight, Matt--

1266
00:59:17,437 --> 00:59:18,938
All glitter and glamour.

1267
00:59:18,938 --> 00:59:20,440
You say you're giving the people hope

1268
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,941
I think you're stealing their hope.

1269
00:59:22,442 --> 00:59:23,810
Oh no, Henry --
[sighing]

1270
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,312
As long as the prerequisite for that shining paradise

1271
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:28,815
is ignorance, bigotry, and hate...

1272
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,819
I say, "the hell with it."

1273
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:37,824
[Door closing]

1274
00:59:44,797 --> 00:59:47,300
We had to keep an open mind on the origin of species.

1275
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,801
Very interesting, Howard.

1276
00:59:48,801 --> 00:59:50,303
Very interesting.

1277
00:59:51,304 --> 00:59:52,805
Now, go on, Howard

1278
00:59:52,805 --> 00:59:56,309
tell us what else Mr. Cates told you
in the classroom

1279
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:59,312
Well, he said at first

1280
00:59:59,312 --> 01:00:01,814
the earth was too hot for any kind of life.

1281
01:00:01,814 --> 01:00:03,316
then it cooled off a mite,

1282
01:00:03,316 --> 01:00:05,318
and cells and things began to grow.

1283
01:00:05,818 --> 01:00:06,819
cells

1284
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:09,322
Oh...oh!

1285
01:00:09,322 --> 01:00:10,323
Mr. McKinnon.

1286
01:00:10,323 --> 01:00:12,325
Mr. Galbraith.

1287
01:00:12,325 --> 01:00:14,827
I think you know the rest of these gentlemen.

1288
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:20,333
[Gavel pounding]

1289
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:24,704
Ahem.


1290
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:27,207
Cells, Howard.

1291
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,709
Little bugs, like in the water.

1292
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,212
then the little bugs got to be bigger bugs,

1293
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,214
and sprouted legs and crawled up on the land.

1294
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,716
How long did this take according to Mr. Cates

1295
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:40,220
Couple million years...maybe longer.

1296
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,722
Then comes the fishes and the reptiles and the mammals.

1297
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:44,224
Man's a mammal.

1298
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:46,226
Along with the dogs...

1299
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,727
and the cattle in the field

1300
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:50,230
Did he say that

1301
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,231
Yes, sir.

1302
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:54,234
Now, Howard,

1303
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,736
How does man come out of this slimy mess

1304
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,238
of bugs and serpents,

1305
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,740
according to your, uh, professor

1306
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:05,245
Well, man was sort of evoluted...

1307
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,747
from the old-world monkeys.

1308
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,749
Did you hear that, my friends

1309
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,251
old-world monkeys!

1310
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:12,252
Ha!

1311
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:13,753
According to Mr. Cates,

1312
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,255
you and I aren't even descended

1313
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,757
from good American monkeys.

1314
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,259
Now Howard, listen, carefully.

1315
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,762
in all this talk of bugs and evolution

1316
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:25,765
of slime and ooze,

1317
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,768
did Mr. Cates ever make any reference to God

1318
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:33,773
[Sighing] not as I remember.

1319
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:37,277
of the miracle he achieved in 7 days

1320
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,280
as described in the beautiful book of genesis

1321
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,281
No, sir.

1322
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:43,783
Ladies and gentlemen--

1323
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,785
Objection!

1324
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,787
I ask the court to remind the learned counsel

1325
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,789
that he is not in a Chautauqua tent.

1326
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,292
He's supposed to be submitting evidence to a jury.

1327
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,294
There are no ladies on the jury.

1328
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:58,298
Your honor...I have no intention of making a speech

1329
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,801
there is no need.

1330
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:04,804
I am sure that everyone on the jury,

1331
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,307
everyone within the sound of this boy's voice

1332
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,809
is moved by his tragic confusion.

1333
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:11,811
He has been taught

1334
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,813
that he wriggled up like an animal

1335
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,316
from the filth and muck below.

1336
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,318
I say that these bible haters,

1337
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,321
these evolutionists, are brewers of poison!

1338
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,824
and the legislature of this sovereign state

1339
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:26,326
has had the wisdom to demand

1340
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:29,329
that the peddlers of poison, in bottles or in books,

1341
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:32,832
clearly label the product they attempt to sell.

1342
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,335
I say that if this law is not upheld,

1343
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:37,337
this boy will become one of a generation

1344
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:40,340
shorn of its faith by the teachings of godless science!

1345
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,343
But, if the full penalty of the law

1346
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:45,345
is meted out to Bertram Cates,

1347
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:47,347
the faithful the whole world over

1348
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:51,351
who are watching us here and listening to our every word

1349
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:54,854
will rise up and call this courtroom blessed!

1350
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:57,857
Your witness, Sir.

1351
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:10,370
I sure am glad the colonel didn't make a speech.

1352
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,871
[Laughing]

1353
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,375
Now, Howard...

1354
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:18,378
I heard you say that the world used to get pretty hot.

1355
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,880
Well, that's what Mr. Cates said.

1356
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,882
Any hotter than it is right now, do you think

1357
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,385
Well, I guess it must have been.

1358
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:27,387
Mr. Cates read it to us from a book.

1359
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:29,889
This the book

1360
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:32,392
Charles Darwin's theory

1361
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,395
of the evolution and the descent of man

1362
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:36,896
Yes, sir.

1363
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,398
That's right, Howard.

1364
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:40,900
That's the very book

1365
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,902
He read to you in your classroom.

1366
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:45,905
Now, Howard, tell me,

1367
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:50,410
do you think there was anything wrong in that

1368
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,912
Well, I don't know

1369
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,414
Objection, your honor.

1370
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,416
The defense is asking that

1371
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,418
a 15-year-old boy hand down an opinion

1372
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,420
on a question of morality.

1373
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,922
I am trying to establish that Howard,

1374
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,924
or Col.Brady, or Charles Darwin,

1375
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:07,427
or anyone sitting in this courtroom, or you, sir,

1376
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,429
has the right to think.

1377
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,931
Col. Drummond, the right to think

1378
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,934
is not on trial here.

1379
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:17,437
Well, with all due respect to the court, sir,

1380
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:18,938
I think the right to think

1381
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:21,441
is very much on trial here...

1382
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:22,942
and it is fearfully in danger in

1383
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,444
the proceedings of this courtroom.

1384
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:25,945
A man is on trial!

1385
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,447
A thinking man!

1386
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,950
and he's faced with fine and imprisonment

1387
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,453
because he chooses to speak what he thinks.

1388
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:35,955
Col. Drummond,

1389
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:38,458
will you please, ah, rephrase your question

1390
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,961
Well now, let's put it this way, Howard--

1391
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:45,465
all this fuss and feathers about evolution--

1392
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:46,966
do you think it hurt you any

1393
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:47,967
Sir

1394
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:50,470
Did it do you any harm

1395
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,472
Still feel reasonably fit

1396
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:54,974
what Mr. Cates told you,

1397
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:58,478
Did it, ah, did it hurt your baseball game any

1398
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,980
did it affect your pitching arm

1399
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:02,482
No, sir.

1400
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:03,983
I'm a lefty.

1401
01:05:04,682 --> 01:05:06,684
A south paw, huh

1402
01:05:06,684 --> 01:05:08,686
Still honor your father and your mother

1403
01:05:08,686 --> 01:05:09,687
Sure.

1404
01:05:10,187 --> 01:05:11,689
Haven't murdered anybody since breakfast, have you

1405
01:05:11,689 --> 01:05:12,690
Objection.

1406
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:15,693
This is an absurd piece of jactitation.

1407
01:05:19,196 --> 01:05:20,197
Ahem.

1408
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,702
Counsel uses a word

1409
01:05:24,702 --> 01:05:27,204
with which, ah, the bench is not familiar.

1410
01:05:28,205 --> 01:05:29,707
Jactitation--

1411
01:05:29,707 --> 01:05:31,709
A specious or false premise.

1412
01:05:31,709 --> 01:05:33,210
in this instance,

1413
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:35,212
as to the murder of known or unknown persons.

1414
01:05:36,714 --> 01:05:38,215
Objection
Sustained.

1415
01:05:39,216 --> 01:05:40,718
Ahem.

1416
01:05:40,718 --> 01:05:43,721
Ask him if his faith in the holy scriptures has been shattered.

1417
01:05:46,223 --> 01:05:48,726
When I need your help, Col.Brady,

1418
01:05:48,726 --> 01:05:52,730
you may rest assured I shall humbly ask for it.

1419
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:56,734
Anytime, Col. Drummond, anytime.

1420
01:05:56,734 --> 01:05:58,235
He's the only man I know

1421
01:05:58,235 --> 01:05:59,737
who can strut sitting down.

1422
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,241
Now, Howard, tell me something--

1423
01:06:04,742 --> 01:06:06,744
did you believe everything Mr. Cates told you

1424
01:06:07,745 --> 01:06:09,246
I'm not sure.

1425
01:06:09,747 --> 01:06:10,748
I gotta think about it.

1426
01:06:10,748 --> 01:06:12,249
Good for you.
Good for you.

1427
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:16,754
Now, uh, uh, your Pa's a farmer, isn't he

1428
01:06:17,254 --> 01:06:17,755
Yes, sir.

1429
01:06:17,755 --> 01:06:19,256
Got a tractor

1430
01:06:19,256 --> 01:06:20,257
Brand-new one.

1431
01:06:20,257 --> 01:06:22,760
You think there's anything sinful about a tractor

1432
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,762
because it isn't mentioned in the bible

1433
01:06:25,262 --> 01:06:26,263
No.

1434
01:06:26,263 --> 01:06:28,766
You know, Moses never made a phone call.

1435
01:06:29,266 --> 01:06:30,768
You figure that makes the telephone

1436
01:06:31,268 --> 01:06:33,771
an instrument of the devil

1437
01:06:33,771 --> 01:06:34,772
I never thought of it that way.

1438
01:06:35,272 --> 01:06:37,274
Neither did anybody else!

1439
01:06:37,775 --> 01:06:40,277
Your honor, the defense makes the same old error

1440
01:06:40,277 --> 01:06:42,279
of all godless men--

1441
01:06:42,279 --> 01:06:44,281
he confuses material things

1442
01:06:44,281 --> 01:06:48,285
with the great spiritual value of the revealed word.

1443
01:06:48,285 --> 01:06:50,287
Why do you bewilder this child

1444
01:06:50,287 --> 01:06:53,173
Does right have no meaning to you, sir

1445
01:06:53,173 --> 01:06:56,176
Realizing that I may prejudice the case of my client,

1446
01:06:56,677 --> 01:06:57,678
I must tell you

1447
01:06:57,678 --> 01:07:00,681
that right has no meaning for me whatsoever.

1448
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:02,182
[Murmuring]

1449
01:07:05,435 --> 01:07:08,555
But truth has meaning...as a direction!

1450
01:07:10,557 --> 01:07:12,559
But...

1451
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:16,563
it is one of the peculiar imbecilities of our time

1452
01:07:16,563 --> 01:07:20,567
that we place a grid of morality upon human behavior

1453
01:07:20,567 --> 01:07:23,070
so that the action of every man

1454
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:25,072
must be measured against a...

1455
01:07:25,072 --> 01:07:27,074
an arbitrary latitude of right

1456
01:07:27,074 --> 01:07:28,575
and a longitude of wrong

1457
01:07:29,076 --> 01:07:33,080
in exact minutes, degrees, and seconds, so...

1458
01:07:39,086 --> 01:07:41,088
Howard, do you know what the heck...

1459
01:07:41,088 --> 01:07:43,090
do you understand what I'm talking about

1460
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:44,591
No, sir.

1461
01:07:46,093 --> 01:07:48,095
Maybe someday you will.

1462
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,096
That's all, son.

1463
01:07:49,096 --> 01:07:50,597
Thank you. you're excused.

1464
01:07:50,597 --> 01:07:52,599
This boy may not
understand, but I do.

1465
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:54,601
I've seen what you can do to a jury--

1466
01:07:54,601 --> 01:07:56,103
twist and tangle them.

1467
01:07:56,103 --> 01:07:58,105
Nobody's forgotten the Endicott publishing case,

1468
01:07:58,105 --> 01:08:01,108
where you made the jury believe the obscenity was in their own minds

1469
01:08:01,108 --> 01:08:02,609
It was immoral, what you did to the jury.

1470
01:08:02,609 --> 01:08:04,611
tricking them, judgment by confusion.

1471
01:08:04,611 --> 01:08:06,113
you think you can get away with it here

1472
01:08:06,613 --> 01:08:09,116
I'm not trying to get away with anything!

1473
01:08:09,116 --> 01:08:11,618
I am simply trying to prevent the clock-stoppers

1474
01:08:11,618 --> 01:08:14,121
from dumping a lot of medieval nonsense

1475
01:08:14,121 --> 01:08:17,291
into the United States constitution.

1476
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:19,293
this is not a federal court, Col. Drummond.

1477
01:08:19,293 --> 01:08:21,295
Well, damn it, you have to start from somewhere!

1478
01:08:21,295 --> 01:08:23,297
Your honor, it's obvious what he's trying to do--

1479
01:08:23,297 --> 01:08:25,299
he is trying to make us forget the lawbreaker

1480
01:08:25,299 --> 01:08:27,301
and put the law on trial

1481
01:08:27,301 --> 01:08:29,803
Well, we have the answer for you in our next witness.

1482
01:08:30,304 --> 01:08:32,689
Call miss Rachel Brown to the stand.

1483
01:08:32,689 --> 01:08:34,191
[Bailiff] Rachel Brown!

1484
01:08:34,191 --> 01:08:37,194
[Clerk] Rachel Brown, come to the stand, please!

1485
01:08:38,195 --> 01:08:40,697
Did you know about this

1486
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:43,200
He didn't, but we should have.

1487
01:08:45,202 --> 01:08:46,203
Rach

1488
01:08:48,705 --> 01:08:50,207
Rach, what did you tell him

1489
01:08:50,207 --> 01:08:52,209
Take it easy, son.

1490
01:09:00,217 --> 01:09:01,218
Sit down, Samson.

1491
01:09:01,218 --> 01:09:03,220
You're about to get a haircut.

1492
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,722
Rachel, do you solemnly swear

1493
01:09:05,722 --> 01:09:07,224
the testimony you're about to give

1494
01:09:07,724 --> 01:09:10,227
is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

1495
01:09:10,227 --> 01:09:11,228
so help you God

1496
01:09:11,728 --> 01:09:12,729
I do.

1497
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:14,731
Now, my dear,

1498
01:09:15,232 --> 01:09:16,733
I just want you to repeat

1499
01:09:16,733 --> 01:09:18,735
some of the things you told me last night.

1500
01:09:19,236 --> 01:09:21,238
Please, Mr. Brady...

1501
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:24,241
Rachel, didn't you say you wanted the people here to understand

1502
01:09:24,241 --> 01:09:26,243
Yes. 
Then just answer my question.

1503
01:09:27,244 --> 01:09:28,745
Now, Miss Brown,

1504
01:09:28,745 --> 01:09:31,748
you are an old friend of the efendant, Bertram Cates

1505
01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:35,252
We're...we're engaged to be married.

1506
01:09:35,252 --> 01:09:37,254
Do you and Mr. Cates attend the same church

1507
01:09:37,254 --> 01:09:39,756
Yes...we did.

1508
01:09:40,257 --> 01:09:41,758
Do you now

1509
01:09:42,259 --> 01:09:43,260
What?

1510
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:44,761
Attend the same church

1511
01:09:46,263 --> 01:09:47,264
No.

1512
01:09:47,764 --> 01:09:49,766
Did Mr. Cates leave the church

1513
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:52,269
No, not really.

1514
01:09:52,769 --> 01:09:53,770
Not the spirit of it.

1515
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:56,273
But the body of it, correct

1516
01:09:56,273 --> 01:09:58,775
Mr. Cates left the church

1517
01:09:58,775 --> 01:10:01,278
you and he once attended together

1518
01:10:01,278 --> 01:10:02,279
Yes.
Why

1519
01:10:04,781 --> 01:10:05,782
Because of the Stebbins boy.

1520
01:10:06,283 --> 01:10:08,285
The Stebbins boy.

1521
01:10:08,285 --> 01:10:10,287
Would you tell us about that, please

1522
01:10:10,787 --> 01:10:12,656
It was 2 summers ago.

1523
01:10:13,156 --> 01:10:16,159
The little Stebbins boy was 13 years old.

1524
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:18,161
He was one of Bert's students.

1525
01:10:18,662 --> 01:10:20,664
He lived right next door to the boarding house,

1526
01:10:20,664 --> 01:10:21,665
and he used to come over

1527
01:10:22,165 --> 01:10:24,801
And look through
Bert's microscope.

1528
01:10:24,801 --> 01:10:27,304
Bert said the boy had a bright mind

1529
01:10:27,304 --> 01:10:29,806
and--and he might even be a scientist when he grew up.

1530
01:10:30,307 --> 01:10:31,308
Yes

1531
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:36,813
He--he went to the river with the other boys a-and went swimming.

1532
01:10:38,065 --> 01:10:39,566
He...

1533
01:10:39,566 --> 01:10:42,069
he got a cramp... 
and drowned.

1534
01:10:45,689 --> 01:10:46,690
Go on.

1535
01:10:48,692 --> 01:10:50,694
At the funeral,

1536
01:10:50,694 --> 01:10:54,197
Pa preached that tommy didn't die in a state of grace

1537
01:10:54,197 --> 01:10:57,200
because... because his father wouldn't allow him

1538
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,702
to be baptized.

1539
01:10:58,702 --> 01:11:00,704
Tell him what your father really said,

1540
01:11:00,704 --> 01:11:03,206
that tommy's soul was damned, writhing in hellfire!

1541
01:11:03,206 --> 01:11:06,093
Cates, you sinner!

1542
01:11:06,093 --> 01:11:08,095
Religion's supposed to comfort people,

1543
01:11:08,095 --> 01:11:10,097
Not frighten them to death!

1544
01:11:10,097 --> 01:11:11,098
[Crowd murmuring]

1545
01:11:11,598 --> 01:11:13,100
[Gavel pounding]

1546
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,601
We will have order, please.

1547
01:11:14,601 --> 01:11:16,103
Now, sit down, Bert.

1548
01:11:16,103 --> 01:11:17,104
Don't you see

1549
01:11:17,104 --> 01:11:18,605
Bert thought it wasn't fair

1550
01:11:18,605 --> 01:11:21,108
that a little child couldn't go to heaven!

1551
01:11:21,608 --> 01:11:24,111
It wasn't God he abandoned, only the church!

1552
01:11:24,111 --> 01:11:25,112
Very well, my dear. It is true, then,

1553
01:11:25,612 --> 01:11:28,115
that because of what happened to the Stebbins boy,

1554
01:11:28,115 --> 01:11:30,117
Bert Cates left the church!

1555
01:11:31,118 --> 01:11:32,619
We've said nothing wrong.

1556
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,122
We are merely beginning to gain some insight

1557
01:11:35,122 --> 01:11:38,875
into the experiences that sometimes will lead a young man astray.

1558
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:40,377
Objection!

1559
01:11:40,377 --> 01:11:41,878
Whether my client went astray

1560
01:11:42,379 --> 01:11:43,880
is a Matter of interpretation.

1561
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,382
Strike it from the record.

1562
01:11:45,382 --> 01:11:46,383
Objection sustained.

1563
01:11:46,883 --> 01:11:47,884
The jury is directed

1564
01:11:47,884 --> 01:11:50,387
to disregard the remarks of counsel.

1565
01:11:50,387 --> 01:11:52,389
Very well.

1566
01:11:52,389 --> 01:11:54,891
Now, my dear, will you tell the jury

1567
01:11:54,891 --> 01:11:56,893
some more of Mr. Cates' opinions

1568
01:11:56,893 --> 01:11:58,645
on the subject of religion

1569
01:11:58,645 --> 01:12:00,647
Objection!

1570
01:12:00,647 --> 01:12:02,649
Hearsay evidence is not admissible.

1571
01:12:02,649 --> 01:12:05,652
The court sees no objection to this line of questioning.

1572
01:12:05,652 --> 01:12:07,154
Proceed, Col. Brady.

1573
01:12:07,154 --> 01:12:09,656
Just repeat, in your own words, some of the conversations

1574
01:12:09,656 --> 01:12:11,658
you had with the defendant.

1575
01:12:11,658 --> 01:12:13,160
Rachel, you can't.

1576
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,661
The things I said to you

1577
01:12:14,661 --> 01:12:16,663
were questions-- questions you ask your own heart.

1578
01:12:16,663 --> 01:12:18,665
If you say those things out loud,

1579
01:12:18,665 --> 01:12:20,167
he'll make them sound like answers.

1580
01:12:20,167 --> 01:12:21,168
I--I can't.

1581
01:12:21,668 --> 01:12:24,171
You won't hurt him, Rachel. This
is for his good.

1582
01:12:24,171 --> 01:12:25,672
Speak up.

1583
01:12:25,672 --> 01:12:27,674
Mr. Brady, I confided in you--

1584
01:12:27,674 --> 01:12:30,177
Well, we're here to serve the truth, Rachel, only the truth.

1585
01:12:31,178 --> 01:12:33,680
I can't remember.

1586
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:36,183
Rachel, you are testifying under oath.

1587
01:12:36,683 --> 01:12:39,686
It is unlawful to withhold pertinent information.

1588
01:12:39,686 --> 01:12:42,189
Describe to the court your innermost feelings

1589
01:12:42,189 --> 01:12:44,191
when Bert Cates said to you,

1590
01:12:44,191 --> 01:12:47,694
"God did not create man. Man created god."

1591
01:12:47,694 --> 01:12:49,196
Bert didn't say that!

1592
01:12:49,696 --> 01:12:50,697
He was just bitter

1593
01:12:50,697 --> 01:12:52,699
because of the little Stebbins boy!

1594
01:12:52,699 --> 01:12:54,701
He said man created a vengeful god

1595
01:12:54,701 --> 01:12:56,203
out of his own bigotry

1596
01:12:56,203 --> 01:12:57,704
and the devil out of his own hell!

1597
01:12:58,205 --> 01:13:00,207
And when he wondered what's on the other side of the moon,

1598
01:13:00,707 --> 01:13:03,210
did he ever mention the possibility of heaven did he

1599
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:05,212
or did he say there was nothing

1600
01:13:05,212 --> 01:13:08,215
but a world of stars, moons, galaxies, and universal dust

1601
01:13:08,215 --> 01:13:09,716
Tell us, tell us some more.

1602
01:13:09,716 --> 01:13:11,718
What'd he say about the holy state of matrimony

1603
01:13:11,718 --> 01:13:13,220
Did he compare it to animal breeding

1604
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:14,721
[Drummond] Objection!

1605
01:13:14,721 --> 01:13:17,224
You want the good people of this town

1606
01:13:17,224 --> 01:13:18,725
to see what happened to his brain

1607
01:13:18,725 --> 01:13:21,228
so they can help bring him back to his senses, don't ya

1608
01:13:21,228 --> 01:13:24,231
Tell it! Tell it all!
Tell it! Tell it! Tell it!

1609
01:13:24,231 --> 01:13:25,232
Matt!

1610
01:13:26,233 --> 01:13:27,234
[Sobbing]

1611
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,741
Under the circumstances...

1612
01:13:36,743 --> 01:13:39,746
I believe the witness... should be excused.

1613
01:13:46,253 --> 01:13:48,255
Col. Drummond, do you have any objection

1614
01:13:48,255 --> 01:13:49,756
to excusing the witness

1615
01:13:49,756 --> 01:13:52,259
from cross- examination at this time,

1616
01:13:52,259 --> 01:13:54,010
subject to later recall

1617
01:13:54,511 --> 01:13:56,513
Well, your honor, the defense must have a chance

1618
01:13:56,513 --> 01:13:58,014
to challenge the words

1619
01:13:58,014 --> 01:14:00,517
put into the mouth of the witness by the prosecutor.

1620
01:14:01,518 --> 01:14:03,019
Don't plague her. Let her go.

1621
01:14:04,521 --> 01:14:07,023
Uh, may I have a moment

1622
01:14:07,023 --> 01:14:09,526
Do you want every word he just put in her mouth

1623
01:14:10,026 --> 01:14:11,027
to go in to the record

1624
01:14:11,027 --> 01:14:13,029
It's not that important.

1625
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:15,532
Not th-- he just pulled you apart like a plucked chicken.

1626
01:14:16,032 --> 01:14:17,534
Please, do as I say. You've got to.

1627
01:14:17,534 --> 01:14:18,535
I've got to what

1628
01:14:18,535 --> 01:14:20,036
send you to jail

1629
01:14:20,036 --> 01:14:21,037
Let her go.

1630
01:14:21,538 --> 01:14:23,039
You all-American idiot,

1631
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:25,542
She just handed them your head on a silver platter.

1632
01:14:25,542 --> 01:14:27,043
Damn it, stay out of this!

1633
01:14:27,043 --> 01:14:29,045
It's none of your business.

1634
01:14:29,045 --> 01:14:31,047
Don't tie my hands, son.

1635
01:14:32,549 --> 01:14:35,051
Let her go, or I'll change my plea to guilty.

1636
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,060
No questions.

1637
01:14:47,047 --> 01:14:50,550
For the time being, the witness is excused.

1638
01:15:03,563 --> 01:15:05,565
May I have your autograph

1639
01:15:09,569 --> 01:15:12,572
[Judge] Does the, uh, prosecution wish to call any further witnesses

1640
01:15:14,574 --> 01:15:16,576
Not, uh, not at the present time, your honor.

1641
01:15:16,576 --> 01:15:18,328
The prosecution rests.

1642
01:15:18,328 --> 01:15:20,830
We shall proceed with the case for the defense,

1643
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:22,832
Col. Drummond.

1644
01:15:22,832 --> 01:15:25,335
I'd like to call Dr. Amos Keller...

1645
01:15:26,336 --> 01:15:28,338
the head of the department of zoology

1646
01:15:28,338 --> 01:15:29,339
at the University of Chicago.

1647
01:15:29,339 --> 01:15:30,840
Objection!

1648
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,342
On what grounds

1649
01:15:32,342 --> 01:15:35,345
I wish to inquire what possible relevance

1650
01:15:35,345 --> 01:15:37,847
the testimony of a zoology professor

1651
01:15:37,847 --> 01:15:39,349
can have in this trial

1652
01:15:39,349 --> 01:15:41,351
Why, it has every relevance.

1653
01:15:41,351 --> 01:15:44,354
My client is on trial for teaching evolution.

1654
01:15:44,354 --> 01:15:45,855
Certainly any testimony relating to

1655
01:15:45,855 --> 01:15:47,857
his so-called infringement of the law

1656
01:15:47,857 --> 01:15:48,858
must be admitted.

1657
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:51,361
Irrelevant, immaterial, inadmissible.

1658
01:15:51,361 --> 01:15:52,862
But why

1659
01:15:52,862 --> 01:15:55,365
if Bertram Cates were on trial for murder,

1660
01:15:55,365 --> 01:15:57,367
would it be irrelevant to call in witnesses

1661
01:15:57,367 --> 01:15:58,868
to examine the weapon

1662
01:15:58,868 --> 01:16:00,370
would it rule out testimony

1663
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:02,372
that the so-called murder weapon

1664
01:16:02,372 --> 01:16:04,374
was incapable of firing a bullet

1665
01:16:04,374 --> 01:16:07,877
I fail to grasp, ah, the learned counsel's meaning.

1666
01:16:07,877 --> 01:16:08,878
Oh.

1667
01:16:09,879 --> 01:16:11,881
Uh, well, your honor,

1668
01:16:12,382 --> 01:16:14,884
The defense wishes to place Dr. Keller on the stand

1669
01:16:15,385 --> 01:16:18,888
so that he can explain to the gentlemen of the jury

1670
01:16:18,888 --> 01:16:22,392
ah, the exact meaning of the theory of evolution.

1671
01:16:22,392 --> 01:16:25,395
How can they pass judgment if they don't know what it's all about

1672
01:16:25,395 --> 01:16:27,897
I hold that the very law we're here to enforce

1673
01:16:27,897 --> 01:16:30,400
excludes such testimony!

1674
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,402
The people of this state have made it very clear

1675
01:16:32,902 --> 01:16:35,405
that they do not want this zoological hogwash

1676
01:16:35,405 --> 01:16:37,407
slopping around the schoolrooms,

1677
01:16:37,407 --> 01:16:40,910
and I refuse to allow these agnostic scientists

1678
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:43,913
to employ this courtroom as a sounding board

1679
01:16:43,913 --> 01:16:45,415
as a platform

1680
01:16:45,415 --> 01:16:46,416
from which they can shout their heresies

1681
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:47,917
into the headlines

1682
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,422
Col. Drummond,

1683
01:16:52,422 --> 01:16:55,925
the bench rules that zoology is irrelevant to the case.

1684
01:16:56,676 --> 01:16:58,678
Agnostic scientists

1685
01:17:03,683 --> 01:17:04,684
Ahem.

1686
01:17:05,185 --> 01:17:07,187
I call Dr. Allen Page,

1687
01:17:07,687 --> 01:17:09,689
deacon of the congregational church

1688
01:17:09,689 --> 01:17:11,691
and professor of geology and archaeology

1689
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:12,692
at Oberlin College.

1690
01:17:12,692 --> 01:17:13,693
Objection.

1691
01:17:13,693 --> 01:17:16,696
Objection sustained.

1692
01:17:16,696 --> 01:17:18,698
Uh, does your honor deny in one breath

1693
01:17:18,698 --> 01:17:23,086
The existence of zoology, geology and archaeology

1694
01:17:23,086 --> 01:17:26,089
we do not deny the existence of these sciences,

1695
01:17:26,089 --> 01:17:29,209
but they do not relate to this point of law.

1696
01:17:34,214 --> 01:17:35,715
[Sighing]

1697
01:17:36,716 --> 01:17:38,218
I call Walter Aaronson,

1698
01:17:38,718 --> 01:17:41,221
anthropologist, philosopher, author,

1699
01:17:41,221 --> 01:17:44,224
and one of the most brilliant minds in the world today. Any objection

1700
01:17:44,724 --> 01:17:45,725
Objection!

1701
01:17:46,226 --> 01:17:48,228
Your honor, the defense has brought to Hillsboro,

1702
01:17:48,228 --> 01:17:52,232
at great expense and great inconvenience, 6 noted scientists.

1703
01:17:52,232 --> 01:17:54,234
their testimony is basic

1704
01:17:54,234 --> 01:17:56,236
to the defense of my client...

1705
01:17:57,737 --> 01:17:59,239
for I intend to show this court

1706
01:17:59,239 --> 01:18:02,742
that what Bertram Cates spoke quietly one spring morning

1707
01:18:02,742 --> 01:18:05,745
in the Hillsboro high school is no crime.

1708
01:18:05,745 --> 01:18:08,248
It is incontrovertible as geometry

1709
01:18:08,248 --> 01:18:11,251
to any enlightened community of minds.

1710
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:12,752
in this community, Col. Drummond,

1711
01:18:13,253 --> 01:18:14,754
and in this sovereign state,

1712
01:18:14,754 --> 01:18:16,756
exactly the opposite is the case.

1713
01:18:16,756 --> 01:18:18,758
The language of the law is clear, your honor.

1714
01:18:18,758 --> 01:18:20,260
We do not need experts

1715
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:22,762
to question the validity of a law already on the books.

1716
01:18:22,762 --> 01:18:26,266
Well, what do you need a gallows to hang him from.

1717
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:28,768
That remark is an insult to this entire community.

1718
01:18:28,768 --> 01:18:31,771
And this community is an insult to the world!

1719
01:18:31,771 --> 01:18:34,274
[Crowd murmuring]

1720
01:18:34,274 --> 01:18:37,277
Your honor, I request permission to withdraw from this case.

1721
01:18:38,278 --> 01:18:40,280
Mr. Drummond, you can't quit now!

1722
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,282
Why not you were ready to 5 minutes ago!

1723
01:18:43,917 --> 01:18:44,918
Col. Drummond,

1724
01:18:45,418 --> 01:18:47,921
What reasons canyou possibly have

1725
01:18:47,921 --> 01:18:50,924
Well, there are 200 of them!

1726
01:18:50,924 --> 01:18:53,426
And if that's not enough, there's one more--

1727
01:18:53,426 --> 01:18:57,430
I think my client has already been found guilty.

1728
01:18:57,430 --> 01:19:02,435
Is Mr. Drummond saying that this expression of an honest emotion

1729
01:19:02,435 --> 01:19:03,937
will in any way influence

1730
01:19:04,437 --> 01:19:06,439
the court's impartial
administration of the law

1731
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:10,944
I say that you cannot administer
a wicked law impartially.

1732
01:19:10,944 --> 01:19:13,446
You can only destroy.
You can only punish.

1733
01:19:13,446 --> 01:19:14,697
And I warn you

1734
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:16,699
that a wicked law, like cholera,

1735
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,202
destroys everyone it touches,

1736
01:19:19,202 --> 01:19:21,204
its upholders as well as its defiers.

1737
01:19:21,704 --> 01:19:22,705
[Judge] Col. Drummond--

1738
01:19:22,705 --> 01:19:25,208
Can't you understand...

1739
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:27,210
that if you take a law like evolution

1740
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:29,712
and you make it a crime to
teach it in the public schools,

1741
01:19:29,712 --> 01:19:31,214
tomorrow you can make it a crime

1742
01:19:31,714 --> 01:19:33,216
to teach it in the private schools

1743
01:19:33,716 --> 01:19:36,219
and tomorrow you may make it a 
crime to read about it

1744
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:39,722
and soon you may ban
books and newspapers.

1745
01:19:39,722 --> 01:19:42,725
and then you may turn
catholic against protestant

1746
01:19:43,226 --> 01:19:45,228
and protestant against protestant

1747
01:19:45,228 --> 01:19:47,230
and try to foist your own religion

1748
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:48,731
upon the mind of man!

1749
01:19:48,731 --> 01:19:50,733
If you can do one, you can do the other!

1750
01:19:50,733 --> 01:19:54,737
Because fanaticism and ignorance
is forever busy

1751
01:19:55,238 --> 01:19:56,739
and needs feeding.

1752
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:59,742
and soon, your honor...

1753
01:20:00,743 --> 01:20:05,248
with banners flying and with drums beating,

1754
01:20:05,248 --> 01:20:09,752
we'll be marching backward! 
Backward!

1755
01:20:09,752 --> 01:20:13,756
Through the glorious ages of that 16th century

1756
01:20:13,756 --> 01:20:16,759
when bigots burned the man who dared bring

1757
01:20:16,759 --> 01:20:19,762
enlightenment and intelligence to the human mind.

1758
01:20:22,632 --> 01:20:25,134
I hope counsel does not mean to imply

1759
01:20:25,134 --> 01:20:26,636
that this court is bigoted.

1760
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:29,138
Well, your honor has the right to hope.

1761
01:20:29,138 --> 01:20:31,140
I have the right to do more than that.

1762
01:20:31,641 --> 01:20:33,643
You have the power to do more than that!

1763
01:20:33,643 --> 01:20:36,145
And I exercise that power.

1764
01:20:36,145 --> 01:20:38,147
Col. Drummond, I order you to show cause

1765
01:20:38,147 --> 01:20:39,649
tomorrow morning at 10:00

1766
01:20:39,649 --> 01:20:42,285
Why you should not be held in contempt
of this court.

1767
01:20:42,285 --> 01:20:43,786
And in the meanwhile, I order that you be held

1768
01:20:44,287 --> 01:20:45,788
in custody of the bailiff.

1769
01:20:46,289 --> 01:20:48,291
bail is fixed at $2,000.

1770
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:49,792
$2,000--

1771
01:20:51,294 --> 01:20:53,046
Why don't you make it $4,000

1772
01:20:54,047 --> 01:20:55,915
It's $4,000, Col. Drummond.

1773
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:59,419
Your honor, my paper will post the bond.

1774
01:20:59,419 --> 01:21:01,421
Can you prove legal authorization

1775
01:21:01,421 --> 01:21:04,424
to make such a commitment for your employer

1776
01:21:04,424 --> 01:21:06,426
Well, I'll wire my paper immediately.

1777
01:21:06,926 --> 01:21:08,428
Fine. Until then,

1778
01:21:08,428 --> 01:21:10,430
Col. Drummond can avail himself

1779
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:12,815
of our municipal accommodations.

1780
01:21:12,815 --> 01:21:14,317
[Crowd murmuring]

1781
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,821
Your honor

1782
01:21:18,821 --> 01:21:20,823
your honor, sir

1783
01:21:20,823 --> 01:21:23,826
I'll put up my farm for Mr. Drummond.

1784
01:21:23,826 --> 01:21:25,328
[Judge] We have no way of ascertaining

1785
01:21:25,328 --> 01:21:27,330
the value of your farm, sir.

1786
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:29,449
it ought to be worth that much.

1787
01:21:29,949 --> 01:21:33,453
The law demands that bond be posted in cash.

1788
01:21:33,453 --> 01:21:36,456
Your honor, my bank will honor the offer

1789
01:21:36,956 --> 01:21:38,958
on the security of this farm.

1790
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:41,961
He has considerably more equity in it than that.

1791
01:21:42,462 --> 01:21:43,463
Ahem.

1792
01:21:44,964 --> 01:21:46,349
Very well.

1793
01:21:46,349 --> 01:21:48,351
you can make arrangements with the court clerk.

1794
01:21:51,354 --> 01:21:52,855
Who are you

1795
01:21:52,855 --> 01:21:55,358
my name is John Stebbins.

1796
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,361
[Judge] Court will adjourn

1797
01:21:58,861 --> 01:22:00,863
and reconvene at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

1798
01:22:08,738 --> 01:22:10,740
We'll hang Bert Cates

1799
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:13,242
to a sour apple tree

1800
01:22:13,242 --> 01:22:15,244
We'll hang Bert Cates

1801
01:22:15,745 --> 01:22:17,747
to a sour apple tree

1802
01:22:17,747 --> 01:22:19,749
We'll hang Bert Cates

1803
01:22:20,249 --> 01:22:22,251
to a sour apple tree

1804
01:22:22,251 --> 01:22:26,756
Our god is marching on

1805
01:22:27,757 --> 01:22:31,260
glory, glory hallelujah

1806
01:22:32,261 --> 01:22:34,263
glory, glory hallelujah...

1807
01:22:38,768 --> 01:22:40,770
She'll sleep all right tonight.

1808
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:43,773
Give her these pills tomorrow

1809
01:22:43,773 --> 01:22:45,775
and keep her in bed.

1810
01:22:48,277 --> 01:22:49,779
Thank you, John.

1811
01:22:54,283 --> 01:22:55,785
Rachel

1812
01:22:58,287 --> 01:22:59,789
Rachel

1813
01:23:04,794 --> 01:23:06,796
We'll hang Bert Cates

1814
01:23:07,296 --> 01:23:09,298
to a sour apple tree

1815
01:23:09,298 --> 01:23:13,803
our god is marching on

1816
01:23:14,554 --> 01:23:19,058
glory, glory hallelujah

1817
01:23:19,058 --> 01:23:23,563
glory, glory hallelujah

1818
01:23:23,563 --> 01:23:27,817
glory, glory hallelujah

1819
01:23:27,817 --> 01:23:32,321
His truth is marching on

1820
01:23:32,321 --> 01:23:34,824
We'll hang Bert Cates

1821
01:23:34,824 --> 01:23:37,326
to a sour apple tree

1822
01:23:37,326 --> 01:23:39,462
We'll hang Bert Cates

1823
01:23:39,462 --> 01:23:41,964
to a sour apple tree

1824
01:23:41,964 --> 01:23:43,966
We'll hang Bert Cates

1825
01:23:44,467 --> 01:23:46,469
to a sour apple tree

1826
01:23:46,469 --> 01:23:51,090
our god is marching on

1827
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:53,593
We'll hang Henry Drummond

1828
01:23:53,593 --> 01:23:56,095
to a sour apple tree

1829
01:23:56,095 --> 01:23:58,598
We'll hang Henry Drummond

1830
01:23:58,598 --> 01:24:00,600
to a sour apple tree

1831
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,102
We'll hang Henry Drummond

1832
01:24:03,102 --> 01:24:05,605
to a sour apple tree

1833
01:24:05,605 --> 01:24:07,106
Our god is...

1834
01:24:08,491 --> 01:24:09,992
[Knocking at door]

1835
01:24:10,993 --> 01:24:15,498
glory, glory hallelujah

1836
01:24:15,498 --> 01:24:20,002
glory, glory hallelujah

1837
01:24:20,002 --> 01:24:24,006
glory, glory hallelujah

1838
01:24:24,006 --> 01:24:28,010
His truth is marching on...

1839
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:29,011
trick or treat.

1840
01:24:29,512 --> 01:24:31,514
Oh, for Pete's sake.

1841
01:24:32,014 --> 01:24:34,016
Hooligans of the world, unite!

1842
01:24:35,518 --> 01:24:37,019
You've got nothing to burn

1843
01:24:37,019 --> 01:24:39,021
but your intellectuals.

1844
01:24:39,021 --> 01:24:42,024
Well, those are the boobs that make our laws.

1845
01:24:42,024 --> 01:24:44,026
It's a democratic process.

1846
01:24:44,527 --> 01:24:47,029
Well, I suppos e you have something better to suggest.

1847
01:24:47,029 --> 01:24:49,031
We'll hang Henry Drummond

1848
01:24:49,031 --> 01:24:51,651
to a sour apple tree...

1849
01:24:52,652 --> 01:24:54,153
Looks like you're going out

1850
01:24:54,153 --> 01:24:56,656
in a blaze of glory, counselor.

1851
01:24:58,157 --> 01:24:59,659
Well...

1852
01:24:59,659 --> 01:25:01,160
you were pretty impressive

1853
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,663
for a while there today, Henry.

1854
01:25:03,663 --> 01:25:06,165
"your honor, after a while

1855
01:25:06,165 --> 01:25:08,167
you'll be setting" man against man,

1856
01:25:08,668 --> 01:25:11,170
"creed against creed, et cetera, et cetera,

1857
01:25:11,671 --> 01:25:13,172
ad nauseam."

1858
01:25:13,172 --> 01:25:15,675
Aw, Henry, why don't you wake up

1859
01:25:16,175 --> 01:25:17,677
Darwin was wrong.

1860
01:25:17,677 --> 01:25:19,679
man's still an ape,

1861
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:22,682
and his creed's still a totem pole

1862
01:25:22,682 --> 01:25:24,684
when he first achieved
the upright position,

1863
01:25:24,684 --> 01:25:26,185
he took a look at the stars--

1864
01:25:26,185 --> 01:25:28,187
thought they were something to eat.

1865
01:25:28,688 --> 01:25:29,689
When he couldn't reach them,

1866
01:25:29,689 --> 01:25:31,190
he decided they were groceries

1867
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:33,192
belonging to a bigger creature.

1868
01:25:34,694 --> 01:25:37,196
that's how Jehovah was born.

1869
01:25:37,196 --> 01:25:39,699
I wish I had your worm's-eye view of history.

1870
01:25:40,199 --> 01:25:42,201
It would certainly make things a lot easier.

1871
01:25:42,201 --> 01:25:44,704
Oh-oh, no! Not for you!

1872
01:25:44,704 --> 01:25:47,206
No, no, you--you'd still be spending your time

1873
01:25:47,206 --> 01:25:48,207
trying to make sense

1874
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:50,209
out of what is laughingly referred to

1875
01:25:50,209 --> 01:25:52,211
as the human race.

1876
01:25:52,211 --> 01:25:54,714
Why don't you take your blinders off

1877
01:25:55,214 --> 01:25:57,717
Don't you know the future's already obsolete

1878
01:25:57,717 --> 01:26:00,720
You think man still has a noble destiny.

1879
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,222
Well, I tell you, he's already started

1880
01:26:03,222 --> 01:26:04,724
on his backward march

1881
01:26:04,724 --> 01:26:07,727
to the salt and stupid sea from which he came.

1882
01:26:07,727 --> 01:26:09,729
What about men like Bert Cates

1883
01:26:11,230 --> 01:26:12,231
Cates

1884
01:26:14,734 --> 01:26:17,236
The monkey who tried to fly

1885
01:26:17,236 --> 01:26:19,238
Cates climbed to the top of the totem pole

1886
01:26:19,238 --> 01:26:21,240
but...then he jumped,

1887
01:26:22,241 --> 01:26:24,744
and there was nobody there to catch him--

1888
01:26:24,744 --> 01:26:26,245
not even you.

1889
01:26:26,245 --> 01:26:27,246
You were there.

1890
01:26:27,246 --> 01:26:30,249
You saw what they did to my witnesses.

1891
01:26:30,249 --> 01:26:32,251
What you need is a drink.

1892
01:26:32,251 --> 01:26:34,253
What I need is a miracle.

1893
01:26:34,253 --> 01:26:35,755
A miracle

1894
01:26:35,755 --> 01:26:37,757
Here's a whole bagful--

1895
01:26:39,258 --> 01:26:41,761
courtesy Matthew Harrison Brady.

1896
01:27:15,294 --> 01:27:16,796
Your honor...

1897
01:27:24,303 --> 01:27:25,304
Your honor, I, uh...

1898
01:27:25,805 --> 01:27:26,806
I feel I owe you an apology.

1899
01:27:26,806 --> 01:27:29,308
Any remarks leading up to the contempt citation

1900
01:27:29,308 --> 01:27:30,309
I regret very much.

1901
01:27:30,309 --> 01:27:32,812
I realize your honor is trying to be fair and

1902
01:27:34,313 --> 01:27:36,816
I, uh... I'm very sorry for any remarks

1903
01:27:36,816 --> 01:27:38,818
that were made in the heat of the moment.

1904
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:42,321
My friends...

1905
01:27:42,321 --> 01:27:43,823
Col. Drummond...

1906
01:27:43,823 --> 01:27:45,825
the man that I believe came into the world

1907
01:27:45,825 --> 01:27:47,827
to save mankind from sin

1908
01:27:47,827 --> 01:27:50,830
taught that it was godly to forgive.

1909
01:27:51,330 --> 01:27:52,965
I believe in those principles.

1910
01:27:52,965 --> 01:27:55,468
I accept Col. Drummond's apology.

1911
01:27:55,468 --> 01:27:57,970
I withdraw the contempt citation.

1912
01:27:57,970 --> 01:27:58,971
Thank you, your honor.

1913
01:27:58,971 --> 01:27:59,972
I, too, should like to add

1914
01:27:59,972 --> 01:28:01,474
that in the spirit of forgiveness,

1915
01:28:01,974 --> 01:28:03,976
I feel no animosity toward learned counsel

1916
01:28:03,976 --> 01:28:05,478
from Chicago.

1917
01:28:05,478 --> 01:28:08,481
He is well known to have ridden hobbyhorses before

1918
01:28:08,981 --> 01:28:09,982
perhaps he'll return to his home

1919
01:28:09,982 --> 01:28:11,484
having learned a lesson.

1920
01:28:11,484 --> 01:28:12,985
We commend him to learn in his heart

1921
01:28:12,985 --> 01:28:14,487
the words of him who said,

1922
01:28:14,487 --> 01:28:16,489
"if you thirst, come unto me,

1923
01:28:16,489 --> 01:28:17,990
"and I will give you life."

1924
01:28:19,992 --> 01:28:21,994
That's why he hasn't an enemy in the world--

1925
01:28:21,994 --> 01:28:23,996
only his friends hate him.

1926
01:28:26,499 --> 01:28:28,000
Ahem.

1927
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,002
Perhaps, ah, there is much to learn

1928
01:28:30,002 --> 01:28:32,505
from the learned counsel for the prosecution.

1929
01:28:33,005 --> 01:28:36,008
Your honor, there were some remarks I made, ah, yesterday, ah,

1930
01:28:36,008 --> 01:28:38,010
namely that I wish to withdraw from the case.

1931
01:28:38,511 --> 01:28:39,512
If it please the court,

1932
01:28:39,512 --> 01:28:41,013
I shall like to withdraw my withdrawal

1933
01:28:41,013 --> 01:28:43,516
and continue as counsel for Bertram Cates.

1934
01:28:43,516 --> 01:28:45,017
[Judge] I see no reason why Col.Drummond

1935
01:28:45,518 --> 01:28:48,020
should not continue as counsel for the defense.

1936
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:49,021
Proceed, Col. Drummond.

1937
01:28:49,021 --> 01:28:51,023
Thank you,
Thank you.

1938
01:28:51,023 --> 01:28:54,026
Your honor, the court, ah, has ruled out any evidence

1939
01:28:54,026 --> 01:28:57,530
as to scientific knowledge or the Darwinian theory.

1940
01:28:57,530 --> 01:29:00,533
would the court admit evidence--

1941
01:29:00,533 --> 01:29:02,034
expert evidence--

1942
01:29:02,034 --> 01:29:04,537
on a book known as the holy bible

1943
01:29:06,655 --> 01:29:08,657
Ahem.

1944
01:29:08,657 --> 01:29:10,159
Any objection, Col. Brady

1945
01:29:12,044 --> 01:29:15,548
If counsel can advance the case for the defendant

1946
01:29:15,548 --> 01:29:17,550
through the use of the holy scriptures,

1947
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:20,553
the prosecution will take no exception.

1948
01:29:20,553 --> 01:29:23,055
Good. I call to the stand

1949
01:29:23,055 --> 01:29:25,057
one of the world's foremost experts

1950
01:29:25,057 --> 01:29:28,060
on the bible and its teachings--

1951
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:30,062
Matthew Harrison Brady.

1952
01:29:30,062 --> 01:29:31,564
[Crowd mumbling, judge banging gavel]

1953
01:29:31,564 --> 01:29:33,566
Your honor, this is preposterous!

1954
01:29:33,566 --> 01:29:36,185
Brother, let us pray.

1955
01:29:36,185 --> 01:29:37,686
Well,

1956
01:29:37,686 --> 01:29:39,688
it's highly unorthodox

1957
01:29:40,189 --> 01:29:41,690
I've never known an instance

1958
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:45,327
where the defense called the prosecuting
attorney as a witness.

1959
01:29:45,327 --> 01:29:47,329
Your honor, this entire trial

1960
01:29:47,329 --> 01:29:48,831
is unorthodox...

1961
01:29:50,332 --> 01:29:51,834
but if the interests

1962
01:29:51,834 --> 01:29:54,837
of right and justice will be served,

1963
01:29:54,837 --> 01:29:55,838
I will take the stand.

1964
01:29:55,838 --> 01:29:57,840
But, Col.Brady...

1965
01:29:58,958 --> 01:29:59,959
the court will support you

1966
01:30:00,459 --> 01:30:02,461
if you wish to decline to testify

1967
01:30:02,461 --> 01:30:04,463
as a witness against your own case.

1968
01:30:04,463 --> 01:30:05,965
Your honor,

1969
01:30:05,965 --> 01:30:09,468
I shall not testify against anything.

1970
01:30:09,468 --> 01:30:11,971
I shall speak out as I have all my life

1971
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:15,474
on behalf of the living truth of the holy scriptures.

1972
01:30:20,229 --> 01:30:21,230
Col. Brady--
no, no, no.

1973
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:23,732
That won't be necessary to swear him in.

1974
01:30:23,732 --> 01:30:25,234
Oh, I can make affirmation.

1975
01:30:25,234 --> 01:30:28,237
I have no objection to swearing to God.

1976
01:30:28,237 --> 01:30:32,241
[Chuckling] No. I take it you will tell the truth.

1977
01:30:32,241 --> 01:30:35,244
Now, sir, I-I-I am right
in calling upon you

1978
01:30:35,244 --> 01:30:38,247
as an authority on-- on the bible, am I not

1979
01:30:39,248 --> 01:30:41,250
I believe it is not boastful to say

1980
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:44,253
that I have studied the bible as much as any layman,

1981
01:30:44,253 --> 01:30:45,254
and I have tried to live

1982
01:30:45,754 --> 01:30:47,256
according to its precepts.

1983
01:30:47,256 --> 01:30:48,757
Bully for you.

1984
01:30:48,757 --> 01:30:50,759
Now, I suppose you can quote me chapter and verse

1985
01:30:50,759 --> 01:30:52,761
Right straight through the King James version.

1986
01:30:52,761 --> 01:30:54,763
There are many portions of the holy bible

1987
01:30:54,763 --> 01:30:56,265
that I have committed to memory.

1988
01:30:57,766 --> 01:30:59,768
I don't suppose there are many portions of this book

1989
01:30:59,768 --> 01:31:00,769
you've committed to memory--

1990
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:02,271
the origin of the species.

1991
01:31:02,771 --> 01:31:03,772
I am not the least interested

1992
01:31:03,772 --> 01:31:05,774
in the pagan hypotheses of that book.

1993
01:31:05,774 --> 01:31:07,276
[Drummond] Never read it

1994
01:31:07,276 --> 01:31:08,410
and I never will.

1995
01:31:08,410 --> 01:31:10,913
Then how in perdition have you got the gall

1996
01:31:10,913 --> 01:31:12,414
to whoop up this holy war

1997
01:31:12,414 --> 01:31:14,416
about something you don't know anything about

1998
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:16,919
How can you be so cocksure

1999
01:31:16,919 --> 01:31:19,421
that the body of scientific knowledge

2000
01:31:19,421 --> 01:31:21,924
systematized in the writings of Charles Darwin

2001
01:31:21,924 --> 01:31:24,426
is in any way irreconcilable

2002
01:31:24,426 --> 01:31:27,429
with the book of genesis

2003
01:31:27,429 --> 01:31:29,431
Would you state that question again, please

2004
01:31:31,433 --> 01:31:32,935
Well now, let me put it this way.

2005
01:31:34,937 --> 01:31:37,439
On page 10 of the origin of the species,

2006
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:38,440
Darwin states--

2007
01:31:38,941 --> 01:31:40,943
I object to this, your honor.

2008
01:31:40,943 --> 01:31:41,944
Col. Brady has been called

2009
01:31:42,444 --> 01:31:43,946
as an authority on the bible.

2010
01:31:43,946 --> 01:31:45,948
now the, ah... gentleman from Chicago

2011
01:31:45,948 --> 01:31:47,449
is using this opportunity

2012
01:31:47,449 --> 01:31:49,451
to read into the record scientific testimony

2013
01:31:49,451 --> 01:31:50,953
which you, your honor,

2014
01:31:50,953 --> 01:31:52,454
have previously ruled irrelevant.

2015
01:31:52,454 --> 01:31:55,457
If he's going to examine Col. Brady on the bible,

2016
01:31:55,457 --> 01:31:56,458
let him stick to the bible,

2017
01:31:56,458 --> 01:32:00,579
the holy bible and only the bible.

2018
01:32:00,579 --> 01:32:03,082
You will, uh, confine your questions to the bible.

2019
01:32:07,086 --> 01:32:08,087
All right.

2020
01:32:08,087 --> 01:32:09,588
Forget it.

2021
01:32:12,591 --> 01:32:15,094
We'll play in your ballpark, Colonel.

2022
01:32:15,094 --> 01:32:17,596
[Crowd chuckling]

2023
01:32:17,596 --> 01:32:20,099
Now a--a I'd like to get this part clear first.

2024
01:32:20,599 --> 01:32:25,104
Th-this is the book...this is the book th-that you're an authority on, isn't it

2025
01:32:25,104 --> 01:32:26,605
That is correct.

2026
01:32:26,605 --> 01:32:29,108
You believe that-- that every word written in this book

2027
01:32:29,108 --> 01:32:30,609
should be taken literally

2028
01:32:30,609 --> 01:32:32,611
everything in the bible should be accepted

2029
01:32:32,611 --> 01:32:35,614
exactly as
it is given there

2030
01:32:35,614 --> 01:32:37,616
now, what about this part right here

2031
01:32:37,616 --> 01:32:39,118
Where, uh...

2032
01:32:40,119 --> 01:32:42,621
Uh, it talks about, uh,

2033
01:32:42,621 --> 01:32:45,624
Jonah being swallowed by the whale

2034
01:32:45,624 --> 01:32:47,126
you figure that really happened

2035
01:32:47,126 --> 01:32:49,628
The bible do es not say "a whale."

2036
01:32:49,628 --> 01:32:51,630
It says "a big fish"

2037
01:32:51,630 --> 01:32:53,632
Heh heh heh.

2038
01:32:54,133 --> 01:32:56,135
[Chuckling] As a Matter of fact, it says a great fish."""

2039
01:32:56,135 --> 01:32:57,136
[Laughter]

2040
01:32:57,636 --> 01:33:00,139
But I guess one's pretty much the same as the other.

2041
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:03,642
What do you...what do you think about that business

2042
01:33:03,642 --> 01:33:05,644
I believe in a god who can make a whale

2043
01:33:05,644 --> 01:33:07,146
and who can make a man

2044
01:33:07,146 --> 01:33:09,648
and make both do what he pleases.

2045
01:33:10,649 --> 01:33:14,153
God bless you, Matthew Harrison Brady.

2046
01:33:14,653 --> 01:33:15,654
[Crowd] Amen.

2047
01:33:15,654 --> 01:33:16,655
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.

2048
01:33:18,657 --> 01:33:21,660
I want those Amen's in the record.

2049
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:24,663
Now, I recollect a--a story about Joshua--

2050
01:33:26,165 --> 01:33:28,667
Joshua making the sun stand still.

2051
01:33:28,667 --> 01:33:30,669
Uh, as an expert, do you a...tell me

2052
01:33:30,669 --> 01:33:33,672
that that's a... as right as the Jonah business

2053
01:33:35,174 --> 01:33:36,675
That's a pretty neat trick.

2054
01:33:38,177 --> 01:33:40,179
I do not question or scoff

2055
01:33:40,179 --> 01:33:41,680
at the miracles of the lord

2056
01:33:42,181 --> 01:33:43,682
as do ye of little faith

2057
01:33:43,682 --> 01:33:45,184
Have you ever pondered

2058
01:33:45,184 --> 01:33:46,685
what would actually happen to the earth

2059
01:33:47,186 --> 01:33:48,187
if the sun stood still

2060
01:33:48,687 --> 01:33:51,190
You can testify to that if I get you on the stand.

2061
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:52,191
[Laughing]

2062
01:33:52,191 --> 01:33:54,693
If, as they say, "the sun stood still,"

2063
01:33:54,693 --> 01:33:56,195
they must have had some kind of an idea

2064
01:33:56,195 --> 01:33:58,697
that the--that the sun moved around the earth.

2065
01:33:58,697 --> 01:34:00,199
Do you think that's the way of things

2066
01:34:00,199 --> 01:34:02,201
or don't you believe the earth moves around the sun

2067
01:34:02,201 --> 01:34:04,203
I have faith in the bible.

2068
01:34:04,203 --> 01:34:06,205
you don't have much faith in the solar system.

2069
01:34:06,205 --> 01:34:07,206
The sun stopped.

2070
01:34:07,706 --> 01:34:08,707
Good.

2071
01:34:08,707 --> 01:34:11,710
Now, if what you say actually happened--

2072
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:14,713
if Joshua stopped the sun in the sky--

2073
01:34:16,215 --> 01:34:19,218
the earth stopped spinning on its axis,

2074
01:34:19,218 --> 01:34:21,220
continents toppled over one another,

2075
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:23,222
mountains flew into space,

2076
01:34:23,222 --> 01:34:26,725
and the earth shriveled to a cinder,

2077
01:34:26,725 --> 01:34:28,727
crashed into the sun.

2078
01:34:30,729 --> 01:34:32,731
Now, how come they missed that little tidbit of news

2079
01:34:33,232 --> 01:34:34,233
they missed it because it didn't happen.

2080
01:34:34,733 --> 01:34:35,734
But it had to happen,

2081
01:34:35,734 --> 01:34:37,736
It must have happened according to natural law,

2082
01:34:37,736 --> 01:34:39,738
or don't you believe in natural law, Mr. Brady

2083
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:43,242
would you--would you ban copernicus from the classroom

2084
01:34:43,242 --> 01:34:44,743
along with Charles Darwin

2085
01:34:44,743 --> 01:34:46,245
would you pass a law

2086
01:34:46,245 --> 01:34:49,748
throwing out all scientific knowledge since Joshua

2087
01:34:49,748 --> 01:34:50,749
revelations, period

2088
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:52,751
Natural law was born

2089
01:34:52,751 --> 01:34:54,253
in the mind of the heavenly father.

2090
01:34:54,253 --> 01:34:55,754
he can change it, cancel it,

2091
01:34:55,754 --> 01:34:56,755
use it as he pleases

2092
01:34:56,755 --> 01:34:58,257
It constantly amazes me

2093
01:34:58,257 --> 01:34:59,758
that you apostles of science,

2094
01:34:59,758 --> 01:35:01,760
for all your supposed wisdom,

2095
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,263
fail to grasp this simple fact.

2096
01:35:09,768 --> 01:35:10,769
Now...ahem.

2097
01:35:10,769 --> 01:35:12,771
Now listen to this.

2098
01:35:12,771 --> 01:35:15,274
This is genesis, 4 to 16.

2099
01:35:17,276 --> 01:35:19,778
"and Cain went out from the presence
of the lord,

2100
01:35:19,778 --> 01:35:22,281
and dwelt in" the land of nod,

2101
01:35:22,281 --> 01:35:24,283
"on the east of eden.

2102
01:35:24,783 --> 01:35:26,785
and Cain knew his wife."

2103
01:35:28,787 --> 01:35:30,789
Now, where the hell did she come from

2104
01:35:32,291 --> 01:35:32,791
Who

2105
01:35:33,292 --> 01:35:35,794
Mrs. Cain. Cain's wife.

2106
01:35:35,794 --> 01:35:37,796
If in the beginning there were just
Cain and Abel

2107
01:35:38,297 --> 01:35:39,298
and Adam and Eve,

2108
01:35:39,298 --> 01:35:41,800
where--where did this extra woman come from

2109
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,302
d-did you ever stop to think about that

2110
01:35:43,302 --> 01:35:44,803
No, sir.

2111
01:35:44,803 --> 01:35:46,805
I leave the agnostics to hunt for her.

2112
01:35:46,805 --> 01:35:47,806
Ha ha ha!

2113
01:35:48,307 --> 01:35:49,808
[Laughing]

2114
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:52,811
[Gavel pounding]

2115
01:35:52,811 --> 01:35:53,812
Never bothered you

2116
01:35:53,812 --> 01:35:54,813
Never bothered me.

2117
01:35:54,813 --> 01:35:55,814
Never tried to find out

2118
01:35:56,315 --> 01:35:57,316
Nope.

2119
01:35:57,316 --> 01:35:59,318
You figure somebody else pulled another creation

2120
01:35:59,318 --> 01:36:00,819
over in the next county somewhere

2121
01:36:00,819 --> 01:36:03,322
the bible satisfies me. It is enough.

2122
01:36:06,825 --> 01:36:08,327
It frightens me

2123
01:36:08,327 --> 01:36:10,329
to think of the state of learning in the world

2124
01:36:10,329 --> 01:36:13,332
if everybody had your driving curiosity.

2125
01:36:15,834 --> 01:36:18,837
Now this book goes into a lot of "begats."

2126
01:36:20,839 --> 01:36:24,843
"and Arphaxad begat Salah...

2127
01:36:24,843 --> 01:36:26,845
and salah begat Eber..."

2128
01:36:26,845 --> 01:36:29,348
and so on and so on and so on.

2129
01:36:29,848 --> 01:36:31,350
How, are these pretty important people

2130
01:36:32,351 --> 01:36:33,852
they are the generations

2131
01:36:33,852 --> 01:36:34,853
of the holy men and women 

2132
01:36:34,853 --> 01:36:36,855
of the bible.

2133
01:36:36,855 --> 01:36:39,858
How'd they go about all this begatting

2134
01:36:39,858 --> 01:36:41,360
What do you mean

2135
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,363
Well, I mean, did they a...
did they begat

2136
01:36:44,363 --> 01:36:45,364
in much the same way

2137
01:36:45,364 --> 01:36:48,867
as folks get themselves begat today

2138
01:36:48,867 --> 01:36:50,869
The process is about the same

2139
01:36:50,869 --> 01:36:52,371
I don't think your scientists

2140
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:53,872
have improved it any.

2141
01:36:53,872 --> 01:36:54,873
Ha! Ha ha

2142
01:36:54,873 --> 01:36:55,874
[Laughing]

2143
01:36:55,874 --> 01:36:57,376
[Gavel pounding]

2144
01:36:58,877 --> 01:37:00,379
In other words,

2145
01:37:00,379 --> 01:37:03,882
all of these folks were conceived and brought forth

2146
01:37:03,882 --> 01:37:08,387
by the normal biological function known as sex.

2147
01:37:10,889 --> 01:37:12,891
What do you think of sex, Col.Brady

2148
01:37:14,393 --> 01:37:17,896
in what spirit is this question asked

2149
01:37:17,896 --> 01:37:19,898
[Chuckling] I'm not asking you
what you think of sex

2150
01:37:19,898 --> 01:37:21,900
as a father, as a husband,

2151
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:23,402
or even as a presidential candidate.

2152
01:37:23,902 --> 01:37:25,904
you're up here as an expert on the bible.

2153
01:37:26,405 --> 01:37:28,907
What is the biblical evaluation of sex

2154
01:37:28,907 --> 01:37:31,410
It is considered original sin.

2155
01:37:32,911 --> 01:37:35,414
and all these holy people got themselves begat

2156
01:37:35,414 --> 01:37:36,915
through original sin

2157
01:37:38,417 --> 01:37:39,918
Well...

2158
01:37:39,918 --> 01:37:42,537
all that sinning make them any less holy

2159
01:37:42,537 --> 01:37:44,539
Your honor, where is this leading us

2160
01:37:44,539 --> 01:37:45,540
What has it got to do with

2161
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:48,043
the State v. Bertram Cates

2162
01:37:48,543 --> 01:37:50,545
Col. Drummond, the court must be satisfied

2163
01:37:50,545 --> 01:37:52,047
that this line of questioning

2164
01:37:52,047 --> 01:37:53,548
has some bearing on the case.

2165
01:37:53,548 --> 01:37:55,550
You've ruled out all of my witnesses.

2166
01:37:55,550 --> 01:37:57,052
you must allow me to examine

2167
01:37:57,052 --> 01:37:59,554
the one witness you've left to me in my own way.

2168
01:37:59,554 --> 01:38:01,056
Your honor

2169
01:38:01,056 --> 01:38:02,557
I am willing to sit here

2170
01:38:03,058 --> 01:38:05,060
and endure Mr. Drummond's sneering

2171
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:06,561
and his disrespect

2172
01:38:07,062 --> 01:38:08,063
for he is pleading

2173
01:38:08,063 --> 01:38:09,064
the case of the prosecution

2174
01:38:09,064 --> 01:38:11,566
by his contempt for all that is holy.

2175
01:38:11,566 --> 01:38:14,069
I object! I object! I object!

2176
01:38:14,069 --> 01:38:16,071
On what grounds

2177
01:38:16,071 --> 01:38:19,574
Is it possible that something is holy

2178
01:38:19,574 --> 01:38:21,576
to the celebrated agnostic

2179
01:38:21,576 --> 01:38:22,577
Yes--

2180
01:38:23,578 --> 01:38:25,580
The individual human mind.

2181
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:29,584
in a child's power

2182
01:38:29,584 --> 01:38:32,087
to master the multiplication table,

2183
01:38:32,087 --> 01:38:34,089
there is more sanctity

2184
01:38:34,089 --> 01:38:37,592
than in all your shouted "Amens"
and "Holy holies"

2185
01:38:37,592 --> 01:38:39,094
and "Hosannas"!

2186
01:38:39,094 --> 01:38:42,097
An idea is a greater monument

2187
01:38:42,097 --> 01:38:44,099
than a cathedral,

2188
01:38:44,099 --> 01:38:45,600
and the advance of man's knowledge

2189
01:38:46,101 --> 01:38:49,104
is a greater miracle than all the sticks turned to snakes

2190
01:38:49,104 --> 01:38:51,106
or the parting of the waters.

2191
01:38:51,106 --> 01:38:52,607
But now,

2192
01:38:52,607 --> 01:38:54,609
are we to forgo all this progress

2193
01:38:55,110 --> 01:38:58,113
because Mr. Brady now frightens us with a fable

2194
01:39:01,116 --> 01:39:02,617
Gentlemen,

2195
01:39:02,617 --> 01:39:04,619
Progress has never been a bargain.

2196
01:39:04,619 --> 01:39:06,121
you have to pay for it.

2197
01:39:06,121 --> 01:39:08,623
sometimes I think there's a man who sits behind a counter

2198
01:39:08,623 --> 01:39:11,626
and says, "all right, you can have a telephone,

2199
01:39:11,626 --> 01:39:15,130
"but you lose privacy and the charm of distance."

2200
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:18,133
Madam, you may vote, but at a price.

2201
01:39:18,633 --> 01:39:21,636
"you lose the right to retreat behind the powder puff"

2202
01:39:21,636 --> 01:39:23,138
or your petticoat

2203
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:27,642
"Mister, you may conquer the air," will lose
their wonder...

2204
01:39:27,642 --> 01:39:30,145
but the birds

2205
01:39:30,645 --> 01:39:33,148
"and the clouds will smell of gasoline."

2206
01:39:34,149 --> 01:39:37,652
Darwin took us forward to a hilltop

2207
01:39:38,153 --> 01:39:39,154
from where we could look back

2208
01:39:39,654 --> 01:39:41,156
and see the way from which we came.

2209
01:39:41,156 --> 01:39:44,159
But for this insight and for this knowledge,

2210
01:39:44,659 --> 01:39:49,164
we must abandon our faith in the pleasant poetry of Genesis.

2211
01:39:49,164 --> 01:39:51,666
We must not abandon faith!

2212
01:39:51,666 --> 01:39:53,668
Faith is the most important thing!

2213
01:39:53,668 --> 01:39:57,172
Then why did God plague us with the power to think

2214
01:39:57,172 --> 01:40:01,676
Mr. Brady, why do you deny the one faculty of man

2215
01:40:01,676 --> 01:40:04,679
that raises him above the other creatures of the earth--

2216
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:07,182
the power of his brain to reason

2217
01:40:07,182 --> 01:40:09,184
what other merit have we

2218
01:40:09,184 --> 01:40:10,185
the elephant is larger,

2219
01:40:10,185 --> 01:40:12,187
the horse is swifter and stronger,

2220
01:40:12,687 --> 01:40:14,689
the butterfly is far more beautiful,

2221
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:17,192
the mosquito is more prolific,

2222
01:40:17,192 --> 01:40:21,196
even the simple sponge is more durable.

2223
01:40:21,196 --> 01:40:22,697
Or does a sponge think

2224
01:40:23,198 --> 01:40:24,199
I don't know.

2225
01:40:24,199 --> 01:40:26,201
I'm a man, not a sponge.

2226
01:40:26,201 --> 01:40:27,702
[Laughing]

2227
01:40:27,702 --> 01:40:30,205
Well, do you think a sponge thinks

2228
01:40:30,205 --> 01:40:32,707
If the lord wishes a sponge to think,

2229
01:40:32,707 --> 01:40:34,209
it thinks.

2230
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:36,711
Do you think a man should have

2231
01:40:36,711 --> 01:40:38,713
the same privilege as a sponge

2232
01:40:38,713 --> 01:40:40,215
Of course.

2233
01:40:40,715 --> 01:40:43,718
This man wishes to be accorded

2234
01:40:43,718 --> 01:40:46,221
the same privilege as a sponge.

2235
01:40:46,221 --> 01:40:47,722
He wishes to think!

2236
01:40:56,731 --> 01:40:58,233
But your client is wrong!

2237
01:40:58,233 --> 01:41:01,736
He is deluded! he has lost his way!

2238
01:41:01,736 --> 01:41:03,238
It's sad that we don't all have

2239
01:41:03,238 --> 01:41:05,240
your positive knowledge of what is right and wrong,

2240
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:06,741
Mr. Brady.

2241
01:41:12,247 --> 01:41:15,250
How old do you think this rock is

2242
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:17,752
I am more interested in the rock of ages

2243
01:41:17,752 --> 01:41:19,254
than I am in the age of rocks.

2244
01:41:19,254 --> 01:41:20,755
Ha! 
Ha ha

2245
01:41:20,755 --> 01:41:22,257
Dr. Page of Oberlin College

2246
01:41:22,257 --> 01:41:25,260
tells me this rock is at least 10 million years old.

2247
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:26,761
Well, well ...

2248
01:41:26,761 --> 01:41:28,263
Col. Drummond,

2249
01:41:28,263 --> 01:41:29,264
you managed to sneak in

2250
01:41:29,264 --> 01:41:32,267
some of that scientific testimony after all.

2251
01:41:33,268 --> 01:41:34,269
Look, Mr. Brady...

2252
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:37,272
these are the fossil remains

2253
01:41:37,272 --> 01:41:39,774
of a marine prehistoric creature

2254
01:41:39,774 --> 01:41:41,276
found in this very county

2255
01:41:41,276 --> 01:41:43,278
and which lived here millions of years ago

2256
01:41:43,778 --> 01:41:45,280
when these very mountain ranges

2257
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:46,281
were submerged in water.

2258
01:41:46,281 --> 01:41:47,282
I know.

2259
01:41:47,782 --> 01:41:49,284
The bible gives a fine account of the flood.

2260
01:41:49,284 --> 01:41:51,786
But your professor's a little mixed-up on his dates.

2261
01:41:51,786 --> 01:41:54,789
That rock is not more than 6,000 years old.

2262
01:41:55,290 --> 01:41:56,791
How do you know

2263
01:41:56,791 --> 01:41:59,294
A fine biblical scholar, Bishop Usher,

2264
01:41:59,294 --> 01:42:00,795
has determined for us

2265
01:42:00,795 --> 01:42:03,298
the exact date and hour of the creation

2266
01:42:03,298 --> 01:42:06,301
it occurred in the year 4004 B.C.

2267
01:42:08,303 --> 01:42:10,305
Ah, well,
uh, that...

2268
01:42:10,305 --> 01:42:12,307
That's...that's, uh, Bishop Usher's opinion.

2269
01:42:12,307 --> 01:42:13,308
It's not an opinion.

2270
01:42:13,808 --> 01:42:14,809
It's a literal fact,

2271
01:42:14,809 --> 01:42:16,311
which the good Bishop arrived at

2272
01:42:16,311 --> 01:42:17,812
through careful computation

2273
01:42:17,812 --> 01:42:19,314
of the ages of the prophets

2274
01:42:19,314 --> 01:42:21,316
as set down in the old testament.

2275
01:42:21,316 --> 01:42:22,317
In fact,

2276
01:42:22,817 --> 01:42:24,319
he determined that the Lord began the creation

2277
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:28,323
on the 23rd of october, 4004 B.C.

2278
01:42:28,323 --> 01:42:30,325
at, uh, 9 a.m.

2279
01:42:34,329 --> 01:42:36,331
At eastern standard time

2280
01:42:37,332 --> 01:42:40,335
or rocky mountain time

2281
01:42:40,335 --> 01:42:42,337
it wasn't daylight saving time, was it

2282
01:42:42,837 --> 01:42:44,339
because the lord didn't make the sun

2283
01:42:44,339 --> 01:42:45,340
until the 4th day.

2284
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:46,341
That is correct.

2285
01:42:46,341 --> 01:42:47,342
That first day, uh...

2286
01:42:47,842 --> 01:42:48,843
Wha-what do you think it was,

2287
01:42:48,843 --> 01:42:49,844
24 hours long

2288
01:42:49,844 --> 01:42:51,346
Bible says it was a day.

2289
01:42:51,346 --> 01:42:52,847
Well, there was no sun

2290
01:42:52,847 --> 01:42:55,350
h-how do you know how long it was

2291
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:56,851
The bible says it was a day.

2292
01:42:56,851 --> 01:42:59,854
Well, was it a normal day, a literal day, a 24-hour day

2293
01:42:59,854 --> 01:43:00,855
I don't know.

2294
01:43:01,356 --> 01:43:02,857
[Col. Drummond] what do you think

2295
01:43:04,859 --> 01:43:06,361
I do not think about things

2296
01:43:06,361 --> 01:43:08,363
that I do not think about.

2297
01:43:08,863 --> 01:43:10,365
Do you ever think about things

2298
01:43:10,365 --> 01:43:11,866
that you do think about

2299
01:43:11,866 --> 01:43:13,368
Isn't it possible

2300
01:43:13,368 --> 01:43:15,370
that it could have been 25 hours

2301
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:17,872
there was no way to measure it.
No way to tell.

2302
01:43:18,373 --> 01:43:20,375
Could it have been 25 hours

2303
01:43:20,375 --> 01:43:21,376
It is possible.

2304
01:43:21,876 --> 01:43:24,379
then you interpret that the first day

2305
01:43:24,879 --> 01:43:26,881
as recorded in the book of Genesis

2306
01:43:26,881 --> 01:43:29,384
could have been a day of indeterminate length

2307
01:43:29,384 --> 01:43:30,385
I mean to state

2308
01:43:30,885 --> 01:43:34,389
that it is not necessarily a 24-hour day.

2309
01:43:34,389 --> 01:43:36,391
It could have been 30 hours,

2310
01:43:36,391 --> 01:43:37,392
It could have been a week.

2311
01:43:37,892 --> 01:43:39,894
It could have been a month, it could have been a year,

2312
01:43:40,395 --> 01:43:41,396
it could have been a hundred years,

2313
01:43:41,896 --> 01:43:43,398
or it could have been 10 million years!

2314
01:43:43,398 --> 01:43:44,399
I protest!

2315
01:43:44,899 --> 01:43:46,401
This is not only irrelevant, immaterial,

2316
01:43:46,401 --> 01:43:47,902
it is illegal!

2317
01:43:47,902 --> 01:43:48,903
I demand to know the purpose

2318
01:43:49,404 --> 01:43:50,405
of Mr. Drummond's examination.

2319
01:43:50,405 --> 01:43:51,906
What's he trying to do

2320
01:43:51,906 --> 01:43:53,408
I'll tell you what he's trying to do. 

2321
01:43:53,408 --> 01:43:55,410
He wants to destroy everybody's belief in the bible

2322
01:43:55,410 --> 01:43:56,411
and in God.

2323
01:43:57,912 --> 01:43:59,914
That's not true, and you know it.

2324
01:44:01,416 --> 01:44:02,917
The bible is a book.

2325
01:44:03,418 --> 01:44:06,921
It's a good book, but it is not the only book.

2326
01:44:06,921 --> 01:44:09,924
It is the revealed word of the almighty God

2327
01:44:10,425 --> 01:44:12,427
spake to the men who wrote the bible.

2328
01:44:12,427 --> 01:44:15,430
How do you know that god didn't spake to Charles Darwin

2329
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:17,432
I know, because God tells me to oppose

2330
01:44:17,432 --> 01:44:18,933
the evil teachings of that man.

2331
01:44:18,933 --> 01:44:20,935
Oh, God speaks to you
Yes!

2332
01:44:20,935 --> 01:44:22,437
He tells you what is right and wrong,
Yes

2333
01:44:22,437 --> 01:44:23,938
and you act accordingly
Yes.

2334
01:44:23,938 --> 01:44:25,440
So you, Matthew Harrison Brady,

2335
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:28,443
through oratory or legislature or whatever,

2336
01:44:28,943 --> 01:44:30,445
you pass on god's orders

2337
01:44:30,945 --> 01:44:32,447
to the rest of the world!

2338
01:44:32,447 --> 01:44:36,951
Well, meet the prophet from Nebraska!

2339
01:44:36,951 --> 01:44:38,453
Is that the way of things

2340
01:44:38,453 --> 01:44:40,455
is that the way of things

2341
01:44:40,455 --> 01:44:43,458
God tells Brady what is good.

2342
01:44:43,458 --> 01:44:45,460
to be against Brady is to be against God.

2343
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,962
No! each man is a free agent!

2344
01:44:48,463 --> 01:44:51,966
Then what is Bertram Cates doing in a Hillsboro jail

2345
01:44:51,966 --> 01:44:54,969
supposing Mr. Cates had the influence and the lung power

2346
01:44:54,969 --> 01:44:57,472
to railroad through the state legislature

2347
01:44:57,472 --> 01:44:59,474
a law saying that only Darwin

2348
01:44:59,474 --> 01:45:00,975
could be taught in the schools

2349
01:45:00,975 --> 01:45:01,976
Ridiculous! Ridiculous!

2350
01:45:02,477 --> 01:45:04,979
There is only one great truth in the world.

2351
01:45:04,979 --> 01:45:05,980
The gospel--

2352
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:08,983
the gospel according to Brady.

2353
01:45:08,983 --> 01:45:12,987
God speaks to Brady, and Brady tells the world!

2354
01:45:12,987 --> 01:45:15,990
Brady, Brady, Brady almighty!

2355
01:45:15,990 --> 01:45:17,492
The lord--the lord is my strength!

2356
01:45:17,492 --> 01:45:19,494
suppose that a lesser human being--

2357
01:45:19,494 --> 01:45:21,496
suppose a Cates or a Darwin

2358
01:45:21,996 --> 01:45:26,000
had the audacity to think that God might whisper to him,

2359
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,003
that an un-Brady thought might still be holy

2360
01:45:29,003 --> 01:45:31,506
must a man go to prison because he differs

2361
01:45:31,506 --> 01:45:33,508
with the self-appointed prophet

2362
01:45:33,508 --> 01:45:35,510
extend the testaments.

2363
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:37,512
Let us have a book of Brady.

2364
01:45:38,012 --> 01:45:39,514
We shall hex the Pentateuch

2365
01:45:39,514 --> 01:45:41,015
and slip you in neatly

2366
01:45:41,015 --> 01:45:42,517
between Numbers and Deuteronomy!

2367
01:45:42,517 --> 01:45:43,518
N-now, my friends...

2368
01:45:44,018 --> 01:45:46,020
Your honor, my followers..

2369
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:47,021
ladies and gentlemen...

2370
01:45:47,021 --> 01:45:48,022
The witness is excused!

2371
01:45:48,022 --> 01:45:49,524
All of you know what I stand for.

2372
01:45:49,524 --> 01:45:51,526
What I believe...

2373
01:45:51,526 --> 01:45:53,027
I believe in the truth of the book of Genesis--

2374
01:45:53,027 --> 01:45:55,029
Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy,

2375
01:45:55,029 --> 01:45:57,031
Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1st Samuel,

2376
01:45:57,031 --> 01:45:59,534
2nd Samuel, 1st Kings, 2nd Kings,

2377
01:45:59,534 --> 01:46:03,037
Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Lamentations,
Ezekiel...

2378
01:46:03,037 --> 01:46:06,040
[Judge] Court is adjourned until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

2379
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:07,041
[Judge pounding gavel]

2380
01:46:07,542 --> 01:46:11,045
[Chattering]

2381
01:46:18,937 --> 01:46:19,938
Matt

2382
01:46:20,939 --> 01:46:22,440
Matt, dear

2383
01:46:22,941 --> 01:46:24,442
let's go home.

2384
01:46:25,443 --> 01:46:26,444
Home

2385
01:46:26,444 --> 01:46:27,946
Back to the hotel.

2386
01:46:27,946 --> 01:46:28,947
Uh.

2387
01:46:40,742 --> 01:46:44,746
[Knocking at door]

2388
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:52,253
Who is it

2389
01:46:55,757 --> 01:46:56,758
Where is he

2390
01:46:56,758 --> 01:46:57,759
I've got to talk to him.

2391
01:46:57,759 --> 01:47:00,261
Not now, Rachel. He isn't feeling well.

2392
01:47:00,261 --> 01:47:01,763
Yes, now.

2393
01:47:01,763 --> 01:47:03,264
He's got to tell Bert it wasn't my fault

2394
01:47:03,264 --> 01:47:04,766
Rachel, please be quiet. He's sleeping.

2395
01:47:04,766 --> 01:47:06,768
Why should I be quiet

2396
01:47:06,768 --> 01:47:08,269
I want the whole world to know

2397
01:47:08,269 --> 01:47:09,771
that Matthew Harrison Brady's a fake.

2398
01:47:10,271 --> 01:47:11,272
Rachel!

2399
01:47:21,783 --> 01:47:22,784
I'm sorry.

2400
01:47:35,046 --> 01:47:37,048
I found myself in bed today,

2401
01:47:38,049 --> 01:47:41,052
in the middle of the day.

2402
01:47:41,052 --> 01:47:44,556
I-I was dreaming I was in the witness chair--

2403
01:47:44,556 --> 01:47:46,558
chained to it.

2404
01:47:46,558 --> 01:47:49,060
I kept begging him to let me go.

2405
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:51,563
Oh, Rachel, Rachel, it's been a nightmare for all of us.

2406
01:47:51,563 --> 01:47:53,565
But mine was real.

2407
01:47:53,565 --> 01:47:55,567
I turned to your husband for help.

2408
01:47:56,067 --> 01:47:58,570
he encouraged me to open up my heart to him,

2409
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:01,072
and then he twisted my words.

2410
01:48:01,072 --> 01:48:02,574
He tricked me.

2411
01:48:02,574 --> 01:48:04,576
Why why did he do it

2412
01:48:04,576 --> 01:48:06,077
I don't know.

2413
01:48:06,077 --> 01:48:08,079
I don't know why he did it.

2414
01:48:11,583 --> 01:48:13,585
Maybe it meant too much to him.

2415
01:48:13,585 --> 01:48:16,087
Maybe he was tired or afraid.

2416
01:48:16,588 --> 01:48:18,089
I taught my pupils

2417
01:48:18,089 --> 01:48:20,592
that Matthew Harrison Brady was a great man--

2418
01:48:20,592 --> 01:48:22,093
next to God, almost.

2419
01:48:22,093 --> 01:48:24,095
What do you want me to teach them now

2420
01:48:24,095 --> 01:48:26,097
He's still the same man.

2421
01:48:26,097 --> 01:48:28,099
No, if he could do such an evil thing,

2422
01:48:28,099 --> 01:48:30,101
then he must be an evil man,

2423
01:48:30,101 --> 01:48:31,603
and everything he stands for

2424
01:48:31,603 --> 01:48:32,604
must be evil, too.

2425
01:48:32,604 --> 01:48:34,105
Oh, stop it! stop it!

2426
01:48:36,357 --> 01:48:38,860
Youth can be so pure.

2427
01:48:38,860 --> 01:48:40,862
What do you know of good or evil

2428
01:48:40,862 --> 01:48:42,363
what do you understand

2429
01:48:42,363 --> 01:48:44,365
of the sum of a man's life

2430
01:48:44,365 --> 01:48:45,366
He betrayed me.

2431
01:48:45,366 --> 01:48:47,368
You betrayed yourself.

2432
01:48:47,368 --> 01:48:49,871
You see my husband as a saint,

2433
01:48:49,871 --> 01:48:53,374
and so he must be right in everything he says and does.

2434
01:48:53,875 --> 01:48:55,376
and then you see him as a devil,

2435
01:48:55,376 --> 01:48:58,379
and everything he says and does must be wrong.

2436
01:48:58,379 --> 01:49:02,517
Well, my husband's neither a saint nor a devil.

2437
01:49:02,517 --> 01:49:04,519
He's just a human being...

2438
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,522
and he makes mistakes.

2439
01:49:08,022 --> 01:49:09,524
How can you defend him

2440
01:49:09,524 --> 01:49:11,526
it's not he I'm defending.

2441
01:49:11,526 --> 01:49:15,029
I'm defending the 40 years I've lived with this man

2442
01:49:15,029 --> 01:49:17,031
and watched him carry the burdens

2443
01:49:17,031 --> 01:49:18,533
of people like you.

2444
01:49:18,533 --> 01:49:20,034
If he's been wrong,

2445
01:49:20,034 --> 01:49:22,036
at least he stood for something.

2446
01:49:22,036 --> 01:49:24,038
What do you stand for

2447
01:49:24,038 --> 01:49:27,542
do you believe in Bertram Cates

2448
01:49:27,542 --> 01:49:30,044
I believe in my husband.

2449
01:49:30,044 --> 01:49:31,546
What do you believe in

2450
01:49:34,048 --> 01:49:35,049
Matt.

2451
01:49:35,550 --> 01:49:37,051
I was asleep, but...

2452
01:49:39,554 --> 01:49:41,556
What can I do for you, child

2453
01:49:43,558 --> 01:49:46,060
I'm not your child any longer,
Mr. Brady--

2454
01:49:47,061 --> 01:49:48,062

01:50:03,077 --> 01:50:04,579
What did she want, Sarah

2459
01:50:08,583 --> 01:50:10,585
Whe's been hurt, Matt.

2460
01:50:13,087 --> 01:50:14,589
You hurt her.

2461
01:50:15,590 --> 01:50:16,591
Oh, Matt,

2462
01:50:17,592 --> 01:50:20,595
you were always a good man.

2463
01:50:20,595 --> 01:50:21,596
that's why I loved you,

2464
01:50:22,096 --> 01:50:23,598
even from the very beginning.

2466
01:50:28,102 --> 01:50:30,104
you could have been president 3 times over,

2467
01:50:30,605 --> 01:50:33,107
but I never doubted you, Matt,

2468
01:50:33,107 --> 01:50:36,110
because your decisions were honest.

2469

You never sacrificed your principles just to win.

I didn't mean to hurt her.

Sarah, a victory here

2473
01:50:43,618 --> 01:50:44,619
would be a monument to God

2474
01:50:45,119 --> 01:50:46,120
that would last a 1,000 years!

You can't do it for them, Matt.

2478

If you do, it becomes your monument, not theirs,

2479
01:50:55,630 --> 01:51:00,134
and they'll topple it the minute they find a flaw in it.

you mean a flaw in me, don't you, Sarah

Ah, they didn't understand.

[Excited chattering]

2616
01:59:20,269 --> 01:59:23,772
Ah...ah, did ah...

2617
01:59:23,772 --> 01:59:26,525
Did your honor say $100

2618
01:59:26,525 --> 01:59:28,027
That is correct.

2619
01:59:28,027 --> 01:59:30,029
That seems to conclude the business of the trial.

2620
01:59:30,029 --> 01:59:32,281
But, your honor, the prosecution takes exception.

2621
01:59:32,781 --> 01:59:34,283
Why, the issues are so titanic

2622
01:59:34,783 --> 01:59:36,785
the court must mete out more drastic punishment--

2623
01:59:36,785 --> 01:59:37,786
I object.

2624
01:59:38,287 --> 01:59:39,788
to make an example of this transgressor,

2625
01:59:39,788 --> 01:59:41,290
to show the world--

2626
01:59:41,290 --> 01:59:42,791
Just a minute,
just a minute.

2627
01:59:42,791 --> 01:59:44,793
The amount of the fine is of no concern to me,

2628
01:59:44,793 --> 01:59:47,296
because Bertram Cates has no intention of paying

2629
01:59:47,296 --> 01:59:48,797
this or any other fine.

2630
01:59:48,797 --> 01:59:51,800
If it were one single dollar, he would not pay it.

2631
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:55,304
We are going to appeal this decision to the state supreme court.

2632
01:59:55,804 --> 01:59:59,308
Will the court grant us 30 days in which to prepare the appeal

2633
01:59:59,925 --> 02:00:00,426
Granted.

2634
02:00:00,926 --> 02:00:02,928
Court fixes bond at $200.

2635
02:00:02,928 --> 02:00:05,814
I believe that concludes the business of this trial

2636
02:00:05,814 --> 02:00:07,816
Therefore, I declare this court adjourned.

2637
02:00:07,816 --> 02:00:10,319
Your honor, with the court's permission,

2638
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:11,820
I should like to read into the record

2639
02:00:12,321 --> 02:00:13,822
a few short remarks which I have prepared.

2640
02:00:13,822 --> 02:00:16,325
I object to that.

2641
02:00:16,325 --> 02:00:18,327
Mr. Brady is free to read any remarks,

2642
02:00:18,827 --> 02:00:19,828
long, short, or otherwise,

2643

in a Chautauqua tent or a political campaign,

2644
02:00:22,331 --> 02:00:24,833
but our business in Hillsboro is completed.

2645
02:00:24,833 --> 02:00:26,835
The defense moves that the court be adjourned.

2646
02:00:26,835 --> 02:00:28,837
But I-I have a few remarks--

2647
02:00:28,837 --> 02:00:31,206
[Judge] and we are all anxious to hear them, sir

2648
02:00:31,206 --> 02:00:34,209
But Col.Drummond's point of procedure is well taken.

2649
02:00:34,209 --> 02:00:38,213
I'm sure everyone here will wish to remain after the court is adjourned

2650
02:00:38,213 --> 02:00:40,215
To hear your address.

2651
02:00:40,215 --> 02:00:42,968

Why

02:03:51,239 --> 02:03:53,241
You never pushed a noun against a verb

except to blow up something.

sentimentality in the first degree.

2735
02:04:07,756 --> 02:04:11,259
Why, because I refuse to erase a man's lifetime

2736
02:04:11,259 --> 02:04:13,762
No, because you know what I thought of him,

02:06:03,872 --> 02:06:05,373
you're all alone.

2779
02:06:07,375 --> 02:06:09,377
When you go to your grave, there won't be anybody

2780
02:06:09,377 --> 02:06:11,880
to pull the grass up over your head,

2781
02:06:12,380 --> 02:06:15,383
nobody to mourn you, nobody to give a damn.

2782
02:06:17,886 --> 02:06:19,387
You're all alone.

2783
02:06:30,398 --> 02:06:31,900
You're wrong, Henry.

2784
02:06:33,401 --> 02:06:34,903
You'll be there.

2785
02:06:35,904 --> 02:06:37,405
You're the type.

2786
02:06:38,907 --> 02:06:41,910
Who else would defend my right to be lonely

2787
02:07:08,937 --> 02:07:12,440
[Sighing]

2788
02:07:24,953 --> 02:07:28,456
...of the coming of the lord

2789
02:07:28,456 --> 02:07:31,459
He is trampling out the vintage

2790
02:07:31,459 --> 02:07:34,462
Where the grapes of wrath are stored

2791
02:07:34,462 --> 02:07:37,465
He hath loosed the fateful lightning

2792
02:07:37,465 --> 02:07:40,468
of his terrible swift sword

2793
02:07:40,468 --> 02:07:45,473
His truth is marching on

2794
02:07:46,975 --> 02:07:52,480
Glory! Glory!
Hallelujah

2795
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:57,986
Glory! Glory!
Hallelujah

2796
02:07:57,986 --> 02:08:02,991
Glory! Glory!
Hallelujah
