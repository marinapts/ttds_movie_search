1
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,927
What the hell
are you doing to me?

2
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,694
What are you doing?

3
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:04,167
Goddamn it! Where am I?
A boat.

4
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:06,704
A fishing boat.
You were in the water.

5
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:09,741
We pull you out.
What water?

6
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:12,072
You were shot.
See? There are the bullets.

7
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:16,376
Ohh. Look. There is
a number for a bank.

8
00:05:16,448 --> 00:05:18,939
Why was it in your hip?

9
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,576
My hip?
Why was it in your hip?

10
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:24,611
Yeah. In your hip under the skin.
Uh. Oh, God!

11
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,888
You need to rest.
Wait. Please. Slow down.

12
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:33,591
I'm a friend.
I'm your friend. Huh?

13
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:37,260
My name is Giancarlo.
Who are you?

14
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:42,138
What's your name?
What's your name?

15
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:44,266
Uh, I don't know.

16
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,003
Oh, God.

17
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:18,474
It's been confirmed, sir.
Mission failed.

18
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:40,257
If you want to eat,
you better get in there.

19
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:43,988
Based on these charts, I think
I may have been closer to the coast.

20
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:46,758
What's this?
You tied these knots?

21
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:48,800
So it start
to come back, huh?

22
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:51,358
No, it doesn't start to come back.
The knot's like everything else.

23
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:53,802
I just found the rope
and I did it.

24
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:56,670
The same way I can...
I can read, I can write.

25
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,176
I can add, subtract. I can make coffee.
I can shuffle cards.

26
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:01,940
I can set up a chessboard.
Yes, yes. It will come back.

27
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,346
No, it's not coming back,
goddamn it! That's the point!

28
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:10,010
I'm down here looking through all this shit.
For two weeks I'm down here.

29
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:12,818
It's not working. I don't
even know what to look for.

30
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,190
You need to rest.

31
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:22,529
It will come back.
What if it doesn't come back?

32
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:28,537
We get in there tomorrow,
l-I don't even have a name.

33
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:03,371
It's not much, but it should get you
to Switzerland.

34
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:09,003
Thank you.

35
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:48,135
Hey.

36
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,382
All right.

37
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,184
No. L-I don't...

38
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:07,220
I don't have any papers. I lost...

39
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:41,826
These people have threatened
my family, my babies.

40
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,664
So I'm telling you,
when the evidence is clear...

41
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:46,966
I will have a nice story
for you to read about.

42
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:50,303
And all my friends out there,
you will read about yourselves.

43
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,400
Cause if you want to play this game...

44
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:55,469
after I've been reasonable,
I will show you.

45
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:59,779
That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking
in Paris the day before yesterday.

46
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:02,115
He was an irritation
before he took power...

47
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:05,987
he was a problem when he was in power
and he's been a disaster for us in exile.

48
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:10,153
He's writing a book about the agency's
history in Africa. He's going to name names.

49
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:13,163
It's basically a shakedown.
He's demanding the agency's help.

50
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:17,361
He wants us to put him back
in power in six months or else.

51
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:21,202
This interview, and I'll make the tape
available to anyone who wants it...

52
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,470
he goes on to claim that he's just
survived an assassination attempt.

53
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,338
He says it's us.
He says he's got proof.

54
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:34,508
The director wants to know if there's
any possible shred of truth in this accusation.

55
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:38,784
I've already assured him there's nobody
that reckless on my senior staff.

56
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:50,132
I was recalling a conversation we had some
time ago, talking about Treadstone.

57
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:53,831
I seem to remember Nykwana Wombosi's name
might have come up.

58
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,474
I'm not sure
what we're talking about.

59
00:12:57,542 --> 00:13:02,411
Someone tried to take him out.
Tried and failed.

60
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,906
Was this Treadstone?

61
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:08,885
You're asking me
a direct question?

62
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,321
Yes.
I thought you were never gonna do that.

63
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,018
What happened?

64
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:20,895
Well, we, uh, lost
communication with our man.

65
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,957
This was almost
two weeks ago.

66
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:25,594
We've been working
around the clock, the whole unit.

67
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,639
We've been sleeping down there.
Believe me, we're doing everything we can.

68
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:32,609
And you don't let me know this?
You never wanted to before.

69
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:35,544
You never made
a mistake before.

70
00:14:09,948 --> 00:14:13,440
Uh, yes. I'm here about
a numbered account.

71
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:17,113
If you just enter your account number here,
I'll direct you to an appropriate officer.

72
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:20,506
My name is Jason Bourne.

73
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:29,245
I live in Paris.

74
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,763
Yes. In Paris. Do you have
the number for a Jason Bourne?

75
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:33,801
Yes, sir. Would you
like me to connect you?

76
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:36,346
Yes. Please.

77
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:43,486
This is 4-6-9-9-0-3-8-4.

78
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,489
Leave a message at the beep.

79
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:52,847
I'm an American.
Okay.

80
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,119
Hold it. Wait.

81
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,492
You have no jurisdiction here.

82
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:07,435
No. Excuse me. No.
This is not my current address, okay?

83
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:09,439
This was my current address
until two days ago...

84
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:11,737
when I started standing
in line outside.

85
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:16,906
Now, I lose my apartment, okay?That means
no address, no phone, no money, no time.

86
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:20,747
- I still have no visa.
- Miss Kreutz, I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.

87
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:24,811
Excuse me. But where's the guy
that I talked to last week?

88
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:27,323
Every week it's a new person.
How am I supposed to...

89
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,384
I don't know who you saw last week.
Well, let me help you.

90
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:34,192
- I'm sure I have it. Hold on.
- Could I have your attention for a moment, please?

91
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:36,460
It's right here. Look at it.

92
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:44,040
This is a student visa now.
It's not about a green card anymore.

93
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:47,805
- It's completely different.
- It's not a menu, Miss Kreutz.

94
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,870
You don'tjust pick what you want.

95
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:02,283
You! Red bag! The red bag!
Stop right there!

96
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,294
Put your hands up.!

97
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,767
I'm on the east... Ohh!

98
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,004
Move it.! Now.! Now.!

99
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:12,622
Check. Clear!

100
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:16,064
Bravo Unit moving up staircase.
Proceeding to second floor.

101
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,653
On the floor! Down!

102
00:22:43,728 --> 00:22:45,389
Clear.!

103
00:24:10,948 --> 00:24:12,677
Go.! Go.! Come on.!

104
00:25:17,982 --> 00:25:22,476
He's in Zurich now?
Right now? Yes. It just came in.

105
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:24,783
But they're sure? Sure it's him?
Yes. He went to the bank.

106
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:26,789
Our source at the bank,
that's who called.

107
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:29,883
- Come on.
- He's got to assume we're watching the bank, right?

108
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,725
I don't know. Come on.

109
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,994
I mean, he cleaned out the box.
He left the gun. What does that mean?

110
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,001
I said I don't know.

111
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,594
I liked it better
when I thought he was dead.

112
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,839
Oh, Scheise.

113
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,956
What are you looking at?

114
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:01,617
I heard you inside.
What?

115
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:05,321
The consulate. I heard you talking.
I thought maybe we could help each other.

116
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:09,298
How's that?
You need money. I need a ride out ofhere.

117
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,569
I'm not running a car service
just now. Thank you.

118
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:15,231
I'll give you $10,000
for driving me to Paris.

119
00:26:23,547 --> 00:26:25,777
What is this, a joke?
Some kind of scam?

120
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,250
No, it's no scam.

121
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,344
And I'll give you another ten
when we get there.

122
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:33,754
Jesus.

123
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,363
- Is that for you?
- Look. You drive, I pay. It's that simple.

124
00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:48,428
Scheise.
I got enough trouble, okay?

125
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,839
Okay. Can I have
my money back?

126
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:12,454
All right, go.
Keep going. Go.

127
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,226
There. Wait.
- No. It's got to be near the end.

128
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,824
Oh, come on, folks.
We caught a break here. Let's go.

129
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:22,532
Okay, I'm up. We're getting grids.
Airline, train, hotels...

130
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:24,836
Did you get the address?
The street? Gemeinschaft.

131
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,343
- Here we go.
- I got it. I think I got it.

132
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:30,437
Is it him?
Unreal.

133
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:32,607
This is 38 minutes ago.

134
00:27:32,683 --> 00:27:35,709
Hey, Zurich police are looking
for an American man carrying a red bank bag.

135
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:38,914
Hejust tore up the embassy, and he put two cops
in the hospital last night.

136
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,889
Get everybody up. Do it now.
I want them all activated.

137
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:46,896
All of them?
At the same time?

138
00:27:46,964 --> 00:27:51,594
You heard me. I want Bourne
in a body bag by sundown.

139
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:55,969
Let's get a map up here.
Come on, folks. Work it.

140
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:00,700
Take a look.
The grids are good info.

141
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,416
Which was fine for me,
because I was ready.

142
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:23,016
You know, because, I mean,
after six months in Amsterdam...

143
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:26,290
you're not sure if you've been there 20 minutes or 20 years,
if you know what I mean.

144
00:29:26,363 --> 00:29:28,524
So I went and I took
all the money I had...

145
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:32,558
and I went in with friends and we took over
this really cool surf shop outside Biarritz...

146
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:36,003
um, which was right by the water
it was amazing.

147
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:38,598
It was just amazing
for about three months...

148
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:42,635
until it turned out that this,
uh, jerk who had found us the lease...

149
00:29:42,713 --> 00:29:47,707
was actually shining everyone on and...

150
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:53,913
And what?

151
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:56,959
What do you mean what?
Listen to me.

152
00:29:57,027 --> 00:29:59,587
I've been speed-talking
for about 60 kilometers now.

153
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:02,860
I talk when I'm nervous.
I mean, I talk like this when I'm nervous.

154
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:05,424
I'm gonna shut up now.
No. Don't do that.

155
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,572
I haven't talked to anybody in a while.

156
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:13,299
Yeah, but we're not talking.
I'm talking.

157
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:15,607
You've said, like, ten words
since we left Zurich.

158
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,739
Well, listening to you,
um, it's relaxing.

159
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:23,747
I haven't slept
in a while and...

160
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:26,915
and I've had this headache.

161
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,925
It's like a constant thing
inside my head.

162
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,393
And it's just starting
to move to the background, so...

163
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:35,391
keep going.

164
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,525
Really. If you want,
please keep talking.

165
00:30:43,407 --> 00:30:45,375
What kind of music do you like?

166
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:49,371
Huh? What do you like? Come on.
Um...

167
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:54,281
You know what, never mind.
No. It's fine. Tell me.

168
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:56,819
What do you want
to listen to?

169
00:30:56,887 --> 00:31:00,323
I don't know. Come on.
It's not that hard.

170
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,518
What do you like?
Tell me.

171
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:04,584
I don't know.

172
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:17,065
Who pays $20,000 for a ride to Paris?

173
00:31:27,384 --> 00:31:32,822
Fuck it. I can't remember anything
that happened before two weeks ago.

174
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,316
Lucky you.
No. I'm serious.

175
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:41,296
I don't know who I am. I don't know
where I'm going. None of it.

176
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:44,926
What, like, amnesia?
Yes.

177
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,164
Amnesia?
Yes.

178
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,068
Great.

179
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:05,281
- That's the best angle of the courtyard?
- That's the only angle.

180
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:08,223
Well, what do they have
of the streets or the area?

181
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:10,385
They must have something.
Hang on.

182
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,857
Oh, what is he doing?

183
00:32:16,266 --> 00:32:19,258
Is it a game? Is he warning us?
Is it a threat?

184
00:32:20,537 --> 00:32:22,528
Sir, look at this.

185
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:27,004
What's that? It's an angle of the street.
It's some sort of alley.

186
00:32:27,077 --> 00:32:31,309
Just enhance it.

187
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:36,982
Who the hell is that?

188
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:39,784
Marie Helena Kreutz.

189
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,984
She's 26.
Born outside of Hannover.

190
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,493
Father was a welder.
He died in '87.

191
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:46,358
Still don't have the mother.

192
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,489
The grandmother,
she's still there in Hannover...

193
00:32:48,565 --> 00:32:51,830
and looks like she's the anchor
for this little domestic disaster.

194
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:55,861
And there's a stepbrother.
It's tough. The girl's a gypsy.

195
00:32:55,939 --> 00:33:00,205
She pops up on the grid here and there,
but it's chaotic at best.

196
00:33:00,277 --> 00:33:02,802
She paid some electric bills
in Spain, '95...

197
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,873
had a phone in her name for
three months in Belgium, '96.

198
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,077
No taxes, no credit.

199
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,645
I don't like her.
I want to go deep.

200
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:15,556
Get a phone log for granny
and the half brother...

201
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,924
anybody we can cross-file.

202
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:21,362
I want to know every place
she's slept in the past six years.

203
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:24,333
Have Paris get these
out in the field.

204
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,160
I'm not making this up.

205
00:33:55,232 --> 00:33:57,564
These are real.

206
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:08,071
Okay. Who has a safety
deposit box full of...

207
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:13,176
money and six passports
and a gun?

208
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:18,946
Who has a bank account number
in their hip?

209
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,058
I come in here...

210
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:25,892
and the first thing I'm doing is I'm catching
the sight lines and looking for an exit.

211
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:28,056
I see the exit sign too.
I'm not worried.

212
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,464
I mean, you were shot.

213
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:34,971
People do all kinds of weird and
amazing stuff when they're scared.

214
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:44,010
I can tell you the license plate numbers
of all six cars outside.

215
00:34:45,215 --> 00:34:47,149
I can tell that
our waitress is left-handed...

216
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:51,586
and the guy sitting up at the counter
weighs 215 pounds and knows how to handle himself.

217
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:55,250
I know the best place to look for
a gun is the cab of the gray truck outside.

218
00:34:55,325 --> 00:35:00,126
And at this altitude, I can run flat-out
for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

219
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,093
Now why would I know that?

220
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:10,096
How can I know that
and not know who I am?

221
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:54,984
Hey.

222
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:58,244
Ah, I slept.

223
00:35:59,723 --> 00:36:02,214
I can't believe it.
Yeah. Well, you were tired.

224
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:07,059
I haven't slept. Oh. Here. For 20,000,
I like to throw in breakfast.

225
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,133
Did you stop for gas?

226
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,965
You were
pretty out of it.

227
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:18,507
Yeah.
Ohh.

228
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:24,841
So, do you think there's,
like, a family waiting for you?

229
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:28,507
I don't know.

230
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:32,249
I haven't
thought about it.

231
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,664
Is that it?

232
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,462
One-o-four.
Yeah, that's it. That's the address.

233
00:36:44,534 --> 00:36:47,196
No, no. Keep going.
Keep going. Okay.

234
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:50,001
Where? Just, uh, just take a left.
Go on over here.

235
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,622
So this is it, right?
Yeah. I guess.

236
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,528
Yeah, but I don't
recognize any of this.

237
00:37:13,597 --> 00:37:15,588
Okay. You should go.

238
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,295
Jason.

239
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:25,898
Oh, God. Money. Right.

240
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:30,038
Yeah.
Here.

241
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:32,479
Danke, okay?

242
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:34,983
Thanks for the ride.

243
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,043
Anytime.

244
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:45,657
Well, you could come up and you can...
Or you could wait here.

245
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:50,166
I can go check it out, but you could wait...
Uh, no, no. No, no.

246
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:55,637
Um, with you, you would probably just forget
about me if I stayed here.

247
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,734
How could I forget about you?

248
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,745
You're the only person I know.

249
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:10,144
Yeah. That's true.

250
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,459
I guess you're not home.

251
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:04,830
Hello?

252
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,529
You sure this is all yours?

253
00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:30,498
I guess.

254
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,345
This is my kitchen.

255
00:40:09,706 --> 00:40:13,972
- Any clues?
- I think I'm in the shipping business.

256
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,035
So it's all coming back, huh?

257
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:24,813
Do you mind if I use the bathroom?

258
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:29,452
- Uh, sure.
- Okay.

259
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:56,146
Uh, yeah. Hello? Hello?

260
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:59,916
Yes, sir. Hotel Regina, Paris.
How may I direct your call?

261
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,618
Yeah. You're in Paris?
Yes, sir.

262
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:05,752
I'm looking for a, uh, guest there.

263
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:09,094
Uh, Jason Bourne.
- One moment, please.

264
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,157
Thank you.

265
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:18,207
I'm afraid I have no one
by that name registered, sir.

266
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,444
Uh, okay. Uh, thank you.

267
00:41:22,512 --> 00:41:25,845
Uh, wait. No, no, no.
Uh, are you there? Hello? Sir?

268
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,851
Uh, can you check another,
uh, name for me, please?

269
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,784
Uh, bear with me one second.

270
00:41:32,055 --> 00:41:34,523
Um...

271
00:41:34,591 --> 00:41:37,287
uh, John Michael Kane.
Kane with a "K."

272
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,521
One moment, sir.
Thank you.

273
00:41:48,371 --> 00:41:51,738
You call about Monsieur Kane?
John Michael Kane?

274
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:55,244
Uh, yeah. That's right.
You are a friend of his?

275
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:58,145
Uh, uh-huh. Yep.

276
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:00,445
I have some very
bad news for you, sir.

277
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:02,485
I'm terribly sorry
to tell you this...

278
00:42:02,552 --> 00:42:06,283
but Monsieur Kane
has passed away almost two weeks ago.

279
00:42:06,356 --> 00:42:09,223
There was an accident on the motorway.

280
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:11,852
Apparently,
he was killed instantly.

281
00:42:11,928 --> 00:42:14,658
Really. I'm terribly sorry
to be the one to tell you this.

282
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,530
When they came for his things,
people made note for us, you see?

283
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:23,732
- Who-Who came?
- His brother.

284
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:27,709
Did his, uh, brother leave a number or
a way to get in touch with him?

285
00:42:27,777 --> 00:42:30,177
I think not.

286
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:32,715
So I'm sorry...

287
00:42:53,403 --> 00:42:56,099
Uh, Jason?

288
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:59,141
There's no hot water.
It's freezing.

289
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,337
Uh, I'll go, uh, try
the water in the kitchen.

290
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:06,439
Why don't you just stay in the bathroom?
I'll-I'll see if I can... get it hot.

291
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,750
Yeah, it's really cold in here too.

292
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:25,797
The water is still cold.

293
00:43:27,203 --> 00:43:29,728
Yeah, it's cold
in the, uh, kitchen too.

294
00:43:29,806 --> 00:43:32,172
I got it running though.

295
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,201
So...

296
00:43:42,452 --> 00:43:44,443
What?

297
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:49,315
Nothing.

298
00:43:49,392 --> 00:43:53,021
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

299
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,712
What is it?
Something wrong?

300
00:44:47,984 --> 00:44:49,212
Jason!

301
00:45:51,314 --> 00:45:54,647
Open that! Open that! Tell me what's inside.
Who are you?

302
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,444
Who are you?

303
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:03,152
Who are you?

304
00:46:04,227 --> 00:46:06,627
Oh, my God.

305
00:46:06,696 --> 00:46:10,826
Ohh.

306
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,266
Answer me! Who are you?

307
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:15,133
- He's got my picture.
- All right. Just... stop.

308
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,070
No, no, no!

309
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,041
I don't... How... Where did you get this?
Stay there! Stay there!

310
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:22,236
How did you get my picture?
Marie, stay there. Come on.

311
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,577
Where did you get this from?
How did you get...

312
00:46:25,648 --> 00:46:29,414
Don't do this. I'll do this.
You stay there. Stay there.

313
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,147
But he...

314
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:47,536
Where are your shoes?
Get your shoes.

315
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:50,004
Sure. Yeah. Sure.

316
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:53,338
Uh, he went out the window.
Why would someone do that?

317
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:56,310
We can't stay here.
It's not safe.

318
00:46:56,379 --> 00:46:59,212
Look, I can get us out ofhere,
but we got to go. We got to go right now.

319
00:47:02,418 --> 00:47:05,148
Okay. Look, uh, you could wait.

320
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:07,781
You could wait for the cops.
It's okay.

321
00:47:07,857 --> 00:47:10,883
You just wait for them to get here, but I can't.
I got to go.

322
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,623
Marie?

323
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:19,324
Marie?

324
00:47:25,775 --> 00:47:27,367
Ohh.! Ohh.!
Quiet. Quiet.

325
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:42,558
- Don't look.

326
00:47:54,737 --> 00:47:57,604
Code in.
Alpha three-seven-five-zero-nine.

327
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,639
Yeah?

328
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:10,682
Hang on. Bourne, he went to Paris.
He went to the apartment.

329
00:48:10,753 --> 00:48:14,382
We got him? Tell me.
- He killed our man.

330
00:48:14,457 --> 00:48:16,391
What? In the apartment?
- Yeah.

331
00:48:16,459 --> 00:48:19,986
Well, you got to clean that up.
No, I can't clean it up.

332
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,759
There's a body in the streets.
So?

333
00:48:22,832 --> 00:48:24,766
There's police.
This is Paris.

334
00:48:24,834 --> 00:48:27,268
Put up the scanners.
Get as much radio information as you can.

335
00:48:29,872 --> 00:48:34,707
Okay. You stay here. I'll go find a place
for this money. I'll be back in ten minutes.

336
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,493
Hey. I told you to stay in the car.

337
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:10,564
Jesus Christ.
I told you to stay in the car.

338
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:14,802
I needed a drink. I didn't think
you would come back anyway.

339
00:50:14,877 --> 00:50:17,345
You got to go to the cops.
Right now.

340
00:50:17,413 --> 00:50:20,280
You got to go before this gets any worse.
By myself?

341
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:23,944
It's gonna be okay. Take my passport,
okay? You show this to them.

342
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,011
You have that picture.
You have the 20,000.

343
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,819
You tell them everything that happened.
Everything. They're gonna believe you.

344
00:50:28,891 --> 00:50:30,916
They have to believe you.

345
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:38,131
Marie, you can't just sit here.
It's not safe here.

346
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,829
Safe? This is from
inside the embassy.

347
00:50:40,903 --> 00:50:42,996
Who can do this? This is from yesterday.
I don't know.

348
00:50:43,072 --> 00:50:45,006
How can they even know
that we're together?

349
00:50:45,074 --> 00:50:47,804
Look, I'm trying to do
the right thing for you, okay? Just...

350
00:50:47,877 --> 00:50:50,107
Try... How are you gonna
make this right...

351
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:53,205
by sending me there alone?
Do you think I want you to go to the cops?

352
00:50:53,282 --> 00:50:55,250
You think that's good for me?
You want to go, fine.

353
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,548
You go to the cops, I gotta run.
You tell them what happened.

354
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,214
I don't know what happened!
I don't know who this guy was!

355
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:03,053
I don't know about that picture!
I don't know who I am!

356
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:13,029
Look, I'm... You're acting like
I'm trying to burn you here.

357
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:16,663
- I'm just trying to do the right thing.
- Nobody does the right thing.

358
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:28,379
Look, I can't
run with you. I can't...

359
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,619
We run... I gotta live
like this. I gotta...

360
00:51:32,688 --> 00:51:34,781
I don't even know
who I'm hiding from.

361
00:51:34,857 --> 00:51:37,917
These people know who I am.
Now I gotta...

362
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,292
I gotta stay here.
I gotta figure this out.

363
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,388
So figure it out.

364
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:02,243
You take care
of this car?

365
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:05,515
What do you mean?
Tires felt a little splashy on the way over here.

366
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:08,682
It pulls a little to the right.

367
00:52:30,279 --> 00:52:32,270
Last chance, Marie.

368
00:53:55,798 --> 00:53:57,857
So...
What?

369
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:00,402
uh, we got a bump
coming up.

370
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:35,901
Turn your head away.
Turn your head away.

371
00:55:53,382 --> 00:55:56,818
Ohh!

372
00:56:47,269 --> 00:56:49,635
You can never
come back to this car.

373
00:56:49,705 --> 00:56:51,639
You understand?
Mm-hmm.

374
00:56:51,707 --> 00:56:55,643
Okay. We're gonna clean it out
and I'll wipe it down and we walk away.

375
00:56:55,711 --> 00:56:57,645
That's it. Okay.
Okay.

376
00:56:57,713 --> 00:57:01,410
And I'll find a place for us to rest,
and I gotta think.

377
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:03,975
Do you have a hat or a scarf
or something? For my hair?

378
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:06,146
Yeah. Just until we can change it.

379
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:08,656
Yeah. Sure. Okay.
Okay.

380
00:57:15,831 --> 00:57:19,767
Shh.! Shush.! Shh.!
Hush up.

381
00:57:19,835 --> 00:57:21,860
Shh.! Shh.!

382
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:28,600
Monsieur Kane.
Monsieur Kane.

383
00:57:28,677 --> 00:57:30,872
Ah, Monsieur Kane.

384
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:49,354
It's not him.

385
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:14,556
What do you have?

386
00:58:14,623 --> 00:58:16,716
Wombosi went to the morgue.

387
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:19,454
He saw the body.
He didn't buy it.

388
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:22,497
Where is he now?

389
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,193
I told you I'm not staffed for this.

390
00:58:25,267 --> 00:58:27,462
Where is he now?
Right now, where's Wombosi?

391
00:58:27,536 --> 00:58:29,834
They were leaving the morgue.
Theyjust left.

392
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:39,170
Sir, what do you want to do?

393
01:00:37,694 --> 01:00:40,219
I need to get that pile.

394
01:02:10,587 --> 01:02:12,578
Hey.

395
01:02:22,832 --> 01:02:25,494
You've already cleaned the room?

396
01:02:25,568 --> 01:02:29,766
I wiped the whole place down for
fingerprints.

397
01:02:32,141 --> 01:02:36,043
Can I walk around or is that gonna leave any
footprints?

398
01:02:42,252 --> 01:02:44,948
You can... walk around. It's no problem.

399
01:02:46,289 --> 01:02:49,224
But we'll just keep track of everything we touch.

400
01:02:49,292 --> 01:02:52,693
I just think
it's better if we leave a room that we're
not gonna leave a trail.

401
01:02:52,762 --> 01:02:57,358
Why? Where are we going? I need to go to the
hotel where John Michael Kane stayed...

402
01:02:57,433 --> 01:02:59,367
the Hotel Regina.

403
01:02:59,435 --> 01:03:01,903
Um, if I was him...

404
01:03:01,971 --> 01:03:03,962
then they're gonna have some records.

405
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,873
We need that hotel bill. Okay.

406
01:03:06,943 --> 01:03:09,241
It gets slightly complicated though.

407
01:03:10,914 --> 01:03:12,905
Because you're dead.

408
01:03:14,551 --> 01:03:17,418
Right.

409
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:22,517
- Sir, please. - They want war?

410
01:03:22,592 --> 01:03:27,188
Then we will give them war. If they want to
kill me, they better kill me the first time.

411
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:29,197
They better kill me dead.

412
01:03:29,265 --> 01:03:32,200
- They better kill me in my sleep. -
Nykwana, listen to me.

413
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:35,829
We need these people. It's hard enough getting people we know to help us.

414
01:03:35,905 --> 01:03:39,272
We need to be careful. - We?

415
01:03:39,342 --> 01:03:43,039
No, you. You need to bring me back that
bastard Kane's head...

416
01:03:43,112 --> 01:03:47,446
put it in front of this house and show them
what kind of war we are fighting.

417
01:04:07,203 --> 01:04:09,728
I want a reference check before we go.

418
01:04:11,474 --> 01:04:13,465
Okay.

419
01:04:15,044 --> 01:04:16,978
What's the pay phone number?

420
01:04:17,046 --> 01:04:20,072
616-2 468.

421
01:04:20,149 --> 01:04:22,879
Exits? There's three.

422
01:04:22,952 --> 01:04:27,286
Service at the back, um, side goes to the
street past the shops.

423
01:04:27,357 --> 01:04:29,291
Front is the best.

424
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:33,159
If I think I'm being followed, I walk out with the bag over my right shoulder.

425
01:04:33,229 --> 01:04:36,130
And if there's no taxi? I keep on walking...

426
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:38,429
don't look back until you make contact.

427
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:43,605
What?

428
01:04:46,643 --> 01:04:48,577
We need this, right?

429
01:04:50,513 --> 01:04:52,674
Okay.

430
01:05:03,593 --> 01:05:06,721
I need distances.

431
01:05:06,796 --> 01:05:09,629
You walk in, you pick a spot... some
midpoint in the lobby.

432
01:05:09,699 --> 01:05:13,533
I want you to count your steps to that spot
and then remember that number.

433
01:05:13,603 --> 01:05:16,697
Because after I call you, I can get you
moving. You understand?

434
01:05:16,773 --> 01:05:21,369
I also need a head count from the time you
walk in until you get to the desk.

435
01:05:21,444 --> 01:05:24,345
How many hotel employees are there? And
obviously security.

436
01:05:24,414 --> 01:05:27,349
And it might not be that easy to see who
they are.

437
01:05:27,417 --> 01:05:30,716
I'll call you. You give me the layout. We'll
take it from there.

438
01:05:57,313 --> 01:06:00,373
What happened? Did something go wrong?

439
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:03,544
I've got the records.

440
01:06:03,619 --> 01:06:06,179
This guy at the front desk was smiling at me.

441
01:06:06,255 --> 01:06:09,486
I thought... all this trouble... maybe it's easier to just ask for them.

442
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:11,493
Do you have the bill?

443
01:06:11,561 --> 01:06:14,724
He made me a photocopy.

444
01:06:14,797 --> 01:06:17,630
You just asked for it?

445
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:22,569
I said I was Mr. Kane's personal assistant.

446
01:06:22,638 --> 01:06:24,572
Oh.

447
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,599
Okay. Good thinking.

448
01:06:36,686 --> 01:06:40,087
Reschedule a meeting... Sir, can l...

449
01:06:43,059 --> 01:06:47,086
Wombosi was assassinated in his house in the
middle of Paris.

450
01:06:47,163 --> 01:06:49,097
Yeah, we just heard.

451
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,094
It's him. It's Bourne. We're almost positive.

452
01:06:53,169 --> 01:06:55,763
He had an assignment. He failed.

453
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:58,102
He obviously felt compelled to finish the
task.

454
01:06:58,174 --> 01:07:01,610
Shit. Jesus. We think he'll come back in now.

455
01:07:01,677 --> 01:07:06,239
I mean, it's routine. It's like behavioral
software.

456
01:07:07,784 --> 01:07:10,150
He's following a protocol.

457
01:07:10,219 --> 01:07:13,916
Now that
he's completed the mission, we think he'll
come back in.

458
01:07:14,991 --> 01:07:17,789
They always do. - When?

459
01:07:19,028 --> 01:07:21,826
How long till he checks in?

460
01:07:21,898 --> 01:07:23,832
Twenty-four hours. - Twenty-four hours?

461
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,391
Yeah. It's usually something like that.

462
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:30,337
Then what?

463
01:07:30,406 --> 01:07:32,601
I told you we'd clean this up.

464
01:07:32,675 --> 01:07:34,165
It will be clean.

465
01:07:37,847 --> 01:07:42,307
I understand you're a dive shop, but where are you located?

466
01:07:42,385 --> 01:07:44,319
Marseilles?

467
01:08:08,845 --> 01:08:13,009
What specifically does your company supply?
I am sorry...

468
01:08:13,082 --> 01:08:15,175
what did you say your name was, monsieur?

469
01:08:35,404 --> 01:08:37,395
What? The Paris police found the vehicle.

470
01:08:50,419 --> 01:08:53,081
You've reached the office of Simon Rawlins...

471
01:08:53,155 --> 01:08:55,646
at Alliance Securite, Maritime Division.

472
01:08:55,725 --> 01:08:59,320
The Paris office hours are from 8:00 a.m. to
5:00 p.m.

473
01:08:59,395 --> 01:09:02,296
I got a lead in Paris.

474
01:09:02,365 --> 01:09:05,801
The rest were Marseilles and... In Paris it's what?

475
01:09:05,868 --> 01:09:08,666
Uh, Alliance Securite. Simon Rawlins. I got
a machine.

476
01:09:30,826 --> 01:09:32,760
Monsieur.

477
01:09:32,828 --> 01:09:35,388
Mr. Kane?

478
01:09:35,464 --> 01:09:38,865
Mr. Kane.

479
01:09:38,935 --> 01:09:42,302
How are you? - I'm good. I'm good. How are
you?

480
01:09:46,943 --> 01:09:48,808
Oh, Mr. Kane. Come right in.

481
01:09:48,878 --> 01:09:51,779
Please, have a seat. Thank you.

482
01:09:51,847 --> 01:09:55,112
So, this is the PalmerJohnson tri-deck.

483
01:09:55,184 --> 01:09:58,915
I'm assuming you're still in the market. It's still the same vessel.

484
01:09:58,988 --> 01:10:01,252
Yes.

485
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,414
So I'm Kane.

486
01:10:26,482 --> 01:10:28,473
Hey. I just had a meeting as Kane.

487
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:31,850
They said...No. I'm definitely Kane. I just had a meeting as Kane.

488
01:10:31,921 --> 01:10:36,187
And he knew me as Kane. So
I'm definitely Bourne. I'm also definitely
Kane.

489
01:10:36,258 --> 01:10:39,386
This is all just boats. I got blueprints and
cameras.

490
01:10:39,462 --> 01:10:42,863
I just found John Michael Kane's body.

491
01:10:42,932 --> 01:10:45,162
In a morgue here in Paris.

492
01:10:45,234 --> 01:10:50,262
But if you areJohn Michael Kane, whose body
do they have?

493
01:10:57,580 --> 01:11:00,515
What was name again? - Kane.

494
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:02,744
Kane. John Michael Kane.

495
01:11:02,818 --> 01:11:04,911
John Michael Kane.

496
01:11:09,759 --> 01:11:13,217
Kane. It's number 121.

497
01:11:13,295 --> 01:11:16,128
- I want to see the body. - Our boss could
come back.

498
01:11:16,198 --> 01:11:19,224
I'm not supposed to do that.

499
01:11:19,301 --> 01:11:21,496
Come on.

500
01:11:35,785 --> 01:11:38,982
Is this it? Wh-Where is he?

501
01:11:39,055 --> 01:11:41,421
l... I don't know where.

502
01:11:49,832 --> 01:11:52,596
Who are you? What's going on here? Where's
the body?

503
01:11:52,668 --> 01:11:55,831
I said someone came last night. I know.
Where'd they take the body?

504
01:11:55,905 --> 01:11:57,930
Look, this is not a carnival, okay?

505
01:11:58,007 --> 01:12:00,737
People call. They make an appointment and
they follow the rules.

506
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:04,041
Everyone signs in and out. This is a serious
place...serious work.

507
01:12:04,113 --> 01:12:08,209
It's not just to come in whenever you like! You're
right. We didn't sign in.

508
01:12:08,284 --> 01:12:10,218
Get the hell out ofhere.

509
01:12:10,286 --> 01:12:13,585
Fine, fine. I'm just gonna go sign in. Go.

510
01:12:16,192 --> 01:12:18,524
Is this it? This is it, right?

511
01:12:18,594 --> 01:12:21,825
You can't take the book. It's okay. There's a pencil in here.

512
01:12:21,897 --> 01:12:24,058
Honey, why don't you go wait outside?

513
01:12:24,133 --> 01:12:27,330
Oh, here it is. We cannot have...Excuse me.

514
01:12:28,337 --> 01:12:30,897
Jason, what just happened in there?

515
01:12:30,973 --> 01:12:33,464
What are you looking for? - Nykwana Wombosi.

516
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:38,138
Wombosi went to the morgue to visit Kane.

517
01:12:38,214 --> 01:12:40,148
See? So?

518
01:12:40,216 --> 01:12:44,152
So, look. He's in the Alliance Securite brochure. Same guy.

519
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,381
This guy knows.

520
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,811
My French sucks. I can't...

521
01:13:19,889 --> 01:13:24,349
It says something about a boat or...

522
01:13:24,426 --> 01:13:27,554
I don't understand. What does it say? You read it.

523
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:30,497
Huh? Tell me. Wha...

524
01:13:30,566 --> 01:13:32,966
It says that three weeks before he was
killed...

525
01:13:33,035 --> 01:13:36,937
Mr. Wombosi told police that a man came on
to his yacht...

526
01:13:37,006 --> 01:13:40,339
five miles off the coast of Marseilles and
tried to kill him.

527
01:13:40,409 --> 01:13:44,778
It says that he chased the man off the boat
and shot him twice in the back.

528
01:13:46,115 --> 01:13:48,640
It says I'm an assassin.

529
01:14:36,432 --> 01:14:39,230
What's going on?

530
01:14:39,301 --> 01:14:42,270
What are you doing?

531
01:14:42,338 --> 01:14:44,898
Go. Go.

532
01:14:44,974 --> 01:14:48,102
We're blown. Come on. Blown? What is "blown"?

533
01:14:54,984 --> 01:14:57,612
Ow. Keep walking. Keep walking.

534
01:14:57,686 --> 01:15:00,655
What do you
thinkthey're doing there? They're onto the
hotel.

535
01:15:00,723 --> 01:15:03,783
No, you don't know that. Trust me. Just keep walking.

536
01:15:24,847 --> 01:15:27,315
Are you crazy? What are you doing now?

537
01:15:29,285 --> 01:15:31,219
Jason!

538
01:15:31,287 --> 01:15:33,278
This. This is "blown."

539
01:15:40,663 --> 01:15:42,597
Marie. Get away.

540
01:15:42,665 --> 01:15:44,895
Marie, stop. Get away from me.

541
01:15:44,967 --> 01:15:46,992
Stop. What are you gonna do, kill me?

542
01:15:47,069 --> 01:15:49,299
Is that what's next? Listen... Stay calm. Stay calm.

543
01:15:49,371 --> 01:15:54,001
Whatever we do, we have to do it together.
We?

544
01:15:54,076 --> 01:15:57,739
The only thing we had in common was that
neither of us knew who you were.

545
01:15:57,813 --> 01:15:59,747
We passed that now. Marie, listen to me!

546
01:15:59,815 --> 01:16:03,114
The police will find us, and the people who
took that picture in the embassy...

547
01:16:03,185 --> 01:16:05,676
the people who killed Wombosi... they are
gonna kill us.

548
01:16:05,754 --> 01:16:07,813
The people who you work for.

549
01:16:09,058 --> 01:16:11,458
I will take you wherever you need to go.

550
01:16:11,527 --> 01:16:13,518
I will take you there. I will leave you
there.

551
01:16:13,595 --> 01:16:15,790
You can do whatever you want. You never have
to see me again.

552
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:20,801
But not here. If we stay here, we die.

553
01:16:26,275 --> 01:16:30,803
Great police work. Really brilliant.

554
01:16:30,879 --> 01:16:35,441
Why
don't they justhang out a banner that says "Don't
come back"?

555
01:16:35,517 --> 01:16:40,045
Jesus Christ. What is the French word for
stakeout, huh?

556
01:16:43,926 --> 01:16:46,690
Hmm.

557
01:16:46,762 --> 01:16:49,822
Okay. This was 16 minutes ago.

558
01:16:49,898 --> 01:16:51,832
This is our starting point.

559
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:55,336
They can't fly. Trains are risky. Nicky? - Yes.

560
01:16:55,404 --> 01:17:00,569
I need to know everything
Paris's finest is doing on this. - I'm on it.

561
01:17:00,642 --> 01:17:04,578
You said 2 4 hours, and he's not back.

562
01:17:06,148 --> 01:17:09,345
No. We've got a good idea where he is.

563
01:17:09,418 --> 01:17:12,649
You've got a black ops agent who's off the
reservation.

564
01:17:12,721 --> 01:17:16,555
He's trashed an American consulate. He's on
the run in Europe. You don't know why.

565
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:20,152
I've gotta stand before an oversight committee. What am I gonna tell 'em
about Treadstone?

566
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:22,754
You're worried about a budget meeting?

567
01:17:22,831 --> 01:17:26,733
We don't take care of this, we don't make it
to the men's room.

568
01:17:26,802 --> 01:17:28,736
Is that clear enough for you?

569
01:17:28,804 --> 01:17:32,205
We will burn for this.

570
01:17:32,274 --> 01:17:34,265
We will both of us burn.

571
01:17:35,844 --> 01:17:39,439
I want two teams. Daryl, Ray, stay on the
grids.

572
01:17:39,515 --> 01:17:41,779
Brian, Harris, Steve...

573
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:45,684
I want to work on this girl. Where do we
stand with this residency pattern?

574
01:17:45,754 --> 01:17:48,279
- Uh, we started it. - Get it out.

575
01:17:52,528 --> 01:17:55,964
We cross-referenced numbers from the
grandmother and the stepbrother.

576
01:17:56,031 --> 01:17:59,967
Whenever we found convergence, we back-
checked those numbers and ran a search
merge...

577
01:18:00,035 --> 01:18:03,027
with any other data we had on her, which
wasn't much, but...

578
01:18:03,105 --> 01:18:07,371
These pins. These are all the places we
think she's lived in the last six years.

579
01:18:07,443 --> 01:18:12,107
One, two, three, four, five. That's our pool.

580
01:18:17,653 --> 01:18:21,646
No answer. How many times did you let it
ring?

581
01:18:21,723 --> 01:18:24,089
Look, if you don't wanna go, I'll hitch.

582
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:26,923
I said I'd take you.

583
01:18:26,995 --> 01:18:29,429
Those are the targets.

584
01:18:29,498 --> 01:18:32,797
Beg, borrow, hack, tap, bypass...

585
01:18:32,868 --> 01:18:35,462
I don't care what you do.

586
01:18:35,537 --> 01:18:39,735
I want to know everything you can tell me
about what's going on at those locations.

587
01:18:57,593 --> 01:18:59,925
How do you know he still owns this?

588
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:04,957
Eamon always had money. He would never sell
this.

589
01:19:22,618 --> 01:19:24,609
Scheise.

590
01:19:34,496 --> 01:19:37,090
- Marie. - What?

591
01:19:38,834 --> 01:19:40,893
We gotta go.

592
01:19:40,969 --> 01:19:44,097
What? - We gotta go.

593
01:19:44,172 --> 01:19:46,663
Oh, Scheise.

594
01:19:46,742 --> 01:19:49,609
I thought...

595
01:19:52,481 --> 01:19:55,575
Oh, shit. That's Eamon.

596
01:19:55,651 --> 01:19:57,585
I'll talk to him. We're leaving.

597
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:03,150
Eamon. Hey.

598
01:20:03,225 --> 01:20:05,159
Surprise. It's me... Marie.

599
01:20:05,227 --> 01:20:07,161
Wow, uh, God...

600
01:20:07,229 --> 01:20:10,323
There's a really good reason for this.

601
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:12,333
There bloody well better be.

602
01:20:12,401 --> 01:20:14,767
Daddy! Hang on. Just hang on.

603
01:20:16,104 --> 01:20:18,402
I had no idea you would be here.

604
01:20:18,473 --> 01:20:23,308
Well, why would I be here? It's only my bloody house, right?

605
01:20:23,378 --> 01:20:27,212
Yeah. Did she get you into this?

606
01:20:29,017 --> 01:20:31,178
It was just gonna be for a day.

607
01:20:31,253 --> 01:20:34,279
Daddy, Alan has to go to pee.

608
01:20:34,356 --> 01:20:37,484
All right. Come on. Get out of the car.

609
01:20:40,596 --> 01:20:43,429
Come on, Alan.

610
01:20:43,498 --> 01:20:45,762
I'm sorry. I thought it was... would be okay.

611
01:20:45,834 --> 01:20:47,768
But I guess I was wrong.

612
01:20:47,836 --> 01:20:51,272
Let's find Mummy. Mummy is away for two days, thank God.

613
01:20:57,012 --> 01:21:00,413
You've got yourself all tied up. Okay.

614
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:06,518
What's he do for a living?

615
01:21:07,522 --> 01:21:10,923
He used to be in shipping. Uh-huh.

616
01:21:11,927 --> 01:21:15,727
Is he good for you? Are you happy?

617
01:21:15,797 --> 01:21:17,924
You know me. I try too hard.

618
01:21:41,303 --> 01:21:44,431
Here you go.

619
01:21:44,506 --> 01:21:47,304
Sleep well. Good night.

620
01:21:48,944 --> 01:21:50,935
I'll sleep on the floor.

621
01:21:57,152 --> 01:21:59,643
This was when? 11:45 a.m.

622
01:21:59,721 --> 01:22:03,350
Which is definitely within the driving range
of Paris.

623
01:22:03,425 --> 01:22:07,589
- The call came from a highway rest stop,
southbound side. - What's this yellow pin?

624
01:22:07,663 --> 01:22:10,029
She spent a couple of months there in 1997.

625
01:22:10,098 --> 01:22:12,123
Closest town is Riome.

626
01:22:13,869 --> 01:22:17,305
We took her family's phone records and collated the international calls.

627
01:22:17,372 --> 01:22:19,499
They were in Paris at 2:00 a.m.

628
01:22:19,574 --> 01:22:22,441
They can't fly. Train's too dangerous.

629
01:22:22,511 --> 01:22:27,005
He knows better than to go anywhere we might
track him. So this is our best guess.

630
01:23:24,806 --> 01:23:28,503
What are you doing here? The kids...

631
01:23:28,577 --> 01:23:30,909
I was worried. You're gonna wake them up.

632
01:23:30,979 --> 01:23:34,506
We gotta... I don't wanna know who I am anymore.

633
01:23:34,583 --> 01:23:37,848
Shh. I don't care. I don't wanna know.

634
01:23:39,588 --> 01:23:43,183
Come on. We'll... Everything I found out, I wanna forget.

635
01:23:43,258 --> 01:23:45,192
It's okay.

636
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:48,320
I don't care who I am or what I did.

637
01:23:49,698 --> 01:23:52,861
It's okay. We have this money.

638
01:23:52,934 --> 01:23:54,925
We can hide.

639
01:23:57,038 --> 01:24:00,474
Could we do that? Is there any chance you
can do that?

640
01:24:07,315 --> 01:24:10,580
I don't know.

641
01:24:14,523 --> 01:24:16,514
Come on.

642
01:24:23,565 --> 01:24:25,499
Guy. Guy.

643
01:24:25,567 --> 01:24:27,899
Here, boy.

644
01:24:27,969 --> 01:24:30,597
Here, boy. Here, boy. Morning.

645
01:24:30,672 --> 01:24:34,836
Christ, you're up early. Bless you for making coffee.

646
01:24:42,984 --> 01:24:45,316
One night... you weren't kidding.

647
01:24:45,387 --> 01:24:47,287
For a change.

648
01:24:47,355 --> 01:24:51,018
He's not there either.

649
01:24:51,092 --> 01:24:53,356
You looked by the car? He's not anywhere.

650
01:24:53,428 --> 01:24:56,454
All right. Let me get dressed.

651
01:24:56,531 --> 01:24:59,261
Who? Bloody dog's gone missing.

652
01:24:59,334 --> 01:25:01,268
Does that happen a lot?

653
01:25:01,336 --> 01:25:03,702
That mutt miss his breakfast? Not a chance.

654
01:25:03,772 --> 01:25:06,104
It's always something, right?

655
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:09,309
Get in the basement.

656
01:25:09,377 --> 01:25:12,039
What?

657
01:25:12,113 --> 01:25:15,480
- Get everyone in the basement. - What the
hell are you talking about?

658
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:18,644
We're in danger. Your family's in danger. I
don't have time to explain.

659
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,553
- What the... - Eamon, you should go.

660
01:25:21,623 --> 01:25:24,524
What the hell have you done?
It's not her. It's me.

661
01:25:24,593 --> 01:25:28,654
You need to get out of sight and in the
basement as quick as you can.

662
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:31,324
Daddy.

663
01:25:34,102 --> 01:25:36,002
I'm sorry.

664
01:25:36,071 --> 01:25:38,062
Let's go.

665
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:57,390
The phone is dead.

666
01:25:57,459 --> 01:25:59,552
Yeah.

667
01:25:59,628 --> 01:26:01,687
Jason, who's out there?

668
01:26:01,763 --> 01:26:03,856
Who is it?

669
01:26:10,071 --> 01:26:12,369
Scheise. Scheise.

670
01:26:19,447 --> 01:26:21,915
What are you doing?

671
01:26:27,856 --> 01:26:30,450
We should never have come here. L... These
children...

672
01:26:30,525 --> 01:26:32,891
That's not gonna happen.

673
01:28:58,573 --> 01:29:01,474
Where is it?

674
01:29:01,543 --> 01:29:04,512
Where's the weapon?

675
01:29:05,947 --> 01:29:07,881
Who else is out here?

676
01:29:07,949 --> 01:29:10,850
How many you got with you? I'm not gonna ask you again.

677
01:29:10,919 --> 01:29:14,377
I work alone, like you.

678
01:29:16,124 --> 01:29:18,058
We always work alone.

679
01:29:18,126 --> 01:29:20,788
What do you mean? Who are you? Bonn?

680
01:29:20,862 --> 01:29:23,330
Paris?

681
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:26,858
Treadstone... both of us.

682
01:29:26,935 --> 01:29:28,869
Treadstone? Which one?

683
01:29:28,937 --> 01:29:31,770
Paris. I live in Paris. Do you still get the
headaches?

684
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,774
Yeah.

685
01:29:33,842 --> 01:29:36,640
I get such bad headaches.

686
01:29:36,711 --> 01:29:38,975
You know at night when you're driving a car?

687
01:29:39,047 --> 01:29:41,777
Maybe it's something to do with the headlights. What is Treadstone?

688
01:29:42,851 --> 01:29:46,548
Treadstone... said, "Pioze..."

689
01:29:47,555 --> 01:29:49,955
They said, "Go to Paris."

690
01:29:50,024 --> 01:29:52,492
Is Treadstone in Paris?

691
01:29:54,028 --> 01:29:56,019
Look at this.

692
01:29:57,332 --> 01:29:59,323
Look at what they make you give.

693
01:30:23,992 --> 01:30:26,722
All right. All right. All right. All right.

694
01:30:26,794 --> 01:30:29,558
Right, get in the front, put your belt on.

695
01:30:29,631 --> 01:30:31,861
We're just gonna put you in the back.

696
01:30:31,933 --> 01:30:33,924
Get in the front, Polly.

697
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,432
- I'm not waiting, Marie. - One minute, Eamon.

698
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:44,501
I'm not waiting! Please!

699
01:30:44,579 --> 01:30:46,877
Take it.

700
01:30:46,948 --> 01:30:50,384
I took out 30 grand. The rest is yours.

701
01:30:50,451 --> 01:30:53,682
That's it? That's all I got.

702
01:30:53,755 --> 01:30:56,690
No, that's not what I meant.

703
01:30:56,758 --> 01:30:59,352
This is not gonna stop, Marie.

704
01:30:59,427 --> 01:31:02,123
You gotta get out now, away from me.

705
01:31:03,431 --> 01:31:05,558
You gotta get out. You gotta start running.

706
01:31:05,633 --> 01:31:07,567
You get low. You stay low.

707
01:31:07,635 --> 01:31:11,366
No more friends. Nothing familiar.

708
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:14,738
There's enough in there for you to make a life.

709
01:31:14,809 --> 01:31:17,334
Any life. - I'm out ofhere, Marie.

710
01:31:17,412 --> 01:31:19,403
Hey.

711
01:31:21,049 --> 01:31:23,040
Get in the car. You gotta go.

712
01:31:28,456 --> 01:31:31,186
What are you gonna do?

713
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:35,195
I'll end it. Go ahead.

714
01:31:37,131 --> 01:31:39,122
Please.

715
01:32:56,644 --> 01:32:59,306
Code in, please.

716
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:01,507
Code in.

717
01:33:04,986 --> 01:33:07,454
- Code in.

718
01:33:09,857 --> 01:33:11,791
Who is this?

719
01:33:17,732 --> 01:33:20,428
Who the hell are you?

720
01:33:23,171 --> 01:33:25,105
The man you sent is dead.

721
01:33:25,173 --> 01:33:27,801
So whoever this is, you better start talking.

722
01:33:29,344 --> 01:33:31,437
Hello, Jason.

723
01:33:31,512 --> 01:33:33,742
So what are we into now?

724
01:33:37,518 --> 01:33:40,419
Come on. It only goes two ways, Jason.

725
01:33:40,488 --> 01:33:44,652
Come in and let us make thisright, or
we're gonna keep going until we're satisfied.

726
01:33:44,726 --> 01:33:46,557
You mean until you kill me.

727
01:33:48,262 --> 01:33:50,890
I can't fix this if I don't know what the
problem is.

728
01:33:50,965 --> 01:33:54,457
So tell me what we're into, and I'll do the
best I can.

729
01:34:02,076 --> 01:34:06,103
Why don't you talk to Marie, Jason?

730
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:10,014
Let's ask Marie what she wants to do. I don't
think she gives a shit.

731
01:34:10,084 --> 01:34:12,143
She's dead.

732
01:34:20,762 --> 01:34:23,424
I'm sorry to hear that. How did that happen?

733
01:34:23,498 --> 01:34:26,194
She was slowing me down.

734
01:34:26,267 --> 01:34:29,031
Jason, listen. All we've been doing right from...

735
01:34:29,103 --> 01:34:31,537
Enough. Enough.

736
01:34:31,606 --> 01:34:35,940
5:30 p.m. Paris. Today. Pont Neuf.

737
01:34:36,010 --> 01:34:38,535
You come alone. You walk to the middle of
that bridge.

738
01:34:38,613 --> 01:34:40,604
You take off yourjacket. Face east.

739
01:34:40,681 --> 01:34:42,842
I'll redial this number. Jason, wait.

740
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:58,020
First flight out. Tell Nicky I'll call from the car. Tell her to find Picot now. Go.

741
01:35:00,635 --> 01:35:03,229
So... what are we gonna do?

742
01:35:03,304 --> 01:35:06,273
I told you I'd clean this up. That's what I'm doing.

743
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:08,433
Can you really bring him in?

744
01:35:08,509 --> 01:35:11,808
I think we're past that, don't you?

745
01:35:11,879 --> 01:35:15,781
Do you have a better idea? You've given me nothing but a trail of collateral damage.

746
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:18,250
I don't think I could do much worse.

747
01:35:18,319 --> 01:35:21,345
Why don't you go upstairs and book a conference room?

748
01:35:21,422 --> 01:35:23,856
Maybe you can talk him to death.

749
01:36:40,902 --> 01:36:43,564
The bus. The tour bus.

750
01:36:43,638 --> 01:36:46,368
Negative.

751
01:36:48,175 --> 01:36:51,633
Position one. - Negative.

752
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:53,737
Position two. - Negative.

753
01:37:09,463 --> 01:37:12,557
Position three... motorcycle.

754
01:37:12,633 --> 01:37:15,761
Negative.

755
01:37:35,323 --> 01:37:37,086
En position.

756
01:37:39,594 --> 01:37:42,461
- Jason? - I told you to come alone.

757
01:37:42,530 --> 01:37:44,589
I guess that was too complicated.

758
01:37:44,665 --> 01:37:47,031
So try this... I'm gone.

759
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:00,914
- Get Nicky on the phone.

760
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:17,564
Yeah.

761
01:38:17,632 --> 01:38:20,965
How long does it take to wipe the room down
and get it moved?

762
01:38:21,035 --> 01:38:22,969
- Get rid of everything? - Yeah.

763
01:38:23,037 --> 01:38:25,665
Two to three hours. All right. Get started.

764
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,646
Listen, no breaks. Two men outside, one in
the lobby and keep your eyes open.

765
01:38:40,054 --> 01:38:43,512
- Keep the truck? - Keep the truck. I'm gonna close this unit down.

766
01:38:43,591 --> 01:38:45,582
We'll move the gear in the truck.

767
01:39:02,777 --> 01:39:06,873
They were covering Spain, Malta, Morocco.
Yes, all local police radio traffic.

768
01:39:06,947 --> 01:39:11,008
No. For northern Europe we need an
authorized directive.

769
01:39:11,085 --> 01:39:16,148
Yeah. Okay. They're on it. We'll have a
satellite download in 30 minutes.

770
01:40:24,024 --> 01:40:26,458
Where's your field box?

771
01:40:30,831 --> 01:40:34,028
- Where's your field box? - It's right there.

772
01:40:34,101 --> 01:40:37,901
The system's gone haywire.

773
01:40:37,972 --> 01:40:40,236
That's this window right here.

774
01:40:40,307 --> 01:40:42,571
Dining room window?

775
01:40:42,643 --> 01:40:45,077
I don't get...

776
01:40:47,481 --> 01:40:50,575
Dead. The phones are dead.

777
01:40:50,651 --> 01:40:54,644
It's Bourne, isn't it?

778
01:40:54,722 --> 01:40:56,713
Just quiet.

779
01:41:43,370 --> 01:41:45,668
You move, you die.

780
01:41:45,739 --> 01:41:47,934
- Bourne. - Gun down.

781
01:41:53,447 --> 01:41:56,348
In there.

782
01:41:57,685 --> 01:42:00,654
Okay, so what do you want? Treadstone.

783
01:42:00,721 --> 01:42:02,712
You better take a look around.

784
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:04,849
There's not much left. Are you Treadstone?

785
01:42:04,925 --> 01:42:08,053
Am I Treadstone? Me? What the hell are you
talking about?

786
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,062
He's lost it.

787
01:42:10,130 --> 01:42:13,827
You better start filling in the blanks,
cause I thought we were on the same side.

788
01:42:13,901 --> 01:42:17,564
Who's side is that? You don't know what you're doing, do you, Jason?

789
01:42:17,638 --> 01:42:21,699
- You don't have a goddamn clue. - Who am I?

790
01:42:21,775 --> 01:42:23,709
You're U.S. government property.

791
01:42:23,777 --> 01:42:27,008
You're a malfunctioning, $30-million-dollar weapon.

792
01:42:27,081 --> 01:42:29,072
You're a total goddamn catastrophe.

793
01:42:29,149 --> 01:42:33,210
By God, you're gonna tell me how this happened. Why are you trying to kill me?

794
01:42:33,287 --> 01:42:36,051
- What happened in Marseilles? - Why are you
try...

795
01:42:36,123 --> 01:42:39,354
You sent me to kill Wombosi. Kill Wombosi?

796
01:42:39,426 --> 01:42:44,386
We can do that anytime we want. I can send
Nicky to do that, for Christ's sake.

797
01:42:44,465 --> 01:42:47,195
Mr. Wombosi was supposed to be dead three
weeks ago.

798
01:42:47,268 --> 01:42:50,931
He was supposed to have died in a way where
the only possible explanation was...

799
01:42:51,005 --> 01:42:54,099
that he'd been murdered by a member of his own entourage.

800
01:42:54,174 --> 01:42:57,735
I don't send you to kill. I send you to be invisible.

801
01:42:57,811 --> 01:42:59,870
I send you because you don't exist.

802
01:42:59,947 --> 01:43:02,381
I want to know what happened in Marseilles.

803
01:43:02,449 --> 01:43:05,247
I don't remember what happened in Marseilles.

804
01:43:05,319 --> 01:43:09,915
Bullshit! This is unacceptable, Soldier. You
hear me? You failed.

805
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:12,925
Unacceptable? You failed! You failed, and
you're gonna tell me why.

806
01:43:12,993 --> 01:43:16,258
I can't tell you. I don't re... You brought
John Michael Kane to life.

807
01:43:16,330 --> 01:43:19,857
You put together a meeting with Wombosi. You
found the security company.

808
01:43:19,934 --> 01:43:24,598
You broke into the office. You're the one who picked the yacht as the strike point.

809
01:43:33,113 --> 01:43:36,105
You picked the boat. You picked the day.

810
01:43:36,183 --> 01:43:38,743
You tracked the crew, the food, the fuel.

811
01:43:38,819 --> 01:43:41,253
You told us where. You told us when.

812
01:43:41,322 --> 01:43:45,088
You hid out on that boat five days.

813
01:43:45,159 --> 01:43:49,596
You were in, Jason. You were in. It was over.

814
01:44:49,223 --> 01:44:52,351
No, you do remember.

815
01:44:54,895 --> 01:44:56,886
Don't you?

816
01:45:02,536 --> 01:45:04,527
I don't wanna do this anymore.

817
01:45:04,605 --> 01:45:08,063
I don't think that's a decision you can make.

818
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:15,971
Jason Bourne is dead. Do you hear me?

819
01:45:16,050 --> 01:45:18,018
He drowned two weeks ago.

820
01:45:18,085 --> 01:45:20,417
You're gonna go tell 'em that Jason Bourne
is dead.

821
01:45:20,487 --> 01:45:22,546
Do you understand? Where are you gonna go?

822
01:45:22,623 --> 01:45:25,820
I swear to God, if I even feel somebody
behind me...

823
01:45:25,893 --> 01:45:30,592
there is no measure to how fast and how hard
I will bring this fight to your doorstep.

824
01:45:30,664 --> 01:45:32,894
I'm on my own side now.

825
01:49:07,481 --> 01:49:09,415
It's done.

826
01:49:09,483 --> 01:49:12,577
Shut it down.

827
01:49:49,089 --> 01:49:52,081
The Treadstone Project has already been
terminated.

828
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:55,322
It was designed primarily as a sort of
advanced game program.

829
01:49:55,395 --> 01:49:57,955
We'd hoped it might build into a good training platform...

830
01:49:58,031 --> 01:50:01,330
but, quite honestly, for a strictly
theoretical exercise...

831
01:50:01,401 --> 01:50:04,427
the cost-benefit ratio was just too high.

832
01:50:04,504 --> 01:50:06,495
It's all but decommissioned at this point.

833
01:50:06,573 --> 01:50:08,871
All right. What's next? Okay.

834
01:50:08,942 --> 01:50:13,038
This is...Black Briar.

835
01:50:13,113 --> 01:50:16,082
Black Briar is a joint D.O.D. communications
program...

836
01:50:16,149 --> 01:50:18,174
that we really feel has good traction.

837
01:50:18,251 --> 01:50:20,742
It's got legs. It'll run and run.

838
01:50:20,821 --> 01:50:24,416
It combines elements of...

839
01:51:08,568 --> 01:51:11,401
This your store? - Yeah.

840
01:51:12,406 --> 01:51:15,000
It's nice.

841
01:51:15,075 --> 01:51:17,202
It's a little hard to find, but...

842
01:51:20,947 --> 01:51:23,848
Think I could rent a scooter?

843
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:28,454
You have I.D.?

844
01:51:30,123 --> 01:51:32,114
Not really.
