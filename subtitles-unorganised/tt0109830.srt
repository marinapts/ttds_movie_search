Hello. My name's
Forrest... Forrest Gump.

00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:29,439
Do you want a chocolate?

3
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,447
I could eat about a million
and a half of these.

4
00:03:36,514 --> 00:03:38,448
My mama always said

5
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:42,247
life was like
a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:46,449
You never know what
you're going to get.

7
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:56,800
Those must be
comfortable shoes.

8
00:03:56,868 --> 00:04:00,235
I bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that

9
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:02,239
and not feel a thing.

10
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:07,912
I wish I had shoes like that.

11
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,413
My feet hurt.

12
00:04:10,482 --> 00:04:12,416
Mama always said
there's an awful lot

13
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:16,420
you can tell about
a person by their shoes.

14

15
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,957
where they've been.

16
00:04:26,998 --> 00:04:29,558
I've worn lots of shoes.

17
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:34,438
I bet if I think
about it real hard

18
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,940
I could remember
my first pair of shoes.

19
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:42,780
Mama said they'd
take me anywhere.

All right, Forrest,
open your eyes now.

22
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:57,823
Let's take a little walk around.

23
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:07,061
How do those feel?

24
00:05:10,474 --> 00:05:12,772
His legs are strong,
Mrs. Gump,

25
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:15,277
as strong as I've ever seen.

26
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:19,406
But his back's as
crooked as a politician.

27
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:22,850
But we're going to straighten him
right up, aren't we, Forrest?

28

<i>Now, when I was a baby,</i>

30
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,754
<i>Mama named me after</i>
<i>the great Civil War hero</i>

31
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:30,828
<i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i>

<i>She said we was related</i>
<i>to him in some way.</i>

34
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:36,932
<i>What he did was,</i>

35
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,436
<i>he started up this club</i>
<i>called the Ku Klux Klan.</i>

36
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:43,940
<i>They'd all dress up in their robes</i>
<i>and their bedsheets</i>

37
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:48,444
<i>and act like a bunch</i>
<i>of ghosts or spooks or something.</i>

38
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:52,448
<i>They'd even put bedsheets</i>
<i>on their horses and ride around.</i>

39
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:56,577
<i>And, anyway, that's how</i>
<i>I got my name... Forrest Gump.</i>

40
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:59,986
<i>Mama said the Forrest part</i>
<i>was to remind me</i>

41
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:02,992
<i>that sometimes we all</i>
<i>do things that, well,</i>

42
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,494
<i>that just don't make no sense.</i>

43

00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,668
All right.

45
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:21,677
What are y'all staring at?

46
00:06:21,745 --> 00:06:23,178
Haven't you ever seen

47
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:26,238
a little boy with braces
on his legs before?

48
00:06:27,484 --> 00:06:28,917
Don't ever let anybody

49
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:31,419
tell you they're better
than you, Forrest.

50
00:06:31,488 --> 00:06:33,922
If God intended everybody
to be the same,

51
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,925
he'd have given us all
braces on our legs.

<i>and we had all these empty rooms,</i>

61
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,554
<i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i>

62

<i>Some years later,</i>

159
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:05,951
<i>that handsome young man</i>
<i>who they called the King,</i>

160
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:08,920
<i>well, he sung too many songs.</i>

161
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:11,923
<i>Had himself a heart attack</i>
<i>or something.</i>

162
00:12:11,991 --> 00:12:14,983
It must be hard being a king.

163
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:20,932
You know, it's funny how you
remember some things,

164
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,932
but some things you can't.

165
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:25,468
You do your very best now, Forrest.

166
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:27,938
I sure will, Mama.

167
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:31,534
<i>I remember the bus ride</i>
<i>on the first day of school</i>

168
00:12:31,611 --> 00:12:32,942
<i>very well.</i>

169
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:37,880
Are you coming along?

170
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:41,443
Mama said not to be
taking rides from strangers.

171
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:44,046
This is the bus to school.

172
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:49,324
I'm Forrest...
Forrest Gump.

173
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:51,192
I'm Dorothy Harris.

174
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:53,698
Well, now we ain't
strangers anymore.

175
00:13:06,446 --> 00:13:09,142
This seat's taken.

176
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:12,014
It's taken.

177
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:22,017
You can't sit here.

178
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:28,267
<i>You know, it's funny what</i>
<i>a young man recollects,</i>

179
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:30,666
<i>'cause I don't</i>
<i>remember being born.</i>

180
00:13:30,737 --> 00:13:34,138
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

181
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:35,640
and I don't know

182
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,142
when I went on
my first outdoor picnic,

183
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:39,644
but I do remember

184
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:43,705
the first time I heard
the sweetest voice

185
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:45,683
<i>in the wide world.</i>

186
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:48,687
You can sit here
if you want.

187
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:54,892
<i>I had never seen anything</i>
<i>so beautiful in my life.</i>

188
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:57,555
<i>She was like an angel.</i>

189
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,396
Well, are you going to
sit down or aren't you?

190
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,530
What's wrong with your legs?

191
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:09,541
Um, nothing at all, thank you.

192
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:12,407
My legs are just fine and dandy.

193
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:15,413
<i>I just sat next to her</i>
<i>on that bus</i>

194
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:18,416
<i>and had a conversation</i>
<i>all the way to school.</i>

195
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:20,918
My back's crooked
like a question mark.

196
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:23,615
<i>Next to Mama,</i>
<i>no one ever talked to me</i>

197
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,090
<i>or asked me questions.</i>

198
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,423
Are you stupid or something?

199
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:31,554
Mama says,
"Stupid is as stupid does."

200
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:34,623
I'm Jenny.

201
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:37,261
I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.

202
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,770
<i>From that day on,</i>
<i>we was always together.</i>

203
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,399
<i>Jenny and me</i>
<i>was like peas and carrots.</i>

204
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,411
<i>She taught me how to climb.</i>

205
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,971
Come on, Forrest,
you can do it.

206
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,711
<i>I showed her how to dangle.</i>

207
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:54,309
"A good little..."

208
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:56,821
<i>She helped me</i>
<i>learn how to read,</i>

209
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:59,983
<i>and I showed her how to swing.</i>

210
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:03,561
<i>Sometimes, we'd just sit out</i>

211
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:05,927
<i>and wait for the stars.</i>

212
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:08,466
Mama's going to worry about me.

213
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,435
Just stay a little longer.

214
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:15,600
<i>For some reason,</i>
<i>Jenny didn't never want to go home.</i>

215
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:18,439
O.K., Jenny, I'll stay.

216
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:22,811
<i>She was my most special friend.</i>

217
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:26,780
My only friend.

218
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:31,456
Now, my mama always told me

219
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:33,458
that miracles happen every day.

220
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:35,460
Some people don't think so,

221
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:37,018
but they do.

222
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:41,391
Hey, dummy!

223
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:44,936
Are you dumb,
or just plain stupid?

224
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:46,767
Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.

225
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:48,170
Just run away, Forrest.

226
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:50,607
Run, Forrest!

227
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:52,769
Run away! Hurry!

228
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:54,403
Get the bikes!

229
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,277
Let's get him! Come on!

230
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:58,146
Look out, Gump!

231
00:15:58,217 --> 00:16:01,084
We're going to get you!

232
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:03,281
Run, Forrest, run!

233
00:16:03,356 --> 00:16:05,381
Run, Forrest!

234
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:08,317
Come back here, you!

235
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:12,592
Ha ha ha ha ha!

236
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:24,907
Run, Forrest!

237
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:26,569
Run!

238
00:16:57,043 --> 00:16:59,773
<i>Now, you wouldn't</i>
<i>believe if I told you...</i>

239
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:04,078
but I could run
like the wind blows.

240
00:17:05,918 --> 00:17:08,409
From that day on,

241
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,921
if I was going somewhere,

242
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,356
I was running.

243
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:49,561
That boy sure
is a running fool.

244
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,464
<i>Now, remember how I told you</i>

245
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,467
<i>that Jenny never seemed</i>
<i>to want to go home?</i>

246
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,902
<i>She lived in a house</i>
<i>that was as old as Alabama.</i>

247
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:03,600
<i>Her mama had gone</i>
<i>to heaven when she was 5,</i>

248
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:08,112
<i>and her daddy was</i>
<i>some kind of a farmer.</i>

249
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:09,407
Jenny?

250
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,415
<i>He was a very loving man.</i>

251
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:16,647
<i>He was always kissing</i>
<i>and touching her and her sisters.</i>

252
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:20,423
<i>And then this one time,</i>

253
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:23,426
<i>Jenny wasn't on the bus</i>
<i>to go to school.</i>

254
00:18:23,494 --> 00:18:25,928
Jenny, why didn't you
come to school today?

255
00:18:25,997 --> 00:18:28,431
Shh. Daddy's taking a nap.

256
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:29,591
Jenny!

257
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,931
Come on!

258
00:18:32,003 --> 00:18:34,938
Jenny, where'd you run to?

259
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:37,531
You better
get back here, girl!

260
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:41,675
Where you at?

261
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:46,449
Jenny!

262
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:48,382
Jenny, where you at?

263
00:18:51,189 --> 00:18:52,156
Jenny!

264
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:54,157
Pray with me, Forrest.

265
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:55,658
Pray with me.

266
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:56,955
Jenny!

267
00:18:57,028 --> 00:19:00,327
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

268
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:02,332
far, far away from here.

269
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,337
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far.

270
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:10,340
<i>Mama always said</i>
<i>God is mysterious.</i>

271
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:11,739
Jenny!

272
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,744
<i>He didn't turn Jenny</i>
<i>into a bird that day.</i>

273
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:16,575
<i>Instead,</i>

274
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:18,582
<i>he had the police say</i>

275
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,086
<i>Jenny didn't have to stay</i>
<i>in that house no more.</i>

276
00:19:22,153 --> 00:19:24,587
<i>She was to live</i>
<i>with her grandma,</i>

277
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:26,590
<i>just over on Creekmore Avenue,</i>

278
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:30,651
<i>which made me happy,</i>
<i>'cause she was so close.</i>

279
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:33,122
<i>Some nights,</i>

280
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:35,131
<i>Jenny'd sneak out</i>

281
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:37,633
<i>and come on over to my house,</i>

282
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:40,136
<i>just 'cause</i>
<i>she said she was scared.</i>

283
00:19:40,204 --> 00:19:43,196
<i>Scared of what,</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

284
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:45,936
<i>But I think</i>
<i>it was her grandma's dog.</i>

285
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,945
<i>He was a mean dog.</i>

286
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:52,176
<i>Anyway, Jenny and me</i>
<i>was best friends</i>

287
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,740
<i>all the way up</i>
<i>through high school.</i>

288
00:19:54,752 --> 00:19:56,185
Hey, stupid!

289
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:58,222
Quit it!

290
00:19:58,289 --> 00:19:59,722
Run, Forrest, run!

291
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,190
Hey,

292
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:03,284
didn't you hear me, stupid?

293
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:04,293
Run, Forrest!

294
00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:05,693
Get in the truck!

295
00:20:05,763 --> 00:20:09,096
Come on!
He's getting away! Move it!

296
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,635
Run, Forrest! Run!

297
00:20:15,073 --> 00:20:16,335
Ha, ha!

298
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:18,602
Move it! Move it!

299
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,507
You better be runnin'!

300
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:33,989
Yeah!

301
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:36,720
- Whoo-hoo!
- Go!

302
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,821
Run, Forrest!

303
00:20:43,968 --> 00:20:45,492
Now, it used to be

304
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,505
I ran to get
where I was going.

305
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:51,906
I never thought
it would take me anywhere.

306
00:21:16,934 --> 00:21:17,866
Ohh!

307
00:21:20,538 --> 00:21:22,597
Who in the hell is that?

308
00:21:22,673 --> 00:21:25,471
That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

309
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:27,534
Just a local idiot.

310
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:29,978
<i>And can you believe it?</i>

311
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:32,845
<i>I got to go to college, too.</i>

312
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:39,989
Forrest, move it!

313
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:40,989
Run!

314
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:41,990
O.K.!

315
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,151
Run!

316
00:21:43,227 --> 00:21:46,060
Run, you stupid
son of a bitch! Run!

317
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,811
Run, son of a bitch, run!
Go! Run!

318
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:06,711
Run! Run! Go!

00:30:29,716 --> 00:30:32,150
<i>I got to pee.</i>

481
00:30:32,218 --> 00:30:34,743
<i>I believe he said</i>
<i>he had to pee.</i>

482
00:30:49,335 --> 00:30:52,099
<i>Some time later,</i>
<i>for no particular reason,</i>

483
00:30:52,172 --> 00:30:55,471
<i>somebody shot</i>
<i>that nice young president</i>

484
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:57,942
<i>when he was riding</i>
<i>in his car.</i>

485
00:30:58,011 --> 00:30:59,876
<i>And a few years after that,</i>

486
00:30:59,946 --> 00:31:02,380
<i>somebody shot</i>
<i>his little brother, too,</i>

487
00:31:02,448 --> 00:31:04,780
<i>only he was</i>
<i>in a hotel kitchen.</i>

488
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:08,112
Must be hard being brothers.

489
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:11,020
I wouldn't know.

490
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:12,486
Forrest Gump.

491
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,992
<i>Now can you believe it?</i>

492
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,494
<i>After only five years</i>
<i>of playing football,</i>

493
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:18,155
<i>I got a college degree.</i>

494
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:20,825
Congratulations, son.

495
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,027
<i>Mama was so proud.</i>

496
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,534
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.

497
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:28,198
I'll hold this for you.

498
00:31:28,274 --> 00:31:30,367
Congratulations, son.

499
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:33,037
Have you given any thought
to your future?

500
00:31:35,114 --> 00:31:36,581
Thought?

501
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:39,751
Hello. I'm Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

502
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:41,411
Nobody gives a horse's shit

503
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:43,079
who you are, pus ball!

504
00:31:43,156 --> 00:31:45,920
You're not even a lowlife,
scum-sucking maggot!

505
00:31:45,992 --> 00:31:48,256
Get your maggoty ass
on the bus!

506
00:31:48,328 --> 00:31:49,761
You're in the army now!

507
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:51,592
Seat's taken.

508
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:54,925
Taken.

509
00:31:58,004 --> 00:32:00,905
<i>At first it seemed</i>
<i>like I made a mistake.</i>

510
00:32:00,974 --> 00:32:02,908
<i>It was only</i>
<i>my induction day,</i>

511
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:05,035
<i>and I was getting yelled at.</i>

512
00:32:08,615 --> 00:32:11,209
Sit down if you want to.

513
00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:13,548
<i>I didn't know who I might meet</i>

514
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,053
<i>or what they might ask.</i>

515
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:17,885
You ever been
on a real shrimp boat?

516
00:32:17,957 --> 00:32:19,720
No.

517
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:22,556
But I been on a real big boat.

518
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:25,564
I'm talking about
a shrimp catching boat.

519
00:32:25,632 --> 00:32:28,567
I been working on
shrimp boats all my life.

520
00:32:28,635 --> 00:32:30,899
I started out
on my uncle's boat

521
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,904
when I was about maybe 9.

522
00:32:32,972 --> 00:32:35,907
I was just looking
into buying my own boat

523
00:32:35,975 --> 00:32:37,909
and got drafted.

524
00:32:37,977 --> 00:32:41,242
My given name
is Benjamin Buford Blue.

525
00:32:41,314 --> 00:32:43,578
People call me Bubba,

526
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,084
just like one of them
old redneck boys.

527
00:32:46,152 --> 00:32:47,414
Can you believe that?

528
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:49,580
My name's Forrest Gump.

529
00:32:49,656 --> 00:32:51,920
People call me Forrest Gump.

530
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:54,926
<i>So Bubba was from</i>
<i>Bayou La Batre, Alabama,</i>

531
00:32:54,994 --> 00:32:56,723
<i>and his mama cooked shrimp.</i>

532
00:32:58,698 --> 00:33:01,064
<i>And her mama</i>
<i>before her cooked shrimp,</i>

533
00:33:01,134 --> 00:33:04,729
<i>and her mama before her mama</i>
<i>cooked shrimp, too.</i>

534
00:33:04,804 --> 00:33:06,567
<i>Bubba's family knew everything</i>

535
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:09,073
<i>there was to know about</i>
<i>the shrimping business.</i>

536
00:33:09,142 --> 00:33:11,406
I know everything
there is to know

537
00:33:11,477 --> 00:33:12,739
about the shrimping business.

538
00:33:12,812 --> 00:33:15,246
I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

539
00:33:15,315 --> 00:33:17,579
after I get out of the army.

540
00:33:20,486 --> 00:33:21,475
O.K.

541
00:33:21,554 --> 00:33:22,816
Gump!

542
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:25,483
What's your sole purpose
in this army?

543
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:27,992
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

544
00:33:28,061 --> 00:33:31,656
God damn it, Gump,
you're a goddamn genius.

545
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:34,165
That's the most outstanding
answer I've ever heard.

546
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:36,827
You must have
a goddamn I.Q. Of 160.

547
00:33:36,903 --> 00:33:39,497
You are goddamn gifted,
Private Gump.

548
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,004
Listen up, people!

549
00:33:43,076 --> 00:33:46,011
<i>Now for some reason,</i>
<i>I fit in the army</i>

550
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:48,013
<i>like one of them round pegs.</i>

551
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:49,343
<i>It's not really hard.</i>

552
00:33:49,415 --> 00:33:51,349
<i>You just make your bed neat,</i>

553
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:52,850
<i>remember to stand up straight,</i>

554
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,511
<i>and always answer every question</i>

555
00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:56,521
<i>with "Yes, Drill Sergeant."</i>

556
00:33:56,589 --> 00:33:58,022
Is that clear?

557
00:33:58,091 --> 00:34:00,355
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

558
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:03,862
What you do is drag your nets
along the bottom.

559
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,192
On a good day,

560
00:34:05,264 --> 00:34:08,199
you can catch over
a hundred pounds of shrimp.

561
00:34:08,267 --> 00:34:09,529
Everything goes all right,

562
00:34:09,602 --> 00:34:11,365
2 men shrimping 10 hours,

563
00:34:11,437 --> 00:34:13,530
less what you spends on gas...

564
00:34:13,606 --> 00:34:15,699
Done, Drill Sergeant!

565
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:17,208
Gump!

566
00:34:18,778 --> 00:34:21,713
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly?

567
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:23,715
You told me to,
Drill Sergeant.

568
00:34:23,783 --> 00:34:25,375
Jesus H. Christ.

569
00:34:25,451 --> 00:34:27,385
This is a new company record.

570
00:34:27,453 --> 00:34:28,886
If it wasn't a waste

571
00:34:28,955 --> 00:34:30,388
of a fine enlisted man,

572
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:32,890
I'd recommend you for O.C.S.,
Private Gump.

573
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:35,223
You're going to be
a general someday!

574
00:34:35,294 --> 00:34:37,228
Now disassemble your weapon
and continue!

575
00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:41,232
Anyway, like I was saying,

576
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,564
shrimp is the fruit
of the sea.

577
00:34:43,636 --> 00:34:46,901
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it,

578
00:34:46,973 --> 00:34:48,406
bake it, saut it.

579
00:34:48,474 --> 00:34:51,568
They's, uh, shrimp kabobs,
shrimp creole,

580
00:34:51,644 --> 00:34:55,580
shrimp gumbo,
pan fried, deep fried,

581
00:34:55,648 --> 00:34:56,910
stir fried.

582
00:34:56,983 --> 00:34:58,746
There's pineapple shrimp

583
00:34:58,818 --> 00:35:01,685
and lemon shrimp,
coconut shrimp,

584
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:02,880
pepper shrimp,

585
00:35:02,955 --> 00:35:05,389
shrimp soup, shrimp stew,

586
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:07,050
shrimp salad,

587
00:35:07,126 --> 00:35:08,889
shrimp in potatoes,

588
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:10,394
shrimp burger,

589
00:35:10,463 --> 00:35:12,226
shrimp sandwich.

590
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:16,560
That... That's about it.

591
00:35:20,807 --> 00:35:23,970
<i>Nighttime in the army</i>
<i>is a lonely time.</i>

592
00:35:24,043 --> 00:35:26,477
<i>We'd lay there in our bunks,</i>

593
00:35:26,546 --> 00:35:28,980
<i>and I'd miss my mama,</i>

594
00:35:29,048 --> 00:35:31,642
<i>and I'd miss Jenny.</i>

595
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:36,988
Hey, Gump.

596
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:39,650
Get a load of the tits on her.

597
00:35:52,405 --> 00:35:53,838
<i>Turns out...</i>

598
00:35:53,906 --> 00:35:55,999
<i>Jenny had gotten</i>
<i>into some trouble</i>

599
00:35:56,075 --> 00:35:59,340
<i>over some photos of her</i>
<i>in her college sweater.</i>

600
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:01,607
<i>And she was</i>
<i>thrown out of school.</i>

601
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:04,844
~ My baby does the hanky panky ~

602
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:07,351
<i>But that wasn't a bad thing,</i>

603
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,854
<i>'cause a man who owns a theater</i>

604
00:36:09,922 --> 00:36:11,355
<i>in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

605
00:36:11,424 --> 00:36:13,016
<i>saw those photos</i>

606
00:36:13,092 --> 00:36:16,858
<i>and offered Jenny</i>
<i>a job singing in a show.</i>

607
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:19,022
<i>The first chance I got,</i>

608
00:36:19,098 --> 00:36:21,362
<i>I took the bus up to Memphis</i>

609
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:23,698
<i>to see her perform in that show.</i>

610
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:25,202
That was Amber, Amber Flame.

611
00:36:25,271 --> 00:36:26,704
Give her a big hand.

612
00:36:26,772 --> 00:36:29,707
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,

613
00:36:29,775 --> 00:36:31,538
direct from Hollywood,
California,

614
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:33,374
our very own beatnik beauty.

615
00:36:33,446 --> 00:36:35,710
Let's give a big round of applause

616
00:36:35,781 --> 00:36:37,544
to the luscious Bobbie Dylan.

617
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:52,560
~ How many roads
must a man walk down ~

618
00:36:52,632 --> 00:36:58,002
~ Before you can
call him a man? ~

619
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:04,270
~ Yes, and how many seas
must the white dove sail ~

620
00:37:04,343 --> 00:37:06,277
<i>Her dream had come true.</i>

621
00:37:06,345 --> 00:37:08,279
~ Before she sleeps
in the sand? ~

622
00:37:08,347 --> 00:37:10,178
<i>She was a folksinger.</i>

623
00:37:10,249 --> 00:37:13,343
~ Yes, and how many times ~

624
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:16,479
~ Must the cannonballs fly ~

625
00:37:16,556 --> 00:37:21,152
~ Before they're
forever banned? ~

626
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:22,558
Shake it up now.

627
00:37:22,628 --> 00:37:24,061
Somebody get her a harmonica.

628
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,859
~ The answer, my friend ~

629
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:27,695
~ Is blowin' in the wind ~

630
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,200
This ain't <i>Captain Kangaroo.</i>

631
00:37:29,268 --> 00:37:32,032
Hey, honey, I got
something here for you.

632
00:37:32,104 --> 00:37:34,163
Hey! God damn it!

633
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,504
Hey, you stupid jerk!

634
00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:38,339
I'm singing a song here.

635
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:42,847
Polly, get out here!

636
00:37:42,915 --> 00:37:45,349
Shut up yourself!

637
00:37:45,418 --> 00:37:46,885
Just shut up!

638
00:37:49,455 --> 00:37:52,390
Forrest! What are you
doing here?

639
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:53,789
What are you doing?

640
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:54,791
- Hey!
- Aw!

641
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,623
What are you doing, Forrest?

642
00:37:56,696 --> 00:37:58,721
Let me down!

643
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:01,323
- Oh! Ooh!
- Ooh!

644
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,802
Ha ha ha!

645
00:38:02,935 --> 00:38:05,369
You can't keep
doing this, Forrest.

646
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:07,871
You can't keep
trying to rescue me.

647
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,737
They was trying to grab you.

648
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:12,141
A lot of people try to grab me.

649
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:16,204
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

650
00:38:16,282 --> 00:38:19,809
I can't help it.
I love you.

651
00:38:19,885 --> 00:38:22,149
Forrest...

652
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:24,189
You don't know what love is.

653
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,865
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

654
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:38,703
We prayed for God
to turn me into a bird

655
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:40,705
so I could fly far away.

656
00:38:41,941 --> 00:38:43,533
Yes, I do.

657
00:38:46,512 --> 00:38:48,946
You think I could
fly off this bridge?

658
00:38:56,188 --> 00:38:59,214
What do you mean, Jenny?

659
00:39:02,394 --> 00:39:03,656
Nothing.

660
00:39:06,732 --> 00:39:08,996
I got to get out of here.

661
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:12,329
Wait, Jenny.

662
00:39:12,404 --> 00:39:14,838
Forrest, you stay
away from me, O.K.?

663
00:39:14,907 --> 00:39:16,841
You stay away from me, please.

664
00:39:16,909 --> 00:39:18,342
Can I have a ride?

665
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,672
Where are you going?

666
00:39:19,745 --> 00:39:20,837
I don't care.

667
00:39:20,913 --> 00:39:22,141
Get in the truck.

668
00:39:22,214 --> 00:39:24,409
So bye-bye, Jenny.

669
00:39:25,818 --> 00:39:28,685
They sending me to Vietnam.

670
00:39:30,389 --> 00:39:33,222
It's this whole other country.

671
00:39:35,794 --> 00:39:37,557
Just hang on a minute.

672
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:42,066
Listen, you promise me
something, O.K.?

673
00:39:42,134 --> 00:39:44,068
Just if you're
ever in trouble,

674
00:39:44,136 --> 00:39:45,398
don't be brave.

675
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:48,406
You just run, O.K.?
Just run away.

676
00:39:48,474 --> 00:39:49,839
O.K.

677
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,343
Jenny.

678
00:39:57,917 --> 00:40:01,011
I'll write you all the time.

679
00:40:09,595 --> 00:40:11,430
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>she was gone.</i>

680
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,193
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>she was gone.</i>

681
00:40:28,447 --> 00:40:30,881
You come back safe to me.

682
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:32,382
Do you hear?

683
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,562
~ Some folks are born ~

684
00:40:53,638 --> 00:40:55,902
~ Made to wave the flag ~

685
00:40:55,974 --> 00:40:59,239
~ Ooh, they're red,
white, and blue ~

686
00:40:59,311 --> 00:41:02,838
~ And when the band plays
"Hail To The Chief" ~

687
00:41:02,914 --> 00:41:06,509
~ Ooh, they'll point
the cannon at you ~

688
00:41:06,585 --> 00:41:08,348
~ It ain't me ~

689
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,354
~ It ain't me ~

690
00:41:10,422 --> 00:41:13,516
~ I ain't no senator's son ~

691
00:41:13,592 --> 00:41:15,355
~ It ain't me ~

692
00:41:15,427 --> 00:41:16,860
<i>Now they told us</i>

693
00:41:16,928 --> 00:41:19,863
<i>that Vietnam was going</i>
<i>to be very different</i>

694
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:21,956
<i>from the United States</i>
<i>of America.</i>

695
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:26,129
<i>Except for all</i>
<i>the beer cans and barbecues,</i>

696
00:41:26,204 --> 00:41:27,967
<i>it was.</i>

697
00:41:37,716 --> 00:41:40,810
Hey, I'll bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

698
00:41:40,886 --> 00:41:43,821
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimp.

699
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:45,823
After we win this war

700
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:47,518
and we take over everything,

701
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:49,856
we can get American
shrimpers out here

702
00:41:49,928 --> 00:41:51,190
and shrimp these waters.

703
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:53,197
Just shrimp all the time, man.

704
00:41:55,934 --> 00:41:58,198
You must be my FNGs.

705
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,362
Morning, sir.

706
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:00,961
Oh, get your hands down.

707
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:02,472
Do not salute me.

708
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:04,975
There are goddamn snipers
all around this area

709
00:42:05,043 --> 00:42:07,136
who'd love
to grease an officer.

710
00:42:07,212 --> 00:42:10,477
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fort Platoon.

711
00:42:11,716 --> 00:42:13,308
What's wrong with your lip?

712
00:42:14,386 --> 00:42:16,650
I was born with big gums, sir.

713
00:42:16,721 --> 00:42:18,814
Well, you better tuck that in.

714
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,324
Gonna get that caught
on a trip wire.

715
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:24,995
Where are you boys
from in the world?

716
00:42:25,063 --> 00:42:26,155
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

717
00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:28,366
You twins?

718
00:42:30,602 --> 00:42:33,196
No. We are not relations, sir.

719
00:42:35,273 --> 00:42:36,535
Look,

720
00:42:36,608 --> 00:42:37,939
it's pretty basic here.

721
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,272
You stick with me

722
00:42:40,345 --> 00:42:41,778
and learn from the guys

723
00:42:41,846 --> 00:42:43,780
who've been in country a while,

724
00:42:43,848 --> 00:42:45,110
you'll be all right.

725
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:47,447
There is one item of G.I. Gear

726
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,613
that can be the difference
between life and death...

727
00:42:50,689 --> 00:42:51,747
Socks.

728
00:42:51,823 --> 00:42:53,848
Cushioned sole, O.D. Green.

729
00:42:53,925 --> 00:42:55,756
Try and keep your feet dry.

730
00:42:55,827 --> 00:42:58,261
When we're out humpin',
change your socks

731
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:59,524
whenever we stop.

732
00:42:59,598 --> 00:43:01,862
The Mekong will eat
a grunt's feet

733
00:43:01,933 --> 00:43:03,366
right off his legs.

734
00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:04,868
Sergeant Sims. God damn it,

735
00:43:04,936 --> 00:43:07,370
where's that sling rope
I said to order?

736
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:08,872
I put in the requisitions.

737
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,204
Well, you call
those sons of bitches...

738
00:43:11,276 --> 00:43:13,369
<i>Lieutenant Dan</i>
<i>sure knew his stuff.</i>

739
00:43:13,445 --> 00:43:16,380
<i>I felt real lucky</i>
<i>he was my lieutenant.</i>

740
00:43:16,448 --> 00:43:20,111
<i>He was from a long,</i>
<i>great military tradition.</i>

741
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:22,710
<i>Somebody in his family</i>
<i>had fought</i>

742
00:43:22,787 --> 00:43:24,254
<i>and died</i>

743
00:43:24,322 --> 00:43:25,914
<i>in every...</i>

744
00:43:25,991 --> 00:43:27,117
<i>single...</i>

745
00:43:27,192 --> 00:43:29,285
<i>American war.</i>

746
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:31,295
God damn it, kick some ass.

747
00:43:31,363 --> 00:43:32,625
Get on it!

748
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:34,130
<i>I guess you could say</i>

749
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:36,633
<i>he had a lot to live up to.</i>

750
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:39,636
So, you boys
from Arkansas, huh?

751
00:43:39,704 --> 00:43:40,796
Well,

752
00:43:40,872 --> 00:43:42,635
I been through there.

753
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:45,471
Little Rock's a fine town.

754
00:43:45,543 --> 00:43:47,306
Now, shake down your gear.

755
00:43:47,379 --> 00:43:48,641
See the platoon sergeant.

756
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:51,477
Draw what you need
for the field.

757
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:52,982
If you boys are hungry,

758
00:43:53,051 --> 00:43:55,815
we got steaks burning
right over here.

759
00:43:55,887 --> 00:43:58,651
Two standing orders
in this platoon...

760
00:43:58,723 --> 00:44:01,248
1... take care of your feet,

761
00:44:01,326 --> 00:44:04,921
2... try not to do
anything stupid,

762
00:44:04,996 --> 00:44:06,588
like getting
yourself killed.

763
00:44:12,837 --> 00:44:15,362
I sure hope I don't
let him down.

764
00:44:26,551 --> 00:44:29,486
<i>I got to see</i>
<i>a lot of the countryside.</i>

765
00:44:29,554 --> 00:44:31,954
<i>We would take</i>
<i>these real long walks.</i>

766
00:44:34,025 --> 00:44:35,959
~ There must be
some kind of way ~

767
00:44:36,027 --> 00:44:38,120
~ Out of here ~

768
00:44:38,196 --> 00:44:40,289
~ Said the joker
to the thief ~

769
00:44:40,365 --> 00:44:41,798
<i>And we were always lookin'</i>

770
00:44:41,866 --> 00:44:43,800
<i>for this guy named Charlie.</i>

771
00:44:43,868 --> 00:44:45,460
~ There's too much confusion ~

772
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:49,635
~ I can't get no relief ~

773
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,302
Hold it up!

774
00:44:53,378 --> 00:44:54,811
Hold up, boys!

775
00:44:56,381 --> 00:44:59,407
<i>It wasn't always fun.</i>

776
00:44:59,484 --> 00:45:02,749
<i>Lieutenant Dan was always</i>
<i>getting these funny feelings</i>

777
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:05,915
<i>about a rock or a trail</i>
<i>or the road,</i>

778
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,925
<i>so he'd tell us</i>
<i>to get down, shut up.</i>

779
00:45:08,993 --> 00:45:10,085
Get down!

780
00:45:10,161 --> 00:45:11,253
Shut up!

781
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,592
<i>So we did.</i>

782
00:45:30,115 --> 00:45:33,380
<i>Now I don't know</i>
<i>much about anything,</i>

783
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:36,386
<i>but I think some of</i>
<i>America's best young men</i>

784
00:45:36,454 --> 00:45:37,716
<i>served in this war.</i>

785
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:40,053
<i>There was Dallas from Phoenix.</i>

786
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:44,223
<i>Cleveland...</i>
<i>he was from Detroit.</i>

787
00:45:44,295 --> 00:45:45,523
Hey, Tex.

788
00:45:45,597 --> 00:45:47,087
Hey, Tex.

789
00:45:47,165 --> 00:45:48,757
What the hell's going on?

790
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:51,028
<i>And Tex was...</i>

791
00:45:51,102 --> 00:45:53,696
<i>Well, I don't remember</i>
<i>where Tex come from...</i>

792
00:45:53,772 --> 00:45:55,296
Ah, nothing.

793
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,235
Fourth platoon, on your feet.

794
00:46:01,312 --> 00:46:04,213
Y'all got 10 clicks
to go to that river.

795
00:46:04,282 --> 00:46:05,874
Move out.

796
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,384
1, 2! Hup!

797
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:11,221
Step it up!

798
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:12,620
Look alive out there.

799
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,123
<i>The good thing about Vietnam</i>

800
00:46:14,192 --> 00:46:16,456
<i>is there was always</i>
<i>someplace to go.</i>

801
00:46:16,528 --> 00:46:17,790
Fire in the hole!

802
00:46:21,366 --> 00:46:23,960

That's all I have
to say about that.

It was a bullet, wasn't it?

970

A bullet?

971
00:56:38,411 --> 00:56:41,141
That jumped up and bit you.

Oh. Yes, sir.

973
00:56:44,217 --> 00:56:46,845
Bit me directly
in the but-tocks.

974
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,357
They said it was a million
dollar wound, but...

975
00:56:51,424 --> 00:56:53,358
the army must keep that money,

976
00:56:53,426 --> 00:56:57,362
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

977

The only good thing about being
wounded in the but-tocks

<i>The hospital's people</i>

Nothing just happens.
It's all part of a plan!

You see that?

Do you know what it's like

1033

not to be able to use your legs?

1034
01:00:27,937 --> 01:00:29,996
Y-Y-Yes, sir, I do.

1035

You understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

1043

01:06:22,892 --> 01:06:24,860
Can't hear you!

1124
01:06:26,495 --> 01:06:28,759
Can't hear anything!

1125
01:06:29,832 --> 01:06:30,764
This... This one!

1126
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:31,765
Give me that!

1127
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:34,394
Speak up!

1128
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:36,233
That's it.

1129
01:06:36,305 --> 01:06:38,671
And that's all I have to say

1130
01:06:38,741 --> 01:06:40,504
about that.

1131
01:06:46,849 --> 01:06:49,044
That's so right on, man.

1132
01:06:49,118 --> 01:06:50,585
You said it all.

1133
01:06:52,121 --> 01:06:54,282
What's your name, man?

1134
01:06:54,356 --> 01:06:57,792
My name is Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

1135
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,418
Forrest Gump.

1136
01:06:59,495 --> 01:07:00,757
- Gump! Gump!
- Gump!

1137
01:07:02,364 --> 01:07:04,332
Forrest!

1138
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:06,834
Forrest!

1139
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:12,139
Jenny!

1140
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:13,232
Forrest!

1141
01:07:28,657 --> 01:07:30,056
Hey!

1142
01:07:39,835 --> 01:07:43,669
<i>It was the happiest</i>
<i>moment of my life.</i>

1143
01:07:45,374 --> 01:07:49,276
<i>Jenny and me were just like</i>
<i>peas and carrots again.</i>

1144
01:07:49,345 --> 01:07:50,778
<i>She showed me around</i>

1145
01:07:50,846 --> 01:07:53,781
<i>and even introduced me</i>
<i>to some of her new friends.</i>

1146
01:07:53,849 --> 01:07:55,282
Shut that blind, man!

1147
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:58,286
And get your white ass
away from that window.

1148
01:07:58,354 --> 01:07:59,586
Don't you know we in a war here?

1149
01:07:59,586 --> 01:08:00,644
Don't you know we in a war here?

1150
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,620
He's cool.
He's one of us.

1151
01:08:02,689 --> 01:08:04,623
Let me tell you about us.

1152
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:07,626
Our purpose here is
to protect our black leaders

1153
01:08:07,694 --> 01:08:10,162
from the racial
onslaught of the pig

1154
01:08:10,229 --> 01:08:13,062
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

1155
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:16,329
rape our women, and destroy
our black communities.

1156
01:08:16,402 --> 01:08:17,801
Who's the baby killer?

1157
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:20,805
This is my good friend
I told you about.

1158
01:08:20,873 --> 01:08:23,808
This is Forrest Gump.
Forrest, this is Wesley.

1159
01:08:23,876 --> 01:08:26,310
Wesley and I
lived together in Berkeley,

1160
01:08:26,379 --> 01:08:29,314
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

1161
01:08:29,382 --> 01:08:32,317
We are here to offer
protection and help

1162
01:08:32,385 --> 01:08:34,819
for all those
who need our help,

1163
01:08:34,887 --> 01:08:36,320
because we,
the Black Panthers,

1164
01:08:36,389 --> 01:08:38,323
are against the war in Vietnam.

1165
01:08:38,391 --> 01:08:39,824
We are against any war

1166
01:08:39,892 --> 01:08:42,827
where black soldiers
are sent to the front line

1167
01:08:42,895 --> 01:08:45,830
to die for a country
that hates them.

1168
01:08:45,898 --> 01:08:49,834
We are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

1169
01:08:49,902 --> 01:08:53,429
and come to be brutalized and
killed in their own communities.

1170
01:08:53,506 --> 01:08:56,407
We are against
these racist and imperial acts...

1171
01:08:58,911 --> 01:09:01,175
~ And I gave her the gun ~

1172
01:09:01,247 --> 01:09:02,839
~ I shot her ~

1173
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:06,407
Forrest!

1174
01:09:06,486 --> 01:09:07,680
Stop it!

1175
01:09:07,754 --> 01:09:09,244
Stop it!

1176
01:09:10,323 --> 01:09:11,585
Forrest!

1177
01:09:11,658 --> 01:09:14,058
Stop it! Stop it!

1178
01:09:22,869 --> 01:09:25,303
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

1179
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:30,070
I should have known it was going
to be some bullshit hassle!

1180
01:09:30,143 --> 01:09:32,703
He should not be
hitting you, Jenny.

1181
01:09:37,884 --> 01:09:39,715
Come on, Forrest.

1182
01:09:44,824 --> 01:09:49,659
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

1183
01:09:51,363 --> 01:09:54,264
He doesn't mean it
when he does things like this.

1184
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:56,801
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

1185
01:09:58,737 --> 01:10:00,671
I know you wouldn't,
Forrest.

1186
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:05,437
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

1187
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:18,082
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

1188
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:21,790
You look handsome in it.

1189
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:23,589
You do.

1190
01:10:26,865 --> 01:10:28,298
You know what?

1191
01:10:28,367 --> 01:10:29,459
What?

1192
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:36,204
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

1193
01:10:37,709 --> 01:10:39,301
Me, too, Forrest.

1194
01:10:39,378 --> 01:10:42,836
<i>We walked around</i>
<i>all night, Jenny and me,</i>

1195
01:10:42,914 --> 01:10:44,848
<i>just talkin'.</i>

1196
01:10:44,916 --> 01:10:49,683
<i>She told me about</i>
<i>all the traveling she'd done</i>

1197
01:10:49,755 --> 01:10:53,623
<i>and how she discovered</i>
<i>ways to expand her mind</i>

1198
01:10:53,692 --> 01:10:57,296
<i>and learn how</i>
<i>to live in harmony...</i>

1199
01:10:57,429 --> 01:10:59,329
<i>which must be</i>
<i>out west somewhere,</i>

1200
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:02,333
<i>'cause she made it</i>
<i>all the way to California.</i>

1201
01:11:02,401 --> 01:11:04,335
~ Love one another right now ~

1202
01:11:04,403 --> 01:11:05,335
Hey.

1203
01:11:06,405 --> 01:11:08,703
Anybody want to go
to San Francisco?

1204
01:11:08,774 --> 01:11:10,241
I'll go.

1205
01:11:10,309 --> 01:11:11,640
Far out!

1206
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:14,144
<i>It was a very special night</i>

1207
01:11:14,212 --> 01:11:15,907
<i>for the two of us.</i>

1208
01:11:17,616 --> 01:11:19,550
<i>I didn't want it to end.</i>

1209
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:22,584
Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

1210
01:11:23,855 --> 01:11:25,379
I have to, Forrest.

1211
01:11:26,858 --> 01:11:27,790
Jenny?

1212
01:11:29,628 --> 01:11:32,290
Things got
a little out of hand.

1213
01:11:32,364 --> 01:11:33,956
It's just this war

1214
01:11:34,032 --> 01:11:36,796
and that lying
son of a bitch Johnson and...

1215
01:11:38,203 --> 01:11:41,070
I would never hurt you.
You know that.

1216
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:45,775
Know what I think?

1217
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:49,212
I think...

1218
01:11:49,281 --> 01:11:51,306
you should go home to Greenbow,

1219
01:11:51,383 --> 01:11:53,374
Alabama!

1220
01:12:03,395 --> 01:12:04,760
Forrest,

1221
01:12:05,897 --> 01:12:08,525
we have very
different lives, you know.

1222
01:12:17,409 --> 01:12:19,343
I want you...

1223
01:12:19,411 --> 01:12:21,504
to have this.

1224
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,341
Forrest, I can't keep this.

1225
01:12:29,354 --> 01:12:30,787
I got it...

1226
01:12:30,856 --> 01:12:34,189
just by doing
what you told me to do.

1227
01:12:35,861 --> 01:12:39,126
Why are you so good to me?

1228
01:12:39,197 --> 01:12:41,028
You're my girl.

1229
01:12:43,168 --> 01:12:44,863
I'll always be your girl.

1230
01:13:07,793 --> 01:13:12,753
~ To everything,
turn, turn, turn ~

1231
01:13:12,831 --> 01:13:17,325
~ There is a season,
turn, turn, turn ~

1232
01:13:17,402 --> 01:13:21,168
~ And a time to every purpose ~

1233
01:13:21,239 --> 01:13:23,264
~ Under heaven ~

1234
01:13:24,443 --> 01:13:27,276
<i>And just like that,</i>

1235
01:13:27,345 --> 01:13:31,304
<i>she was gone</i>
<i>out of my life again.</i>

1236
01:13:31,516 --> 01:13:34,349
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

1237
01:13:36,354 --> 01:13:39,152
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

1238
01:13:43,862 --> 01:13:46,797
<i>I thought I was</i>
<i>going back to Vietnam,</i>

1239
01:13:46,865 --> 01:13:48,298
<i>but instead they decided</i>

1240
01:13:48,366 --> 01:13:51,301
<i>the best way for me</i>
<i>to fight the Communists</i>

1241
01:13:51,369 --> 01:13:52,802
<i>was to play Ping-Pong,</i>

1242
01:13:52,871 --> 01:13:54,805
<i>so I was in the Special Services,</i>

1243
01:13:54,873 --> 01:13:56,465
<i>traveling around the country,</i>

1244
01:13:56,541 --> 01:13:59,169
<i>cheering up wounded veterans</i>
<i>and showing 'em</i>

1245
01:13:59,244 --> 01:14:00,802
how to play Ping-Pong.

1246
01:14:00,879 --> 01:14:03,848
I was so good
that some years later,

1247
01:14:03,915 --> 01:14:05,815
<i>the army decided I should be</i>

1248
01:14:05,884 --> 01:14:08,045
<i>on the all-American Ping-Pong team.</i>

1249
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:11,384
<i>We were the first Americans</i>
<i>to visit the land of China</i>

1250
01:14:11,456 --> 01:14:13,856
<i>in a million years or something.</i>

1251
01:14:13,925 --> 01:14:16,860
<i>Somebody said world peace</i>
<i>was in our hands,</i>

1252
01:14:16,928 --> 01:14:19,624
<i>but all I did was play Ping-Pong.</i>

1253
01:14:19,698 --> 01:14:22,565
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity,

1254
01:14:22,634 --> 01:14:24,534
famouser even
than Captain Kangaroo.

1255
01:14:24,769 --> 01:14:26,703
<i>Here he is, Forrest Gump.</i>

1256
01:14:26,771 --> 01:14:28,136
<i>Right here.</i>

1257
01:14:33,979 --> 01:14:36,948
<i>Gump, have a seat.</i>

1258
01:14:37,015 --> 01:14:39,779
<i>Forrest Gump, John Lennon.</i>

1259
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:41,785
<i>Welcome home.</i>

1260
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:43,787
<i>Can you tell us, um,</i>

1261
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:45,982
<i>what was China like?</i>

1262
01:14:49,227 --> 01:14:51,286
<i>In the land of China...</i>

1263
01:14:51,363 --> 01:14:53,297
<i>people hardly got nothin'at all.</i>

1264
01:14:53,365 --> 01:14:55,526
<i>No possessions?</i>

1265
01:14:58,003 --> 01:15:02,804
<i>And in China,</i>
<i>they never go to church.</i>

1266
01:15:02,874 --> 01:15:04,307
<i>No religion, too?</i>

1267
01:15:04,376 --> 01:15:06,310
<i>Oh.</i>

1268
01:15:06,378 --> 01:15:07,970
<i>Hard to imagine.</i>

1269
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:11,311
<i>Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.</i>

1270
01:15:11,383 --> 01:15:12,816
<i>Some years later,</i>

1271
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:14,818
<i>that nice young man from England</i>

1272
01:15:14,886 --> 01:15:17,855
<i>was on his way home</i>
<i>to see his little boy</i>

1273
01:15:17,923 --> 01:15:19,823
<i>and was signing some autographs.</i>

1274
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:21,756
<i>For no particular reason at all,</i>

1275
01:15:21,826 --> 01:15:24,294
<i>somebody shot him.</i>

1276
01:15:26,831 --> 01:15:28,765
They gave you...

1277
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:30,824
the congressional Medal of Honor.

1278
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:34,034
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

1279
01:15:36,975 --> 01:15:38,567
Lieutenant Dan!

1280
01:15:38,643 --> 01:15:40,508
They gave you...

1281
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:43,605
the congressional

01:23:52,869 --> 01:23:54,496
Wouldn't you know it?

1442
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:56,300
A few months later,

1443
01:23:56,373 --> 01:23:59,308
they invited me
and the Ping-Pong team

1444
01:23:59,376 --> 01:24:00,809
to visit the White House.

1445
01:24:00,877 --> 01:24:02,276
So I went...

1446
01:24:02,345 --> 01:24:03,505
again.

1447
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:07,380
And I met the president
of the United States again.

1448
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:10,011
<i>Only this time,</i>
<i>they didn't get us rooms</i>

1449
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:11,816
<i>in a real fancy hotel.</i>

1450
01:24:11,888 --> 01:24:13,321
<i>Are you enjoying yourself</i>

1451
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:15,324
<i>in our nation's capital,</i>
<i>young man?</i>

1452
01:24:15,392 --> 01:24:16,825
<i>Where are you staying?</i>

1453
01:24:16,893 --> 01:24:18,326
<i>It's called the Hotel Ebbott.</i>

1454
01:24:18,395 --> 01:24:21,330
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>
<i>I know a much nicer hotel.</i>

1455
01:24:21,398 --> 01:24:22,763
<i>It's brand-new. Very modern.</i>

1456
01:24:22,833 --> 01:24:25,461
<i>I'll have my people</i>
<i>take care of it.</i>

1457
01:24:25,535 --> 01:24:26,763
Security.

1458
01:24:26,837 --> 01:24:28,270
Yeah. Sir,

1459
01:24:28,338 --> 01:24:31,273
you might want to send
a maintenance man

1460
01:24:31,341 --> 01:24:33,775
over to that office
across the way.

1461
01:24:33,844 --> 01:24:35,277
The lights are off

1462
01:24:35,345 --> 01:24:38,280
and they must be looking
for a fuse box,

1463
01:24:38,348 --> 01:24:41,283
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1464
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:43,285
O.K., sir.
I'll check it out.

1465
01:24:43,353 --> 01:24:44,650
Thank you. Good night.

1466
01:24:47,858 --> 01:24:49,291
<i>Therefore...</i>

1467
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:51,293
<i>I shall resign the presidency</i>

1468
01:24:51,361 --> 01:24:53,625
<i>effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

1469
01:24:53,697 --> 01:24:55,631
<i>Vice President Ford</i>

1470
01:24:55,699 --> 01:24:57,792
<i>will be sworn in as president</i>

1471
01:24:57,868 --> 01:25:00,530
<i>at that hour in this office.</i>

1472
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,115
Forrest Gump.

1473
01:25:13,183 --> 01:25:14,810
Yes, sir!

1474
01:25:14,885 --> 01:25:16,318
As you were.

1475
01:25:16,386 --> 01:25:18,320
I have your discharge papers.

1476
01:25:18,388 --> 01:25:20,049
Service is up, son.

1477
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:25,624
Does this mean I can't
play Ping-Pong no more?

1478
01:25:25,695 --> 01:25:27,663
For the army, it does.

1479
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,767
<i>And just like that,</i>

1480
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:35,271
<i>my service in</i>
<i>the United States Army was over.</i>

1481
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:41,811
<i>So I went home.</i>

1482
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,024
I'm home, Mama.

1483
01:26:05,101 --> 01:26:07,501
I know. I know.

1484
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:10,305
Louise, he's here.

1485
01:26:10,373 --> 01:26:13,308
<i>Now, when I got home,</i>
<i>I had no idea,</i>

1486
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:15,810
<i>but Mama had all sorts</i>
<i>of visitors.</i>

1487
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:17,813
We've had all sorts of visitors.

1488
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:21,317
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1489
01:26:21,384 --> 01:26:24,251
One man even left
a check for $25,000

1490
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:27,757
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you like using their paddle.

1491
01:26:27,824 --> 01:26:30,759
I only like using
my own paddle.

1492
01:26:30,827 --> 01:26:32,226
Hi, Miss Louise.

1493
01:26:32,295 --> 01:26:33,284
Hey, Forrest.

1494
01:26:33,363 --> 01:26:36,264
I know that,
but it's $25,000, Forrest.

1495
01:26:36,333 --> 01:26:39,769
I thought maybe
you could hold it for a while,

1496
01:26:39,836 --> 01:26:42,270
see if it grows on you.

1497
01:26:42,339 --> 01:26:44,273
<i>That Mama, she sure was right.</i>

1498
01:26:44,341 --> 01:26:47,076
<i>It's funny how things work out.</i>

1499
01:26:47,209 --> 01:26:49,109
<i>I didn't stay home for long</i>

1500
01:26:49,178 --> 01:26:51,612
<i>because I'd made</i>
<i>a promise to Bubba,</i>

1501
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,114
<i>and I always try</i>
<i>to keep my promise,</i>

1502
01:26:54,183 --> 01:26:56,617
<i>so I went on down</i>
<i>to Bayou La Batre</i>

1503
01:26:56,685 --> 01:26:58,175
<i>to meet Bubba's family.</i>

1504
01:26:58,253 --> 01:27:02,656
Are you crazy
or just plain stupid?

1505
01:27:02,724 --> 01:27:05,955
Stupid is as stupid does,
Mrs. Blue.

1506
01:27:06,028 --> 01:27:06,960
I guess.

1507
01:27:07,029 --> 01:27:08,462
<i>And, of course,</i>

1508
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:11,624
<i>I paid my respect</i>
<i>to Bubba himself.</i>

1509
01:27:12,868 --> 01:27:15,530
Hey, Bubba.
It's me, Forrest Gump.

1510
01:27:18,874 --> 01:27:20,808
I remember everything
you said,

1511
01:27:20,876 --> 01:27:23,743
and I got it
all figured out.

1512
01:27:25,414 --> 01:27:32,047
I'm taking $24,562.47

1513
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:34,248
that I got, that's left

1514
01:27:34,323 --> 01:27:36,757
<i>after a new haircut</i>
<i>and a new suit</i>

1515
01:27:36,825 --> 01:27:39,760
<i>and took Mama out</i>
<i>to a real fancy dinner,</i>

1516
01:27:39,828 --> 01:27:42,695
<i>and I bought a bus ticket,</i>
<i>then three Dr. Peppers.</i>

1517
01:27:42,764 --> 01:27:44,755
Tell me something.

1518
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:47,267
Are you stupid or something?

1519
01:27:47,336 --> 01:27:50,032
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1520
01:27:50,105 --> 01:27:52,039
That's what's left
after me saying,

1521
01:27:52,107 --> 01:27:56,043
"When I was in China on
the all-America Ping-Pong team,

1522
01:27:56,111 --> 01:27:58,045
"I just loved
playing Ping-Pong

1523
01:27:58,113 --> 01:28:00,240
with my Flex-O-Lite
Ping-Pong paddle,"

1524
01:28:00,315 --> 01:28:02,249
which everybody knows isn't true,

1525
01:28:02,317 --> 01:28:05,252
but Mama said it was just
a little white lie,

1526
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,254
so it wasn't hurting nobody.

1527
01:28:07,322 --> 01:28:09,756
So anyway,
I'm putting all that

1528
01:28:09,825 --> 01:28:12,259
on gas, ropes, and new nets

1529
01:28:12,327 --> 01:28:15,262
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1530
01:28:36,385 --> 01:28:39,821
<i>Now Bubba told me everything</i>
<i>he knew about shrimping,</i>

1531
01:28:39,888 --> 01:28:42,823
<i>but you know what I found out?</i>

1532
01:28:43,892 --> 01:28:46,452
<i>Shrimping is tough.</i>

1533
01:28:48,397 --> 01:28:51,059
I only caught five.

1534
01:28:51,133 --> 01:28:54,569
A couple more,
you can have yourself a cocktail.

1535
01:28:56,405 --> 01:28:59,340
Hey, you ever think about
naming this old boat?

1536
01:28:59,408 --> 01:29:02,343
It's bad luck to have
a boat without a name.

1537
01:29:02,411 --> 01:29:04,845
<i>I'd never named a boat before,</i>

1538
01:29:04,913 --> 01:29:09,941
<i>but there was only one</i>
<i>I could think of,</i>

1539
01:29:10,018 --> 01:29:13,977
<i>the most beautiful name</i>
<i>in the wide world.</i>

1540
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,550
~ <i>Do a little dance</i> ~

1541
01:29:19,628 --> 01:29:21,596
~ <i>Make a little love</i> ~

1542
01:29:21,663 --> 01:29:23,597
~ <i>Get down tonight</i> ~

1543
01:29:23,665 --> 01:29:25,963
~ <i>Get down tonight</i> ~

1544
01:29:26,034 --> 01:29:28,229
~ <i>Do a little dance</i> ~

1545
01:29:28,303 --> 01:29:30,066
~ <i>Make a little love</i> ~

1546
01:29:30,138 --> 01:29:31,765
~ <i>Get down tonight</i> ~

1547
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:32,932
~ <i>Whoo</i> ~

1548
01:29:33,008 --> 01:29:34,305
~ <i>Get down tonight...</i> ~

1549
01:29:34,376 --> 01:29:36,776
<i>Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny</i>

1550
01:29:36,845 --> 01:29:38,142
<i>in a long while,</i>

1551
01:29:38,213 --> 01:29:40,647
<i>but I thought about her a lot.</i>

1552
01:29:40,716 --> 01:29:43,810
<i>I hoped whatever</i>
<i>she was doing made her happy.</i>

1553
01:29:43,885 --> 01:29:48,913
~ Oh, and the bird
you cannot change ~

1554
01:29:52,361 --> 01:29:59,062
~ And this bird
you cannot change ~

1555
01:29:59,134 --> 01:30:06,506
~ Lord knows I can't change ~

1556
01:30:06,575 --> 01:30:13,504
~ Lord, help me, I can't change ~

1557
01:31:29,724 --> 01:31:33,160
<i>I thought about Jenny all the time.</i>

1558
01:31:56,484 --> 01:31:58,577
Hey!

1559
01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:26,706
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

1560
01:32:26,781 --> 01:32:30,148
Well, thought
I'd try out my sea legs.

1561
01:32:30,218 --> 01:32:33,153
Well, you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1562
01:32:33,221 --> 01:32:34,654
Yes, I know that.

1563
01:32:34,722 --> 01:32:38,920
You wrote me a letter,
you idiot.

1564
01:32:38,993 --> 01:32:41,359
Well, well.
Captain Forrest Gump.

1565
01:32:41,429 --> 01:32:44,296
I had to see this for myself...

1566
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,067
and...

1567
01:32:47,135 --> 01:32:51,572
I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain,

1568
01:32:51,639 --> 01:32:53,573
that I'd be your first mate.

1569
01:32:53,641 --> 01:32:55,302
Well, here I am.

1570
01:32:55,376 --> 01:32:57,310
I'm a man of my word.

1571
01:32:57,378 --> 01:32:58,402
O.K.

1572
01:32:58,479 --> 01:33:00,640
But don't you be thinking

1573
01:33:00,715 --> 01:33:03,149
that I'm going
to be calling you "sir."

1574
01:33:03,217 --> 01:33:04,149
No, sir.

1575
01:33:12,693 --> 01:33:14,217
It's my boat.

1576
01:33:17,398 --> 01:33:21,494
I have a feeling
if we head due east,

1577
01:33:21,569 --> 01:33:25,130
we'll find some shrimp,
so take a left.

1578
01:33:26,541 --> 01:33:27,974
Take a left!

1579
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:28,974
Which way?

1580
01:33:29,043 --> 01:33:29,975
Over there!

1581
01:33:30,044 --> 01:33:31,477
They're over there!

1582
01:33:31,546 --> 01:33:34,879
Get on the wheel
and take a left.

1583
01:33:34,949 --> 01:33:36,382
O.K.

1584
01:33:37,718 --> 01:33:39,652
Gump, what are you doing?

1585
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,153
Take a left!

1586
01:33:41,222 --> 01:33:42,211
Left!

1587
01:33:44,091 --> 01:33:48,027
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

1588
01:33:48,095 --> 01:33:49,027
Ha ha!

1589
01:33:49,096 --> 01:33:51,223
That's where we'll find them.

1590
01:34:03,644 --> 01:34:05,578
Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.

1591
01:34:05,646 --> 01:34:07,580
O.K., so I was wrong.

1592
01:34:07,648 --> 01:34:10,583
Well, how are we
going to find them?

1593
01:34:10,651 --> 01:34:14,678
Maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1594
01:34:14,755 --> 01:34:17,417
~ So pray that ~

1595
01:34:17,492 --> 01:34:20,757
~ I'm homeward bound... ~

1596

I didn't know it,

There'll be another one
along shortly.

1704
01:41:39,732 --> 01:41:44,169
Now, because I had been
a football star and war hero

1705
01:41:44,236 --> 01:41:47,171
and national celebrity
and a shrimping boat captain

1706
01:41:47,239 --> 01:41:48,672

the city fathers
of Greenbow, Alabama,

1708

decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1709
01:41:55,247 --> 01:41:58,774
<i>So I never went back to work</i>
<i>for Lieutenant Dan,</i>

1710

<i>though he did take care</i>
<i>of my Bubba Gump money.</i>

1711

<i>He got me invested</i>
<i>in some kind of fruit company.</i>

1712
01:42:04,857 --> 01:42:07,291
<i>So then I got a call from him</i>

1713
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,920
<i>saying we don't have to worry</i>
<i>about money no more,</i>

1714
01:42:09,996 --> 01:42:14,399
and I said,
"That's good. One less thing."

1715
01:42:14,467 --> 01:42:16,264
~ I've got a new hope... ~

1716

<i>Now Mama said</i>

<i>and the rest</i>
<i>is just for showing off.</i>

1719
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:26,911
<i>So I gave a whole bunch of it</i>

1720
01:42:26,979 --> 01:42:30,244
<i>to the Foursquare Gospel Church...</i>

1721
01:42:30,316 --> 01:42:35,379
<i>and I gave a whole bunch to the</i>
<i>Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...</i>

1722
01:42:36,856 --> 01:42:39,290
<i>and even though Bubba was dead</i>

1723
01:42:39,358 --> 01:42:42,794
<i>and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,</i>

1724

<i>I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.</i>

You know what?

1726
01:42:50,703 --> 01:42:54,639
<i>She didn't have to work</i>

That smells wonderful.

1728
01:42:57,376 --> 01:42:59,810
<i>And 'cause I was a gozillionaire</i>

1729
01:42:59,879 --> 01:43:02,814
<i>and I liked doing it so much,</i>

1730
01:43:02,882 --> 01:43:06,318
<i>I cut that grass for free.</i>

1731

<i>Jenny came back</i>

<i>Maybe it was because</i>
<i>she had nowhere else to go,</i>

1739

<i>or maybe it was because</i>

1740
01:45:22,788 --> 01:45:26,224
<i>'cause she went to bed</i>

02:09:43,911 --> 02:09:45,845
always said

2069
02:09:45,913 --> 02:09:50,009
that dyin' was a part of life.

2070
02:09:52,586 --> 02:09:54,349
I sure wish it wasn't.

2071
02:09:57,758 --> 02:09:59,282
Little Forrest is...

2072
02:10:00,594 --> 02:10:02,858
doing just fine.

2073
02:10:02,930 --> 02:10:03,919
"But..."

2074
02:10:03,997 --> 02:10:06,431
<i>About to start school again soon,</i>

2075
02:10:06,500 --> 02:10:08,525
<i>and...</i>

2076
02:10:08,602 --> 02:10:11,867
<i>and I make his breakfast,</i>
<i>lunch, and dinner</i>

2077
02:10:11,939 --> 02:10:12,997
every day.

2078
02:10:14,775 --> 02:10:16,367
I make sure he...

2079
02:10:17,778 --> 02:10:19,211
combs his hair

2080
02:10:19,279 --> 02:10:21,372
and brushes his teeth every day.

2081
02:10:23,617 --> 02:10:26,177
Teaching him how
to play Ping-Pong.

2082
02:10:28,455 --> 02:10:29,888
<i>He's really good.</i>

2083
02:10:29,957 --> 02:10:32,050
Uh, Forrest, you go.

2084
02:10:32,125 --> 02:10:33,183
Uhh!

2085
02:10:36,630 --> 02:10:38,063
<i>We fish a lot.</i>

2086
02:10:41,468 --> 02:10:43,834
And every night,
we read a book.

2087
02:10:43,904 --> 02:10:45,337
He's so smart, Jenny.

2088
02:10:48,408 --> 02:10:50,501
You'd be so proud of him.

2089
02:10:52,246 --> 02:10:53,508
I am.

2090
02:10:54,915 --> 02:10:58,078
He, uh, wrote you
a... a letter.

2091
02:10:59,419 --> 02:11:02,354
And he says I can't read it.
I'm not supposed to,

2092
02:11:02,422 --> 02:11:05,357
so I'll just leave it
here for you.

2093
02:11:21,608 --> 02:11:23,543
Jenny...

2094
02:11:28,447 --> 02:11:31,382
I don't know
if Mama was right

2095
02:11:31,450 --> 02:11:34,544
or if it... it's
Lieutenant Dan.

2096
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:36,485
I don't know...

2097
02:11:37,623 --> 02:11:40,285
if we each have a...

2098
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:42,586
destiny...

2099
02:11:44,063 --> 02:11:47,829
or if we're all just
floating around accidental-like

2100
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:49,333
on a breeze...

2101
02:11:53,573 --> 02:11:55,507
but l... I think...

2102
02:11:57,410 --> 02:11:59,173
maybe it's both.

2103
02:12:03,416 --> 02:12:06,647
Maybe both get happening
at the same time.

2104
02:12:12,425 --> 02:12:14,359
But I miss you, Jenny.

2105
02:12:20,933 --> 02:12:22,924
If there's anything
you need...

2106
02:12:24,103 --> 02:12:26,037
I won't be far away.

2107
02:12:49,562 --> 02:12:51,496
[Birds Chirping]

2108
02:13:00,406 --> 02:13:02,840
Here's your bus.

2109
02:13:02,908 --> 02:13:04,273
O.K.

2110
02:13:04,343 --> 02:13:06,834
Hey...

2111
02:13:06,912 --> 02:13:08,345
I know this.

2112
02:13:08,414 --> 02:13:10,848
I'm gonna share that
for show-and-tell

2113
02:13:10,916 --> 02:13:14,079
because Grandma used
to read it to you.

2114
02:13:14,153 --> 02:13:16,212
My favorite book.

2115
02:13:19,692 --> 02:13:21,125
Here we are.

2116
02:13:21,193 --> 02:13:22,524
Hey...

2117
02:13:24,430 --> 02:13:25,863
here you go.

2118
02:13:31,037 --> 02:13:32,595
Hey, Forrest...

2119
02:13:32,672 --> 02:13:34,139
don't...

2120
02:13:36,942 --> 02:13:39,467
I want to tell you
I love you.

2121
02:13:39,545 --> 02:13:41,513
I love you, too, Daddy.

2122
02:13:41,580 --> 02:13:44,447
I'll be right here
when you get back.

2123
02:13:44,517 --> 02:13:45,484
[Pop]

2124
02:13:49,889 --> 02:13:53,325
You understand this is the bus
to school, now, don't you?

2125
02:13:53,392 --> 02:13:57,158
Of course, and you're Dorothy
Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump.
