PUBLIC AFFAIRS SECTION CHIEF

15
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,550
My child has sensitive skin,

16
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,254
and that water gave him an awful rash.
PUBLIC AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT

17
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,651
Plus it breeds mosquitoes like crazy.

18
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,853
And it stinks, besides.

19
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:20,193
Can't you do something? It would make
a great playground if you filled it in.

20
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,625
Please wait a moment.

21
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,912
Sir, they've come to complain
about a sewage pond.

22
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,078
- Engineering Section.
- Yes.

23
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:46,117
<i>Ah, here is our protagonist now.</i>

24
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:50,927
<i>But it would only be tiresome</i>
<i>to meet him right now.</i>

25
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,757
<i>After all,</i>

26
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:58,801
<i>he's simply passing time</i>
<i>without actually living his life.</i>

27
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,572
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>he's not really even alive.</i>

28
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,476
Odagiri,

29
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,918
how dare you,
during business hours?

30
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,452
But it's so funny.

31
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,419
Funny? What is?

32
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,728
It's the "Liar's Club."
Someone sent it around.

33
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,695
Read it to us.

34
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,401
"I hear you've never even
taken a vacation.

35
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,177
Is that because City Hall
couldn't function without you?"

36
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:44,116
"No, because everyone would realize
that City Hall doesn't need me at all."

37
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:00,528
<i>Oh, no, this will never do.</i>

38
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,292
<i>He might as well be a corpse.</i>

39
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:08,907
<i>In fact, this man has been dead</i>
<i>for more than 20 years now.</i>

40
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,543
<i>Before that, he did live a little.</i>

41
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:16,170
<i>He even actually tried</i>
<i>to do real work.</i>

42
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:25,654
<i>A PROPOSAL FOR I NCREASING</i>
<i>DEPARTMENTAL EFFICIENCY</i>

43
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,792
<i>SUBMITTED 1930</i>

44
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,934
<i>But now, there's barely a trace of</i>
<i>his old passion and ambition.</i>

45
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:41,737
<i>He's been worn down completely by</i>
<i>the minutia of the bureaucratic machine</i>

46
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,569
<i>and the meaningless busyness</i>
<i>it breeds.</i>

47
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,948
<i>Busy, always so very. Busy.</i>

48
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,150
<i>But in fact, this man does</i>
<i>absolutely nothing at all.</i>

49
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,624
<i>Other than protecting</i>
<i>his own spot.</i>

50
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:07,189
<i>The best way to protect your place</i>
<i>in this world is to do nothing at all.</i>

51
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,498
Is this really
what life is all about?

52
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,744
Is this really
what life is all about?

53
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:25,179
Before our friend will
take this question seriously,

54
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,515
his stomach has
to get a lot worse,

55
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:33,588
and he'll have to waste much,
much more time.

56
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,793
But any proposal
for creating a park

57
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,658
goes to the Parks Department.

58
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,601
This really seems to be
a question of hygiene,

59
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,566
so you'd better try
the Health Department.

60
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,098
Go to the Sanitation Department.

61
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,643
See Environmental Sanitation.

62
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,847
Department of Prevention.

63
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,678
Infectious Diseases.

64
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,118
Lots of mosquitoes?

65
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,921
That's a job for
the Division of Pest Control.

66
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:09,650
The problem is seeping waste,
which means

67
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:14,227
it's a problem for
the Sewage Department at City Hall.

68
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:21,165
Originally, it was a ditch
with a road running over it,

69
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,475
which means the Roads Department.

70
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:28,308
We're waiting on a decision
from City Planning.

71
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,745
Go to Ward Reorganization.

72
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:35,586
The Fire Department objected
to draining that cesspool.

73
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,691
There are water pressure problems
in that area.

74
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:43,763
Are you kidding?
All we need's a good water supply.

75
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:47,961
There's no reason it has to
breed mosquitoes and cause rashes.

76
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:52,294
Think what a time we'd have
getting that filth out of our hoses.

77
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:57,500
Of course, we'd love a kiddie pool
in that neighborhood.

78
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:04,308
Try the Education Department. They
should have a Child Welfare Committee.

79
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:09,548
But the problem doesn't only
affect children.

80
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:14,523
We've had enough trouble
just rebuilding all the schools.

81
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:20,766
A problem this big belongs with your
Ward Representative to the City Council.

82
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,666
I'll give you an introduction
to the Deputy Mayor.

83
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,166
Show him my card
and he'll meet with you immediately.

84
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,511
Please, sit down.

85
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,909
Thank you for all your hard work.

86
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,820
The truth is that we truly appreciate

87
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,024
folks like you,
who know to bring

88
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,194
such complaints directly
to our attention.

89
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:53,962
That's precisely what inspired
our new Department of Public Affairs.

90
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,566
Don't skimp on your complaints.

91
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,928
Hey, you. Show these folks
the Public Affairs desk.

92
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:05,009
You'll need to take that up
with Engineering. Desk 8.

93
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:19,189
How dare you?
Stop giving us the runaround.

94
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:23,689
What the hell's this poster mean?
To help us kill time?

95
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,663
We call people like you time-killers.

96
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:31,302
All we want is to get
that stinking cesspool cleaned up.

97
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:36,702
If it's Engineering, Sewage,
Health, Sanitation or the Fire Department,

98
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,034
Public Affairs should sort it out.

99
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,837
Forget it.
We won't bother you anymore.

100
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:46,018
You're just laughing at us.
What a mockery of democracy.

101
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,451
Let's go.

102
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,198
Um, excuse me.

103
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,429
Unfortunately, the section chief
took the day off,

104
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:12,605
and it'd be easier for us
if you'd put this in writing.

105
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,784
PUBLIC AFFAIRS SECTION CHIEF

106
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,126
What do you think?

107
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,855
The section chief
never takes days off.

108
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,536
Yes, he's been
kind of listless recently.

109
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:43,766
But we really can't have him
taking extended time off.

110
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:49,176
Exactly. It's not like him to take
a day off over a little cold.

111
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,075
Nothing moves unless he stamps it.

112
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,377
Yes, you're right.

113
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:59,223
I must say,
it's a terrible shame.

114
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,556
One more month

115
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:06,627
and he'd have broken the record of
30 years without a single absence.

116
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,536
Trust me, some people are
happy to have him gone.

117
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:15,405
Only a bureaucrat schemes
to replace his boss as soon as he's out.

118
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,503
What's that medicine
he's been taking?

119
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:26,218
Stomach medicine. He always slurped
his noodle bowl to the bottom,

120
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,187
but lately, he barely touches it.

121
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:35,761
Plain noodle soup. In all these years,
I've never seen him eat anything else.

122
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,130
And if the worst happens,
who'll replace him?

123
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:47,937
What's the rush? Lots more guys
have to die before it's your turn.

124
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,543
X-RAY LAB

125
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,565
- Hiraoka-san...
- Yes.

126
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,130
Your stomach?

127
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:02,913
Yeah, my stomach's bad, too.
It's what they call "chronic."

128
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,153
These days I hardly feel alive
unless my stomach hurts.

129
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,983
<i>- Suzuki-san...</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

130
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,325
That man over there...

131
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,533
His doctor told him
he's got an ulcer,

132
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,807
but trust me, it's stomach cancer.

133
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,911
In a word, that very thing.

134
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:40,247
And stomach cancer
is practically a death sentence.

135
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:44,254
The doc usually says
it's just a mild ulcer,

136
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,550
and that there's
no real need to operate.

137
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:54,628
And that you can eat whatever you want
as long as it's easy to digest.

138
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:59,228
If that's what he tells you,
you've got a year, at most.

139
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:05,636
But if you've got these symptoms,
you won't last a year:

140
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,612
First, if the pain is kind of heavy.

141
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,845
Second, if you can't stop
burping unpleasantly.

142
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,990
And your tongue's always dry.

143
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,092
You can't get enough water and tea.

144
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:27,095
And then there's the diarrhea.

145
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:31,065
And, if it isn't diarrhea,
well, then you're constipated.

146
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,938
Your bowel movements go black.

147
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,335
And then,

148
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,275
that meat you used to love so,
you can hardly touch it anymore.

149
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:50,020
And whatever you eat,
you vomit half an hour later.

150
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,257
And when stuff you ate
last week comes up

151
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,551
when you vomit,
well, then you're done for.

152
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,992
You've hardly got three months...

00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,150
Yes.

156
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:02,926
Sit down.

157
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,633
Um... it looks like
you've got a mild ulcer.

158
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,174
Honestly...

159
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,450
please tell me...

160
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,950
the truth.

161
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,858
Tell me it's stomach cancer.

162
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,587
I just told you,
it's a mild ulcer.

163
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:04,121
What about an operation?
Can't you operate?

164
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:08,089
Oh, no, there's no need to operate.
It'll heal on its own.

165
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,352
And my diet?

166
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:17,266
Well, just use your common sense.
As long as it's easy to digest,

167
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,594
you can eat whatever you like.

168
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,808
Does that patient have a year?

169
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,845
No, I'd give him six months.

170
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,986
- Six months?
- Yeah.

171
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:46,356
What would you do if you had only
six months left to live, like him?

172
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,831
What about you, Aihara?

173
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,039
The barbiturates are over there.

174
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,808
<i>Is there a blackout?</i>

175
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,610
<i>The street lights</i>
<i>and neighbors'are lit.</i>

176
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,585
<i>How strange.</i>
<i>I wonder if Dad's out.</i>

177
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:17,946
<i>Where's the key?</i>

178
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,688
<i>In your handbag.</i>

179
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:26,257
Did Hayashi-san forget to lock up
when she went home?

180
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,390
She's only a part-time maid.

181
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:34,069
Full-time would hardly break the bank,
but a thief sure would.

182
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,898
That's just like Dad,
the petty bureaucrat.

183
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,311
Man, it's freezing.

184
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,811
Just as cold inside as out.

185
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,141
I just hate Japanese houses.

186
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:51,014
Have a great time out and come home
to this dump. We need a modern home.

187
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:52,724
- Honey...
- Yeah.

188
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:57,194
A house of our own would
cost 500,000 yen, right?

189
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,488
Use father's retirement bonus
as collateral...

190
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,797
Yeah, it ought to be worth
6 or 700,000 yen by now.

191
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,497
Plus a monthly pension of
12 or 13,000 yen.

192
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,033
And another 100,000 in savings.

193
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,137
But you think he'd agree?

194
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:16,611
If he doesn't, we'll tell him
we're moving out. That'll clinch it.

195
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:21,344
Besides, even Pop wouldn't want to take
all that money to his grave.

196
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,095
What's wrong, Dad?

197
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:40,904
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

198
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,741
That was strange.

199
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,941
Listen, honey.

200
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,385
It's not fair.

201
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,485
What isn't?

202
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,588
He heard our whole conversation.

203
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,156
It's really not fair.

204
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,325
It may be his house,
but this is our room.

205
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:09,189
I can't believe he snuck in here
while we were out.

206
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:14,338
Besides, if he's got a gripe,
he should come out with it.

207
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,165
Not go around acting
like a crabby kid.

208
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,654
Stop being so moody.

209
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,019
Forget about your dad.

210
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:12,852
He has his life.
We have ours.

211
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,801
Love me.

212
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,359
How sad.

213
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,761
She was so young,

214
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:51,260
and to leave such a sweet
little boy behind.

215
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,034
She must have regretted dying.

216
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,608
Cut it out.
The same broken record.

217
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,192
Hurry, hurry.
Mommy's leaving.

218
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,251
You can't use Mitsuo

219
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,953
as an excuse
not to marry again.

220
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,781
As soon as that boy grows up,

221
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,721
he'll never love you
the way you loved him.

222
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,561
And when he gets married,
they'll squeeze you out.

223
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,756
You've got to think about
your own future.

224
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,403
I'm telling you,
find another wife now.

225
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,571
Besides, my wife says,

226
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:05,402
the thought of you
and your oily skin

227
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,410
keeping up with the laundry
is too disgusting to bear.

228
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,509
Dad.

229
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,391
Mitsuo.

230
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,664
<i>Good night.</i>
<i>You'll lock up down there, right?</i>

231
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,197
Mitsuo.

232
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,041
What do you say?
What a great hit.

233
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:48,675
You know, the batter is my...

234
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,116
Mitsuo, Mitsuo.

235
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,393
That idiot.

236
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,490
What's he thinking?

237
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:21,106
Mitsuo.

238
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:29,015
Mitsuo, be brave.
It's only your appendix.

239
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,313
No worse than pulling a tooth.

240
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,834
Can't you stay for the operation, Dad?

241
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:52,509
Well, I've got some other things
to do and...

242
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,849
Mitsuo, Mitsuo.

243
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:15,926
<i>Banzai, Banzai.</i>

244
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:24,342
<i>Banzai, banzai.</i>

245
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,581
Dad.

246
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,756
Mitsuo.

247
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,268
CERTI FICATE OF APPRECIATION

248
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:20,144
IN RECOGNITION OF 25 YEARS
OF DISTINGUISHED CIVIL SERVICE

249
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,660
Watanabe-san left for work as usual.

250
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,294
What?

251
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:37,690
But he hasn't been in at all.

252
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:42,002
It's been five days now,
but he hasn't called in sick either.

253
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:45,538
The sub-section chief asked me
to check up on him.

254
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,413
Madam. Madam.

255
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,392
What? Impossible.

256
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,257
<i>But it's true.</i>
<i>The man from his office said so.</i>

257
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,522
What could Father be doing?

258
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,067
It's incredible, but it's really true.

259
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:16,232
The people at his house
were flabbergasted.

260
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,867
What a bother.

261
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:24,207
When the section chief's out,
I can stamp your paperwork.

262
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,617
But he has to approve
any resignations, right?

263
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,855
Don't tell me you want to quit?

264
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,916
I don't belong here.

265
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:47,329
Uncle, he even withdrew
50,000 yen from his account.

266
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,898
That miser?

267
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:54,368
Maybe he's got a woman.
That would be quite something.

268
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,643
- Now, dear.
- Never.

269
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,817
Oh, there's no telling
when it comes to love.

270
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:03,579
The least likely ones
have the highest risk.

271
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:09,516
If you ask me, he's actually
always been a real lech.

272
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:15,561
What they call a sullen lech. But he's
stayed single these 20 years for you.

273
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,926
It makes sense
he'd explode sooner or later.

274
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,172
Oh, no. He's lost
a lot of weight recently,

275
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,004
and his skin's
strangely dry and flaky.

276
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,078
I bet there's another explanation.

277
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,803
You saw him recently?

278
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:33,845
Four days ago.
He turned up that morning.

279
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,953
I thought there was definitely
something wrong.

280
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,555
But you know your uncle.

281
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:45,159
He just said, "Why the glum look?
If it's a loan, forget it."

282
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:49,926
Hey, don't tell me he had good news.
Not with that long face.

283
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,969
Now, honey, it's just that

284
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:56,666
my husband thinks all men
are self-indulgent, like him.

285
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:05,177
Say, Mitsuo-san.
Did something happen at home?

286
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,881
No... nothing in particular.

287
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:34,909
Hey.

288
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,143
Deliver this to my place.

289
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,712
My editor's waiting outside.

290
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:50,089
And get some sleeping pills
at the drugstore.

291
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,886
There's a prescription
in my name.

292
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:55,026
But sir, the drugstore's
already closed.

293
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,628
Is it that late?

294
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,903
Around here, they close up
shop after dinner.

295
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,035
What to do?

296
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,510
I can't get to sleep unless
I take them with my nightcap.

297
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,576
Um, I don't mean to be rude.

298
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,311
But I happen to have
some sleeping pills with me.

299
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,203
Well, much obliged.

300
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,309
May I pay you the official price?

301
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,836
No, no.

302
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,176
I was planning to throw them away.

303
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,982
- But...
- No, really.

304
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,580
Really?

305
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:56,020
Then let me pick up your tab.

306
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,855
Oh, no.

307
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,360
You can drink, right?

308
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:04,089
Please, have another.
You hardly seem tipsy.

309
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,303
Why, thank you.

310
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:14,240
I throw up everything anyway.

311
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:20,509
In other words, my stomach...
I have stomach cancer.

312
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,381
- Stomach cancer?
- Yes.

313
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,987
That's a shock.

314
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,059
But then, what you're doing is crazy.

315
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,402
Yes, it's embarrassing, but...

316
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,432
But...

317
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:45,031
It's suicide to drink
when you have stomach cancer.

318
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,807
But... I can't die.

319
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,882
I'll just up and die on them.

320
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,492
I want to, but...

321
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,188
I can't... die.

322
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:12,360
In other words,
I can't bring myself to die.

323
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:19,540
I don't know what I've been doing
with my life all these years.

324
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,711
No children?

325
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,151
Your stomach hurts?

326
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:37,287
No, it's not my stomach...

327
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,166
It seems you're carrying
a heavy load indeed.

328
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:51,475
No...

329
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,546
It's just...

330
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:01,715
I'm such a fool.

331
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,119
I'm just...

332
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:15,557
so furious with myself.

333
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:23,870
Until just a few days ago,

334
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:29,339
I'd never even bought a drink
with my own money.

335
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:36,680
It's only now that I don't know
how much longer I've got to live

336
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,983
that I finally...

337
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,217
I understand.

338
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,119
I understand.

339
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:47,225
But drinking is plain crazy.

340
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:50,196
Besides, does it even taste good?

341
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,995
No, it doesn't.

342
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,837
But...

343
00:37:56,173 --> 00:38:00,371
for a little while,
I can forget my cancer,

344
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:04,306
and all the other painful things.

345
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,448
Drinking...

346
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:14,554
this expensive sake

347
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:19,395
is like paying myself
back with poison

348
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,900
for the way I lived all these years.

349
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,129
In other words,

350
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,529
I mean,

351
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,806
it feels awful,

352
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:37,608
but it feels good at the same...

353
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,784
I can understand.

354
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,322
Oh, why...

355
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,123
Actually, I...

356
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,592
I have 50,000 yen here with me,

357
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,698
which I'd like to spend all at once.

358
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,828
But embarrassingly enough,

359
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:38,198
the thing is, I don't even
actually know how.

360
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,339
So what I'm trying to say is...

361
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,909
You want me to show you
how to spend it?

362
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:49,682
Yes, I realize
it's terribly forward of me...

363
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,582
But...

364
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,663
No, this money...

365
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:14,240
It took me dozens of years
to set aside this money.

366
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,710
All the more reason now to...
What I'm trying to say...

367
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,585
I understand.

368
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:25,913
But please put your money away.

369
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,556
Tonight's on me.

370
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,457
But that's not... I...

371
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,857
Just leave things to me.

372
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,743
Truly fascinating...

373
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,380
I realize it's rude
to call you fascinating,

374
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:58,277
but you're an extremely
rare individual.

375
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:04,017
I'm a half-baked fool
who writes meaningless novels.

376
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,022
You've really made me think tonight.

377
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:25,414
I realize what they say about
the nobility of misfortune is true.

378
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,709
Because misfortune
teaches us the truth.

379
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:32,584
Your cancer has opened your eyes
to your own life.

380
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:43,794
We humans are so careless.

381
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:49,136
We only realize how beautiful life is
when we chance upon death.

382
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,834
But few of us are actually able
to face death.

383
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:56,576
The worst ones know nothing of life
'til they die.

384
00:41:56,881 --> 00:42:00,373
You're splendid.
Rebelling against life at your age.

385
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,449
Your rebellious spirit moves me.

386
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:08,623
You were a slave to your own life.
Now you will become its master.

387
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:12,360
I'm telling you, it's our human duty
to enjoy life.

388
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,693
Wasting it,,
you desecrate God's great gift.

389
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:19,035
We've got to be greedy
about living.

390
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:23,470
We learned that greed is a vice,
but that's old. Greed is a virtue.

391
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,835
Especially this greediness for life.

392
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,042
Let's go.

393
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,415
Let us go reclaim the life
you have wasted.

394
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:41,290
Tonight it will be my pleasure
to act as your Mephistopheles.

395
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:45,121
A good Mephistopheles
who seeks no reward.

396
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:51,460
With a black dog to guide us.
Show us the way.

397
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:57,831
Listen.

398
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,443
These silver balls, they're you.

399
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,309
They're your life itself.

400
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:07,607
This machine liberates people
who strangle themselves

401
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:12,948
in their daily lives. A vending
machine of dreams and infatuations.

402
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,095
Over here, sweetie.

403
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,083
- Not so fast.
- But...

404
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:28,831
You don't know, but these women are
the greediest of all mammals.

405
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:36,629
It'll cost you close to a dozen hats
to get that old one back.

406
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:46,945
Besides, it's time to buy a new hat
to switch to a new self.

407
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,901
Welcome.

408
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,877
Welcome.
We haven't seen you in a while.

409
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,623
The same for your friend?

410
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,661
What are you laughing at?

411
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,741
It's the honest truth.
He really has cancer.

412
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,666
- Then why's he drinking?
- You idiot.

413
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,707
That's why you'll never get it.

414
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:54,409
Ecce homo.
Behold this man.

415
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:58,515
This man bears a cross called cancer.
He's Christ.

416
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:03,091
If you were diagnosed with cancer, you'd
die on the spot.

417
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:08,660
But not this fellow.
That's the moment he started living.

418
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,228
Right? Isn't that so?

419
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:07,289
Listen, the thing is,
that's the etiquette.

420
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:10,352
Listen, you, over here, here.

421
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,978
Anybody want to request a favorite?

422
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,745
"Life is Brief."

423
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,007
What?

424
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,252
"Life is Brief."

425
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:48,753
<i>Fall in love, maidens</i>

426
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:52,788
Oh, that love song from back
in the nineteen teens.

427
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:28,357
<i>Life is brief</i>

428
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:35,502
<i>Fall in love, maidens</i>

429
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:46,476
<i>Before the crimson bloom</i>

430
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:53,345
<i>Fades from your lips</i>

431
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:04,890
<i>Before the tides of passion</i>

432
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:12,004
<i>Cool within you</i>

433
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:21,340
<i>For those of you</i>

434
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:29,316
<i>Who know no tomorrow</i>

435
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:40,894
<i>Life is brief</i>

436
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:47,667
<i>Fall in love, maidens</i>

437
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:57,710
<i>Before your raven tresses</i>

438
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:04,417
<i>Begin to fade</i>

439
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:14,331
<i>Before the flames in your hearts</i>

440
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:21,644
<i>Flicker and die</i>

441
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:31,751
<i>For those to whom</i>

442
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:38,854
<i>Today will never return</i>

443
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:49,097
That's the spirit, man.

444
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:56,169
<i>Life is brief</i>

445
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:47,694
Striptease.
Now, this is what I call art.

446
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:52,028
No, it's more than art.
It's more direct.

447
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:55,529
In other words, that female body

448
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:59,567
gently undulating up there
on stage is a juicy steak,

449
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:02,210
a glass of liquor,
a bottle of camphor,

450
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:04,538
streptomycin, uranium...

451
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:40,000
Please, stop.

452
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:43,303
Hey, stop the car.

453
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:58,777
What? Had enough?

454
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:00,920
I think he's throwing up.

455
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,928
What a drag.

456
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:10,556
<i>Say, let's sing something.</i>
<i>I hate feeling blue.</i>

457
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:14,460
<i>C'mon a my house</i>
<i>a my house</i>

458
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:18,527
<i>I'm gonna give you</i>
<i>a Christmas tree</i>

459
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,367
<i>C'mon a my house</i>
<i>a my house</i>

460
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:28,435
<i>I'm gonna give you a marriage ring</i>
<i>and a pomegranate too</i>

461
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,876
<i>C'mon a my house</i>
<i>a my house</i>

462
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:35,618
<i>C'mon a my house</i>
<i>a my house</i>

463
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:41,849
I'm gonna give you a peach and a pear
I love your hair

464
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:20,857
Section Chief.

465
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:33,306
I thought it was you.

466
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:44,152
I hardly recognized you
in that new hat.

467
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:56,061
But I'm glad.
I was looking for your place.

468
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,500
Are you off to work?

469
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:00,497
No, I'm...

470
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:02,628
Do you have your seal?

471
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,205
No, my seal's back at home.

472
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,807
I want to quit the civil service.

473
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:12,380
I'm in a rush
'cause I found a new job.

474
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,480
- Then come to my house.
- Sure.

475
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,959
- Why are you quitting?
- Boredom.

476
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:35,227
It's killing me. Each day is
as predictable as the last.

477
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,132
Nothing new ever happens.

478
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:42,544
Still, I put up with it
for a year and a half,

479
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:47,145
but the only novel thing that happened
was you taking a few days off,

480
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:51,853
and now this new hat of yours.
That was it.

481
00:59:57,126 --> 01:00:00,391
In any case, don't say anything
when Dad gets back.

482
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,025
I've nothing to say.

483
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:05,828
What I mean is, don't reproach him
about anything.

484
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:08,732
If you hadn't brought up
his pension...

485
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,906
You're so self-centered,
blaming it all on me.

486
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,607
You brought up his savings.

487
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:18,642
Said even he wouldn't
take them to his grave...

488
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:24,644
But it just doesn't make sense that
that's all it took to set Dad off.

489
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,184
Dad's never stayed out all night.

490
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:30,917
Let's stop this now.
We don't even know

491
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,494
what he's up to, let alone
if it's got anything to do with us.

492
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,064
I'll be going then.

493
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:46,799
Oh, c'mon in.

494
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:49,675
Honey!

495
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,845
Thirty years.

496
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:01,315
Thirty years in that awful place.
It kills me to think of it.

497
01:02:02,618 --> 01:02:04,210
I'm sorry.

498
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,053
No, it's just,

499
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:10,751
recently,

500
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,285
every time I see that award,

501
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:18,132
it reminds me of
that joke you read us.

502
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:23,733
No, no, that joke hit the nail
on the head.

503
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:31,371
No matter how hard I try,

504
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:38,181
I can't remember a thing
I've done in that office

505
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:43,224
over the last thirty years.

506
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:47,561
All I remember,

507
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:52,764
what I mean is,
I was just busy,

508
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:57,405
and even then I was bored.

509
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:03,913
I had you all wrong, Section Chief.
You actually get it. What a shock.

510
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:17,158
That's crazy. Whatever uncle says,
I know Dad best.

511
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,423
But...

512
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:23,531
I can't even imagine Dad with such a
young girl.

513
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,970
This is the wrong form.

514
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:10,873
Are you going in to the office?

515
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:13,447
Yes, I've got to deliver this.

516
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:16,641
Then will you post my sick leave?

517
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,987
Why are you staying out
of the office?

518
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:24,784
It's a hot topic around there.
Like you mutated or something.

519
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,724
I just...

520
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,864
Are you really sick?

521
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:36,664
Actually, you look kind of pale.

522
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:41,201
It's just that what I mean...

523
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:44,279
I didn't think so.

524
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:49,541
So where do you go
when you pretend you're going to work?

525
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:53,886
You don't fool me.

526
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,422
But how odd.

527
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,094
Don't you know? Sakai-san came here
yesterday and spilled the beans.,

528
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:06,395
Who cares?

529
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:09,005
After 30 years with
an unblemished record,

530
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:11,872
you deserve at least six months off.

531
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:20,339
Besides, I'll cover for you.
I'm not like that Fish Kite.

532
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:24,076
- Fish kite?
- Yes, he's a human Fish Kite,

533
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:30,593
that Sakai-san is. His lips are always
moving, but he's just hot air inside.

534
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:35,430
Besides, he acts like
he's some high flyer.

535
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:39,299
He makes 200 yen more a month
than I do,

536
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:42,560
so he looks down on me.

537
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:03,950
Bye, then.

538
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:17,161
Say, wait, I'll go with you.

539
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,288
Madam.

540
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:16,231
Madam.

541
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:21,499
You're so lucky. I wish I could live
in a house like yours.

542
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:27,369
Our place crams three generations
in two rooms. It's like civil war.

543
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:32,211
And you have a wonderful son, right?

544
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:36,017
In any event, where do you buy
ladies' stockings?

545
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:37,876
- You're buying some?
- Yes.

546
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:41,713
Western clothing stores carry them.

547
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:48,186
They're for your daughter-in-law, right?
I've heard she's very pretty.

548
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:51,589
According to our
Mr. Fish Kite's report.

549
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:07,210
- They look wonderful.
- I'm all dizzy.

550
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:11,014
- They make you that happy?
- So happy.

551
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:16,223
To buy them myself, I'd have to live
on sardines for lunch for three months.

552
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:19,085
But why did you buy them for me?

553
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:22,956
In a word, your stockings had holes.

554
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:28,964
But the holes in my stockings
don't bother your legs.

555
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:31,469
It's just that I...

556
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:37,211
No, no. I didn't mean that.
I know how kind you are.

557
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:43,248
But right now, I feel kind of awkward,
so I made that awful remark. I'm sorry.

558
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,698
Want to hear something good?

559
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,032
Something good?

560
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:11,212
I got so bored I had to give everyone
at work a nickname.

561
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:12,871
Want to hear them?

562
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:14,812
Sea Slug.
- Sea Slug?

563
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:19,153
Can you guess?
Someone who's slippery and evasive.

564
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:23,217
Ohno-san, the sub-section chief.

565
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:27,259
Sea Slug... indeed.

566
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:32,128
Ditch-cover-board,
damp and soggy all year round.

567
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:36,101
- Would that be Ohbara?
- Bingo!

568
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,465
Next comes Flypaper.

569
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:44,074
- Flypaper?
- You know, sticks to everything.

570
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:46,774
Get it? Noguchi-san.

571
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:55,651
Next is Saito-san, the manager.
See if you can guess his nickname.

572
01:09:56,125 --> 01:10:00,061
Saito, huh. Saito would be...

573
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:04,697
Saito's main feature
is that he's so featureless.

574
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:09,169
I don't really know...

575
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:11,004
Daily Special.

576
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,865
- Daily special?
- At the cafeteria.

577
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:20,939
Then what about Kimura?

578
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:24,310
Rice noodles,
always timid and trembling.

579
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:30,854
Say, I had a nickname
for you, too.

580
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:35,922
But I'm not going to tell,
'cause I had you all wrong.

581
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:40,029
No, don't worry, just tell me...

582
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:42,131
Oh, dear.

583
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:46,372
No, I'd rather you broke it to me.

584
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:49,035
Okay, then. The Mummy.

585
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,244
I'm sorry.

586
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:58,348
Oh, no...

587
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:03,289
In other words, I'm...

588
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:19,437
I'm going.
Thank you so much.

589
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:24,438
Do you really have to tender
your resignation today?

590
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:30,915
If you could make it tomorrow,
why not spend today...

591
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:03,172
You're not eating anything.

592
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:04,969
No, it's just...

593
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:08,182
You look so tired.

594
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:12,877
But I had a truly
marvelous day today.

595
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:17,022
But you snored through
the best part of the movie.

596
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:24,558
It's just that I overdid it
a little last night.

597
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:31,868
Kimura-san...

598
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:51,059
I really can't...
This isn't the sort of thing

599
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:56,530
I can tell just anyone. It's quite
embarrassing, but...

600
01:13:57,032 --> 01:14:00,968
In other words, the reason

601
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:04,636
I worked like a mummy

602
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:08,674
these last 30 years...

603
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:12,003
Oh, no,

604
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:18,342
it's not that I mind you
calling me a mummy.

605
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:22,784
Because that's exactly right.

606
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:27,359
In other words, I don't blame you.

607
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:33,226
It's just that the reason

608
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:36,862
I made myself into a mummy...

609
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:42,503
In other words, I did it all

610
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,705
for my son's sake.

611
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:51,812
But as it turned out, my son

612
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:56,090
doesn't seem to give a whit.

613
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:02,958
But you can't blame it all
on your son.

614
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:05,699
Isn't that right?

615
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:09,697
Not unless he asked you
to make a mummy of yourself.

616
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:25,511
Parents are all the same.

617
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:28,747
My mom gives me the same
kind of line sometimes.

618
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:31,551
"The things I've suffered for you."

619
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:34,021
And I'm grateful she had me.

620
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:36,289
But it's not my fault I was born.

621
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:45,233
What's the matter with you,
bad-mouthing your son to me?

622
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:50,805
It's just...

623
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:57,347
You know you still adore him.

624
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:41,490
No end in sight
for the electricity shortage.

625
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:44,356
Is that a fact?

626
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:29,474
They say we haven't had
such a heat wave in 30 years.

627
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:34,673
I see.

628
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:58,134
The thing is, there's something

629
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:02,207
I'd like to tell you.

630
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:08,743
I know I should have
told you sooner,

631
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:13,914
but it's not very pleasant business.

632
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:16,916
Father, let's drop it.

633
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:20,859
You see, I discussed it
with Uncle today,

634
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:24,430
and we have to address this
to avoid complications later.

635
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:27,998
For instance, we have our rights
as your heirs.

636
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:29,760
To avoid misunderstandings...

637
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:30,970
- Mitsuo!
- Fact is,

638
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:34,040
she's fleeced you out of 50,000 yen
in a few days.

639
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:36,437
Young girls these days...
- What are you...

640
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:40,512
Father, we respect your right
to freedom of expression.

641
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:43,184
We accept your degenerate behavior.

642
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:46,146
But we do have
some basic conditions.

643
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:50,824
Think of Kazue or, putting her aside,
of her family back home.

644
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:54,155
How dare you bring
a woman like that home.

645
01:18:54,529 --> 01:19:00,024
And holding hands with her in your
room. I could hardly face the maid.

646
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:49,009
<i>It's been two weeks now since</i>
<i>our protagonist abandoned his spot.</i>

647
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,093
<i>During that time,</i>

648
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:05,925
<i>various rumors and speculations</i>
<i>have swirled around our Watanabe-san.</i>

649
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:20,447
<i>All these rumors</i>
<i>and speculations coincide perfectly</i>

650
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:25,145
<i>with the notion that our Watanabe-san</i>
<i>is being very. Foolish indeed.</i>

651
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:32,224
<i>But Watanabe himself has</i>
<i>never taken his actions so seriously</i>

652
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,621
<i>in his entire life.</i>

653
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:37,790
This isn't the city office,

654
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:42,964
where you waste a whole day
on an hour's work. It's more serious.

655
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:44,570
It's just, I...

656
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:47,298
Every minute I waste here
costs me money.

657
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:49,836
Then I'll see you tonight...

658
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:53,544
I'm exhausted at night.
I'd rather sleep than go out.

659
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:58,618
Besides, why are you always
taking me out?

660
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:00,584
It's just...

661
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:05,019
Let's stop doing this.
It doesn't feel right.

662
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:09,293
But, then, just one more night, okay?

663
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:11,763
No, it'll never end.

664
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,529
I'm sorry.

665
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:44,632
After tonight,
no more, okay?

666
01:22:47,562 --> 01:22:50,030
Shall we go for a stroll?

667
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:51,596
I've had it.

668
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:55,733
Next it'll be a sweet shop,
then a sushi or noodle joint.

669
01:22:56,838 --> 01:22:59,568
What's the point of it all?

670
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:05,739
I feel badly that you keep treating me,
but I've had it up to here.

671
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:09,942
Besides, we've both run out
of things to say.

672
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,850
There's that face again.

673
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:20,385
The truth is,
you give me the creeps.

674
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:33,466
What's going on?
Why do you chase me around like this?

675
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:37,741
- In other words...
- In other words, what?

676
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:44,042
In other words, I really enjoy
spending time with you this way.

677
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:45,984
Keep your old man's infatuation.

678
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:50,052
No, it's just that I...

679
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:54,852
Why can't you spit it out,
instead of always dribbling?

680
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,200
- Are you mad?
- No.

681
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:14,715
I don't even know myself

682
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:19,180
why I keep following you around.

683
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:23,284
It's just, all I do know is...

684
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:50,840
You see, I'm going to die soon.

685
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:55,020
I've got stomach cancer.
It's right here.

686
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:04,121
Can you understand?

687
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:10,637
No matter what I do,
I've only got six months or a year left.

688
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:15,574
Ever since I've known that,
the way I felt about you became like...

689
01:25:16,377 --> 01:25:22,612
I know. I nearly drowned in a pond
once when I was a child.

690
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:25,948
I felt exactly the same way then.

691
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:28,988
Everything seems black.

692
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:33,889
No matter how I struggle and panic,
there's nothing to grab hold of,

693
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:36,360
except you.
- And your son?

694
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:40,733
Don't talk to me about my son.

695
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:43,300
I have no son.

696
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,837
I'm all alone.
- But...

697
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:51,039
No, you really don't understand.

698
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:55,879
My son is somewhere far, far away.

699
01:25:56,017 --> 01:25:58,008
Just as my parents were

700
01:25:58,286 --> 01:26:01,881
when I was drowning in that pond.

701
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:06,024
It hurts me even to think
about him now.

702
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:09,262
But why is anyone like me so...

703
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:11,658
It's just that, that, you're, I mean...

704
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:15,827
When I look at you,
it warms me up

705
01:26:16,871 --> 01:26:19,738
right here.

706
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:24,508
This old... this old mummy...

707
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:34,078
In other words, you're like,
you seem like my family...

708
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:41,124
No, that's not right. You're young
and you're healthy, so that's why...

709
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:46,598
No, that's not right.
In other words,

710
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:52,034
in other words, why are you so
incredibly alive?

711
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:54,270
You're just so alive.

712
01:26:54,709 --> 01:27:00,648
That's why I'm envious.
This old mummy envies you.

713
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:04,845
Before I die, I want to live
just one day like you do.

714
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:08,221
I'll live that way before I die.

715
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:11,955
Until I've done it,
I can't just give up and die.

716
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,285
In other words, I just...

717
01:27:14,462 --> 01:27:19,490
I just want something to...
I want to do something.

718
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:25,601
But it's just that, I don't know what.
But you do know.

719
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:28,238
No, maybe you don't, but you...

720
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:29,568
But I don't...

721
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:32,179
No, tell me, how can I be like you?

722
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,877
- But all I do is work and eat...
- And what else?

723
01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:38,218
That's all.

724
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:49,357
I mean it.
All I do is make these little things.

725
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:01,374
Even making these is so much fun.

726
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:05,975
Making them, I feel like I'm playing
with every baby in Japan.

727
01:28:07,415 --> 01:28:09,906
Why don't you try
making something too?

728
01:28:11,919 --> 01:28:14,820
What can I possibly make
at that office?

729
01:28:16,224 --> 01:28:21,958
You're right. It's just impossible
to make anything there. So quit and go...

730
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:33,865
It's too late.

731
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:10,368
It's not too late.

732
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,571
No, it's not impossible.

733
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:19,512
I know I can do something there.
I just have to find the will.

734
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:30,627
There is something I can do...

735
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:10,338
It's a matter of time before he resigns.

736
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:13,102
His son came yesterday about his
pension.

737
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:16,808
Which means
you'll finally be section chief.

738
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:19,540
Well, you never know.

739
01:31:02,757 --> 01:31:04,349
Good morning.

740
01:31:15,069 --> 01:31:16,036
Section Chief.

741
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:22,737
Ohno, I'd like you to...

742
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:33,320
PETITION BYTHE WOMEN'S COMMITTEE
TO REPAI R AND FI LL I N CESSPOOL

743
01:31:34,055 --> 01:31:36,157
THE ENGI NEERI NG DEPARTMENT IS
HEREBY DESIGNATED I N CHARGE OF...

744
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,647
THIS MATTER.

745
01:31:37,925 --> 01:31:39,859
But this belongs to Engineering.

746
01:31:40,595 --> 01:31:44,554
No, this is just the sort of matter

747
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:49,426
that Public Affairs
must take the lead on.

748
01:31:49,937 --> 01:31:52,428
This isn't just Engineering's problem.

749
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:57,007
Parks and Sewage also
have a responsibility.

750
01:31:57,211 --> 01:31:59,543
- Say, get me a bicycle.
- Yes.

751
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:02,949
I'm going out to survey the site.

752
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:05,584
Put together a report today.

753
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:06,888
I think that's a little impossible.

754
01:32:06,888 --> 01:32:09,379
No, not if you set your mind to it.

755
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:34,874
<i>Five months later.</i>

756
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:39,046
T<i>he protagonist of our story. Has died.</i>

757
01:33:24,398 --> 01:33:27,526
Let us see the deputy mayor.
He's here, right?

758
01:33:27,835 --> 01:33:30,804
Five minutes.
Just fiive minutes, please.

759
01:33:41,515 --> 01:33:44,279
What should I tell them?

760
01:34:10,444 --> 01:34:14,471
- But why press it when nothing's wrong?
- Are you sure?

761
01:34:14,849 --> 01:34:17,613
Our claim is based on
thorough research.

762
01:34:17,785 --> 01:34:19,309
Deputy Mayor, sir.

763
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:23,952
Although technically the Parks Dept.
And the Ward Committee built that park

764
01:34:24,258 --> 01:34:28,661
with your backing, wasn't it really
Watanabe-san who built it?

765
01:34:28,896 --> 01:34:29,794
That's the word.

766
01:34:29,897 --> 01:34:33,424
But Watanabe was section chief
of Public Affairs.

767
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:36,795
The Park Department builds parks.

768
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:39,497
Sure, we understand that.
But actually,

769
01:34:39,807 --> 01:34:45,211
we're talking about the man who
kept the plan alive and saw it through.

770
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:48,940
The community residents believe
that was Watanabe-san.

771
01:34:49,216 --> 01:34:51,318
They're all worried about why
Watanabe-san...

772
01:34:51,318 --> 01:34:53,843
died in the park he created.

773
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:55,679
What do you mean?

774
01:34:55,956 --> 01:34:59,858
Well, they had reservations
long before this.

775
01:35:00,895 --> 01:35:06,765
You never mentioned Watanabe-san
in the speech you gave

776
01:35:06,901 --> 01:35:09,836
at the park's opening ceremony.

777
01:35:09,937 --> 01:35:11,539
They don't even call it a speech.

778
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:12,938
What was it, then?

779
01:35:15,776 --> 01:35:17,712
Electioneering.

780
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:18,406
And also,

781
01:35:18,512 --> 01:35:22,312
that Watanabe-san was snubbed
at the ceremony

782
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:26,551
and seated in the back row.

783
01:35:27,088 --> 01:35:30,615
In other words, general sympathy
for Watanabe-san

784
01:35:30,691 --> 01:35:33,251
has given rise to a special
interpretation of his death at the park.

785
01:35:33,494 --> 01:35:38,158
Meaning that his was an act of silent
protest against city officials.

786
01:35:38,499 --> 01:35:43,232
So you're saying that Watanabe
committed suicide,

787
01:35:43,904 --> 01:35:48,102
or at least was prepared to,
when he froze to death there?

788
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:51,075
More or less.

789
01:35:52,179 --> 01:35:57,879
It was snowing last night.
Sounds like a scene right out of a play.

790
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:00,614
However,

791
01:36:01,622 --> 01:36:07,618
the truth is, an autopsy has clearly
established Watanabe's cause of death.

792
01:36:08,028 --> 01:36:13,432
He neither committed suicide nor froze
to death. He died of stomach cancer.

793
01:36:14,702 --> 01:36:16,727
- Stomach cancer?
- Right.

794
01:36:16,871 --> 01:36:18,736
Intestinal hemorrhaging.

795
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:23,205
Watanabe died suddenly,
when he himself had no idea.

796
01:36:23,711 --> 01:36:26,578
If you've any doubts...
Ohno,

797
01:36:27,014 --> 01:36:29,505
refer them to his hospital.

798
01:37:44,091 --> 01:37:45,888
It doesn't sit right.

799
01:37:47,461 --> 01:37:51,158
These newspapermen
and their lack of sensitivity.

800
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:57,868
Actually, it applies
to the general public.

801
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:03,769
Their fundamental antipathy towards
city officials will never do.

802
01:38:06,447 --> 01:38:09,541
They just don't understand
how we function.

803
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:13,513
Take that little park in Kuroe,
for instance.

804
01:38:13,821 --> 01:38:18,520
Apparently the public seems to believe
that Watanabe built it.

805
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:21,022
But that's ridiculous.

806
01:38:21,595 --> 01:38:23,586
I hate to say this at his wake.

807
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:31,463
And maybe I shouldn't,
in front of his family and relatives,

808
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:38,071
but I'll go ahead because I know
Watanabe himself would disagree.

809
01:38:39,179 --> 01:38:44,515
Watanabe certainly went
to great pains

810
01:38:44,618 --> 01:38:47,712
to make that park.

811
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:50,655
I take my hat off to his passion.

812
01:38:51,225 --> 01:38:56,094
But all his efforts were
in the context of his office.

813
01:38:59,533 --> 01:39:02,593
The idea that he went beyond
the scope of his office

814
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:05,200
to facilitate citizens' desires,

815
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:08,541
and actually made the park himself,

816
01:39:08,742 --> 01:39:11,870
is nonsensical to those
who understand our bureaucracy.

817
01:39:15,149 --> 01:39:18,550
I'm sure Watanabe himself is wincing.

818
01:39:24,658 --> 01:39:26,216
However,

819
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:32,997
given that such rumors are surfacing,
perhaps we may have been remiss.

820
01:39:33,901 --> 01:39:38,235
Everyone focused on that historic
project that rushed through construction.

821
01:39:38,706 --> 01:39:42,005
Maybe we should have singled out
someone's service.

822
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:44,075
For instance,

823
01:39:44,845 --> 01:39:47,006
section chief
of the Parks Department.

824
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:52,817
Or his superior,
the division chief in Engineering.

825
01:39:55,556 --> 01:40:00,721
That's what you say, Deputy Mayor,
but here's what I think.

826
01:40:01,128 --> 01:40:06,998
All the Parks' section chief and I did
was follow the dictates of our office.

827
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:11,031
But when you bear in mind
your own struggles

828
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:15,800
to rein in that notoriously political
City Council,

829
01:40:16,076 --> 01:40:18,636
and realize the park's construction,

830
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:22,577
it's you, Deputy Mayor,
who should be singled out.

831
01:40:23,951 --> 01:40:25,543
None of that, now.

832
01:40:26,987 --> 01:40:31,583
Some people have even criticized
my speech at the opening ceremony.

833
01:40:32,226 --> 01:40:33,557
Isn't that right, Ohno?

834
01:40:33,761 --> 01:40:38,061
Some even say
I was electioneering.

835
01:40:39,967 --> 01:40:43,801
Excuse me.
The residents of Kuroe

836
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:46,964
are here asking to burn incense
for the deceased.

837
01:42:53,467 --> 01:42:56,265
Dear.
Mitsuo-san.

838
01:45:01,061 --> 01:45:03,120
It sure is cold.

839
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:05,430
May I pour one for you?

840
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,927
Oh, no, I'll go get warm sake.

841
01:45:09,803 --> 01:45:15,075
What do you say? Why don't you all
move closer down here?

842
01:45:15,075 --> 01:45:16,303
Why not?

843
01:45:17,611 --> 01:45:19,476
- Over here, please.
- Thanks.

844
01:45:21,081 --> 01:45:23,276
Hayashi-san.

845
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:40,428
Here, Ohno-san.

846
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:46,206
Have all the big shots gone
to a meeting?

847
01:45:46,206 --> 01:45:47,002
Yes.

848
01:45:48,675 --> 01:45:51,735
No, they couldn't stand to stay here.

849
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:58,417
I don't care what anyone says.
It was Watanabe-san who made that park.

850
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:03,447
In their hearts, the deputy mayor
and his people know...

851
01:46:03,857 --> 01:46:07,349
That's going too far.
As the deputy mayor said...

852
01:46:07,561 --> 01:46:11,861
That's right. I'm not saying this
because I'm in the Parks Department,

853
01:46:12,065 --> 01:46:15,592
but we planned, budgeted
and built that park.

854
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:19,771
No, that's not what I mean.

855
01:46:21,141 --> 01:46:24,111
Let it go. I can understand
your feelings, but...

856
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:26,705
The point is,
he was in Public Affairs.

857
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:30,477
How dare he even think aboutmaking a
park.

858
01:46:30,851 --> 01:46:32,842
Violating our bureaucratic turf.

859
01:46:33,253 --> 01:46:38,691
No, if you've got to credit something,
it was coincidence that made that park.

860
01:46:38,825 --> 01:46:40,986
- But in that...
- Just listen.

861
01:46:41,261 --> 01:46:45,925
City council members had
an upcoming election to consider,

862
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:50,766
and the concession owners sniffed
a possible restaurant row,

863
01:46:51,004 --> 01:46:55,236
and all that sure sped up work
on that landfill site.

864
01:46:55,776 --> 01:46:57,038
- That's right.
- Yes.

865
01:46:57,411 --> 01:46:59,379
That's exactly right.

866
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:02,978
But I just can't figure it out.

867
01:47:04,518 --> 01:47:11,481
Why would anyone with his personality
suddenly up and change like that?

868
01:47:19,466 --> 01:47:21,491
Right, it's a total mystery.

869
01:47:21,802 --> 01:47:23,736
That's right, exactly.

870
01:47:23,804 --> 01:47:28,764
In other words, with the benefit
of hindsight, it's obvious.

871
01:47:29,342 --> 01:47:34,177
Watanabe-san must've known
he had stomach cancer.

872
01:47:34,514 --> 01:47:35,173
That's why...

873
01:47:35,882 --> 01:47:38,316
Oh, we were just discussing

874
01:47:38,552 --> 01:47:42,189
whether or not your father knew
he had stomach cancer.

875
01:47:42,189 --> 01:47:45,725
Well, if he'd known, I'm sure
he would have told me.

876
01:47:45,725 --> 01:47:46,493
I see.

877
01:47:46,493 --> 01:47:52,232
But I believe my father was fortunate
to die without realizing he had cancer.

878
01:47:52,232 --> 01:47:54,901
Because that disease
is a death sentence.

879
01:47:54,901 --> 01:47:59,105
I see. Well, that knocks out
Saito's theory.

880
01:47:59,105 --> 01:48:00,629
What's that theory?

881
01:48:01,942 --> 01:48:06,079
It's just that five months ago,
something transformed him.

882
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:07,171
You're right.

883
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:11,646
And none of us could make
heads or tails of what had changed him.

884
01:48:11,918 --> 01:48:14,853
Well, that's the woman's touch.

885
01:48:15,222 --> 01:48:16,814
A young mistress' hormones

886
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:23,255
can temporarily revive
an old man. Happens all the time.

887
01:48:23,463 --> 01:48:26,330
Put a real sheen back on his cheeks.

888
01:48:26,633 --> 01:48:32,128
The truth is, he'd recently
found a way to buff that sheen.

889
01:48:32,973 --> 01:48:35,407
Right.
That explains that rakish hat.

890
01:48:35,709 --> 01:48:41,443
You're right. Frankly, that hat
was quite a shocker.

891
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:46,319
Section Chief,
I think that's a little impossible.

892
01:48:46,753 --> 01:48:49,381
No, not if we set our minds to it.

893
01:49:00,267 --> 01:49:01,734
But...

894
01:49:36,836 --> 01:49:38,736
My point is,

895
01:49:39,005 --> 01:49:43,169
there was something extraordinary
about his dedication.

896
01:49:43,443 --> 01:49:44,569
Yes, that's right.

897
01:49:46,846 --> 01:49:52,785
I don't mean to argue, but a woman's
touch alone can't account for...

898
01:49:52,986 --> 01:49:54,385
- But...
- Dear.

899
01:49:54,621 --> 01:49:56,885
The thing is...

900
01:49:59,793 --> 01:50:01,727
Just doesn't...

901
01:50:06,032 --> 01:50:08,865
Not to change the subject,

902
01:50:09,369 --> 01:50:14,864
but there were times when his dogged
dedication threatened to derail it all.

903
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:18,878
That's city hall for you.
Gotta guard your turf.

904
01:50:18,878 --> 01:50:22,541
What I just can't wrap
my head around

905
01:50:22,816 --> 01:50:26,115
is why a 30-year veteran
of the place suddenly...

906
01:50:26,586 --> 01:50:28,554
That's because Watanabe-san...

907
01:50:34,828 --> 01:50:36,227
In any event,

908
01:50:36,363 --> 01:50:40,094
hawking that park proposal of his
around every section

909
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:43,727
practically guaranteed
everyone would dig in their heels.

910
01:50:43,903 --> 01:50:46,506
Including our own section chief.

911
01:50:46,506 --> 01:50:49,669
Parks were our business, not
Watanabe's.

912
01:50:51,511 --> 01:50:54,503
We have our own proposals
for new parks.

913
01:50:54,748 --> 01:51:00,311
Can't you reconsider?
This site is really terrible.

914
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:03,412
But making a park isn't as simple

915
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:06,490
as you outline in your proposal.

916
01:51:06,826 --> 01:51:09,294
No, this proposal is just a...

917
01:51:09,496 --> 01:51:10,986
I understand.

918
01:51:11,698 --> 01:51:16,294
I'll take my time
and go over it thoroughly.

919
01:51:20,774 --> 01:51:24,110
But the thing is, ultimately,
the parks' section chief

920
01:51:24,110 --> 01:51:27,341
caved in to his peculiar determination.

921
01:51:27,781 --> 01:51:31,774
You've got a point there.
Our section chief gave in, too.

922
01:52:37,083 --> 01:52:39,517
He was something.

923
01:52:39,619 --> 01:52:42,213
Watanabe waited days
for the answer he wanted.

924
01:52:42,288 --> 01:52:46,918
Our section chief used to
sneak around, trying to avoid him.

925
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:48,056
That's right.

926
01:52:59,873 --> 01:53:03,570
Engineering Section Chief,
Section Chief.

927
01:53:06,212 --> 01:53:12,048
Couldn't believe he stooped
to flattering peons like me.

928
01:53:12,552 --> 01:53:14,713
Won't you please...

929
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:18,917
Isn't there a way...

930
01:53:42,882 --> 01:53:44,509
Finally, we took pity on him.

931
01:53:46,586 --> 01:53:50,386
That's right. In the end
we all took pity on him.

932
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:54,185
But, hey, you guys in Administration,

933
01:53:54,494 --> 01:53:56,962
you were the worst of all.

934
01:53:57,163 --> 01:53:57,993
That's not...

935
01:53:58,364 --> 01:54:01,822
No, I always went with him,
so I know.

936
01:54:02,135 --> 01:54:05,798
You made us beg for two weeks.
How could I forget?

937
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:07,729
I'm sorry.

938
01:54:08,608 --> 01:54:13,011
But then, remember that shocker?

939
01:54:14,848 --> 01:54:18,375
Yeah, what a shocker.

940
01:54:57,357 --> 01:55:00,884
DEPUTY MAYOR'S OFFICE

941
01:55:03,997 --> 01:55:06,966
But you know
what was even more shocking?

942
01:55:07,267 --> 01:55:09,258
The thing with the deputy mayor?

943
01:55:09,769 --> 01:55:12,237
I heard, I heard.
What a shock.

944
01:55:16,009 --> 01:55:19,877
A lowly section chief
openly defying the deputy mayor.

945
01:55:20,146 --> 01:55:22,011
Made history at City Hall.

946
01:55:31,291 --> 01:55:34,658
About that new park.

947
01:55:35,328 --> 01:55:37,592
It's one thing to show initiative,

948
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:42,630
but you don't want people to think
of you as self-aggrandizing.

949
01:55:43,202 --> 01:55:46,968
And the City Council's got
problems of its own.

950
01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:52,234
I think it's best you give up
that proposal.

951
01:55:52,912 --> 01:55:56,507
Last night, we were treated
to a geisha party.

952
01:55:57,050 --> 01:56:00,315
Man, geisha these days
are appalling.

953
01:56:00,553 --> 01:56:04,785
One of'em spent the whole evening
sulking and clammed up.

954
01:56:04,857 --> 01:56:09,021
The madam said she was
a student, a moonlighter.

955
01:56:10,663 --> 01:56:11,925
That's a laugh.

956
01:56:17,971 --> 01:56:21,031
Won't you please...

957
01:56:23,309 --> 01:56:24,936
reconsider this proposal...

958
01:56:30,583 --> 01:56:33,677
What did you just say?

959
01:56:40,426 --> 01:56:41,017
Yes.

960
01:56:42,829 --> 01:56:44,126
Um...

961
01:56:44,864 --> 01:56:48,823
About that park,

962
01:56:48,968 --> 01:56:52,267
won't you reconsider your decision?

963
01:57:36,115 --> 01:57:38,083
But the thing is,

964
01:57:38,584 --> 01:57:43,021
when you think back, was it worth
his taking it that far?

965
01:57:43,289 --> 01:57:45,553
He was crazy.

966
01:57:45,625 --> 01:57:49,755
It's just that in City Hall
everyone's guarding his own turf.

967
01:57:49,996 --> 01:57:54,228
But after that, the deputy mayor
did reconsider. So...

968
01:57:54,467 --> 01:57:58,403
No, because the City Council rode him.
Coincidence, in other words.

969
01:57:58,604 --> 01:58:04,167
It's too sentimental to attribute it alldto
Watanabe-san's dedication.

970
01:58:05,311 --> 01:58:06,243
Sentimental...

971
01:58:06,813 --> 01:58:10,442
Is that so?
I don't see it that way.

972
01:58:11,117 --> 01:58:16,289
The point is, the world is a dark place
if his dedication was pointless.

973
01:58:16,289 --> 01:58:17,847
It is a dark place.

974
01:58:20,993 --> 01:58:22,392
First of all,

975
01:58:22,528 --> 01:58:26,658
just the sight of Watanabe-san.
It was like

976
01:58:26,866 --> 01:58:29,835
he kept himself going
with nothing but work.

977
01:58:30,136 --> 01:58:32,730
Wasn't that how it seemed?

978
01:58:33,439 --> 01:58:36,966
Sometimes he even
gave me the chills.

979
01:58:38,978 --> 01:58:42,311
When was that? I was...

980
01:59:27,927 --> 01:59:33,024
It reminds me of seeing him
at that construction site.

981
02:01:09,662 --> 02:01:13,996
How can I put it?
The way he gazed out over the site,

982
02:01:14,133 --> 02:01:18,866
like a father or grandfather
tenderly watching a favorite child...

983
02:01:19,138 --> 02:01:21,003
Of course it was.

984
02:01:21,140 --> 02:01:23,631
Because Watanabe-san
cherished that park.

985
02:01:24,810 --> 02:01:26,971
So, in that case...

986
02:01:27,613 --> 02:01:33,745
It's exactly what I told you before.
Whatever anyone may say,

987
02:01:33,919 --> 02:01:35,409
Watanabe-san built it...

988
02:01:35,755 --> 02:01:41,294
But if the City Council and deputy
mayor hadn't been facing an election,

989
02:01:41,294 --> 02:01:43,558
they'd have ditched the proposal.

990
02:01:43,696 --> 02:01:47,962
Watanabe-san had nothing to do
with the crucial decisions.

991
02:01:48,167 --> 02:01:50,567
No, that's not actually true.

992
02:01:50,770 --> 02:01:52,032
- Oh, really?
- Really.

993
02:01:52,405 --> 02:01:55,465
The folks who wanted
that restaurant row

994
02:01:55,708 --> 02:01:59,735
hated having Watanabe
in their way. The thing is...

995
02:02:17,096 --> 02:02:18,427
Section Chief.

996
02:02:21,534 --> 02:02:25,470
- Hey, you Section Chief of Public Affairs?
- Yes.

997
02:02:29,075 --> 02:02:31,305
Just the man I wanted to see.

998
02:02:33,579 --> 02:02:37,037
Old man, you keep your fat trap shut.

999
02:02:37,450 --> 02:02:40,544
What on earth are you trying to...

1000
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:42,581
Don't fuck with me.

1001
02:02:46,792 --> 02:02:51,286
No hard feelings.
Just shut up and back down.

1002
02:02:52,465 --> 02:02:55,059
Hey, say something.

1003
02:02:56,736 --> 02:02:58,169
You're risking your life.

1004
02:03:17,456 --> 02:03:19,924
This is him, Watanabe.

1005
02:04:39,205 --> 02:04:41,173
I just don't get it.

1006
02:04:41,507 --> 02:04:45,443
Why would anyone like him just...

1007
02:04:45,744 --> 02:04:48,076
I just don't...

1008
02:04:59,592 --> 02:05:04,154
No. Watanabe-san knew
he had stomach cancer. I'm positive.

1009
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:05,627
But...

1010
02:05:06,699 --> 02:05:10,829
I just suddenly remembered...

1011
02:05:25,084 --> 02:05:27,348
This is just inexcusable.

1012
02:05:27,853 --> 02:05:29,844
We've been at this for two weeks.

1013
02:05:30,022 --> 02:05:34,686
At least they could tell us
whether or not the funds are there.

1014
02:05:34,927 --> 02:05:36,758
Administration's just cruel.

1015
02:05:37,196 --> 02:05:41,257
They'll allocate the funds anyway.
It's not their personal money.

1016
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:43,431
Now, now, there.

1017
02:05:43,636 --> 02:05:48,369
But doesn't it make you furious
when they walk all over you this way?

1018
02:05:50,676 --> 02:05:51,438
No.

1019
02:05:52,611 --> 02:05:55,705
I can't afford to hate people.

1020
02:05:57,816 --> 02:06:00,910
I haven't got that kind of time.

1021
02:06:09,962 --> 02:06:10,587
Meaning...

1022
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:21,631
Say. Speaking of that...

1023
02:06:22,841 --> 02:06:28,211
I've got another one like that.

1024
02:06:43,896 --> 02:06:46,592
How beautiful.

1025
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:57,206
How truly beautiful.

1026
02:06:59,712 --> 02:07:05,150
In the last 30 years,
I'd all but forgotten about sunsets.

1027
02:07:12,391 --> 02:07:15,656
But I haven't got time for this now.

1028
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,328
Thought so.

1029
02:07:22,735 --> 02:07:23,258
Now I see.

1030
02:07:23,535 --> 02:07:26,698
Knowing he didn't have
long left to live...

1031
02:07:27,272 --> 02:07:30,400
It makes everything clear as day.

1032
02:07:30,542 --> 02:07:32,203
Otherwise, it makes no...

1033
02:07:32,478 --> 02:07:38,075
Well, that explains his extraordinary
passion and his outrageous behavior.

1034
02:07:38,350 --> 02:07:40,045
How else could he have been?

1035
02:07:40,285 --> 02:07:42,378
Absolutely.
We'd have done the same.

1036
02:07:48,694 --> 02:07:51,754
But any one of us
could suddenly drop dead.

1037
02:08:03,709 --> 02:08:05,074
Listen here.

1038
02:08:09,281 --> 02:08:12,978
Hey, Section Chief.

1039
02:08:13,952 --> 02:08:19,822
I mean you, the newly appointed
Public Affairs Section Chief.

1040
02:08:24,163 --> 02:08:27,155
Don't you hear me?

1041
02:08:28,467 --> 02:08:31,868
I haven't been promoted yet.

1042
02:08:39,778 --> 02:08:40,972
Hey!

1043
02:08:42,147 --> 02:08:44,377
Ohno!
- Cut it out.

1044
02:08:44,750 --> 02:08:48,311
What the hell did you just say?

1045
02:08:49,221 --> 02:08:53,123
"We would've done it, too?"

1046
02:08:54,993 --> 02:08:58,861
Don't make me laugh.
- Hey, cut it out.

1047
02:08:59,131 --> 02:09:03,625
You couldn't have done
what Watanabe-san did.

1048
02:09:05,437 --> 02:09:08,099
Make me laugh.

1049
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:11,104
Say, Ohara-san...

1050
02:09:12,211 --> 02:09:16,443
The thing is...

1051
02:09:17,282 --> 02:09:21,275
I may look like this...

1052
02:09:22,087 --> 02:09:26,251
- I only graduated middle school...
- Watanabe-san...

1053
02:09:26,492 --> 02:09:31,452
So I'll never make section chief
in my life...

1054
02:09:42,741 --> 02:09:46,404
Compared to Watanabe-san,
we've all just...

1055
02:09:49,014 --> 02:09:51,539
We're just worthless scum.

1056
02:09:53,051 --> 02:09:55,679
Hey, you assholes, too...

1057
02:09:55,888 --> 02:09:57,321
Why, that's...

1058
02:10:01,527 --> 02:10:03,722
That's right, we're all scum.

1059
02:10:04,763 --> 02:10:09,359
But some of us were okay
when we started out at City Hall.

1060
02:10:09,668 --> 02:10:14,264
But the longer you stay...
Even I didn't used to be like...

1061
02:10:17,609 --> 02:10:21,238
You're not supposed to do
anything there.

1062
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:24,745
Doing anything but nothing
is radical.

1063
02:10:24,917 --> 02:10:28,444
We have to act like we're
doing something but do nothing.

1064
02:10:28,620 --> 02:10:31,453
- That's right.
- That's exactly right.

1065
02:10:31,590 --> 02:10:33,558
The thing is,

1066
02:10:34,026 --> 02:10:38,190
in order to clean up a garbage can
somewhere,

1067
02:10:38,430 --> 02:10:42,560
you need a garbage can
full of paperwork.

1068
02:10:42,835 --> 02:10:44,325
That's exactly right.

1069
02:10:45,904 --> 02:10:50,398
That's just an excuse.
We're robbing people of valuable time.

1070
02:10:51,076 --> 02:10:54,842
The public's upset by bribes
and 40,000 cars and so on,

1071
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:59,917
but those are just farts next to this
invisible, colossal waste of time.

1072
02:11:03,956 --> 02:11:05,753
Now you listen here.

1073
02:11:06,558 --> 02:11:08,992
I worry about these things, too.

1074
02:11:09,161 --> 02:11:13,461
But the thing is, inside that
complex system, it's impossible.

1075
02:11:13,665 --> 02:11:16,600
Besides, there's never time
to think in there.

1076
02:11:17,102 --> 02:11:18,194
Idiots!

1077
02:11:27,412 --> 02:11:30,609
No, but the thing is,

1078
02:11:30,816 --> 02:11:32,215
Ohara-san,

1079
02:11:32,384 --> 02:11:37,822
even within a system
here you can't get a thing done,

1080
02:11:38,290 --> 02:11:41,123
and battling stomach cancer at that,

1081
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:45,126
Watanabe-san managed
to accomplish so much.

1082
02:11:47,099 --> 02:11:50,159
That's it.
That's what I'm trying to say.

1083
02:11:50,602 --> 02:11:53,230
That's why I get so angry.

1084
02:11:53,372 --> 02:11:54,532
That's what I'm saying.

1085
02:11:54,606 --> 02:11:58,303
That Watanabe-san,
with no expectations...

1086
02:11:58,410 --> 02:12:04,144
Exactly. When you remember
how Watanabe-san staked his life...

1087
02:12:04,349 --> 02:12:06,579
Who dares claim his achievements!

1088
02:12:07,052 --> 02:12:09,145
The deputy mayor.
Spit it out!

1089
02:12:13,492 --> 02:12:16,256
That's going too far.

1090
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:26,001
Listen.

1091
02:12:26,305 --> 02:12:31,470
How do you think he felt

1092
02:12:33,178 --> 02:12:35,942
dying all alone in that park?

1093
02:12:36,181 --> 02:12:38,706
Just thinking about it...

1094
02:13:01,540 --> 02:13:06,273
A policeman brought this.
He said he'd found it in the park.

1095
02:13:13,452 --> 02:13:16,910
And he really wants
to light incense for the deceased.

1096
02:13:35,273 --> 02:13:38,606
Thank you for taking the trouble.
Come in.

1097
02:14:37,602 --> 02:14:40,366
You don't have to go.

1098
02:14:40,505 --> 02:14:42,769
Thank you for your trouble.

1099
02:14:44,810 --> 02:14:48,871
Let me pour you one.

1100
02:15:13,538 --> 02:15:15,267
Actually, I...

1101
02:15:20,846 --> 02:15:23,747
Last night, I was

1102
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:29,285
on patrol in the new park

1103
02:15:31,623 --> 02:15:35,354
when I met him.

1104
02:15:36,761 --> 02:15:39,195
It was 10:00 o'clock no.
_

1105
02:15:41,833 --> 02:15:43,824
Nearly 11:00.

1106
02:15:44,803 --> 02:15:46,964
He was on the swing,

1107
02:15:47,239 --> 02:15:52,506
and what with all that snow,

1108
02:15:52,711 --> 02:15:55,305
I just assumed
he was some drunk.

1109
02:15:56,114 --> 02:16:00,778
No, it was a dereliction of my duty.

1110
02:16:06,858 --> 02:16:11,921
If only I'd taken him in,
like I first intended,

1111
02:16:12,697 --> 02:16:15,495
he'd never have ended up...

1112
02:16:16,701 --> 02:16:19,670
How can I apologize to you?

1113
02:16:23,008 --> 02:16:29,208
But he seemed to be
so perfectly happy.

1114
02:16:29,381 --> 02:16:30,973
How can I explain?

1115
02:16:32,717 --> 02:16:36,744
He poured his whole heart
into that song of his.

1116
02:16:39,758 --> 02:16:44,218
His haunting voice...

1117
02:16:46,865 --> 02:16:48,298
pierced...

1118
02:16:50,435 --> 02:16:54,496
the very depths of my own soul.

1119
02:16:59,144 --> 02:17:08,075
<i>Life is brief</i>

1120
02:17:10,455 --> 02:17:17,258
<i>Fall in love, maidens</i>

1121
02:17:20,799 --> 02:17:30,731
<i>Before the crimson bloom</i>

1122
02:17:32,177 --> 02:17:38,639
<i>Fades from your lips</i>

1123
02:17:42,988 --> 02:17:52,329
<i>Before the tides of passion</i>

1124
02:17:54,032 --> 02:18:00,562
<i>Cool within you</i>

1125
02:18:04,276 --> 02:18:13,674
<i>For those of you</i>

1126
02:18:15,253 --> 02:18:21,783
<i>Who know no tomorrow</i>

1127
02:18:44,749 --> 02:18:47,513
Hey, last night,

1128
02:18:48,286 --> 02:18:52,552
under the stairs, I found an envelope
with my name on it.

1129
02:18:53,058 --> 02:18:55,822
It had Dad's bankbook
and seal inside,

1130
02:18:55,960 --> 02:19:00,659
along with forms for expediting
his retirement bonus.

1131
02:19:00,932 --> 02:19:03,662
So he left it before
he went to the park?

1132
02:19:04,035 --> 02:19:07,869
But Dad was so cruel.

1133
02:19:08,073 --> 02:19:11,406
If he had stomach cancer,
why didn't he tell us?

1134
02:19:12,544 --> 02:19:16,947
Hey, his girl never showed up.

1135
02:19:17,282 --> 02:19:20,046
You think that was for real?

1136
02:19:24,522 --> 02:19:25,716
I'll do it.

1137
02:19:25,824 --> 02:19:27,985
I swear.
- Line up behind him.

1138
02:19:28,560 --> 02:19:32,189
We can't waste
Watanabe-san's death.

1139
02:19:33,198 --> 02:19:36,531
I'll work at it
like I'm a man reborn.

1140
02:19:37,001 --> 02:19:39,834
Sacrifice the self to serve the many.

1141
02:19:50,315 --> 02:19:55,309
- Don't forget this feeling.
- I'll do it...

1142
02:20:02,060 --> 02:20:05,029
PUBLIC AFFAIRS SECTION CHIEF

1143
02:20:12,637 --> 02:20:13,797
Section Chief.

1144
02:20:14,205 --> 02:20:18,266
The sewage main break in Kisaki
is overflowing into Takao.

1145
02:20:18,543 --> 02:20:20,272
Engineering.

1146
02:20:25,784 --> 02:20:30,312
Your complaint is a matter for
Engineering, desk 8.

1147
02:21:45,864 --> 02:21:48,264
Kenbo, Yoko.

1148
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:50,600
Yoko, Kenbo.

1149
02:21:51,269 --> 02:21:52,896
Suppertime.
