1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,259
Based on the true story of an
unresolved criminal investigation,

2
00:00:52,302 --> 00:01:00,302
set under a military dictatorship.

3
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:13,173
Junk car! Junk car!

4
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,818
Get out of here, kid.

5
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,753
I told you to get out of here.

6
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:06,059
October 23, 1986

7
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,654
- Go home, kid.
- Go home, kid.

8
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,866
- Little brat.
- Little brat.

9
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,078
- What the hell are they doing?
- What the hell are they doing?

10
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,872
- Hey you!
- Hey you!

11
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,665
- Put that back!
- Put that back!

12
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,214
Hey, leave it there. Go away.

13
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,673
- Hey you!
- Hey you!

14
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,344
- That's important, don't touch!
- That's important, don't touch!

15
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,848
- Those kids.
- Those kids.

16
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,184
MEMORIES OF MURDER

17
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:27,933
What?

18
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,687
You dated the dead girl
and she dumped you last August?

19
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,188
Is that right?

20
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,274
That's correct.

21
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,693
That's correct?

22
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,861
Take off your hat
you damn punk.

23
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,449
Do women like guys like you?

24
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:52,958
After watching Body Heat...

25
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,669
Body Heat?
That an action movie?

26
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,964
A, c, t...

27
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,764
Damn punk...

28
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:12,394
since it's a rape
and murder case and all...

29
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,689
well...

30
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:20,193
If she was sexy or pretty
that sort of thing.

31
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,570
Your impressions?

32
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,656
Well,

33
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,035
she didn't seem
like a country girl...

34
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,287
Don't blink.

35
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,207
You blinked, didn't you?

36
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,669
Hey, look at me.

37
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,381
Don't look at the ceiling
look at me!

38
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,886
Was he born that way?
One, two...

39
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,860
Didn't you want to go
to the Military Academy?

40
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,279
Did you take the exam?

41
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,282
You need to study hard
to get in there.

42
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,871
- Receipt!
- You didn't ask for one.

43
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,041
What? I told you to bring one.

44
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,502
- I told you.
- No you didn't.

45
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,879
That's what you said last time...

46
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,590
Here's one, here.

47
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:29,179
You answered the phone
you lying bastard...

48
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:34,059
I need a receipt from the restaurant.
Not from a bicycle shop.

49
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:41,566
Directed by BONG Joon-Ho

50
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,197
Why didn't you rope the place off?

51
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,951
At least get some sticks
to drive them in, morons.

52
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,078
Inspector Park, over here!

53
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,957
- What is this?
- It's a footprint.

54
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,293
- When did you find it?
- This morning, sir!

55
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,295
Go help those jerks over there.

56
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,673
You called the forensics team?

57
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,716
Yes, they're on their way.

58
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,680
But, where's the person
who reported this?

59
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,977
No forensics team
this is total chaos!

60
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,062
Jesus, look at him!

61
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:21,565
Hey!

62
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,066
Get out of here!

63
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,488
Who received the call on this?

64
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,157
Did you find out
who reported it?

65
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,951
The phone... The crime
site is getting ruined.

66
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,371
Damn forensics team's not here
this is a mess.

67
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,874
What are you talking about?

68
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:43,044
Take pictures when I tell you!

69
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,298
Why'd you bring
so many reporters?

70
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,301
They were all here when I arrived.

71
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,888
Reporter Park's not here.
Must be on vacation.

72
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,473
I don't see him.

73
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,057
Feels great with
that shithead gone.

74
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,478
Why does this have
to happen to me?

75
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,147
How can I investigate like this?

76
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,651
Hey, tractor!

77
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,279
Tractor!

78
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:14,284
Tractor, stay away! Detour!

79
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,664
If someone waves
shouldn't you look?

80
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,584
Shit, is he deaf?

81
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,295
Shit! Look at this.

82
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,381
Now those bastards show up.

83
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,513
What the hell took you so long?

84
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,182
The crime scene's ruined!

85
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:41,478
Jesus, look at these sliding fools!

86
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,480
What's going on?

87
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,573
How can you look at
those photos while eating?

88
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,161
If I keep staring at them

89
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,580
one moment it'll hit me.

90
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,790
Instinctively.

91
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,166
Are you a fortune teller?

92
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,418
Open up a shop then.

93
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:11,841
Chief, I may know nothing else
but my eyes can read people.

94
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,761
It's how I survive as a detective.

95
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:20,058
There's a reason people
say I have shaman's eyes.

96
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,768
OK, then.

97
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,980
You see those two guys there?

98
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:32,404
One of them's a rapist
and the other is the victim's brother.

99
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:40,446
He caught the guy doing this to
his sister, and dragged him in.

100
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:48,753
So tell me
which one's the rapist?

101
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,976
- Hey.
- What?

102
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,394
I think it fell out.

103
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,770
Really?

104
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,064
Let's do this properly.

105
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,281
I'll give this to you
especially today.

106
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,741
I'm so grateful.

107
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,662
It's just a flu shot.

108
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,164
Know how much this costs?

109
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,669
- Kwak Sul-young?
- Yeah?

110
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,048
You must be earning more
now than at the hospital.

111
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,596
I hear everyone in
town comes to you.

112
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,682
Shh. I got something to tell you.

113
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,519
I heard this from the
old woman at the mill.

114
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,273
You know the Baek family
meat restaurant?

115
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,150
The Baek family?

116
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:56,154
You know what people call them?

117
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,572
What?

118
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,660
The Baek Lady Killers.

119
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,163
- Ladies?
- Yeah.

120
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:10,335
But the son's a little
bit retarded. Kwang-ho.

121
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:16,591
Kwang-ho used to follow
Hyang-sook around all the time.

122
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,594
Hyang-sook?
The one who was killed?

123
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,179
Yeah.

124
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:26,768
She was found with
a girdle over her head?

125
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,977
Right.

126
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,231
Even more important,

127
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:34,234
the night she was killed...

128
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:38,488
that old woman saw
Kwang-ho following her.

129
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,867
- Really?
- That's what I'm saying.

130
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,996
I heard that old hag
went senile last year.

131
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,581
No, she's fine.

132
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,173
That kid... Wait.

133
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,052
Kwang-ho? What's he look like?

134
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:06,683
This side of his face is a bit...
you know.

135
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,978
Tell me in detail.

136
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,605
Anyways, he's a poor little kid.

137
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:37,881
Kwang-ho.

138
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,426
Let's talk man to man.

139
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:45,430
You see a pretty girl
you want to do her.

140
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:49,267
When I was your age
I'd go out with friends

141
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,269
I understand.

142
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:57,442
You never intended to kill
Hyang-sook at first, huh?

143
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,445
How aboutjust
touching her breast...

144
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,613
I couldn't touch it.

145
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,574
So you killed her?
Kill her, then you can touch it.

146
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,075
No, I didn't.

147
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,458
That guy coming down now
he's had a hard life, like you.

148
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,668
He's nice.

149
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,171
He's really sweet.

150
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,590
He never beats anyone.

151
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,468
But sometimes you know

152
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,805
if he gets worked up
about something...

153
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:34,479
God, what an ugly face.

154
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,442
Just looking at this face
makes me angry.

155
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,362
Shit.

156
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,166
Pretty?

157
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,546
This is so it won't
leave scratches, you punk.

158
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,463
Hey, hey...

159
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,716
What's with the army boots?

160
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,885
Doing this to the kid...

161
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,971
Kwang-ho, get up.

162
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,686
Are you really innocent? Huh?

163
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,855
Look in my eyes.

164
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,274
Huh?

165
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,276
Where the hell's he looking?

166
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,777
Look in my eyes!

167
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:43,916
Turn yourself in
or may you rot and die.

168
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,359
Excuse me, miss...

169
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,194
Hello?

170
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,364
Oh, miss?

171
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,366
Are you all right?

172
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,577
Why are you following me?

173
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,914
No, I just wanted
to ask directions.

174
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,957
Let me help you.

175
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,545
Let go!

176
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,963
What's wrong?

177
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:28,259
Rolling in the fields, huh?
Is this town rapist's paradise?

178
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,553
You shithead.

179
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,186
What the hell?

180
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,187
Who are you?

181
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,066
Get over here.

182
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,986
Hey miss, the victim
needs to file a report!

183
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,365
Miss!

184
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,626
Where is she going?

185
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,962
Are you a detective?

186
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,385
You should have told me.

187
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,469
My mistake.

188
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,807
How can a detective
be such a bad fighter?

189
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,647
How can a detective have
such a bad eye for criminals?

190
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,653
What's that smell?

191
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,655
Oh, sneakers.

192
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,281
They smell bad?

193
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:36,369
But these here are
evidence item #28.

194
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,063
Develop these quickly, huh?

195
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,444
- Uh, chief.
- What?

196
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,154
This guy here... from Seoul.

197
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:15,908
Nice to meet you!
I got the call...

198
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,660
But...

199
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,912
your face...

200
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,915
Did anything happen?

201
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,917
- No, nothing.
- A desk, you need...

202
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,588
Oh, I prepared a desk
over there with lots of sunlight.

203
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,633
I think... I like that corner.

204
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,638
Okay, okay! As you wish.

205
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,477
Inspector Jo, say hello.

206
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,730
From Seoul

207
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,192
Suh Tae-... yoon, senior officer.

208
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,277
Jo Yong-gu. Nice to meet you.

209
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,490
He volunteered to assist
with this investigation.

210
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,910
Quite an uncommon thing.

211
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,578
Well, go arrange your desk.

212
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,205
Yes, sit down.

213
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,083
Inspector Chief

214
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,264
The song is great.
The opening song.

215
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,559
I always watch
Inspector Chief with Dad.

216
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,770
What was my phone number?

217
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,189
Just eat.

218
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,399
Right, I need to call Dad!

219
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,402
I should call. Oh, it's Dad!

220
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,372
Hey, Kwang-ho.

221
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,751
Listen.

222
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:53,005
This footprint was found at the
site of Hyang-sook's murder.

223
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,006
Look.

224
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,260
And these are sneakers
we found at your house.

225
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,679
You wear these? Right?

226
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,473
Now, look closely.

227
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:08,563
The footprint in this photo
and the sole of your shoe.

228
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,398
The same, right?

229
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,567
This pattern?

230
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:18,072
The circle, this indentation?
Exactly the same.

231
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,740
Am I right?

232
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,077
This part was smudged

233
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,996
don't worry about that.

234
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,459
You killed all
those women, right?

235
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,671
Okay.

236
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,467
You didn't kill them all, right?

237
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:45,057
So you didn't not kill only
Hyang-sook, correct?

238
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,186
I didn't kill anyone.

239
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,982
We've got the evidence here!

240
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,860
- Where's our shovel?
- Shovel?

241
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,740
Look at you...

242
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,494
Hey, bastard. Give me that.

243
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,080
Can't you even shovel right?
Watch me.

244
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,876
Loosen the dirt first.
Then push with your foot.

245
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,878
- Kwang-ho!
- Yes?

246
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,297
You punk.

247
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:21,761
Did you come here to play?

248
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,638
You know where this is?

249
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,264
We came here to bury you.

250
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:29,268
- What? Why?
- Why?

251
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,562
Because you won't listen
you bastard.

252
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,857
- I'm a good boy.
- Then tell me!

253
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,278
Out here in the fresh air.
With that face.

254
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,947
Hey, come here.

255
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,283
Women hate this face don't they?

256
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,370
They grimace and
all fucking run away.

257
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,205
It's true.

258
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,082
I'll kill them all.

259
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:58,089
Everyone who
grimaces at my face.

260
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,840
I'll kill them all.

261
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:06,097
Those women who grimace
they're all in my head.

262
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,102
- Hyang-sook too?
- Hyang-sook?

263
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,105
Hyang-sook.
You always followed her around.

264
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,483
- Hyang-sook is pretty.
- Oh yeah, she's pretty.

265
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,486
But Hyang-sook grimaced too, huh?

266
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,780
She said, "Fuck, get away!"
didn't she?

267
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,658
Because you liked her.

268
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,285
So you killed her, huh?

269
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,837
By the train tracks.

270
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,672
In that rice paddy.

271
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,091
The train tracks? Right.

272
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:46,178
Her throat.
Hyang-sook's throat...

273
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,598
strangled it tightly.

274
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,310
- With what?
- Her brassiere.

275
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,771
- Brassiere?
- With her white brassiere

276
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:59,567
strangled her tightly.

277
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,277
- And then?
- Her stocking.

278
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,280
- Her stocking?
- Pulled off her leg.

279
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,865
Then it was the stocking.

280
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,034
This guy's smart, huh?

281
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,578
And then?

282
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,580
What?

283
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,666
What was it?

284
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,293
Something with a strap?

285
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,670
A handbag strap?

286
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,589
Right, a bag strap.

287
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:29,388
Strangling Hyang-sook's
throat with it tightly.

288
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,016
And?

289
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:39,273
Then, Hyang-sook's
body shook a bit.

290
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,484
She looked completely dead.

291
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,778
And then?

292
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,949
Her head was covered up.

293
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,494
With what?

294
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:59,210
Her panties.
Covered her head with her panties.

295
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,047
Do you mean a girdle?
That women wear?

296
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,257
Right, girdle!

297
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,388
Looked like it covered
her head right up.

298
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,473
And then?

299
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,184
Um... had to dress her again.

300
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,479
And why was that?

301
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,482
I don't know.
Put the clothes back on.

302
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,193
Why was that?

303
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,866
How would I know?

304
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,868
You were doing well!

305
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,413
Bastard! What did you do next?

306
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,872
- Then... running!
- Where?

307
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,958
- It was raining!
- Where did you run?

308
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,294
- Kept running.
- Oh, you little shit!

309
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,671
The lightning struck!

310
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,050
Where the hell were you running
you bastard!

311
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,761
Yong-gu, start digging.

312
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:51,846
Huh? Digging?

313
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,140
Lightning!

314
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:19,123
Citizens, this is a
civil defence drill.

315
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,126
The air raid siren has begun to sound.
This is only a drill.

316
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,670
The entire country is now
under a civil defence drill.

317
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:29,383
A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses.

318
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,470
Please find cover in the
nearest underground space.

319
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:40,512
Follow the instructions
you hear in this broadcast.

320
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:48,360
Please move all flammable
materials to a safe place.

321
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:53,657
Unplug all cords, then hurry
to an underground area...

322
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,043
Shut off the lights!

323
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,644
Hey, you!

324
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,562
Come here.

325
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,943
Put this on. Everyone ready?

326
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,861
- Yes, sir
- Get in the car.

327
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,655
Turn around.

328
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,952
Take off your pants.

329
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,247
What'll the headline be?

330
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:45,084
Crime-Fighting Trio or
"Smiles of the Unstoppable."

331
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,169
Inspector Park, in the back.

332
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,172
Make a straight line now.

333
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,967
Miss Kwon, big party tonight!
Reserve a room.

334
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:53,842
Smile!

335
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,220
OK!

336
00:25:56,263 --> 00:26:00,224
This time, hold up your fist.
Tight!

337
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,229
- Come take a picture!
- That's okay.

338
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,231
Come on!

339
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,487
Wait a second.

340
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,998
With these webbed fingers

341
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,375
you can't even hold
chopsticks, right?

342
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,379
They've always been this way?
Go on.

343
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,390
Kwang-ho
this is the spot, right?

344
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,474
I don't know.

345
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,394
What's he talking about?
It was here.

346
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,982
For the re-enactment
you have to act well.

347
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,777
There are a lot of reporters here.

348
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,903
How's this?

349
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,488
A bit lower.

350
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,158
- What do we start with?
- Wait.

351
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:04,496
It's best to write down
the correct order.

352
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,957
Then why didn't you do it?
I'm fucking busy.

353
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,334
Chief.

354
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,254
The re-enactment
isn't going to work anyway.

355
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,508
Call it off before it
becomes an embarrassment.

356
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:21,263
Hey, I told you to stay away.
Why'd you come back here?

357
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,183
Just give them some excuse.
The suspect is sick, or...

358
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,267
Inspector Suh!

359
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,064
You're dumping shit
on cooked rice here!

360
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,067
I told you before
Kwang-ho isn't guilty.

361
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,526
Just shut up!

362
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,654
Chief...

363
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:41,158
The cords around their necks
were tied with three tight knots.

364
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,495
Look at Kwang-ho's hands.
Could he do that?

365
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,246
- Get out!
- Even a child can see that.

366
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,082
Get the hell out!

367
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,877
Grab the brassiere strap...

368
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,504
Hey, concentrate!

369
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,881
Dad!

370
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,592
Kwang-ho! It's me!

371
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,677
Dad!

372
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,096
Hey, you're innocent!

373
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,889
I know! I didn't do it!

374
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:10,062
Mr. Baek Kwang-ho!
Are you denying a crime?

375
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,774
He didn't kill anyone!
My son's innocent!

376
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:20,614
You were tortured, weren't you?

377
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,826
My team never tortures suspects.

378
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,966
It's all gone to hell.

379
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,259
Don't bring it up.

380
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:47,433
Hey, did you see the look on
prosecutor Choi's face back there?

381
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:51,061
Fuck, how can he
revoke the warrant?

382
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,688
We even had evidence.

383
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,691
Evidence? That footprint?

384
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,279
How can they set him free?

385
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,114
What can we do?

386
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,076
All we had was a confession.

387
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,289
It was no ordinary confession.
You heard the tape.

388
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:15,210
All the details of the crime
came pouring out his mouth.

389
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:19,590
Things he'd never know
if he weren't the killer.

390
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,050
Like how she was strangled.

391
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,262
You heard it too.

392
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,432
Be honest, didn't you
rehearse that in advance?

393
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,683
What?

394
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,685
Quiet. Eat something.

395
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,604
Jesus...

396
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:42,988
What? I said to separate
the noodles and bean sauce.

397
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,575
What the fuck!

398
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:51,955
Investigative Team Reshuffled

399
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:55,876
Murder Case Shrouded
In Mystery Once Again

400
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:18,357
The location of
the first homicide

401
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,526
and the second homicide.

402
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,238
Now, a distance of...

403
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,448
approximately 1,000 meters.

404
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:30,160
A length of not more than...
one kilometer.

405
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:43,966
The victim
on the 12th and the 16th

406
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:48,887
both days at twelve o'clock...

407
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,266
Ah, December 16th.

408
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,351
On December 16th

409
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,854
at twelve o'clock,

410
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,859
Location: Yangji Teahouse

411
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,278
Han Sung-geun

412
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,364
a 32-year old office worker.

413
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:13,161
An arranged date, maybe?

414
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:17,541
Anyway, at the crime site

415
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:22,296
were found a footprint
two drops of blood

416
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:26,967
and a drop of semen.
Semen? They found semen?

417
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,552
What? Yes.

418
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,266
The two dead women...

419
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,685
Did they have anything in common?

420
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,188
In common...

421
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,357
Well, first...

422
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,903
Both of them were single.

423
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,698
They were both
extremely beautiful.

424
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,200
And?

425
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,288
The murders all
took place in the rain.

426
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,957
Rain?

427
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,335
He murdered them
on rainy nights.

428
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,254
Really?

429
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,256
And red clothes.

430
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,051
They all wore red clothes.

431
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,178
Both of them?

432
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,262
No, all three of them.

433
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,266
Three of them?

434
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,809
What are you talking about?

435
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,478
Three were murdered.

436
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,480
We just haven't found the third body

437
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,987
This is a missing person form.
The name is quite unusual.

438
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,866
Dokko Hyun-soon, age 27.
It was two months ago, July 18.

439
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:37,245
Oh, her? Dokko Hyun-soon?
I know that girl.

440
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,540
Everyone in this town knows her.

441
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,627
A pretty girl, that Hyun-soon.

442
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,381
Even a Miss Korea
is no match for her.

443
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,384
Did you process the missing
person form, Yong-gu?

444
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,635
Oh, shut up.

445
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,472
This is no ordinary incident, Chief.

446
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:59,476
If you look in detail.
Documents never lie.

447
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,814
It says she was
wearing a red shirt.

448
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,649
It's right here in writing.

449
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,442
What's that?

450
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:11,863
Marked here is the weather
on the day she vanished.

451
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,282
It rained on that day too.

452
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,370
Rain, red clothes...

453
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,373
She was murdered.
By the same person.

454
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,460
You don't know this town
that's why you talk nonsense.

455
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:29,881
She always said she'd
go to Seoul one day...

456
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,175
I have an idea where the body is.

457
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,552
Look at the map.

458
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,096
Right here...

459
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:41,268
I marked where the victim went
and where the body might be.

460
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:47,357
Give me two squadrons of cops.
I'll find her in two days.

461
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,987
You sure of this?

462
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,966
You know...

463
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:17,054
university students
when they go on orientation...

464
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,973
people say they
guys all get laid

465
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:25,062
a big group, guys and girls
in one room going at it...

466
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,271
Is that true?

467
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,357
I don't know. Hurry up.

468
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:34,362
You went to a 2-year school
didn't you?

469
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:38,742
Student trips, orientation...
Did you go on those?

470
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:44,623
Go ask Suh, he went
to a 4-year university.

471
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,374
Whether he had group sex...

472
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,252
Shit, four years.

473
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,464
I spent 4 years in high school.

474
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,180
Shit, put that away.

475
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:06,103
You know
I miss Dokko Hyun-soon.

476
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,104
You too?

477
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:11,399
She was just
too good for this town.

478
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,986
I'm telling you
she went to Seoul.

479
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,448
What is it?

480
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,077
Lot of snakes down there.

481
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,460
Each part of a corpse
decays at a different speed.

482
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,754
Look. It's old

483
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,757
but the inner thigh is still firm.

484
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,385
There's evidence of rape?

485
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,846
A bit of semen was found.

486
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,850
But it's so old
we can't determine the blood type.

487
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,019
Oh, Hyun-soon...

488
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:52,149
This time too he used
items belonging to her.

489
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,443
Right, that's her stocking
around the throat?

490
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,278
Yes.

491
00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:00,282
The victim's panties on her face

492
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,159
as with Hyang-sook.

493
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,828
Her hands were bound
the same way too.

494
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,665
His methods of killing
are quite professional.

495
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,169
He's thorough.

496
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,004
And polished.

497
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:21,178
So there hasn't been
a single witness yet.

498
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,266
Would you like
a bit more tenderloin?

499
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,644
That's okay. We're fine.

500
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:33,064
Where did Kwang-ho go?
I don't see him.

501
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,192
Is anything...?

502
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:40,655
I bought your son something
give it to him later.

503
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,490
What's this?

504
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:46,286
Oh, last time
taking a look at his sneakers

505
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,664
they smelled so awful
I felt bad for him.

506
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:53,376
I thought
I'll have to buy him new shoes.

507
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,295
So I picked up some Nikes.

508
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,005
You didn't have to...

509
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,635
That punk, he's always sleeping
in the strangest places!

510
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,472
Kwang-ho!

511
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,852
This here...
your shoe size is 250mm, right?

512
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,563
Here, Nike. Try them on.

513
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,567
Give me that sneaker.

514
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,948
These are "Nice", not Nike.
N, I, C, E.

515
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,367
Nice or Nike. Who cares?

516
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:32,082
If you buy him sneakers
you should get the real thing.

517
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,084
Cool, huh?

518
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:39,923
Have a drink.

519
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,760
I beat you because
I care for you.

520
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:48,181
So if you see me on the street
don't run away.

521
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,101
Yong-gu feels bad about...

522
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,479
Punk.

523
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,862
Hey, where are you going again?

524
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,157
You see, Chief.

525
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,745
That boy is the exact opposite
of the type we're looking for.

526
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,082
Dragging in suspects like that
is a waste of time, so...

527
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:14,833
Inspector Suh!

528
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,838
Have some meat before you speak.

529
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,970
I don't eat burnt meat.

Hey, Seoul city bumpkin.

538
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,267
What?

539
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,187
Why did you come here?

540
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,690
Out to the boondocks? Huh?

541
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,903
To catch the killer.

542
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,577
Is Seoul that big?

543
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,163
Huh? Is it big?

544
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,042
Bigger than America?

545
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,172
Give me a banana.

546
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,386
Let me tell you about America.

547
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,474
They've got the F.B.I.!

548
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,686
If you watch how they investigate...
You know how?

549
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,192
Their heads are
spinning like a top.

550
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,278
Analyzing things...

551
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,739
You know why?

552
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:14,411
It's 'cause they got
so much fucking land!

553
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:21,543
If you don't use your brain
it's too much ground to cover.

554
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:26,840
So they have no choice
those F.B.I. bastards.

555
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:30,844
But our Republic of Korea...

556
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:37,559
using just your two legs
you can run all over it.

557
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,310
You know why?

558
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,690
'Cause our land's
the size of my dick.

559
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:49,571
So it's said, Korean detectives
investigate with their feet.

560
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:53,867
That's folk wisdom, you bastard.

561
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,579
So brainy geeks like you
can go the hell to America.

562
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,041
- Go there and...
- Shut your fucking mouth!

563
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,129
You bastard!

564
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:10,383
- Let go of me!
- What? You f...

565
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,975
Give him this.

566
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,357
Take it away! Take it!

567
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,869
Everything's clearer now.
That's much better.

568
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:45,043
I've got it now.
About the killer.

569
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,045
That bastard

570
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,882
he'll do it again.

571
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,510
The next night it rains.

572
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:58,389
So we need to keep
one step ahead of him.

573
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,100
Pre-emptive! Okay?

574
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:08,233
And if you two ever start fighting
in front of me again

575
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,486
I'll kill you both! Understood?

576
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,586
Ladies and gentlemen!

577
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,671
In just a moment

578
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,131
our President
will be driving past.

579
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,550
Wait a minute...

580
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,989
It's raining nice.

581
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,533
You ready?

582
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:38,489
Ooh, Gui-ok's looking nice!

583
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,490
Shut up.

584
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,872
What if he grabs her for real?

585
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:51,753
Inspector Suh should be following
close behind her.

586
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:58,343
Shit, do we have to do this
every time when it rains?

587
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,887
But thanks to this

588
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,473
Gui-ok puts on that red skirt.

589
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:06,893
With makeup
she looks like a different person.

590
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,520
- So what?
- Was she always that pretty?

591
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,730
You getting hard?

592
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,482
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Let's check.

593
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,525
- We're on duty now...
- Oh, Yong-gu!

594
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,327
Hey.

595
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,081
So do you really
keep watch here?

596
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,126
These days
nobody ever goes outside.

597
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,588
Someone's coming.

598
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,175
Hey, kids!

599
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:41,886
Over here.

600
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,766
That's cold.

601
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,476
You're so wet!

602
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,982
Hey, stay here
until the rain stops.

603
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,652
That umbrella's useless.

604
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,363
And we just picked it up
in front of the school.

605
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,490
Someone threw it away.

606
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,159
Miss, are you going
that way too?

607
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,161
Hey, she's a detective.

608
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,996
No way!

609
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,374
She's in the
Violent Crimes Division.

610
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,251
- Really?
- Sure.

611
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,878
Wait a minute.
We'll give you a ride.

612
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,047
Wow, in a police car!

613
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:23,136
Hey, you two.
What are you doing out so late?

614
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,596
We always stay together
so it's okay.

615
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:29,142
You'll be fine
even if you go alone.

616
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:36,065
Nam-ju, tell them about
what you heard at school.

617
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:36,983
What?

618
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,861
You know, during cleaning time
about the murderer.

619
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:43,781
Right! You know why
they can't catch the murderer?

620
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,868
This is the truth.
We go to Ansong Girls Middle School.

621
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,786
Behind our school
there's an outhouse.

622
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:53,166
They say a crazy man lives
under there, the murderer!

623
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,584
He stays there all day

624
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,670
and when night comes
he sneaks out and kills women.

625
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:01,257
So when he comes out at night

626
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,178
you must be able to smell
the shit from miles away.

627
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,347
That's not the story.

628
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,642
Yoo-jin said a crazy woman
fell in there and died.

629
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:16,439
Then I'll meet you in front of
the factory with an umbrella.

630
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,066
It's okay.

631
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,903
Okay.

632
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:25,239
I'll see you soon.

633
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,089

00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,543
Hello?

637
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,924
Everyone stay where you are!

638
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:53,346
Don't touch anything near you.
Don't move one step!

639
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,056
Hey, you!

640
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,349
I'm talking to you!

641
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:59,018
Wait for the forensics team.

642
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,365
Look!

643
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:15,451
These are genuine footprints.

644
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,872
You see the
Remicon factory there?

645
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:24,085
He caught her near the factory

646
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,964
and quietly pulled her
over 400 meters to here.

647
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:34,261
The footprints
look like a bride and groom's.

648
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:42,019
But you didn't find anything
aside from the footprints?

649
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:46,524
I hoped to find fingerprints on
the umbrella, but no luck.

650
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,652
Not only that due to the rain

651
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,279
the footprints are all smudged.

652
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:57,493
Even after such a thorough
investigation, nothing.

653
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:05,626
Therefore, Chief
I think this could be a hint. Hint!

654
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,128
What?

655
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:11,966
The fact that
we found nothing at the scene.

656
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,303
Always in rape cases

657
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:19,056
at the crime scene

658
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:23,519
there's one or two of
those hairs left behind.

659
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,645
So?

660
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:31,193
I'm saying the criminal must not
have any hair down there.

661
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,446
You mean hairless?

662
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:37,283
That's right, hairtless.
A total baldie.

663
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:44,915
He can't leave hair behind
because he doesn't have any?

664
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,917
For example

665
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:50,755
a Buddhist monk who
shaved the hair down there.

666
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,965
It's a perfect crime.

667
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,175
Well, then.

668
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:59,055
Yongdeok Temple
is just next door.

669
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,514
Should we start there?

670
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:12,651
Hey Gui-ok
you've got the radio on over there.

671
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,363
How would you like your coffee?

672
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,991
Lots of sugar for me.

673
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,369
- Inspector Suh!
- Yes, sir?

674
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,748
Do you have any more ideas?

675
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,460
I don't know. As you saw today,

676
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,879
this criminal is flawless.

677
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,090
- So?
- Therefore

678
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,259
our standard procedures
aren't going to help.

679
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:40,638
So what are we going to do?

680
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,766
Jesus...

681
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:47,103
Excuse me, but I've got
something to show you.

682
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:53,651
What will she show us today?

683
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,113
What's this?

684
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:01,075
These are documents
from an FM radio station.

685
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,994
Looks like a broadcast schedule.

686
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:08,457
Yes, it's an evening music program
I listen to.

687
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:13,838
There's someone who keeps
requesting the song, "Sad Letter".

688
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:17,174
If you look, it lists the dates
this song was broadcast.

689
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,094
Actually, this isn't a very
popular song.

690
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,179
It's quite rare.

691
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,848
A song? What letter?

692
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:27,476
"Sad Letter"
The singer is Yu Jae-ha.

693
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,396
Jo Young-pil's band.

694
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:32,815
- Sure, I heard it.
- So?

695
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:40,656
The song was broadcast on the
same days of the murders here.

696
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,160
Look.

697
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,997
October 20.
That's Park Bo-hee's murder.

698
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:53,043
December 19 was Lee Hyang-sook.

699
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,087
So...

700
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,592
on last night's murder too
this song was broadcast?

701
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:02,761
Yes. I listened to it myself.

702
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:08,058
The DJ read out the postcard
containing the request.

703
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:11,729
Sent by a lonely man
from Terung District.

704
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,356
Please broadcast it
on a rainy day.

705
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,988
Miss Kwon, nice! Good idea!

706
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,782
You read too many mystery novels
as a student?

707
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,286
That was a nice story.

708
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,582
Chief, this can't
be a coincidence.

709
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,292
Look at this.
Documents never lie.

710
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,670
Christ, here we go again.

711
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:40,549
It seems he's a real psycho.

712
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:43,344
As soon as he hears the song
he goes crazy.

713
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:47,765
Oh Chief, now you're doing it too.
This makes no sense!

714
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:50,476
It does make sense, sir!
It's quite simple.

715
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:55,231
Assemblies start with the
National Anthem. It's the same.

716
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,191
Did you get the postcard?

717
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,110
I requested it

718
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,655
but the radio station's
a bit disorganized.

719
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,450
Find it quickly.

720
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,495
Check the postmark
fingerprints and handwriting.

721
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:10,204
Yes, sir!

722
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:14,375
Officer Kwon, call the station
and follow up on this.

723
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:21,757
Baldies!

724
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,802
- What about that?
- Huh?

725
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,179
What we mentioned before...

726
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,764
Hairless, sir!

727
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,100
How do you investigate?

728
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,769
Pull the pants off passing men?

729
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:51,078
The postcard from yesterday.
I asked you to keep it!

730
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,289
What postcard?

731
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,332
You read it on the air yesterday!

732
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,126
Look how many we get here!

733
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:00,838
Hey, mister!

734
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,591
Nothing. Get dressed.

735
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:07,678
Inspector.

736
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:11,390
They've already
carted off yesterday's trash.

737
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,600
It's no use.

738
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,701
You're not going to shower?

739
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,330
Enough showers, for god's sake.

740
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:39,209
My skin feels like it'll burst.

741
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,588
You couldn't find
any hairless men?

742
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:49,303
Like looking for dog's horns.
Just paid sauna fees.

743
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,056
Shit, can't even get reimbursed.

744
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,933
At least your face is clean.

745
00:55:55,477 --> 00:56:00,939
How many times in a day...
dressing, undressing, dressing...

746
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,649
I'll lose my hair there too.

747
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:12,576
I asked the workers
at the sauna there

748
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,495
to call me if they saw anyone

749
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:19,291
Bastards just smirked at me.

750
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:24,838
Don't do it all yourself
have someone else do it.

751
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:32,054
What's that guy from Seoul
doing these days?

752
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,393
- Researching pop songs.
- What?

753
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,938
Shit, it's nothing
you've heard of.

754
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,565
Is he still talking nonsense?

755
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:45,859
Driving me crazy.

756
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:51,865
If you feel that way
go see a shaman.

757
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:53,951
A shaman?

758
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:58,455
Sure, one that
tells fortunes well.

759
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:03,293
Ask her
where the murderer is hiding.

760
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,053
A problem at the main gate
of the police station.

761
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:18,475
It should be moved about
10m to the southwest.

762
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:25,065
A face just passed by me.
I think he's the one.

763
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:35,617
Is his face among
these pictures here?

764
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,746
Take those dirty photos away.

765
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:43,041
- Hey, just look...
- Put them away!

766
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,462
It's bad fortune.

767
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:52,759
Take this, and do what I say.

768
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,511
Don't try to sell that charm.

769
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,908
Wait, wait a minute.

770
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:23,165
You have to mix in dirt
from the crime scene.

771
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:24,500
Stir.

772
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,170
She said that was most important.

773
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,672
Now pour it.

774
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,678
Stop.

775
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:39,932
Good.

776
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,150
Once this dries

777
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:55,489
this stain will form the
shape of the murderer's face.

778
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,157
That's ridiculous.

779
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,243
Quiet, you'll break the charm.

780
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,245
Know how much this costs?

781
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,163
So shut up!

782
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,129
Who's that?

783
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:14,967
You've heard?

784
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,470
Criminals always return
to the crime scene.

785
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,756
Wait a sec.

786
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,134
What the...

787
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,137
What's he doing here?

788
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:01,763
Why'd he come?

789
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,615
What the fuck...

790
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:24,036
We need science here!

791
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,873
What the hell's that?

792
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,673
Still, he's got style.

793
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,581
Stop there!

794
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,212
Hey, you!

795
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:34,100
It's getting narrow!
Single file!

796
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:01,086
Miss, did a strange man
just run past here?

797
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:02,170
No.

798
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:06,466
- It's that policeman.
- What?

799
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,052
- At the guard post.
- You know him?

800
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,682
Damn, he's a fast little bastard.

801
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:18,436
He's not there?

802
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,984
Did you check the
alleys properly?

803
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,278
You think you know this village?

804
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,864
You stepped on a
stick back there.

805
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:31,700
A stick or a shit pile
who cares?

806
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:33,869
He stepped on it.

807
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:40,876
What?

808
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,712
Over there... Hey, you!

809
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:55,974
Stop!

810
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,567
Jesus, not again.

811
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:09,487
Hey, over there.

812
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:41,895
Black clothes, black clothes...

813
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,939
Everyone's in black except you.

814
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,534
Everybody stop!

815
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,540
Don't move an inch!

816
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,525
- Inspector Jo!
- Yes?

817
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,444
Gather them together.

818
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:36,533
Hey, stop.

819
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:38,535
Gather together.

820
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,662
Lift up your heads.

821
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,664
Everyone stand in line.

822
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:02,976
Look in my eyes.

823
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:05,562
Give me that.

824
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,994
What is it?

825
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,082
- You bastard!
- Go away.

826
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:31,880
You ran away from us?

827
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,737
But...

828
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:59,574
Is jerking off a crime?

829
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:02,202
It's not a crime.

830
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:04,162
Why'd you run away?

831
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:08,625
Someone jumped
out of the woods and ran at me

832
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,627
so I panicked.

833
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:15,548
Sure, but why'd you go
all the way out there to do it?

834
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,968
There are kids at home

835
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:22,263
and the air's nice in the woods.

836
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:27,352
Or did you go back to
fantasize about the dead girls?

837
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:35,652
Your husband likes
to go out at night, huh?

838
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:37,821
What's this?

839
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,116
Gimme that.

840
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,454
What did you make these with?

841
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:05,098
These days, you know

842
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:11,062
real events in our town are
stronger than the magazines.

843
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:13,731
When I read the newspaper

844
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:16,151
I start fantasizing.

845
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:18,987
I ask myself why I do this

846
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:23,074
but when will this
chance come again?

847
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:27,704
According to neighbors

848
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:30,582
he looks diligently
after his sick wife

849
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,667
never misses a week at church

850
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,336
that he's honest.

851
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,382
All perverts are like that.

852
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,301
Nice on the outside.

853
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,469
But my eyes can't be fooled.

854
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,347
One look, and I know.

855
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:50,977
Honey

856
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,855
I put socks in here.
Change them after dinner.

857
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,481
Don't forget, or they'll smell.

858
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:59,194
I'll take care of it.
Go feed the kids.

859
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,155
Watch out for protesters.

860
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:07,285
Release Jo Byung-soon!

861
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,286
What now?

862
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:10,663
I heard Byung-soon
confessed last night.

863
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:11,998
Who says so?

864
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,917
Oh, Chief!

865
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,173
When will you make
an announcement?

866
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,343
We know nothing.
Just wait a bit more.

867
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,929
You've held him 4 days
without a warrant.

868
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:28,181
People are saying
he's detained illegally.

869
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:33,353
This time be realistic
like in a movie.

870
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:35,939
Go!

871
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,942
You did a good job just now.

872
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:40,109
Yong-ku?

873
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:48,368
So, you were hiding
behind the outhouse

874
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:51,079
and you saw Park Myung-ja

875
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:54,082
coming towards you
with a flashlight, right?

876
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:57,669
Yes, yes, yes. It seems so.

877
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:01,673
Not it seems
you bastard, be precise!

878
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:09,264
I think I dreamed it that way.

879
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:15,103
Anyway, I snuck up behind her,

880
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:22,777
and I must have chopped
the back of her neck?

881
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,737
With my hand like this.

882
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:25,738
Next?

883
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:32,161
Myung-ja cried out
and I guess she collapsed?

884
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:37,834
So I laid her on the ground
and was about to take her

885
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:42,380
Hey, it didn't happen there
it was...

886
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:46,968
The pine grove!
I took her there.

887
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,388
It was from the rice paddies
to the pine grove.

888
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:54,392
According to the news
more than 200 meters, right?

889
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:56,102
That's so far!

890
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:59,772
So the rain was pouring
and I dragged her through the mud.

891
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,941
And then?

892
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:05,737
So I threw her down
in the pine grove.

893
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:08,448
Then I strangled her.

894
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,867
- With what?
- The bag strap.

895
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,368
Really?

896
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,870
Her stocking!

897
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:18,458
Right.

898
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,461
A brassiere! A Venus brassiere.

899
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:29,969
I wrapped it around
her throat like this

900
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,637
So the woman

901
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:36,893
she took a rock and
clocked me in the head.

902
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:39,354
Where'd she hit you?

903
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:42,565
Right here next to my eye.

904
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:49,197
It still hurts
even if it was just a dream.

905
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:00,708
Byung-soon?

906
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:04,045
Are you gonna keep saying
it was a dream

907
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:08,174
That's enough. Turn your head.

908
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,551
So this bruise is from the rock?

909
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:13,679
- No, this guy here...
- Shut up! Look here.

910
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:22,063
You've done well
now let's finish this.

911
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,192
So...

912
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:30,196
Since she hit me
like this with the rock

913
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,782
I must have lost consciousness?

914
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:37,703
And after lying there a while
I woke up, and looking around...

915
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:39,539
And?

916
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:43,960
I was in the bottom of an outhouse!
A shithouse!

917
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:48,548
And maggots were creeping
all over the place!

918
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:52,552
- Not the outhouse again.
- So after brushing them off

919
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:57,140
I grabbed some straw
and pulled myself up.

920
01:13:57,224 --> 01:14:00,143
Even in a dream, it's hard.

921
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:01,769
But then I saw

922
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:07,775
this wasn't someone's home
it was a school toilet.

923
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,569
Walking to the playground

924
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:13,364
I saw huge swarms of girls

925
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,867
so many, and the smell...

926
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:18,119
Wait! Over here.

927
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:24,959
Where did you hear about
that school outhouse?

928
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:29,046
Everyone knows that story.

929
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:30,673
I saw it in a dream.

930
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:37,763
From below the gas attack
run in a direction...

931
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:40,308
perpendicular to the wind.

932
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,685
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

933
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,937
Put it down. Hey!

934
01:14:54,531 --> 01:14:56,282
Pretend you're dead!

935
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:04,916
Last time, who told you that
story about the outhouse?

936
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,876
You came because of that?

937
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,965
What's wrong?

938
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,176
I hurt myself in the chute.

939
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,512
There was a pebble in there.

940
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,223
Where's the nurse?

941
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:24,143
I'll put it on for you.

942
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:26,479
I'll do it.

943
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,440
Shy? You're just a kid.

944
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:30,566
Sit down.

945
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:35,947
Give it to me.

946
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:40,409
Lift up your shirt.

947
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:45,122
Think about what I asked you.

948
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:52,380
The murderer in the outhouse
coming out at night...

949
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:56,133
Who might have told
that story first...

950
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:57,552
How would I know?

951
01:15:57,594 --> 01:16:02,723
It's like asking who
made up the elephantjokes.

952
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:07,770
Why don't you go to
the outhouse yourself?

953
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:11,065
Do I look like
I have time for that?

954
01:17:01,908 --> 01:17:03,868
Even still...

955
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:06,954
Some kids talk
so you snoop around the outhouse?

956
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:08,497
You got that much time?

957
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:11,542
- Giving me a heart attack.
- Investigating...

958
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:12,168
What?

959
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:16,047
Is investigating
such a dirtyjob?

960
01:17:17,924 --> 01:17:22,595
Ah! Is that why they
made up the rumor?

961
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,724
I saw her myself once or twice.

962
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:27,933
That woman.

963
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:29,060
Who?

964
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,646
A crying woman.

965
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:33,856
When was it?

966
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:38,653
I was in the outhouse then too

967
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:41,781
when I heard a woman crying.

968
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:44,241
When I came out

969
01:17:44,284 --> 01:17:47,745
there was a woman
working on that hill

970
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:49,747
who kept crying.

971
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:53,501
A woman was crying?

972
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:54,960
Yes.

973
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:58,339
She kept crying on that hill.

974
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:01,092
It just seemed strange.

975
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:21,987
Hello?

976
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:26,242
Excuse me.

977
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,663
Are you the person
who lives here?

978
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:34,250
Who are you?

979
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:39,672
I'd like to ask something.
I heard that...

980
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:43,968
Wait!

981
01:18:45,011 --> 01:18:46,429
Look here.

982
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:49,682
- I'm a policeman.
- Really?

983
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:54,145
You can't stay there.
Someone might see.

984
01:18:56,022 --> 01:18:57,356
There's no one here.

985
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:03,446
Go, please.

986
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:05,448
I beg you.

987
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:21,213
Be assured
this will remain a secret.

988
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:25,426
As we're both women

989
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:29,263
tell me everything
comfortably and in detail.

990
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:34,977
That night

991
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:43,068
a light rain was falling.

992
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:45,321
When was it?

993
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:49,074
It was...

994
01:19:53,371 --> 01:19:55,080
last September.

995
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:09,261
I had read all the articles...

996
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,597
about the women killed.

997
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:19,146
The methods he used
were exactly the same.

998
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,233
It was...

999
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,362
the same with me.

1000
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:34,870
You saw his face?

1001
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:37,540
I tried not to on purpose

1002
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:39,875
keeping my chin down.

1003
01:20:41,127 --> 01:20:43,462
My panties covered my head,

1004
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:46,465
but I closed my eyes tight.

1005
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:51,262
If I saw him
he'd have killed me.

1006
01:20:54,474 --> 01:20:58,394
I don't know about the rest
but one thing I remember.

1007
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,272
His hands were very soft.

1008
01:21:02,482 --> 01:21:04,900
The hand over my mouth

1009
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,403
was delicate

1010
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:08,696
just like a woman's.

1011
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:45,733
We're done.
Let's get ourselves some sleep.

1012
01:21:46,192 --> 01:21:49,278
Once we get your seal
it's done.

1013
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:52,698
It's all as you said.

1014
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:55,075
Sound good?

1015
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:58,162
Yes, of course.

1016
01:21:58,204 --> 01:22:01,874
Oh, it's finally over, right?

1017
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:03,208
Please let me down. Please.

1018
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:11,800
Let him go.
He's not the murderer.

1019
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:13,177
What?

1020
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:16,472
Byung-soon
Are you the murderer?

1021
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:18,974
Yes, sir, yes...

1022
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:21,185
Shut up. No you're not.

1023
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:22,811
I think I am...

1024
01:22:22,812 --> 01:22:24,271
Let him go!

1025
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:27,983
Write down everything she said...

1026
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:28,901
Hey!

1027
01:22:29,235 --> 01:22:31,779
You toying with me?

1028
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:34,156
Are you having fun?

1029
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,784
I caught the murderer, OK?

1030
01:22:36,826 --> 01:22:39,620
What do you mean
you caught him?

1031
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,876
Did you hang him
from the ceiling?

1032
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,544
Well, he kept lying, and...

1033
01:22:47,587 --> 01:22:50,089
Get hold of yourself.
Those journalists...

1034
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:53,634
- Chief!
- Those goddamned bastards!

1035
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,640
Stop!

1036
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:02,643
Listen.

1037
01:23:05,605 --> 01:23:06,772
What is that?

1038
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:10,651
- Is it live?
- It's being broadcast now?

1039
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,528
Yes, it's live.

1040
01:23:21,454 --> 01:23:25,374
First, declare a
state of emergency.

1041
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:28,919
And send me
two garrisons of men.

1042
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:31,880
Because our
intelligence says so!

1043
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:36,093
Tonight.
There'll be a murder tonight.

1044
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:39,054
Hello, I need to
speak to producer Im...

1045
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:41,140
What? He quit?

1046
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,559
Get me the A.D. now.

1047
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:47,646
The song that was just played
"Sad Letter".

1048
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,357
Read the name and
address of the requester.

1049
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,443
You must have the postcard.

1050
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:54,737
What? Prank call?

1051
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:58,449
It's the police, bastard!
Hello?

1052
01:23:58,491 --> 01:24:00,075
I'll go myself.

1053
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:02,828
Are the garrisons coming?

1054
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,205
They don't even have
one man available.

1055
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:10,919
They went to suppress
a demonstration in Suwon city.

1056
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:46,163
Name: Ahn Mi-seon, age 28.

1057
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:53,879
Estimated time of death
last night between 7:30 and 8:00.

1058
01:24:54,798 --> 01:25:00,469
When the two of you were
fighting like madmen. Right?

1059
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,765
Wait a minute.

1060
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,561
There's something in the vagina.

1061
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,743
Looks like a peach.

1062
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:52,980
Nine pieces.

1063
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:05,367
Do you see this kind of thing
in Seoul often?

1064
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:08,579
Never.

1065
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:14,293
You were right.

1066
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:15,294
What?

1067
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:22,843
These guys were a waste of time
from the start.

1068
01:26:25,388 --> 01:26:26,346
Hey!

1069
01:26:27,223 --> 01:26:29,349
A call from the radio station.

1070
01:26:29,392 --> 01:26:32,561
I think she found the postcard.

1071
01:26:34,397 --> 01:26:37,274
I've got the postcard.
It has an address.

1072
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:38,984
Can you write it down?

1073
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:41,987
Jinan 1-ri, Terung District

1074
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,990
# 32. Park Hyun-gyu.

1075
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:20,776
Who are you?

1076
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:26,198
We're policemen.
Where has Park Hyun-gyu gone?

1077
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:30,827
He works at the
factory at this time.

1078
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:57,187
Hey, Hyun-gyu.

1079
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:58,272
Park Hyun-gyu!

1080
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:02,192
Park Hyun-gyu!

1081
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:33,390
Show me your hands.

1082
01:28:42,608 --> 01:28:44,735
They're quite smooth.

1083
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:49,740
How long have you
worked in the factory office?

1084
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:55,037
From September last year.

1085
01:28:56,581 --> 01:29:01,209
Then, a little before
the first murder.

1086
01:29:05,214 --> 01:29:10,052
So after doing your military service
you came to this town

1087
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:13,347
and the murders all
began taking place.

1088
01:29:13,389 --> 01:29:14,473
Right?

1089
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:17,934
Park Hyun-gyu.

1090
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:21,772
You sent this postcard
to the station.

1091
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:22,564
Yes.

1092
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:25,275
You sent several others too.

1093
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:26,360
Yes.

1094
01:29:27,236 --> 01:29:29,863
You asked it to be
played on rainy days.

1095
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:31,490
Yes.

1096
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:37,704
"Sad Letter". You know that
each time this song played

1097
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:39,748
a woman was murdered?

1098
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:44,044
No.

1099
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,799
Look at the broadcast records.

1100
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:52,677
Okay.

1101
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:57,474
The song played yesterday?
"Sad Letter".

1102
01:29:58,810 --> 01:29:59,768
Yes.

1103
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:02,771
- You listened to the program?
- Yes.

1104
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:06,775
Your song played at 7:08
and the program finished at 8pm.

1105
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:08,193
- You listened to the end?
- Yes.

1106
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,070
- Continuously?
- Yes.

1107
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:13,281
- What was the final song?
- I don't know.

1108
01:30:13,324 --> 01:30:15,200
- It was yesterday!
- I don't remember.

1109
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:17,953
- Because you went out!
- I was home!

1110
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:21,665
She was killed
between 7:30 and 8pm.

1111
01:30:21,707 --> 01:30:24,292
You weren't listening
you went out!

1112
01:30:24,293 --> 01:30:25,293
Don't make me laugh.

1113
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:28,839
- Yong-gu!
- You motherfucker. Are you joking?

1114
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:30,966
- Let go of him now!
- Hey!

1115
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:36,054
Get back here!

1116
01:30:41,018 --> 01:30:46,731
Even kids in this town know
you torture innocent people.

1117
01:30:46,732 --> 01:30:49,317
- Shut up, you!
- Get back here!

1118
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:55,282
Anyway, I wont be one of them.

1119
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,577
Never.

1120
01:31:01,747 --> 01:31:04,040
Okay. Park Hyun-gyu.

1121
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:08,378
You say you listened
at home to the end?

1122
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:13,133
But you couldn't have forgotten
the last song.

1123
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:17,471
Because the DJ introduced it

1124
01:31:17,513 --> 01:31:19,890
with some very striking words.

1125
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:24,394
She mentioned you
and the many postcards you sent.

1126
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:28,773
If you heard it
you couldnt have forgotten.

1127
01:31:28,774 --> 01:31:31,860
Tell me! If you really
listened to the end.

1128
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:34,571
I don't remember.

1129
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:36,281
You don't remember?

1130
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:39,284
Should I explain it for you?

1131
01:31:43,122 --> 01:31:46,166
This is the recording of
yesterday's program.

1132
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:51,379
Last night, you sat
listening to this song.

1133
01:31:52,423 --> 01:31:56,801
Outside the rain was
pelting down, you listened

1134
01:31:58,804 --> 01:32:01,765
and soon you started
itching with excitement.

1135
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:06,645
There's something you always
do when you hear this song.

1136
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:12,943
You heard a TV program playing
in the room of your landlady

1137
01:32:12,985 --> 01:32:18,031
you left the lights on in your
own room and crept outside.

1138
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:23,870
And in the pitch dark
you wandered here and there.

1139
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:27,832
Who will it be today?

1140
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,418
Right?

1141
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:35,924
You hid in a reed field
waiting for a woman to pass.

1142
01:32:36,425 --> 01:32:38,134
The rain drenching you.

1143
01:32:38,177 --> 01:32:40,845
But you find all this pleasurable.

1144
01:32:40,888 --> 01:32:42,389
Stimulating, right?

1145
01:32:43,015 --> 01:32:46,851
So yesterday you stuffed
this in that woman's body!

1146
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:52,148
You remember how
many pieces it was?

1147
01:32:53,025 --> 01:32:55,777
One piece, two...

1148
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,571
- Three pieces...
- Shut up!

1149
01:32:57,613 --> 01:32:59,406
Four, five...

1150
01:32:59,448 --> 01:33:01,992
- six, seven, eight...
- Shut the fuck up!

1151
01:33:02,451 --> 01:33:04,369
Yong-gu!

1152
01:33:09,458 --> 01:33:13,044
I told you not to hit him.

1153
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:16,172
Didn't I?

1154
01:33:16,215 --> 01:33:20,885
You know why
journalists snoop around here.

1155
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:22,971
You stupid bastard.

1156
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:30,520
Don't even think about coming
into the interrogation room again.

1157
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:46,328
I'm going crazy.

1158
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:51,583
No eyewitnesses

1159
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:54,753
not one piece of evidence.

1160
01:33:55,755 --> 01:33:58,506
We need something, shit.

1161
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:02,969
Shit, we don't need
any damn witnesses.

1162
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:05,513
Just a confession will do.

1163
01:34:05,514 --> 01:34:09,059
Just need to beat that bastard
to an inch of his life.

1164
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,480
You've changed.

1165
01:34:15,733 --> 01:34:21,196
Try it and, you'll be disgraced.
Like with Kwang-ho.

1166
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,160
Retarded Kwang-ho...

1167
01:34:30,539 --> 01:34:33,583
I always wanted to ask you.

1168
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:36,586
When you dragged
him up the mountain

1169
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:43,093
he talked about Hyang-sook's
death in so much detail.

1170
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:45,220
So?

1171
01:34:45,262 --> 01:34:50,225
Did you really not rehearse
that dialogue with him?

1172
01:34:50,267 --> 01:34:54,145
I told you I didn't!

1173
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:58,066
But how did he know the way
she was strangled...

1174
01:34:58,109 --> 01:34:59,776
That's my point!

1175
01:35:02,863 --> 01:35:06,491
The tape... Where's the tape
from the mountain?

1176
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:08,368
Miss Kwon? Gui-ok.

1177
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:14,249
Then, Hyang-sook's body
shook a bit.

1178
01:35:14,291 --> 01:35:15,709
She looked completely dead.

1179
01:35:15,751 --> 01:35:17,836
Listen to how he speaks here.

1180
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:22,966
Covered up Hyang-sook's head.

1181
01:35:23,008 --> 01:35:24,259
With what?

1182
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:26,136
Her panties.

1183
01:35:26,178 --> 01:35:30,682
Her head was covered
with her panties.

1184
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:34,269
He's talking like
it was someone else.

1185
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:35,603
And then?

1186
01:35:36,313 --> 01:35:38,773
He's describing what he saw.

1187
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:44,988
Kwang-ho is the witness.

1188
01:35:57,209 --> 01:35:58,418
Where did Kwang-ho go?

1189
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:01,421
Kwang-ho...

1190
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:04,340
No, no. We came for a drink.

1191
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,885
Some meat, please.

1192
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:10,305
What are you doing here?

1193
01:36:19,231 --> 01:36:21,357
Control yourself, huh?

1194
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:24,778
He's not in his room.
I'll check outside.

1195
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:27,655
Try the game arcade.

1196
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:31,785
How long have you been here?

1197
01:36:32,369 --> 01:36:34,078
Have you seen Kwang-ho?

1198
01:36:47,092 --> 01:36:50,887
It is now 23 months since
the incident first surfaced.

1199
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:54,140
Before interrogating
Detective Moon...

1200
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:57,268
They should cut off
all detectives dicks!

1201
01:36:57,311 --> 01:36:59,813
Nah, it's not worth it.

1202
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:01,940
Stupid bastards.

1203
01:37:01,982 --> 01:37:03,983
Quiet, lets listen.

1204
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:19,165
The trial of detective Moon
suspected of police torture

1205
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:21,251
and sexual assault
opened today.

1206
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:46,442
You fucked your professor
didn't you, bitch!

1207
01:37:46,485 --> 01:37:49,529
Your parents pay good money...

1208
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:53,157
Hey, Yong-gu!

1209
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:28,568
Kwang-ho!

1210
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:33,448
Kwang-ho! Don't run away!

1211
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:35,199
Hey, Kwang-ho!

1212
01:38:35,492 --> 01:38:38,786
Kwang-ho!

1213
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:46,252
Kwang-ho!

1214
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:49,881
I'm sorry...

1215
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:52,258
What's wrong with you?

1216
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:53,801
We're not here to catch you.

1217
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:55,053
Come down.

1218
01:38:57,097 --> 01:38:59,098
You're gonna kill me?

1219
01:38:59,141 --> 01:39:02,644
We'll forget that any of
that happened.

1220
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:05,980
If a fight breaks out
that can happen.

1221
01:39:06,023 --> 01:39:09,359
It's okay just come down, huh?

1222
01:39:09,401 --> 01:39:11,986
If I do, you'll kill me?

1223
01:39:12,029 --> 01:39:12,987
I know it.

1224
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:15,323
We won't kill you
just come down.

1225
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:19,452
Okay, just stay there for now.
We've something to ask you.

1226
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:21,788
You...

1227
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:25,333
You remember Hyang-sook?

1228
01:39:26,835 --> 01:39:28,878
Hyang-sook is pretty.

1229
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:33,466
That's right.
You used to follow after her.

1230
01:39:33,509 --> 01:39:36,260
But that night

1231
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:40,348
when it rained
you saw her killed, huh?

1232
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:43,893
That? I told you already.

1233
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:48,147
In the forest.
I told you already...

1234
01:39:48,190 --> 01:39:52,151
You saw when Hyang-sook was
murdered, didn't you? Here?

1235
01:39:52,194 --> 01:39:54,988
Yeah, here.

1236
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:58,282
The paddy next to
the train tracks.

1237
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:03,162
That night,

1238
01:40:03,205 --> 01:40:06,582
did you see the killers face?

1239
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:09,293
- Yeah.
- Really?

1240
01:40:09,962 --> 01:40:11,295
Lightning, ka-rang!

1241
01:40:14,925 --> 01:40:18,052
I saw everything
from inside here.

1242
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:22,432
So you saw his face?

1243
01:40:22,474 --> 01:40:23,975
Three times.

1244
01:40:25,477 --> 01:40:28,146
Do you remember him in detail?

1245
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:30,648
He was handsome.

1246
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:34,152
More than me.

1247
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:42,076
Was this the face you saw?

1248
01:40:44,413 --> 01:40:45,830
Look at the picture.

1249
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:58,009
You know how hot that fire was?

1250
01:40:58,052 --> 01:40:59,886
Look at the photo!

1251
01:41:00,471 --> 01:41:02,263
It was so hot!

1252
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:04,474
Snap out of it!

1253
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:07,643
Here, look closely.

1254
01:41:07,686 --> 01:41:10,563
Hot hot hot hot!

1255
01:41:10,606 --> 01:41:12,565
Look at the photo!

1256
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:14,275
Hey. Kwang-ho.

1257
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:16,486
When I was young

1258
01:41:16,487 --> 01:41:19,989
he threw me in the fire.
That man.

1259
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:22,075
- Kwang-ho!
- You bastards!

1260
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:23,117
What the hell!

1261
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:27,246
Please forgive him.

1262
01:41:27,998 --> 01:41:29,457
You bastard!

1263
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:32,251
What are you students doing?

1264
01:41:32,669 --> 01:41:34,462
We're police!

1265
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:36,756
Bullshit!
Then we're the F.B.I.!

1266
01:41:41,595 --> 01:41:44,388
Hey, Kwang-ho!

1267
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:55,900
Kwang-ho!
We're looking for you.

1268
01:41:57,236 --> 01:41:57,985
Hey!

1269
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:01,405
A train's coming! Come here!

1270
01:42:07,287 --> 01:42:09,247
Out of the way, quick!

1271
01:42:10,999 --> 01:42:12,083
It's dangerous there.

1272
01:42:12,126 --> 01:42:14,669
Out of the way! You idiot!

1273
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:17,255
Stay away. Go...

1274
01:42:57,171 --> 01:43:01,090
It's okay for you to be here?
They'll be looking for you.

1275
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:38,628
Yes, yes.

1276
01:43:38,670 --> 01:43:42,757
Journalists tend
to be like that.

1277
01:43:42,758 --> 01:43:46,344
Sir, as I said last time...

1278
01:43:46,887 --> 01:43:48,137
Hello?

1279
01:43:48,597 --> 01:43:49,764
Hello?

1280
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:52,558
Assholes!

1281
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:54,769
High-ranking bastards...

1282
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:57,271
- Chief!
- What?

1283
01:43:57,356 --> 01:44:01,484
It's Investigative Crimes.
They found semen.

1284
01:44:01,526 --> 01:44:02,860
They found what?

1285
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:04,362
Take a look.

1286
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:07,365
The semen was found
on the victim's clothing

1287
01:44:07,407 --> 01:44:11,661
Maybe he masturbated
on the corpse

1288
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:13,663
and semen fell on her clothes.

1289
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:14,914
Wait.

1290
01:44:14,957 --> 01:44:16,832
So...

1291
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:20,169
if the DNA in this semen

1292
01:44:20,212 --> 01:44:22,922
is confirmed to match
that of Park Hyun-gyu

1293
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:29,262
then the game's over, isn't it?

1294
01:44:29,304 --> 01:44:32,848
Yes, that would be
quite strong evidence.

1295
01:44:32,891 --> 01:44:34,725
The problem is

1296
01:44:34,768 --> 01:44:37,561
we don't have
the technology in Korea

1297
01:44:37,604 --> 01:44:40,273
to carry out such tests.

1298
01:44:40,315 --> 01:44:42,400
It must be sent to America.

1299
01:44:42,401 --> 01:44:44,402
There's no other way.

1300
01:44:45,570 --> 01:44:49,156
Once the test's complete
the results will be released.

1301
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:53,077
So we just have to wait for
the documents from America?

1302
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:53,828
That's right.

1303
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:58,749
You sent people to
watch over Park Hyun-gyu?

1304
01:44:58,792 --> 01:45:02,586
Yes! They're watching
him 24 hours a day.

1305
01:45:03,338 --> 01:45:05,673
Once the result
comes in from America

1306
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:09,468
wait until we get our
hands on that bastard.

1307
01:45:26,611 --> 01:45:30,281
- What's wrong with your leg?
- Why?

1308
01:45:30,699 --> 01:45:31,741
Did you go to the hospital?

1309
01:45:31,783 --> 01:45:34,660
For this little scratch?
Come here.

1310
01:45:34,703 --> 01:45:37,621
It's okay.
I put on some medicine.

1311
01:45:39,207 --> 01:45:42,376
- What is that?
- Oh, that night...

1312
01:45:43,754 --> 01:45:45,463
It keeps swelling.

1313
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:47,298
Come on, let's go.

1314
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:48,591
Just get in.

1315
01:45:49,634 --> 01:45:53,346
So, you have to amputate?

1316
01:45:53,388 --> 01:45:55,348
Should I explain it again?

1317
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:58,601
It was pierced
but why cut off a healthy leg?

1318
01:45:58,643 --> 01:46:01,270
If you don't, he'll die.

1319
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:05,691
Tetanous is a brutal thing.

1320
01:46:05,734 --> 01:46:08,652
For rusty nails
you need to see a doctor fast.

1321
01:46:08,695 --> 01:46:11,238
Bunch of dim-witted boneheads.

1322
01:46:12,074 --> 01:46:16,660
Be grateful it's under the knee.

1323
01:46:17,704 --> 01:46:19,580
Crazy bastards.

1324
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:20,664
Let's go.

1325
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:24,668
Are you family?

1326
01:46:24,711 --> 01:46:27,505
He doesn't have any
but I'm like his brother...

1327
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:29,673
Anyway, you came together,
right?

1328
01:46:29,716 --> 01:46:34,178
The authorization for surgery.
Read it, then sign.

1329
01:46:50,987 --> 01:46:53,572
You fucker...

1330
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,297
Hello, post office?

1331
01:47:10,882 --> 01:47:13,384
Its Suh Tae-yoon
Investigative Crimes.

1332
01:47:14,136 --> 01:47:16,929
Have the documents
from America arrived?

1333
01:47:19,224 --> 01:47:21,308
Have you checked 100%?

1334
01:47:22,686 --> 01:47:25,688
I keep calling because
it's important!

1335
01:47:26,565 --> 01:47:32,736
Since it's so important
please call as soon as it comes.

1336
01:47:35,073 --> 01:47:36,157
Hello?

1337
01:47:39,327 --> 01:47:40,911
Uh, now?

1338
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:44,582
Why'd you call me out?

1339
01:47:44,583 --> 01:47:47,460
Why? Can't I do that sometimes?

1340
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:50,463
Your face looks worn

1341
01:47:50,505 --> 01:47:51,964
Are you sleeping well?

1342
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:56,051
What kind of detective
sleeps well?

1343
01:47:58,346 --> 01:48:02,391
- What's wrong with you?
- Fishing? Damn free-riders.

1344
01:48:06,813 --> 01:48:08,814
Why'd you call out a busy man?

1345
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:16,363
You look like a corpse.

1346
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:22,286
It may be no use asking

1347
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:24,288
but can you do anything else?

1348
01:48:26,208 --> 01:48:28,292
Can you quit your job?

1349
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:50,457
Violent Crimes Dept!...

1350
01:49:51,293 --> 01:49:52,459
Violent Crimes!

1351
01:49:52,752 --> 01:49:55,379
How many visits in one night?

1352
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:57,715
Is money that important?

1353
01:49:59,759 --> 01:50:02,052
Bo-kyung's grandmother
collapsed again.

1354
01:50:02,095 --> 01:50:03,596
I have to go.

1355
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:07,141
You deserve a medal.

1356
01:50:07,183 --> 01:50:09,476
Get one from the Health Ministry.

1357
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:20,654
Chief!

1358
01:50:20,697 --> 01:50:23,032
Park Hyun-gyu hasn't
come home for 2 hours.

1359
01:50:23,074 --> 01:50:26,660
It's only six stops
from there to his house.

1360
01:50:26,703 --> 01:50:28,662
So he must have gotten off.

1361
01:50:28,705 --> 01:50:31,332
Would a man under
investigation act so wild?

1362
01:50:31,416 --> 01:50:34,043
He's capable of it.

1363
01:50:34,753 --> 01:50:38,964
- He's instinctively crazy.
- You seem like the crazy one!

1364
01:50:39,007 --> 01:50:44,219
Once the DNA tests arrive
he's through. Stop it.

1365
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:47,973
I let him go...

1366
01:50:48,016 --> 01:50:50,768
Don't get so upset!

1367
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:32,953
Citizens

1368
01:52:32,996 --> 01:52:38,959
this is a civil defense drill.

1369
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:43,756
A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses...

1370
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:59,790
Will you make any special
investigation into this incident?

1371
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:17,516
A razor wound in the breast...

1372
01:54:20,311 --> 01:54:21,979
What the hell?

1373
01:54:23,356 --> 01:54:26,066
Something is stuck
inside of the vagina.

1374
01:54:27,235 --> 01:54:31,154
Huh?
Looks like a ball point pen

1375
01:54:31,197 --> 01:54:32,781
and a spoon.

1376
01:54:32,824 --> 01:54:34,366
Jesus...

1377
01:54:38,454 --> 01:54:41,164
Look inside, closely.

1378
01:54:47,422 --> 01:54:49,047
Wait, what's that?

1379
01:54:51,384 --> 01:54:53,886
An old band-aid.

1380
01:55:07,191 --> 01:55:09,693
What are you doing?

1381
01:55:11,529 --> 01:55:14,197
Why are you touching a corpse?

1382
01:55:39,307 --> 01:55:40,474
What?

1383
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:45,270
Get up, you bastard!

1384
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:54,947
You fucker!

1385
01:55:58,159 --> 01:55:59,952
Get up, you fucker.

1386
01:56:04,082 --> 01:56:05,457
Are you human?

1387
01:56:18,471 --> 01:56:22,599
Nobody will care if I kill you.

1388
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:33,986
Tell me!

1389
01:56:35,863 --> 01:56:37,447
Tell me you killed them!

1390
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:41,451
Tell me!

1391
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:45,080
You killed all those women!

1392
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:05,934
Yeah.

1393
01:57:06,936 --> 01:57:08,437
I killed them.

1394
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:12,274
I killed them all.

1395
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:18,363
That's what you want
to hear, right?

1396
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:20,657
Right?

1397
01:57:22,201 --> 01:57:23,744
You feel better?

1398
01:57:28,833 --> 01:57:30,208
Inspector Suh!

1399
01:57:32,462 --> 01:57:34,880
The papers from America!

1400
01:57:35,590 --> 01:57:36,882
Read them!

1401
01:57:39,594 --> 01:57:41,053
You asshole.

1402
01:57:42,764 --> 01:57:43,889
You fucker!

1403
01:57:43,931 --> 01:57:45,182
You mocked us, didn't you!

1404
01:57:45,183 --> 01:57:46,641
You bastard!

1405
01:57:49,312 --> 01:57:50,645
You mocked us!

1406
01:58:08,081 --> 01:58:09,247
What's wrong?

1407
01:58:41,239 --> 01:58:43,156
There's a mistake.

1408
01:58:53,709 --> 01:58:56,670
This document is a lie.
I don't need it.

1409
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:12,811
What does it say, huh?

1410
01:59:20,695 --> 01:59:22,654
It really wasn't you?

1411
01:59:30,538 --> 01:59:32,164
Look in my eyes.

1412
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:05,197
Look in my eyes!

1413
02:00:19,629 --> 02:00:21,755
Fuck, I don't know.

1414
02:00:28,888 --> 02:00:30,931
Do you get up each morning too?

1415
02:00:35,061 --> 02:00:36,186
Go!

1416
02:00:39,232 --> 02:00:40,857
Just go, fucker!

1417
02:00:44,612 --> 02:00:46,488
Bastard.

1418
02:01:56,183 --> 02:01:57,934
That's enough.

1419
02:02:33,554 --> 02:02:38,183
2003

1420
02:02:38,225 --> 02:02:39,476
Chi-hyuk.

1421
02:02:40,770 --> 02:02:43,355
You played computer games
all night, right?

1422
02:02:44,523 --> 02:02:48,193
Did you or didn't you?

1423
02:02:52,365 --> 02:02:54,282
Look in my eyes, son.

1424
02:02:55,034 --> 02:02:56,868
Eyes all bloodshot.

1425
02:02:57,745 --> 02:02:59,579
Do you play well?

1426
02:02:59,622 --> 02:03:00,663
Yeah!

1427
02:03:00,706 --> 02:03:04,167
You don't study
might as well be good at games.

1428
02:03:05,753 --> 02:03:09,381
If you won't study
go get some exercise.

1429
02:03:09,382 --> 02:03:12,258
Sitting in front of the computer...

1430
02:03:12,301 --> 02:03:13,927
I really didn't!

1431
02:03:13,969 --> 02:03:15,887
What do you mean you didn't?

1432
02:03:15,930 --> 02:03:18,223
Think you can fool my eyes?

1433
02:03:19,392 --> 02:03:22,352
He said he didn't. Believe him.

1434
02:03:22,395 --> 02:03:28,483
No, two days ago Manager Oh
called my company.

1435
02:03:28,526 --> 02:03:33,279
He kept saying you can't do this
to people, it's not fair.

1436
02:03:33,322 --> 02:03:36,825
You can't believe him.

1437
02:03:37,284 --> 02:03:40,036
Did I do anything wrong?

1438
02:03:40,454 --> 02:03:45,375
Oh, Chairman Kim...
I'm on the road now with our product.

1439
02:03:46,001 --> 02:03:51,506
Sure, let's have dinner
with Manager Oh.

1440
02:03:52,425 --> 02:03:54,300
It's been a while.

1441
02:03:57,346 --> 02:04:00,473
Chul-yong! Pull over a minute!

1442
02:05:38,113 --> 02:05:40,073
Is something in there?

1443
02:05:41,659 --> 02:05:43,493
Is anything in there?

1444
02:05:44,828 --> 02:05:46,412
No...

1445
02:05:47,456 --> 02:05:49,249
Then why are you looking?

1446
02:05:51,168 --> 02:05:53,044
I'm just looking.

1447
02:05:53,879 --> 02:05:55,380
That's so weird.

1448
02:05:57,550 --> 02:05:59,050
What is?

1449
02:06:00,511 --> 02:06:02,136
A while back

1450
02:06:02,179 --> 02:06:06,432
a man was here
looking into that hole.

1451
02:06:09,979 --> 02:06:13,398
I asked him the same question.

1452
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:15,775
Why he was looking there.

1453
02:06:15,818 --> 02:06:17,068
What did he say?

1454
02:06:18,195 --> 02:06:19,904
What was it?

1455
02:06:20,531 --> 02:06:21,823
Right...

1456
02:06:21,865 --> 02:06:26,244
He remembered doing
something here long ago

1457
02:06:26,245 --> 02:06:31,124
so he came back to take a look.

1458
02:06:43,637 --> 02:06:46,055
Did you see his face?

1459
02:06:51,103 --> 02:06:53,021
What did he look like?

1460
02:06:54,273 --> 02:06:55,690
Well...

1461
02:06:57,526 --> 02:06:59,319
Kind of plain.

1462
02:07:01,447 --> 02:07:02,739
In what way?

1463
02:07:05,409 --> 02:07:06,951
Just...

1464
02:07:09,204 --> 02:07:10,663
ordinary.
