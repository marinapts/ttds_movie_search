1
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,436
I was orphaned at an early age

2
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,166
I had no name,
so people called me Nameless

3
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,503
Being a nobody,
I studied swordsmanship

4
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:55,946
After 10 years of practice

5
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,011
I acquired a unique skill

6
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,713
The King of Qin has summoned me

7
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,613
My deeds have astonished the Kingdom

8
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,562
By order of His Majesty

9
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,892
we have brought the mighty warrior

10
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,722
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword

11
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,416
the three assassins from Zhao

12
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,323
have sought His Majesty's life
for 10 years

13
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,499
His Majesty has known no peace

14
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,599
To the astonishment of all

15
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:27,295
a mighty warrior of Qin
has smashed them

16
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:32,537
His Majesty can finally sleep at night!

17
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,740
We rejoice for our King!

18
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,574
This warrior sent from Heaven

19
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,613
has exterminated the assassins

20
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,334
Summon the warrior!

21
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,542
Remain 100 paces from His Majesty

22
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,252
Or you will be executed.
Never forget that

23
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:26,753
No one is allowed
within 100 paces of me

24
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,187
Do you know why?

25
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,926
To guard against assassins

26
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:34,731
Yes. That's why I am confined
in this armor

27
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,595
You have removed a great peril for me

28
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,233
How should I reward you?

29
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,904
My service was for Qin, not for a reward

30
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,205
Achievements must be rewarded

31
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,342
Sky's silver spear...

32
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,718
wounded many of my brave warriors

33
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,459
Announce my edict!

34
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:03,793
By order of His Majesty

35
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:08,431
he who kills Sky
will receive gold and land

36
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:09,896
and be allowed to drink

37
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,365
within 20 paces of His Majesty

38
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,649
I am informed you're a citizen of Qin

39
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,422
I am a Prefect from Leng Meng County

40
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,464
A County Prefect over 10 square miles!

41
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,969
Surely the lowest-ranking official in Qin

42
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:49,139
How did you defeat such opponents?

43
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,835
I took them on one by one

44
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,003
Tell me the details

45
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,311
Does Your Majesty know

46
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,012
Flying Snow and Broken Sword were lovers?

47
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,645
Yes, I do

48
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,816
And that they hadn't spoken
for three years?

49
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,485
For three years? Why?

50
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,659
Flying Snow had an affair with Sky

51
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,461
Broken Sword never forgave her

52
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,057
Why haven't I heard this before?

53
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,701
I went to great lengths to uncover it

54
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,569
To divide Flying Snow and Broken Sword

55
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,204
I first needed to eliminate Sky

56
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,669
I have an idea of what you planned

57
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,038
Your Majesty is wise

58
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,873
What did you use to defeat Sky?

59
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,147
The sword

60
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,490
I must arrest criminals in my county

61
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,792
On the fifth day of the sixth month

62
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,558
Sky attended a chess house

63
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,119
I had learned he enjoyed playing chess

64
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,998
and listening to music there

65
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,350
So, the seven masters of Qin Palace

66
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,916
We are here to arrest you!

67
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,789
Identify yourself by showing your spear

68
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,970
Halt!

69
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,582
What can a minor official do?

70
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,685
This is my territory

71
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,153
So?

72
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,318
You are on the King's most wanted list

73
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,085
I am placing you under arrest

74
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:08,018
Old man, please play one more tune

75
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,544
Martial arts and music are different

76
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,283
but they share the same principle

77
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,685
Both stress attaining a supreme state

78
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:46,030
Sky and I faced each other
for a long time

79
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,165
Neither of us moved

80
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,995
We fought the battle in our minds

81
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,670
How swift thy sword!

82
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:50,843
I thought I knew everything
about my Kingdom

83
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,642
I didn't know that Leng Meng County

84
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:56,079
held a talent like yours

85
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,385
Broken Sword

86
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,091
Flying Snow

87
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:07,695
By order of His Majesty!

88
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,693
Flying Snow and Broken Sword

89
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,460
have teamed up for assassination

90
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,229
He who kills either of them

91
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,067
will receive gold and land

92
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,366
and be allowed to drink

93
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,144
within 10 paces of His Majesty

94
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,394
Three years ago, Flying Snow

95
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,035
stormed the palace with Broken Sword

96
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,764
3000 elite troops couldn't stop them

97
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:54,101
I've since emptied the palace

98
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,247
so assassins cannot hide

99
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,176
Was your sword swifter
than theirs combined?

100
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,418
No

101
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,281
How did you do it, then?

102
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:19,627
Disguised as a citizen of Zhao

103
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,340
I sought them in the Kingdom of Zhao

104
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:23,833
I learned they were hiding

105
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,601
in a calligraphy school

106
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,743
under the names Highcliff and Springbrook

107
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,179
Rumor had it

108
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,283
the Qin army would attack that day

109
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,951
Most of the townspeople had fled

110
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,980
Only the school's students remained

111
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,119
Why have you come at such a time?

112
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:43,722
Who are you?

113
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,827
I'm from Yi County
in the Kingdom of Zhao

114
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,564
My father's dying wish

115
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,462
was for one of your scrolls

116
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,228
I fear this may be our school's last day

117
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,105
Which calligrapher do you seek?

118
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,035
I respectfully request Master Highcliff

119
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,576
Highcliff was Broken Sword

120
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,711
Legend said his skill as a swordsman

121
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,045
was rooted in his calligraphy

122
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,216
So I had my concerns

123
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,625
I needed to find out if it was true

124
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,594
What do you want written?

125
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:17,826
"Sword."

126
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,227
You are fond of the sword?

127
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,638
It was my father's dying wish

128
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:38,815
What size scroll?

129
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,152
Eight feet

130
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:47,448
For that size I will need red ink

131
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,817
My master has asked me

132
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,523
to borrow some red ink

133
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,825
My master wants to borrow some red ink

134
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,302
Did you hear me, Master Springbrook?

135
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,080
Master Highcliff wants to borrow red ink

136
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,609
Tell him to come himself

137
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,500
Could I have some red ink?

138
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,983
The character "sword"
was still being written

139
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,789
when Your Majesty's troops

140
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,991
arrived at the city gates

141
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,672
Draw!

142
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,045
Your Majesty's army is invincible

143
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,612
not only because it is brave

144
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,338
but also because of its archery

145
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,582
with a greater range than any other army

146
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:06,715
The Qin archers are like artillery

147
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,324
intimidating the enemy

148
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:24,641
Hail! Hail! Hail!

149
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,748
Please remember

150
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,988
their arrows might destroy our town

151
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,554
and topple our Kingdom

152
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,726
but they can never
obliterate our culture

153
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,459
Today

154
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:26,829
you will learn the essence of our culture

155
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,363
Hail! Hail! Hail!

156
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,013
Those Zhao people didn't flee?

157
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,159
They drew strength from their calligraphy

158
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,089
What was so difficult about "sword"?

159
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,822
There are 19 different ways to write it

160
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,500
I asked Broken Sword

161
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,532
for a 20th way

162
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:33,905
Both calligraphy and swordplay

163
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,436
rely on one's strength and spirit

164
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:37,866
The 20th style would reveal

165
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:41,043
the essence of his swordsmanship

166
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,271
How odd to write it in 19 ways

167
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,106
It makes the written language

168
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:47,847
impossible to comprehend

169
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,712
Once I've conquered the six Kingdoms

170
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,481
and all the northern tribes

171
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,126
I will eradicate this problem

172
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,488
by mandating one style of writing

173
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,130
Wouldn't that be ideal?

174
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,230
Your Majesty won't stop
at the six Kingdoms?

175
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,467
The six Kingdoms are nothing!

176
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,195
I will lead my army to conquer vast lands

177
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:11,303
and establish a great empire

178
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,443
Hail! Hail! Hail!

179
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,116
Master Springbrook

180
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,150
Why are you going outside?

181
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:01,581
To fend off the arrows

182
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,024
You aren't needed. Stay inside

183
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,525
The Qin archers are powerful

184
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,625
You alone may not stop them

185
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,498
Hail! Hail! Hail!

186
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:39,713
You are good

187
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,878
You are even better

188
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,785
You didn't come here for calligraphy

189
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,589
Who are you?

190
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,324
I've traveled here to deliver an item

191
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,195
Please meet me in the library at midnight

192
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,076
Great calligraphy

193
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,677
Great swordplay

194
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,146
You didn't even see my swordplay

195
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,981
I couldn't have written without it

196
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:14,575
At midnight

197
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,853
meet me in the library

198
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,357
Several hundred thousand Qin troops

199
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,958
were readying for the next onslaught

200
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,731
I studied the character all night

201
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,490
trying to unlock the secret of his skills

202
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,407
It would reveal his swordsmanship?

203
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:48,177
But it's just an ordinary word

204
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,451
Calligraphy and swordplay are similar

205
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,451
One must comprehend their true essence

206
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,655
Did you discover it?

207
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,122
It eluded me

208
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:03,226
So how did you challenge them?

209
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,593
Although they hadn't spoken in three years,
They spied on each other.

210
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,100
At midnight,

211
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,466
Broken Sword would
peek into Flying Snow's room.

212
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,044
At 2 o'clock in the morning,

213
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,809
she would spy on Broken Sword.

214
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,356
What strange behaviour.

215
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:35,863
I was surprised too.

216
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,997
So I used Sky's
silver spear to get to them.

217
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,771
Sky died by your sword?

218
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,247
Yes

219
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,983
Who are you? Why are you here?

220
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,786
I'm from the Kingdom of Qin

221
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,788
I have a message from Sky

222
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,158
Go on

223
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,460
He said he had lived a life

224
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,358
without responsibilities or commitments

225
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,360
He cared for only one person

226
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,665
Who?

227
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,127
Flying Snow

228
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:27,279
Sky was certain she'd avenge his death

229
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:41,730
To fight, meet me at the Qin camp

230
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:03,763
You can leave now

231
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:10,740
Go!

232
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,308
I know you saw us!

233
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,013
Let me tell you,

234
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,088
I have an affair with her for three years.

235
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,725
I let you see us on purpose!

236
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,464
I no longer care about you at all!

237
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,805
We were both very foolish

238
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,913
I just wanted you to care about me.

239
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,417
I'm not going to fight you

240
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:16,390
Go away!

241
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,160
I will kill you in honor of my master!

242
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,960
You ask to die. I will help you.

243
00:42:59,109 --> 00:42:59,939
Why do you laugh?

244
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,877
What you did last night was stupid

245
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,518
My plan proved successful

246
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,786
When Flying Snow was fighting me

247
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,893
she was disturbed and disoriented

248
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,325
I defeated her easily

249
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,383
I never imagined supreme warriors

250
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,246
like Broken Sword and Flying Snow

251
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:18,284
allowing their emotions
to be a liability

252
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,732
It sounds as if you did divide them

253
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:40,806
Yes

254
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:42,371
In that case, they must have been

255
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:45,514
petty and narrow-minded

256
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:46,647
TRUE

257
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,477
Your story sounds logical

258
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,120
But

259
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,153
you have underestimated one person.

260
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:56,255
Who?

261
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:58,124
Me

262
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,587
Would you like my impression of them?

263
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:06,063
Three years ago they stormed the palace

264
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,561
I was impressed

265
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:11,203
by their valor and dignity

266
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:12,932
Their character could not be petty

267
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,276
So Flying Snow's affair with Sky is a lie

268
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,004
Their betrayal of one another is a lie

269
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,275
The story you just told is a lie!

270
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:27,513
Except for one thing

271
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,686
Sky did know one of you

272
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:33,760
Who?

273
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,291
You

274
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,503
I surmise you two were old friends

275
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,007
And Sky's defeat has only one explanation

276
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,141
What's that?

277
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,469
He permitted it

278
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:58,544
To kill me, the two of you formed a pact

279
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,486
using my men as witnesses

280
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,020
That was not hard to arrange

281
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,320
The hardest part was to persuade Sky

282
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:07,792
to put his life in your hands

283
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:11,793
You were not fast enough to defeat Sky

284
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,798
He died willingly under your sword

285
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,333
Such devotion deserves true respect

286
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,069
He was the first to sacrifice himself

287
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,176
for your mission

288
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,171
Sky was proud

289
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,044
He saw himself as an unrivaled fighter

290
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,845
What convinced him you could succeed

291
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,521
where he had failed?

292
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,625
You have trained, perhaps for 10 years

293
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:40,359
with one goal, my assassination

294
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:43,055
You have a great skill
that few can counter

295
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:57,002
Killing Sky got you within 20 paces of me

296
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,806
So why seek out
Broken Sword and Flying Snow?

297
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:03,181
I surmise that your skill

298
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,385
requires you to come within 10 paces

299
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:09,653
You needed a second sacrifice

300
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,555
to claim another reward

301
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,093
to bring you within 10 paces

302
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,494
Although Broken Sword and Flying Snow

303
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,692
had never met Sky

304
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:20,835
they instantly understood

305
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,563
the reason for his defeat

306
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,778
How far am I from the bookshelves?

307
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,483
About 10 paces

308
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,722
10 paces is fine

309
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,069
I need one of you to help me

310
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,907
Please decide between yourselves

311
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:33,743
Meet me at the Qin camp tomorrow morning

312
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:48,682
How swift thy sword!

313
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:51,658
TRUE

314
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,494
Sky was a superior warrior

315
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,622
He willingly gave his life to this man

316
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,525
He can kill the King

317
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,265
We must proceed

318
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:09,110
That means we will die

319
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:13,482
Then we die together

320
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:34,828
You were one step ahead of me

321
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,577
Did I hurt you too much?

322
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:00,417
I should be the one who fights him

323
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,616
I want you to live

324
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:08,525
If you died, how could I live?

325
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:14,627
You will live on, promise me

326
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:23,903
Say it!

327
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,082
All right

328
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,901
Moon is on her way

329
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,198
I had better go

330
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:36,908
I am Nameless,
Prefect of Leng Meng County

331
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,807
Please allow me to fight this assassin

332
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,113
She is on His Majesty's most wanted list

333
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,948
Now she's here, I will arrest her

334
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:48,381
The assassin and I have an agreement

335
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,215
to fight one on one

336
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,584
Should I be unable to defeat her

337
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,886
please apprehend her

338
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:55,557
Your permission is sought

339
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:49,082
Draw your sword!

340
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:23,918
Hail! Hail! Hail!

341
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:26,051
Make your move!

342
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,857
Hail! Hail! Hail!

343
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,590
I die willingly

344
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:35,593
Make your move

345
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,967
Hail! Hail! Hail!

346
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,905
Hail! Hail! Hail!

347
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:53,114
Hail! Hail! Hail!

348
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:58,116
Hail! Hail! Hail!

349
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:49,962
How swift thy sword!

350
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:10,152
What are you here for?

351
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:12,785
For what you once said.

352
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:17,620
"I will fight the one
who harms Flying Snow."

353
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:19,860
Please draw your sword.

354
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:34,070
Thank you.

355
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,242
I believe that you and Broken Sword

356
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:39,881
had a fight as well.

357
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,447
It was not a battle of life and death,

358
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,383
but rather a way to commemorate
the death of Flying Snow.

359
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:00,570
My master wishes you to have his sword

360
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:06,839
Why?

361
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:09,677
He and she are bound in life and death

362
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:14,252
They will never part,
nor will their swords

363
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,601
It is his dying wish

364
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,198
that you take his sword for your mission

365
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:06,769
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword

366
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:09,274
sacrificed themselves

367
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:12,013
so you can be within 10 paces of me

368
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:14,911
All three gave you their lives

369
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:17,950
The best of friends could not give more

370
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:19,886
Therefore you are

371
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:21,522
the most dangerous assassin of all

372
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,428
How did you uncover my plan?

373
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:38,774
The flames of these candles

374
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:42,041
are disturbed by your murderous intent

375
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:50,718
All of you

376
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:53,079
are willing to die for a cause

377
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:57,017
I'm ashamed to say
I am not that committed

378
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,225
Your Majesty has seen through our plan

379
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,192
If I had realized this sooner

380
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:08,701
I wouldn't have allowed you so close

381
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:12,272
A citizen of Qin would not do this

382
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:13,806
Who are you?

383
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,341
A man of Zhao

384
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:19,377
Your Qin soldiers killed my family

385
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:20,981
I wandered into Qin

386
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,548
and was adopted

387
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,515
I discovered my real identity
10 years ago

388
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:26,579
and set my heart on this plan

389
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,018
You've come to avenge Zhao

390
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:33,892
I see

391
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:36,128
I would like to know

392
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,699
if your special skill has a name

393
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:40,196
As Your Majesty guessed

394
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,932
there is only one crucial move

395
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:43,337
What is that?

396
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:45,237
"Death within 10 Paces."

397
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:48,710
"Death within 10 Paces!" A good name

398
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:50,706
All my guards are 100 paces away

399
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:52,972
outside the palace

400
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:55,412
You are within 10 paces

401
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:57,543
It would seem

402
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:01,749
that today I am doomed

403
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:11,030
But I sense your hesitation

404
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:13,927
Your Majesty is perceptive

405
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:15,726
However

406
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:19,170
you too have underestimated someone.

407
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:21,206
Who?

408
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:22,501
Broken Sword

409
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:31,543
I needed to prove to them

410
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:35,188
that my sword was fast and accurate

411
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:23,037
Within 10 paces

412
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:25,036
my sword strikes with surgical precision

413
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,534
If it enters at precise pressure points

414
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:30,837
it will not cause any fatal injury

415
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,172
If one of you would take a blow

416
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,913
before witnesses, we can fool the King

417
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:42,119
Such a blow is hardly child's play

418
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:44,157
How is Sky now?

419
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:45,685
Fully recovered

420
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:48,392
His trust in your sword
was extraordinary

421
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,993
The King's security is impenetrable

422
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:52,828
There was no other way

423
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:55,730
His Imperial Guards were useless

424
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:59,572
He should have died three years ago.

425
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:00,831
What went wrong?

426
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,210
I abandoned the plan

427
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:11,983
The King must not be killed

428
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:13,853
He said that?

429
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:14,715
Yes

430
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:15,822
Why?

431
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:17,252
I also asked him

432
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:18,816
What did he say?

433
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:21,095
He would not explain that day

434
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:25,224
Broken Sword is the strongest
of the three

435
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:29,460
He and I are probably equal in skills

436
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:34,968
What he told me later

437
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,645
greatly unsettled me

438
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:39,338
While I'm alive

439
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,105
I'll stop you assassinating the King

440
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:45,815
I will help you

441
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:51,416
He let the opportunity go by

442
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:54,486
This time, we must succeed

443
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:57,294
See you tomorrow at the Qin camp

444
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:05,567
Please do me a favor

445
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,007
Help me fight Broken Sword!

446
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:20,783
Master!

447
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:28,697
What are you waiting for?

448
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:32,864
Although I had agreed to help her

449
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,933
attack from behind is dishonorable

450
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,696
so I couldn't draw my sword

451
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:40,436
But we both knew

452
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,407
if we did not stop Broken Sword

453
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,703
we would never succeed

454
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:37,716
Moon, don't!

455
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:41,855
You're no match for him. Stop

456
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:07,854
I knew this would happen

457
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:11,485
You can't stop me now

458
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:14,590
Even wounded, I will still stop you

459
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:17,894
Then I will kill you!

460
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:27,972
Did I hurt him too much?

461
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,406
Your special medicine

462
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:33,237
should heal his wounds in a day

463
01:12:34,316 --> 01:12:35,442
Have you delivered it?

464
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:38,475
I tended to the wound myself

465
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:42,018
After the battle,
carry my "Flying Snow Sword"

466
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:43,657
and follow Nameless to see the King

467
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,160
Yes

468
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,452
They won't treat a servant harshly

469
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:50,195
If the assassination succeeds

470
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,531
wave a red flag on your return

471
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:55,499
If it fails, a yellow one

472
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:58,134
If something happens to you

473
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:59,671
any message will be useless

474
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,535
I will smile from Heaven

475
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:06,809
if I see a red flag

476
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:12,737
How is Flying Snow?

477
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:14,409
She is resting

478
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:20,453
She doesn't know I've come

479
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:23,556
You said you'd stop me

480
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,551
Please abandon the mission

481
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:27,293
You know I am a man of Zhao

482
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:28,530
So am I

483
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:30,430
Doesn't Qin want to conquer Zhao?

484
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:31,897
Yes

485
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,931
Isn't the King the enemy of Zhao?

486
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:35,100
Yes

487
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:37,368
Who are you trying to defend?

488
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:39,001
You call yourself a man of Zhao?

489
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:47,337
Flying Snow has asked me that too

490
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,953
When we first met

491
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:54,751
I was living a carefree life

492
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:03,022
I fell in love with her
after our first fight.

493
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:06,296
She's the daughter of a Zhao general

494
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:09,266
who died in battle against Qin

495
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:11,104
She inherited his sword

496
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:14,001
I knew she would avenge her father

497
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:17,038
I promised to help her

498
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,540
Calligraphy and swordplay

499
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:23,942
share the same principles

500
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:26,648
We did calligraphy to
inspire our swordplay

501
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:27,978
and to heighten our powers

502
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:32,225
She knew I'd drifted since childhood

503
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:35,328
calling no place home

504
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:36,962
Once we'd killed the King, she said

505
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:40,232
she would take me to her home

506
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,004
There'd be no more swordsmen

507
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:44,731
only a man

508
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:45,929
and a woman

509
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:17,298
The essence of calligraphy
is from the soul

510
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:18,999
Swordsmanship is the same

511
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:21,833
Both aspire to truth and simplicity

512
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:24,639
Gradually I recognized a greater cause

513
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:33,678
Three years ago we perfected our skills

514
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:35,851
Flying Snow insisted on going ahead

515
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,790
Together, we stormed the palace

516
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:19,472
She asked why I had abandoned the mission

517
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,309
I told her the King must not be killed

518
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:25,742
That is what calligraphy taught me

519
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:28,441
I didn't kill the King

520
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:31,046
After that she refused to talk to me

521
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:38,719
Please abandon your plan

522
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:40,023
No

523
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,420
Was your sword forged in hatred?

524
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:43,962
Yes

525
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:45,898
For 10 years, it has never tired

526
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:49,869
I can't stop now

527
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:51,499
How can I dissuade you?

528
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:53,504
Only by killing me

529
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:55,400
Are you that determined?

530
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:56,973
Yes

531
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:00,514
Allow me to convey my conviction

532
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,043
in three words

533
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:48,923
These words express my mind

534
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:51,424
Please consider

535
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:03,667
Moon, give my sword to Master Nameless

536
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:05,837
Flying Snow and I will never part

537
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:07,273
nor will our swords

538
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:23,290
Master Nameless

539
01:23:24,299 --> 01:23:25,857
although I am just a humble servant

540
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:27,935
allow me to say a few words

541
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:32,367
I've been with my master since
I was eight

542
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:34,535
He taught me martial arts

543
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:36,367
and how to be a decent person

544
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:39,210
Whatever my master does

545
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:40,845
is for a good reason

546
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:43,548
The words he has given you

547
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:45,747
carry a deep meaning

548
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:53,217
This will be the last thing
I can do for my master.

549
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,060
Master Nameless,

550
01:23:57,599 --> 01:23:59,533
please remember his words.

551
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:13,379
Why did you want to do that?

552
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:15,682
I wanted to follow the example of my master,

553
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,519
and to persuade you with my life.

554
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:21,449
You're still young.
Life is precious.

555
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:23,850
If you must die,
you should die for a greater cause.

556
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:29,860
Be on your way.

557
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:32,764
I will remember what should be remembered.

558
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:53,443
What were the words he wrote?

559
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:54,688
"All under Heaven."

560
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:57,187
All under Heaven...

561
01:24:57,392 --> 01:24:58,256
Broken Sword said

562
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:02,196
The people
have suffered years of warfare

563
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:04,894
Only the King of Qin can stop the chaos

564
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,828
by uniting all under Heaven.

565
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,238
He asked me to abandon the assassination

566
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:13,763
for the greater good of all

567
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:17,173
He said, one person's suffering
is nothing

568
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:20,575
compared to the suffering of many

569
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:23,412
The rivalry of Zhao and Qin is trivial

570
01:25:23,918 --> 01:25:27,217
compared to the greater cause

571
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:33,828
The person who really understands me

572
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:36,758
is my most feared enemy

573
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:43,932
Alone, I have endured so much criticism

574
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:47,802
So many attempts on my life

575
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:50,307
No one understands my intentions

576
01:25:50,745 --> 01:25:53,043
Even my court officials

577
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:56,746
see me as a tyrant

578
01:25:59,387 --> 01:26:02,288
But I never imagined

579
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:04,617
that Broken Sword, my arch-enemy

580
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,090
would truly understand

581
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:11,861
and appreciate my real motives

582
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:25,476
I would like to know

583
01:26:25,713 --> 01:26:28,807
how you mean to kill me
without your sword?

584
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:30,575
By capturing yours!

585
01:26:44,566 --> 01:26:46,500
This sword has protected me

586
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:48,225
through all my battles

587
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:52,097
Having found a true confidant
in Broken Sword

588
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:55,037
even if I died,
I would be content with my life.

589
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:58,435
Let "All under Heaven"

590
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,811
guide your decision

591
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:09,742
It's just dawned on me!

592
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:11,638
This scroll of Broken Sword's

593
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:13,871
isn't about sword technique

594
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:16,607
but about swordsmanship's ultimate ideal

595
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:19,916
Swordsmanship's first achievement

596
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:21,653
is the unity of man and sword

597
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:23,915
Once this unity is attained

598
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:26,252
even a blade of grass can be a weapon

599
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:28,384
The second achievement is when

600
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:32,093
the sword exists in one's heart

601
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,700
when absent from one's hand
One can strike an enemy at 100 paces

602
01:29:34,902 --> 01:29:37,234
even with bare hands

603
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:39,873
Swordsmanship's ultimate achievement

604
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:44,338
is the absence of the sword
in both hand and heart

605
01:29:44,645 --> 01:29:45,873
The swordsman is at peace

606
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,274
with the rest of the world

607
01:29:48,883 --> 01:29:50,407
He vows not to kill

608
01:29:51,185 --> 01:29:52,652
and to bring peace to mankind

609
01:30:19,447 --> 01:30:23,543
Your Majesty,
your visions have convinced me

610
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:28,085
that you are committed to the highest ideal

611
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:30,421
of ultimate swordsmanship

612
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:33,826
Therefore I cannot kill you

613
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:40,090
Remember those who gave their lives

614
01:30:41,335 --> 01:30:43,326
for the highest ideal: Peace.

615
01:33:21,729 --> 01:33:23,629
No more killing
Nameless went within 10 paces of the King

616
01:33:24,832 --> 01:33:27,232
He could not have missed

617
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:30,663
There is only one explanation

618
01:33:31,072 --> 01:33:32,699
He must have abandoned the mission

619
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:36,310
What did you say to him?

620
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:38,267
I wrote three words

621
01:33:39,013 --> 01:33:39,980
What words?

622
01:33:40,982 --> 01:33:42,006
"All under Heaven."

623
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:47,011
That is all you care about!

624
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:47,948
And you

625
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:51,088
I don't believe you

626
01:33:51,559 --> 01:33:52,685
How can I convince you?

627
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:02,299
Draw your sword

628
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:06,131
You've misled Nameless

629
01:34:06,741 --> 01:34:09,175
You've ruined Sky
and the Kingdom of Zhao

630
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:10,440
Draw!

631
01:34:14,582 --> 01:34:16,243
When we first met...

632
01:34:18,386 --> 01:34:19,683
I had to prove myself to convince you

633
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:24,284
What can I do this time?

634
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:26,458
Just draw your sword!

635
01:35:53,314 --> 01:35:54,941
Why didn't you fend off my sword?

636
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:57,681
So that you'd believe me

637
01:36:06,026 --> 01:36:07,994
I always wanted to go home with you

638
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:14,965
Sadly, it won't happen now

639
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:21,934
Take good care of yourself

640
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:37,687
Why didn't you defend yourself?

641
01:36:46,734 --> 01:36:48,065
Why didn't you defend yourself?

642
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:00,478
Why didn't you?

643
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:15,152
No more drifting, no more roaming

644
01:38:21,695 --> 01:38:23,686
I'm taking you home now

645
01:38:26,433 --> 01:38:27,991
Our home

646
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:44,177
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

647
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:47,404
Permission to execute?

648
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:49,642
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

649
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:53,308
Permission to execute?

650
01:40:13,207 --> 01:40:16,335
He conspired to assassinate Your Majesty

651
01:40:16,543 --> 01:40:17,771
Show no mercy!

652
01:40:17,978 --> 01:40:21,505
This is the law of Qin!

653
01:40:24,485 --> 01:40:26,316
To conquer all under Heaven

654
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,579
the law must be enforced

655
01:40:28,789 --> 01:40:31,257
Set an example for the world!

656
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:35,820
Execute him! Execute him!

657
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,463
Execute him!

658
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:43,192
Execute him! Execute him!

659
01:40:43,404 --> 01:40:44,837
Execute him!

660
01:40:54,314 --> 01:40:55,303
Execute him!

661
01:42:16,864 --> 01:42:21,801
Hail! Hail! Hail!

662
01:42:24,171 --> 01:42:28,232
Hail! Hail! Hail!
