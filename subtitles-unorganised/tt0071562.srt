1
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:05,935
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!

2
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,981
They've killed your son Paolo!

3
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,441
Murderers! Murderers!

4
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,787
My son...

5
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,542
All my respect, Don Ciccio.

6
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,717
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.

7
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,678
And his oldest son Paolo...

8
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,973
...because he swore revenge.

9
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,770
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.

10
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,272
He never speaks.

11
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,733
It's not his words I'm afraid of.

12
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,905
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.

13
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,659
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.

14
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:48,746
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.

15
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,632
When he's a man, he'll
come for revenge.

16
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,596
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.

17
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,516
He's all I have left.

18
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:13,938
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!

19
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,198
Vito, run!

20
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,408
Move and I'll kill him!

21
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,911
Run, Vito!

22
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,876
Kill him!

23
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,765
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

24
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,352
You understand?

25
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,616
Anybody who hides the boy
Vito Andolini is in for trouble!

26
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,728
Vito, we're praying for you!

27
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,112
If anyone is hiding the boy
Vito Andolini...

28
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,032
...turn him over to us.

29
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,535
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!

30
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,831
It'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!

31
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:12,556
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

32
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,610
Nurse.

33
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,346
Money?

34
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,641
Interpreter!

35
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,358
Where are you from?

36
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,818
-What is your name?
-Maria.

37
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,367
What is your name?

38
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,788
Come on, son. What is your name?

39
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,877
Vito Andolini from Corleone.

40
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,297
Corleone. Vito Corleone.

41
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,425
Okay, over there.

42
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,552
Next.

43
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:09,316
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine three months.

44
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:23,706
Vito Corleone!

45
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,918
Here he is. This is him.

46
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,652
Did you bring the car keys?

47
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,490
Laurie! Laurie!

48
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:46,640
Mama!

49
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,562
-Look who's here.
-Father Carmelo.

50
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,898
-This is Father Carmelo.
-I'm Merle Johnson.

51
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,402
Mama!

52
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,574
-Here I am.
-Constanzia, after one week?

53
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:07,703
I sent the car to the airport last week
to pick you up.

54
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:13,750
It was chaos. Anyway, here I am, just
one week late. This is for my mama!

55
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:17,045
-What is this?
-You remember Merle?

56
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,882
Hello. How are you? Thank you.

57
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:25,512
Where's Michael? I've got to talk to him
and I can't wait on line.

58
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,973
You go see your children first.

59
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:33,729
Then you worry about waiting on line to
see your brother. Like everybody else.

60
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,069
Ladies and gentlemen...

61
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,449
A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.

62
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,620
Please welcome Senator Pat Geary
of the State of Nevada.

63
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,498
And there is Mrs. Geary.

64
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,093
Thank you very much.

65
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:11,975
This is a very, very happy day
for me and my wife Mrs. Geary.

66
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,687
We see Nevada far too seldom.

67
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:20,692
But today we can join with old friends,
we can make new friends

68
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:24,738
and we help celebrate
a young man's first Communion.

69
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:32,287
And also to thank that boy's family for
a magnificent contribution to the State.

70
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:38,168
I have here in my hand a check
made out to the university

71
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:43,090
and it is a magnificent endowment
in the name of

72
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,261
Anthony Vito Corleone.

73
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,431
The check is signed by
that young man's parents

74
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,351
whom I think we should recognize.

75
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:58,897
Mike, Pat, Kay, stand up, please.
Let the folks see you!

76
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,024
Folks, I want you to join me

77
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:06,863
in giving a real Nevada thank you
to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone!

78
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:18,083
We also have, as a special added
attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir

79
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:24,590
who have chosen a certain special song
and a special arrangement

80
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:28,677
to honor their host,
Mr. Michael Corleone.

81
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,345
Boys.

82
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,031
The plaque.

83
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,742
Okay, fellows, did you get that one?

84
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,703
Okay, that's good.

85
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:58,915
Now, Senator,
just you and Mrs. Corleone.

86
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,398
My lawyer Tom Hagen. Senator Geary.

87
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,610
He arranged everything
through your man Turnbull.

88
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,863
-Yes, yes.
-Sit down.

89
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:36,495
I thought that you and
I would talk alone.

90
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:43,752
I trust these men with my life, Senator.
To ask them to leave would be an insult.

91
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,838
Well, it's perfectly all right with me

92
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:51,593
but I am a blunt man and I intend
to speak very frankly to you.

93
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,762
Maybe more frankly

94
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,182
than anyone in my position
has ever talked to you before.

95
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,352
The Corleone family
has done well in Nevada.

96
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,649
You own, or control,
two major hotels in Vegas

97
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:10,278
and one in Reno.
The licenses were grandfathered in

98
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,782
so there was no problem
with the Gaming Commission.

99
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,745
Now my sources tell me

100
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,916
that you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

101
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,046
They tell me that within a week,
you're going to move Klingman out.

102
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:33,927
Quite an expansion. However, it will
leave you with a little technical problem.

103
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,307
The license will still be
in Klingman's name.

104
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:45,147
-Turnbull is a good man.
-Yeah, well, let's cut out the bullshit.

105
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,400
I don't want to spend
more time here than I have to.

106
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,944
You can have the license.

107
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,905
The price is 250,000 dollars.

108
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,658
Plus five per cent of the gross monthly

109
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:01,246
of all four hotels, Mr. Corleone.

110
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:09,755
The price for the license
is less than 20,000 dollars, right?

111
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,257
That's right.

112
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:17,888
-Why would I pay more than that?
-Because I intend to squeeze you.

113
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,599
I don't like your kind of people.

114
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:26,229
I don't like to see you come out
to this clean country in oily hair

115
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,690
dressed up in those silk suits

116
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:32,694
and try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.

117
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:38,450
I'll do business with you, but the fact is
that I despise your masquerade,

118
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:44,039
the dishonest way you pose yourself
and your whole fucking family.

119
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,381
Senator,

120
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,552
we're both part of the same hypocrisy.

121
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,557
But never think it applies to my family.

122
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,685
All right, all right.

123
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:11,650
Some people have to play little games.
You play yours.

124
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:17,823
Let's say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest.

125
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,994
I want your answer and the money
by noon tomorrow. One more thing.

126
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,665
Don't you contact me again, ever.

127
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,585
From now on you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.

128
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,923
Senator, you can have my answer now
if you like.

129
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,345
My offer is this...

130
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,097
Nothing.

131
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:49,437
Not even the fee for the gaming license,
which I would like you to put up.

132
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,153
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

133
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,534
Ladies! I didn't know you were out here.

134
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,704
-Honey, we have to go.
-Really? I'm sorry.

135
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,207
-It's been delightful.
-It was our pleasure.

136
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,960
It was wonderful talking to you.

137
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:01,676
Fredo! Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch,
you look great!

138
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,762
Frank Pentangeli!

139
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,973
I thought you was
never coming out west, you big bum!

140
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,727
I've got to check on my boys.

141
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,855
-What's with the food here?
-What's the matter?

142
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:19,819
A kid gives me a Ritz cracker
with chopped liver and says, "canapés”.

143
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:25,200
I said, "Can of peas, my ass. That's
a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"

144
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,623
Bring out the peppers and sardines!

145
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,543
Seeing you reminds me of New York
in the old days!

146
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:42,217
You remember Willi Cicci, who was
with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?

147
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,973
We were all upset about that.
Heart attack, huh?

148
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,142
No, that was no heart attack.

149
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:55,480
That's what I'm here to see
your brother Mike about.

150
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,566
-But what's with him?
-What do you mean?

151
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:04,072
Do I have to get a letter of introduction
to get a sit-down?

152
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,785
-You can't get in to see Mike?
-He's got me waiting in a lobby!

153
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,542
-Johnny Ola.
-Al Neri.

154
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,386
-Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen?
-I remember Tom from the old days.

155
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,054
Rocco.

156
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:32,100
-What's this?
-It's an orange from Miami.

157
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,228
Take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.

158
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,312
Johnny?

159
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:43,611
Tom won't stay. He only handles
specific areas of the business.

160
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,573
Sure, Mike.

161
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,872
-What are you drinking, Johnny?
-Anisette.

162
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:04,466
-If you need anything, I'll be outside.
-Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom.

163
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:13,808
-I just left Mr. Roth in Miami.
-How is his health?

164
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,810
It's not good.

165
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,522
Can I do anything or send anything?

166
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:24,486
He appreciates your concern, Michael,
and your respect.

167
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,488
That casino...

168
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:31,242
Registered owners. Jacob Lawrence,
Allan Barclay. Beverly Hills attorneys.

169
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,913
The real owners are
the old Lakeville Road group

170
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,290
and our friend in Miami.

171
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:43,755
Klingman runs it and owns a piece of
it too, but I've been instructed to tell you

172
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,884
that if you move him out,
our friend in Miami will go along.

173
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:54,849
It's very kind of him.
Tell him it's greatly appreciated.

174
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:59,896
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.

175
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,026
One by one, our old friends are gone.

176
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:08,863
Death, natural or not,

177
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,699
prison, deported...

178
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:18,206
Only Hyman Roth is left, because he
always made money for his partners.

179
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:25,797
I can't believe it! Out of 30 professional
musicians there isn't one Italian!

180
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,591
Let's have a tarantella!

181
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,349
You! Up, up, up!

182
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:50,655
Questa mano!

183
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:59,414
What the hell have we here?

184
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:16,097
-I'll see my sister alone.
-It concerns me too. May I stay?

185
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:20,351
How are you, honey? You've met
Merle, he was with me in Vegas.

186
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,605
-I saw him with you.
-Could I have a drink?

187
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,528
Al, please get him a drink!

188
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:36,618
We're going to Europe. I'd like to book
passage on The Queen.

189
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,537
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

190
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,624
We're getting married first.

191
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:54,510
The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet,
and you're getting married?

192
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:59,140
You see your children on weekends.

193
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:04,395
Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno
for a theft you don't even know about.

194
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,857
You fly around the world
with men who use you!

195
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:10,485
-You're not my father!
-So why come to me?

196
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,986
I need money.

197
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,169
Connie, Connie, Connie...

198
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,178
I want to be reasonable with you.

199
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,182
Why don't you stay with the family?

200
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,978
You can live on the estate
with your kids.

201
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:48,731
You won't be deprived of anything.

202
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:58,658
I don't know this Merle. I don't know
what he does or what he lives on.

203
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:05,206
Tell him marriage is out of the question
and you don't want to see him anymore.

204
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,500
He'll understand, believe me.

205
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,593
Connie.

206
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:23,224
If you don't listen to me
and marry this man,

207
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,440
you'll disappoint me.

208
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:06,225
-Famiglia!
-Cent' anni!

209
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,020
What's "Chen dannay"?

210
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,023
"Cent' anni". It means 100 years.

211
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:16,444
It means we should all live happily
for 100 years. The family.

212
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,573
-It would be true if my father were alive.
-Connie.

213
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,283
Hey...

214
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:26,162
Merle, you've met my sister-in-law,
Deanna.

215
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,914
-Fredo's wife.
-My pleasure.

216
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:42,470
With all respect, I didn't
come here to eat dinner!

217
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,722
I know, I know.

218
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:20,174
-I just want to dance!
-You're falling all over the floor.

219
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:24,095
You're just jealous
because he's a real man!

220
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:28,975
-I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.
-You couldn't belt your mama!

221
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,020
These Dagos are crazy
when it comes to their wives.

222
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:38,025
Michael says that if you can't
take care of this, I have to.

223
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,028
-I think you'd better.
-Never marry a Wop.

224
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:46,701
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop. Don't!

225
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:52,999
What are you doing to me,
you big slob? Help!

226
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,292
Fredo!

227
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:59,213
-I can't control her, Mikey.
-You're my brother, don't apologize.

228
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:07,221
Clemenza promised the Rosato
brothers three territories after he died.

229
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,806
You took over and didn't give it to them.

230
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,141
I welched.

231
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:14,687
Clemenza promised them lu cazzo.
He promised them nothing.

232
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:20,401
-He hated them more than I do.
-Frankie, they feel cheated.

233
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:25,490
You're sitting up in the Sierra Mountains
and you're drinking...

234
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,909
-What's he drinking?
-Champagne.

235
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:33,039
Champagne cocktails, and passing
judgment on how I run my family.

236
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,084
Your family's still called Corleone.

237
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,339
And you'll run it like a Corleone.

238
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:45,426
My family doesn't eat here,
doesn't eat in Las Vegas...

239
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,595
...and doesn't eat in Miami...

240
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,764
...with Hyman Roth!

241
00:30:56,104 --> 00:31:00,650
You're a good old man and I like you.

242
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,152
You were loyal to my father for years.

243
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,783
The Rosato brothers
are taking hostages.

244
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:15,873
They spit right in my face, all because
they're backed up by that Jew in Miami.

245
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,834
I know. That's why
I don't want them touched.

246
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,755
-Not touched?
-No, I want you to be fair with them.

247
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:27,885
You want me to be fair with them?
How can you be fair to animals?

248
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:34,183
Tom, listen. They recruit spics,
they recruit niggers.

249
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,062
They do violence in their grandmothers'
neighborhoods!

250
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:44,652
And everything with them is whores!
And junk, dope!

251
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,363
And they leave the gambling to last.

252
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:52,702
I want to run my family without you
on my back. I want those Rosatos dead!

253
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,621
-No.
-Morte.

254
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:05,965
I have business that's important with
Hyman Roth. I don't want it disturbed.

255
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:12,138
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew
before your own blood.

256
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,186
You know my father did business
with Hyman Roth. He respected him.

257
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:24,066
Your father did business with
Hyman Roth, he respected Hyman Roth,

258
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:27,403
but he never trusted Hyman Roth

259
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:31,032
or his Sicilian messenger boy,
Johnny Ola.

260
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:36,662
You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired,
and I'm a little drunk!

261
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:43,794
I want everybody here to know, there's
not going to be no trouble from me!

262
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,088
Don Corleone.

263
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,257
Cicci, the door...

264
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,851
You want him to leave now?

265
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:05,900
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.

266
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,570
The old man had too much wine.

267
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,077
It's late.

268
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,757
How's the baby?

269
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:34,220
-Sleeping inside me.
-Does it feel like a boy?

270
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,473
Yes, it does, Michael.

271
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,519
Kay?

272
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:46,190
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.

273
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,651
It couldn't be helped, though.

274
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,946
It made me think
of what you once told me.

275
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,035
"In five years the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate."

276
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,038
That was seven years ago.

277
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:07,294
I know. I'm trying, darling.

278
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,028
Did you see this?

279
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,752
Why are the drapes open?

280
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,323
Kay, are you all right?

281
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,076
-Are you hit?
-No.

282
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,705
It's all right.

283
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,501
Stop! Stop!

284
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,796
Halt!

285
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:28,561
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.

286
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,813
-Keep them alive.
-We'll try.

287
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,439
Alive!

288
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,651
Stay by the door.

289
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,066
Yeah, come in.

290
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,034
-Mike, are you all right?
-Yeah.

291
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:14,166
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.

292
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,296
And I know that's upset you in the past.

293
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:24,593
You felt it was because of
some lack of trust or confidence.

294
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:30,683
But it's because I admire you
and love you

295
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:33,602
that I kept things secret from you.

296
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,232
Now you're the only one I can trust.

297
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,945
Fredo?

298
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,572
Well, he's got a good heart.

299
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:50,244
But he's weak and he's stupid,
and this is life and death.

300
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,289
Tom, you're my brother.

301
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:05,175
I always wanted to be thought of as
a brother by you, Mikey. A real brother.

302
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,638
I know that.

303
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,022
You're going to take over.

304
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,316
You're going to be the Don.

305
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:29,742
If what I think has happened,
has happened, I'm leaving here tonight.

306
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:36,665
I give you complete power. Over Fredo
and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone.

307
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:42,046
I'm trusting you
with the lives of my wife

308
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,132
and my children,
the future of this family.

309
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:53,474
-If we catch them, will we find out...
-We won't catch them.

310
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,979
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

311
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:03,776
They were killed by somebody
close to us.

312
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:08,489
Inside. Very, very frightened
that they botched it.

313
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:13,160
You don't think that Rocco and Neri
had something to do with this?

314
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:20,709
See... All our people are businessmen.

315
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,506
Their loyalty is based on that.

316
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,511
One thing I learned from Pop

317
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:35,349
was to try to think
as people around you think.

318
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,312
On that basis, anything is possible.

319
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:46,026
Mike, they're dead!
Right outside my window!

320
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:49,363
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!

321
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,210
Over here! There's two of them.

322
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:07,548
Looks like they were hired
out of New York. I don't recognize them.

323
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,968
Won't get anything out of them now.

324
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,220
Fish them out.

325
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,038
Get rid of the bodies.

326
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:43,083
-Where's Mike?
-Rocco.

327
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:18,577
Anthony, everything is going to be
all right. Try to sleep.

328
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:39,264
-Did you like your party?
-I got lots of presents.

329
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:42,768
I know. Did you like them?

330
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:46,230
Yeah. I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

331
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:49,566
Well, they were friends.

332
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:55,822
-Did you see my present for you?
-It was on my pillow.

333
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:01,495
I'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.

334
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,667
-Will you take me?
-No, I can't, Anthony.

335
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:11,672
-Why do you have to go?
-I have to do business.

336
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,467
I could help you.

337
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,931
I know. Some day you will.

338
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,309
Get some sleep.

339
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,889
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.

340
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:08,747
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.

341
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:22,010
I left Naples. I left Mama.

342
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,180
For a no-good tramp!

343
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:31,520
Now here I am in America,
in New York.

344
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,983
Alone! Thinking of my mother.

345
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,154
Without news from home.

346
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:52,165
Finally, a letter from Naples!

347
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:58,046
Vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?

348
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,924
She's very beautiful.

349
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:06,430
To you, she's beautiful. For me,
there's only my wife and son.

350
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,015
Our dear mother -

351
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,353
...is dead!

352
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,913
We'll go backstage later
and take her to eat.

353
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,336
Sit down, you bum!

354
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,094
Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.

355
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:38,271
We'll go see her backstage.

356
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:42,817
Who was that?

357
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,362
The Black Hand.

358
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,355
That's Fanucci...the Black Hand.

359
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,816
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

360
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,028
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!

361
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:29,698
You'll pay me today!

362
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,668
Let's go.

363
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:47,090
Not my daughter! Let her go!

364
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,677
Here, take all my money!

365
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,354
Vito, come on.

366
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,072
I know what you're thinking. But
you don't know how things are.

367
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:15,076
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.

368
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:17,537
Even my father, in the grocery store.

369
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,039
If he's Italian...

370
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,543
...why does he bother other Italians?

371
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:26,046
He knows they have nobody
to protect them.

372
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,298
Forget that. Did you like my angel?

373
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,258
If you're happy, I'm happy.

374
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,350
Don't you feel well?

375
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,231
Is your boss treating you all right?

376
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,984
Forget it.

377
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:45,917
Hey, you speak Italian?

378
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,007
Hide this for me!

379
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,677
Next week I'll come and get it!

380
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,677
Abbandando, meet my nephew!

381
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,684
How's business?

382
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,901
It's good, it's good.

383
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,952
Fanucci's mad. Says the
neighborhood's getting sloppy.

384
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:07,123
People don't pay on time,
don't pay the full amount.

385
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,542
Says he's been too nice to everyone.

386
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,675
So Fanucci's changing?

387
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,553
Sure. He wants double
from everybody.

388
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,723
Even from my father.

389
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,811
I'm a friend, right? So you'll
let him work here?

390
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,178
I've got some bad news.

391
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,935
I feel rotten about telling you this...

392
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:15,775
But Fanucci...he's got a nephew...

393
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,410
And you have to give him my job.

394
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,664
You've always been good to me,
ever since I came here.

395
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:33,001
You looked after me like a father.

396
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,878
I thank you.

397
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,464
And I won't forget it.

398
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,813
Vito!

399
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,736
Oh, no!

400
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,197
Take this to your family.

401
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,911
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.

402
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,073
What a nice pear!

403
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:11,099
I'm Clemenza, you still
have my goods?

404
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:16,229
Did you look inside?

405
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,608
I'm not interested in things
that don't concern me.

406
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:36,249
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.

407
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,801
Sure she would. But who has
money for a rug?

408
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:52,348
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.

409
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,525
Yeah, sure.

410
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,610
My wife would like it.

411
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,554
That son of a bitch! He isn't home!

412
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,435
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.

413
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:44,192
Well, he won't mind.

414
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:56,871
Come on in.

415
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:01,084
Hey, Vito, come on in!

416
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,024
This is your friend's place?

417
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,695
This is a real palace.

418
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,906
One of the best.

419
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,540
Vito, give me a hand, will you?

420
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:40,034
Look how pretty it is, Santino!

421
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:09,975
Come on in.

422
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:15,356
It's all right. Hyman's in there.

423
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,319
-Would you like a tuna sandwich?
-No, thank you.

424
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:30,371
...pick up of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...

425
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:35,209
-Mr. Roth?
-Come in, Michael.

426
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:39,713
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

427
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,634
It's almost over.

428
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:50,266
-Do you follow the football game?
-Not for a while I haven't.

429
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:53,936
I enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.

430
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:59,108
One of the things I love
about this country. Baseball too.

431
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:06,449
Ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1919.

432
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,372
I heard you had some trouble.

433
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:17,918
Stupid.

434
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:22,047
People behaving like that with guns.

435
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:26,719
The important thing is you're all right.

436
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,930
Good health is the most important thing.

437
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:33,809
More than success, more than money.

438
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,021
More than power.

439
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:55,372
I came here because
there's going to be more bloodshed.

440
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,543
I wanted you to know,
so another war won't start.

441
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:03,714
Nobody wants another war.

442
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:09,637
Frank Pentangeli asked my permission
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

443
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:13,516
When I refused he tried to have me
killed. He was stupid, I was lucky.

444
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,601
I'll visit him soon.

445
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:20,523
The important thing is that nothing
interferes with our plans for the future.

446
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:24,109
Nothing is more important.

447
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:31,075
-You're a wise and considerate man.
-And you're a great man, Mr. Roth.

448
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:36,997
-There's much I can learn from you.
-Whatever I can do to help, Michael.

449
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,919
-Excuse me. Lunch.
-Come in.

450
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:46,840
-Thank you, my dear.
-You're going to break your eardrums.

451
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,344
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you.

452
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:58,727
You're young, I'm old and sick.

453
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:03,816
What we'll do in the next few months
will make history.

454
01:05:05,986 --> 01:05:07,987
It's never been done before.

455
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:12,741
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

456
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:19,290
Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?

457
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:23,669
He's small potatoes.

458
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,848
What's up?

459
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:40,603
We got company?

460
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:55,701
What's going on?

461
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,870
Michael Corleone is here.

462
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,290
Where is he?

463
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,208
He's in your den. You better hurry.

464
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,961
He's been waiting a half hour.

465
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:15,346
Is something wrong?

466
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:23,228
I wish you would have let me know
you were coming.

467
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:27,232
-I could have prepared something.
-I didn't want you to know.

468
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:38,827
-You heard what happened?
-I almost died. We were so relieved...

469
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:41,080
In my home!

470
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:47,002
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!

471
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:52,132
Where my children come to play.

472
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:55,844
In my home.

473
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:15,823
I want you to help me take my revenge.

474
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:19,576
Michael, anything. What can I do?

475
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:26,041
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

476
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:28,711
I don't understand. I don't...

477
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:33,799
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.

478
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:38,679
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.

479
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:43,559
-I know he is.
-So why ask me to lay down to them?

480
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:52,776
It was Hyman Roth
that tried to have me killed.

481
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:57,072
I know it was him.

482
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,200
Jesus Christ, Mike.

483
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:05,080
Jesus Christ, let's get them all.
Now while we've got the muscle.

484
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:13,046
This used to be my father's old study.

485
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,508
It's changed.

486
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:21,680
I remember there used to be
a big desk here.

487
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:30,063
I remember when I was a kid. We had
to be quiet when we played near here.

488
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:41,366
I was very happy that this house
never went to strangers.

489
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:46,455
First Clemenza took it over. Now you.

490
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:52,795
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.

491
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:03,222
He taught me, "Keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer."

492
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:09,478
If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
in this, in the Rosato brothers' favor,

493
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:13,023
he'll think his relationship with me
is still good.

494
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:18,278
That's what I want him to think.

495
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:23,116
I want him relaxed and confident
in our friendship.

496
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:27,746
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

497
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:58,735
-Yeah?
-Fredo, this is Johnny Ola.

498
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:03,282
-We need some more help.
-Johnny?

499
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:07,244
Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?

500
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:10,122
-Who's that, honey?
-Listen good, Fredo.

501
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:13,500
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.

502
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:17,045
Pentangeli is going to accept
the Rosato brothers' deal.

503
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,298
-Oh, God.
-Will he come alone?

504
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:22,634
I don't know. You've got me in
deep enough already.

505
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:27,973
Everything will be all right. Pentangeli
says he's willing to make a deal.

506
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:32,561
All we want to know is if he's on
the level, or if he'll bring his boys.

507
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:35,856
You lied to me. I don't want you
to call me anymore.

508
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:40,903
-Your brother won't find out we talked.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

509
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:55,334
-Who was that?
-Wrong number.

510
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:06,720
-Frankie, I've got nobody here.
-Wait in the car, Cicc'.

511
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:09,514
-Frankie.
-That's okay, Cicc'.

512
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:20,817
-What's this?
-A lucky C note for our new deal.

513
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:26,323
Ritchie. Give us a taste.

514
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,498
We were all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

515
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:38,877
-You won't regret it.
-I don't like the C note, Rosato.

516
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:41,630
I take that as an insult.

517
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,716
Michael Corleone says hello!

518
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:04,236
Close the door!

519
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,363
Your friend the cop...

520
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:11,034
Hey, Ritch. It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?

521
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:14,955
I just came in to clean up a little,
you know?

522
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,376
What's the matter?

523
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:22,546
-Is that something on the floor?
-Carmine, not here!

524
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:24,131
Anthony!

525
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:31,096
You open this bar
and I'll blow your head in!

526
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,269
Freddy, it's good to see you.

527
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:26,443
-How is he?
-He's okay. He's in the back.

528
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:32,657
Girls, take a hike.

529
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,829
In this room here.

530
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:44,211
-I want to talk to him alone first.
-Come on.

531
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,680
I thought I could help you, Senator.

532
01:13:59,519 --> 01:14:01,353
Hagen?

533
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,691
-Listen, I did not...
-It's all right.

534
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:11,613
-I didn't do anything.
-It's okay. You're very lucky.

535
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:17,077
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.

536
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:22,207
Had this happened some place else,
we couldn't have helped you.

537
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:28,463
When I woke up, I was on the floor.

538
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:33,802
-And I don't know how it happened.
-You can't remember?

539
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,224
I passed out.

540
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:58,451
Just a game. Jesus.

541
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:11,464
Jesus, Jesus!

542
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,180
Jesus God!

543
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,890
God!

544
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:26,521
I don't know, and I don't understand
why I can't remember.

545
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:29,816
Doesn't matter, just do as I say.

546
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:35,405
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.

547
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:41,161
You decided to spend the night at
Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.

548
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:45,874
-As his guest.
-I do remember that she was laughing.

549
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:53,632
We'd done it before, and I know
that I could not have hurt that girl.

550
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:58,553
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.

551
01:15:58,638 --> 01:16:01,640
It'll be as though she never existed.

552
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,937
All that's left is our friendship.

553
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:25,205
-Yes?
-Sorry, but we're not to let you through.

554
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:30,585
-I'm just going to the market.
-We'll pick up anything you want.

555
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:33,755
-Whose orders are these?
-Mr. Hagen's. He's coming.

556
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:36,299
I'll speak to him.

557
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:45,684
I wanted to explain,
but I had business in Carson City.

558
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:50,188
It's Michael's request for your safety.
We'll get anything you need.

559
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:55,610
-So I'm supposed to stay in my house?
-No, within the compound will be fine.

560
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:58,655
-We were going to New England.
-That's off.

561
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:02,617
-Am I a prisoner?
-That's not how we see it, Kay.

562
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:06,830
Come on, kids.
We're going back to the house.

563
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,208
Joe.

564
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,714
Cuba, Cuba!

565
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:41,841
Most respected gentlemen.

566
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:44,135
Welcome to Havana.

567
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:51,434
I want to thank this distinguished group
of American industrialists

568
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:56,106
for continuing to work with Cuba

569
01:18:56,816 --> 01:18:59,984
for the greatest period of prosperity

570
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:03,655
in her entire history.

571
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:06,074
Mr. William Shaw,

572
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,993
representing
the General Fruit Company.

573
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:11,996
Messrs. Corngold and Dant,

574
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:15,834
of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company.

575
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:18,628
Mr. Petty,

576
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:22,674
Regional Vice President of
the Pan American Mining Corporation.

577
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,345
Mr. Robert Allen
of South American Sugar.

578
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:31,558
Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada,

579
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:37,730
representing our associates
in tourism and leisure activities.

580
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:41,443
And my old friend and associate
from Florida,

581
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,904
Mr. Hyman Roth.

582
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:50,368
I would like to thank United Telephone
and Telegraph for their Christmas gift.

583
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,876
A solid gold telephone.

584
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:03,756
Perhaps you gentlemen
would like to look at it.

585
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,384
-Mr. President?
-Yes?

586
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:12,140
Could you discuss the rebel activity and
what this can mean to our businesses?

587
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,850
-Of course.
-Heavy stuff.

588
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:19,606
I assure you that, although the rebels
have started a campaign in Las Villas,

589
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:32,035
my staff indicates, with assurance,
that we'll drive them out of Santa Clara

590
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:34,162
before the New Year.

591
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:37,957
I want to put you all at ease.

592
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:43,046
We will tolerate no guerrillas
in the casinos or the swimming pools.

593
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,525
He said that they're making an arrest,

594
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:06,361
and in a few minutes
he'll let us through.

595
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:07,529
Johnny...

596
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:08,655
It's nothing.

597
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:12,116
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.

598
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:16,663
Viva Fidel!

599
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:37,350
I hope my age is correct.
I'm always accurate about my age.

600
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:42,355
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.

601
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:48,027
I'm very pleased

602
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:52,740
you're all able to come from
such distances to be with me today.

603
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:57,161
When a man comes
to this point in his life,

604
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:01,916
he wants to turn over
the things he's been blessed with.

605
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:07,130
Turn them over to friends,
as a reward for the friends he's had

606
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:13,636
and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

607
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:16,389
-Not for years.
-Hear, hear!

608
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:20,685
We'll see. The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

609
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:26,941
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana

610
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:30,111
and there's no limit
to where we can go from here.

611
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:34,949
This kind of government knows
how to help business, to encourage it.

612
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:39,078
The hotels here are bigger
and swankier

613
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:41,539
than any of the joints in Vegas.

614
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:45,126
We can thank our friends
in the Cuban government

615
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:49,964
which has put up half the cash with the
Teamsters, on a dollar for dollar basis

616
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:52,884
and has relaxed restrictions on imports.

617
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:57,430
What I'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed...

618
01:22:57,514 --> 01:23:00,308
Real partnership with a government.

619
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,393
Smaller piece.

620
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:08,024
You all know Michael Corleone
and we all remember his father.

621
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:11,819
At the time of my retirement, or death,

622
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:17,825
I turn over all my interests
in the Havana operation to his control.

623
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:21,746
But, all of you will share.

624
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:25,708
The Nacionale will go
to the Lakeville Road Boys,

625
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:29,170
the Capri to the Corleone family,

626
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:31,673
the Sevilla Biltmore also,

627
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:35,343
but Eddie Levine will bring in the
Pennino brothers,

628
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:37,679
Dino and Eddie, for a piece

629
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:40,515
and to handle the casino operations.

630
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:44,060
We've saved a piece
for some friends in Nevada

631
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:47,897
to make sure that things go smoothly
back home.

632
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:55,029
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
So, enjoy!

633
01:23:55,114 --> 01:23:57,573
-Happy birthday!
-L'chaim!

634
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:01,536
I saw an interesting thing happen today.

635
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:05,998
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police.

636
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:10,545
Rather than be taken alive, he exploded
a grenade he had in his jacket.

637
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:14,215
He killed himself and took a captain
of the command with him.

638
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:18,136
-Those rebels are lunatics.
-Maybe so.

639
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:24,726
But it occurred to me, that the soldiers
are paid to fight, the rebels aren't.

640
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:28,604
-What does that tell you?
-They can win.

641
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:34,652
This country has had rebels
for 50 years. It's in their blood.

642
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:38,531
I know, I've been coming here
since the Twenties.

643
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:42,410
We were running molasses
from Havana when you were a baby.

644
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,079
The trucks were owned by your father.

645
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:47,790
Michael.

646
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:59,010
I'd rather we talked about this
when we're alone.

647
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:03,765
The two million never got to the island.

648
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:12,523
It mustn't be known
that you held back the money

649
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:15,109
because you worried about the rebels.

650
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:25,203
Sit down, Michael. Sit down.

651
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:36,672
If I could only live to see it,
to be there with you.

652
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:43,387
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.

653
01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:49,477
Here we are, protected. Free to make
our profits without Kefauver,

654
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:53,314
the goddamn Justice Department
and the FBI.

655
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:57,568
90 miles away, in partnership
with a friendly government.

656
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:02,198
90 miles. It's nothing.

657
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:08,412
Just one small step for a man looking
to be President of the United States

658
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:12,083
and having the cash
to make it possible.

659
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,043
Michael,

660
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:18,339
we're bigger than U.S. Steel.

661
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:48,119
Mikey, how are you? Okay?

662
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:54,125
-Hi! Freddy Corleone.
-Mio frati.

663
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:57,420
Jesus Christ, what a trip!

664
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,132
I thought, "What if somebody knows
what I've got in here".

665
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:06,053
Can you imagine that? Two million
dollars on the seat next to me.

666
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:12,101
-Excuse me.
-It's okay.

667
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:15,938
You want to count it?

668
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:23,946
What's going on? I'm totally in the dark.

669
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:28,826
The family is making an investment in
Havana. This is a gift for the President.

670
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:33,331
That's great! Havana's great.

671
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:37,001
It's my kind of town.

672
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:43,049
-Anybody I know in Havana?
-Don't know. Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?

673
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:48,638
No. I've never met them.

674
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:56,270
Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of...

675
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:04,695
Kind of nervous from the trip.
Can I get a drink or something?

676
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:08,032
I thought maybe we'd go out together.

677
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:12,244
I know a place where
we can spend some time together.

678
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:18,876
Sometimes I think I should have
married a woman like you did. Like Kay.

679
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,797
Have kids. Have a family.

680
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:28,886
For once in my life, be more like

681
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,430
Pop.

682
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:38,354
It's not easy to be a son, Fredo.
It's not easy.

683
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:41,649
Mama used to say,
"You don't belong to me."

684
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:45,277
"You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies."

685
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:47,488
Sometimes I think it's true.

686
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:50,574
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

687
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:55,746
Mikey, I was mad at you.

688
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:07,008
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?

689
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:09,760
You want a drink, right? Waiter!

690
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:16,017
Por favor...

691
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:20,271
-How do you say Banana Daiquiri?
-Banana Daiquiri.

692
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:22,732
-That's it?
-That's it.

693
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:24,900
Uno Banana Daiquiri

694
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:28,195
and a club soda.

695
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:38,706
Senator Geary flies in from Washington
tomorrow

696
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:41,333
with some government people.

697
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:45,087
I want you to show them
a good time in Havana.

698
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:51,093
-That's my specialty, right?
-Can I trust you with something?

699
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:54,305
Of course, Mike.

700
01:29:56,475 --> 01:30:00,227
Later in the evening we're all invited
to the Presidential Palace

701
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:02,063
to bring in the New Year.

702
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:08,235
After it's over they'll take me home
in a military car, alone.

703
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,071
For my protection.

704
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:14,700
Before I reach my hotel,
I'll be assassinated.

705
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:35,638
-Who?
-Roth.

706
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,355
It was Roth who tried to kill me
in my home.

707
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:48,609
It was Roth all along.

708
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:52,696
He acts like I'm his son, his successor.

709
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:56,909
But he thinks he'll live forever
and wants me out.

710
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:06,418
-How can I help?
-Just go along, as if you know nothing.

711
01:31:06,503 --> 01:31:09,213
-I've already made my move.
-What move?

712
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:12,883
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.

713
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:34,321
You're to take it easy,
he'll be back tomorrow.

714
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:36,782
Fly in my own doctor from Miami.

715
01:31:36,867 --> 01:31:39,285
I don't trust a doctor
who can't speak English.

716
01:31:40,787 --> 01:31:43,664
-Gracias, señor.
-Buenas noches.

717
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:49,211
-Honey, go to the casino.
-If you're feeling better.

718
01:31:49,379 --> 01:31:51,046
Feel fine.

719
01:31:52,883 --> 01:31:57,052
-Play the bingo game.
-Okay. Nice to see you, Mr. Paul.

720
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:04,560
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought
a bag full of money. Where is it?

721
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:13,611
-You're pulling out?
-Just want to... Just want to wait.

722
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:20,701
-How do you feel?
-Terrible.

723
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:24,455
I'd give four million to be able to take
a painless piss.

724
01:32:25,081 --> 01:32:30,836
-Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
-The Rosato brothers.

725
01:32:31,004 --> 01:32:34,173
I know, but who gave the go-ahead?

726
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:36,717
I know I didn't.

727
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:49,730
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.

728
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:56,362
Sort of looked up to me, you know.
We did our first work together.

729
01:32:56,446 --> 01:33:00,282
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good.

730
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:06,163
During Prohibition
we ran molasses into Canada.

731
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:09,333
Made a fortune. Your father, too.

732
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:17,007
As much as anyone,
I loved him and trusted him.

733
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:25,641
Later on he had an idea to build a city

734
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:29,520
out of a desert stop-over
for G.I.s going to the West Coast.

735
01:33:31,398 --> 01:33:35,150
That kid's name was Moe Greene

736
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:38,904
and the city he invented was Las Vegas.

737
01:33:40,323 --> 01:33:42,783
This was a great man.

738
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:45,286
A man of vision and guts.

739
01:33:45,412 --> 01:33:51,625
And there isn't even a plaque,
signpost or statue of him in that town.

740
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:57,256
Someone put a bullet through his eye.

741
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:00,801
No one knows who gave the order.

742
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:05,097
When I heard it, I wasn't angry.

743
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:11,145
I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong.
Talking loud, saying stupid things.

744
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:16,066
So when he turned up dead, I let it go.

745
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:20,988
And I said to myself,

746
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:25,075
"This is the business we've chosen."

747
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:27,411
I didn't ask

748
01:34:27,954 --> 01:34:33,167
who gave the order, because it had
nothing to do with business.

749
01:34:41,718 --> 01:34:46,221
That two million in a bag in your room...

750
01:34:48,475 --> 01:34:52,144
I'm going in to take a nap.

751
01:34:52,771 --> 01:34:58,067
When I wake, if the money
is on the table, I know I have a partner.

752
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:01,779
If it isn't, I know I don't.

753
01:35:56,793 --> 01:36:00,963
Does everybody know everybody?
You know Senator Geary.

754
01:36:01,131 --> 01:36:04,299
Good to see you, Mike.
I'm glad we spend this time together.

755
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:07,344
Senator Payton from Florida...

756
01:36:07,637 --> 01:36:10,806
Judge DeMalco from New York...

757
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:13,809
Senator Ream from Maryland...

758
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:16,437
Fred Corngold from UTT.

759
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:20,441
-That Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha!
-He does?

760
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,901
Gentlemen, it's refill time!

761
01:36:22,986 --> 01:36:27,448
You might try some of the local drinks.
Cuba Libre, Piña Colada...

762
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:31,410
I think I'll try
one of those redheaded Yolandas.

763
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:34,329
-That you got! Con gusto...
-Johnny!

764
01:36:35,498 --> 01:36:39,084
You don't know my brother Fredo.
Johnny Ola, Fredo.

765
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:42,880
-We never met. Johnny Ola.
-Pleasure.

766
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:46,550
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana!

767
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:48,343
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

768
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:51,430
-Feliz Año Nuevo!
-Happy New Year.

769
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:07,237
-Hey, Freddy, why are we standing?
-Everybody stands.

770
01:37:07,405 --> 01:37:11,992
-It's worth it. You won't believe this.
-I don't believe it already.

771
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:15,245
-50 dollars, right?
-You've got a bet, mister.

772
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:24,922
That's Superman.

773
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:01,166
Did I tell you or did I tell you?

774
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:05,504
-I don't believe it!
-It's got to be fake.

775
01:38:05,672 --> 01:38:08,966
It's real. That's why
he's called Superman.

776
01:38:09,467 --> 01:38:13,512
Hey, Freddy, where did you find
this place?

777
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:18,016
Johnny Ola brought me here. I didn't
believe it, but seeing is believing!

778
01:38:18,101 --> 01:38:21,562
-I see it, but still don't believe it!
-50 bucks, Pat.

779
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:25,232
Roth won't go here,
but Johnny knows these places!

780
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:31,113
-Watch, he'll break a cracker with it.
-I want to see him break a brick!

781
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:56,448
Relax, we're taking you to the hospital.

782
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:47,999
...and you'll continue to get those.

783
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:52,587
I don't believe that President
Eisenhower would ever pull out of Cuba

784
01:40:52,672 --> 01:40:56,383
as we have over one billion dollars
invested in this country.

785
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:03,181
The American public
believe in non-intervention...

786
01:41:03,266 --> 01:41:06,184
Fredo! Where are you going?

787
01:41:06,269 --> 01:41:09,896
I'm getting a real drink,
because I can't...

788
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:08,997
What kept Mr. Roth?
I understood he was coming.

789
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:12,626
Reeves, what's the protocol?
How long should we stay?

790
01:42:14,045 --> 01:42:18,965
I think a half hour ought to do it. Just
long enough to bring in the New Year.

791
01:42:34,398 --> 01:42:37,734
It's New Year's Eve. Come on,
just for a minute.

792
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:56,813
There's a plane waiting to take us
to Miami in an hour.

793
01:43:56,981 --> 01:43:59,608
Don't make a big thing about it.

794
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:06,823
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.

795
01:44:08,326 --> 01:44:10,118
You broke my heart!

796
01:44:50,326 --> 01:44:54,871
Due to serious setbacks to our
troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...

797
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:58,124
...my position in Cuba is untenable.

798
01:45:00,503 --> 01:45:04,673
I am resigning from office
to avoid further bloodshed.

799
01:45:05,383 --> 01:45:08,551
And I shall leave the city immediately.

800
01:45:12,807 --> 01:45:15,809
I wish all of you good luck.

801
01:45:23,192 --> 01:45:26,236
Salud!

802
01:45:27,446 --> 01:45:30,865
Viva la revolución! Viva Fidel!

803
01:45:52,722 --> 01:45:54,264
Fredo!

804
01:45:54,932 --> 01:45:58,893
Come on. Come with me.
It's the only way out of here tonight.

805
01:45:59,478 --> 01:46:01,438
Roth is dead.

806
01:46:02,231 --> 01:46:06,443
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother.

807
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:09,070
Fredo!

808
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:36,514
I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator.

809
01:47:07,546 --> 01:47:09,506
Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!

810
01:47:49,797 --> 01:47:53,383
Al. Get me a wet towel.

811
01:47:59,849 --> 01:48:02,725
Does Kay know I'm back?

812
01:48:06,814 --> 01:48:09,899
My boy? Did you get him
something for Christmas?

813
01:48:09,984 --> 01:48:13,403
-I took care of it.
-What was it, so I'll know.

814
01:48:13,571 --> 01:48:18,616
It was a little car with an electric motor
that he can ride in. It's nice.

815
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:23,246
Thank you, Al.

816
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:27,876
Fellows, could you step outside
for a minute?

817
01:48:44,935 --> 01:48:46,686
Where's my brother?

818
01:48:47,605 --> 01:48:50,815
Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.

819
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:55,570
He had a stroke, but recovered okay.
Your bodyguard is dead.

820
01:48:55,654 --> 01:48:57,572
I asked about Fredo.

821
01:48:58,574 --> 01:49:01,951
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.

822
01:49:04,955 --> 01:49:06,372
All right.

823
01:49:07,625 --> 01:49:10,418
I want you to get in touch with him.

824
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:13,338
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.

825
01:49:13,464 --> 01:49:18,801
Tell him I know Roth misled him. That
he didn't know they would try to kill me.

826
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:23,973
-They can come in now.
-There was something else.

827
01:49:24,975 --> 01:49:26,476
What?

828
01:49:33,484 --> 01:49:35,276
What? Come on.

829
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:39,614
Kay had a miscarriage.

830
01:49:52,544 --> 01:49:54,921
-Was it a boy?
-At three and a half months...

831
01:49:55,005 --> 01:49:57,924
Can't you give me a straight answer?
Was it a boy?

832
01:50:02,054 --> 01:50:04,639
I really don't know.

833
01:50:19,863 --> 01:50:22,865
Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.

834
01:51:08,245 --> 01:51:11,956
Young man, I hear you and
your friends are stealing goods.

835
01:51:12,291 --> 01:51:16,085
But you don't even send a
dress to my house. No respect!

836
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:18,713
You know I've got three daughters.

837
01:51:19,214 --> 01:51:20,840
This is my neighborhood.

838
01:51:21,717 --> 01:51:25,094
You and your friends should
show me some respect.

839
01:51:26,221 --> 01:51:29,932
You should let me wet
my beak a little.

840
01:51:32,269 --> 01:51:35,938
I hear you and your friends
cleared $600 each.

841
01:51:36,607 --> 01:51:41,110
Give me $200 each, for your own
protection. And I'll forget the insult.

842
01:51:41,487 --> 01:51:46,574
You young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me!

843
01:51:48,869 --> 01:51:51,287
Otherwise the cops will
come to your house.

844
01:51:51,747 --> 01:51:54,290
And your family will be ruined.

845
01:51:55,459 --> 01:52:00,797
Of course if I'm wrong about how much
you stole - I'll take a little less.

846
01:52:01,465 --> 01:52:05,468
And by less, I only mean -
a hundred bucks less.

847
01:52:05,803 --> 01:52:07,637
Now don't refuse me.

848
01:52:09,598 --> 01:52:11,307
Understand, paisan?

849
01:52:17,815 --> 01:52:19,273
I understand.

850
01:52:21,693 --> 01:52:26,364
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.

851
01:52:27,783 --> 01:52:32,120
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.

852
01:52:36,333 --> 01:52:38,626
Don't be afraid to tell them!

853
01:52:41,004 --> 01:52:42,797
600 bucks...

854
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:45,341
Suppose we don't pay?

855
01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:49,971
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.

856
01:52:50,722 --> 01:52:54,142
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci
work this neighborhood.

857
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:58,521
He's got connections with the cops, too.
We have to pay him.

858
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:01,190
$200 each...everybody agreed?

859
01:53:05,696 --> 01:53:07,196
Why do we have to pay him?

860
01:53:07,823 --> 01:53:10,116
Vito, leave this to us.

861
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:14,203
He's one person, we're three.

862
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:17,165
He's got guns, we've got guns.

863
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:21,043
Why should we give him the
money we sweated for?

864
01:53:21,295 --> 01:53:23,504
This is his neighborhood!

865
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:29,719
I know two bookies who don't give
anything to Fanucci.

866
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:31,762
Who?

867
01:53:32,139 --> 01:53:36,142
Joe The Greek and Frank Pignattaro.

868
01:53:36,226 --> 01:53:37,727
They don't pay Fanucci.

869
01:53:39,521 --> 01:53:44,400
If they don't pay Fanucci, then
somebody else collects for Maranzalla!

870
01:53:45,569 --> 01:53:49,572
We'll all be better off if we
pay him. Don't worry.

871
01:54:05,088 --> 01:54:07,924
Now what I say stays in this room.

872
01:54:08,133 --> 01:54:12,970
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?

873
01:54:16,141 --> 01:54:19,477
I guarantee he'll accept
what I give him.

874
01:54:22,105 --> 01:54:24,440
If Fanucci says $200...

875
01:54:24,525 --> 01:54:25,942
...he means it, Vito!

876
01:54:26,443 --> 01:54:29,403
I'll reason with him.

877
01:54:31,532 --> 01:54:33,533
Leave everything to me.

878
01:54:34,159 --> 01:54:36,244
I'll take care of everything.

879
01:54:37,913 --> 01:54:40,456
I never lie to my friends.

880
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:44,210
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.

881
01:54:45,254 --> 01:54:47,088
He'll ask for the money.

882
01:54:48,006 --> 01:54:52,635
Tell him you'll pay whatever
he wants. Don't argue with him.

883
01:54:53,804 --> 01:54:56,472
Then I'll go and get him to agree.

884
01:54:58,684 --> 01:55:01,477
Don't argue with him, since
he's so tough.

885
01:55:02,271 --> 01:55:04,814
How can you get him to take less?

886
01:55:05,566 --> 01:55:07,692
That's my business.

887
01:55:08,026 --> 01:55:11,404
Just remember that I did you a favor.

888
01:55:15,826 --> 01:55:17,410
Is it a deal?

889
01:55:18,495 --> 01:55:19,495
Yes.

890
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:09,754
His family's out of the house.

891
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:12,423
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.

892
01:56:17,346 --> 01:56:21,057
Vito, here's my 50 dollars.
Buona fortuna.

893
01:56:32,110 --> 01:56:34,695
Are you sure he's going to go for it?

894
01:56:38,116 --> 01:56:42,411
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.

895
01:57:15,445 --> 01:57:20,157
It looks like there's -
$100 under my hat.

896
01:57:32,003 --> 01:57:34,213
I was right.

897
01:57:35,632 --> 01:57:37,425
Only $100...

898
01:57:40,804 --> 01:57:43,055
I'm short of money right now.

899
01:57:44,933 --> 01:57:49,520
I've been out of work...so just
give me a little time.

900
01:57:50,397 --> 01:57:52,606
You understand, don't you?

901
01:58:00,824 --> 01:58:03,451
You've got balls, young man!

902
01:58:05,454 --> 01:58:08,497
How come I never heard
of you before?

903
01:58:15,005 --> 01:58:17,423
You've got a lot of guts.

904
01:58:21,386 --> 01:58:24,346
I'll find you some work
for good money.

905
01:58:35,734 --> 01:58:39,987
No hard feelings, right? If I can
help you, let me know.

906
01:58:42,783 --> 01:58:45,201
You've done well for yourself.

907
01:58:49,122 --> 01:58:51,207
Enjoy the festa!

908
02:01:00,503 --> 02:01:02,838
Oh, this is too violent for me!

909
02:03:24,856 --> 02:03:26,315
What've you got there?

910
02:06:04,974 --> 02:06:08,936
Michael, your father loves you
very much.

911
02:09:34,016 --> 02:09:37,644
Mr. Cicci, from the year 1942
to the present time,

912
02:09:37,728 --> 02:09:41,231
you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?

913
02:09:41,691 --> 02:09:43,316
That's right.

914
02:09:44,193 --> 02:09:48,405
But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organization.

915
02:09:51,367 --> 02:09:55,203
No, we called it
the Corleone family, Senator.

916
02:09:55,580 --> 02:09:58,081
What was your position?

917
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:02,252
At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.

918
02:10:02,336 --> 02:10:05,255
-What is that?
-A button, you know, Senator.

919
02:10:05,339 --> 02:10:07,757
No, I don't know. Tell me.

920
02:10:09,302 --> 02:10:14,890
When the boss says "push a button" on
a guy, I push a button. See, Senator?

921
02:10:14,974 --> 02:10:16,349
Mr. Questadt.

922
02:10:16,893 --> 02:10:19,060
-You mean you kill people?
-What?

923
02:10:19,145 --> 02:10:24,274
You kill people at
the behest of your superiors.

924
02:10:28,070 --> 02:10:29,571
Yeah, that's right.

925
02:10:29,655 --> 02:10:34,993
And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?

926
02:10:35,077 --> 02:10:38,205
Yeah, Counselor. Michael Corleone.

927
02:10:38,289 --> 02:10:42,125
Did you ever get such an order
directly from Michael Corleone?

928
02:10:42,919 --> 02:10:45,003
No, I never talked to him.

929
02:10:45,087 --> 02:10:49,007
Mr. Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit?

930
02:10:49,091 --> 02:10:52,427
-Do what?
-Could you expand on your answer?

931
02:10:52,512 --> 02:10:58,308
I'm particularly interested in knowing,
was there always a buffer involved?

932
02:10:58,434 --> 02:11:02,979
Someone in between you
and your superiors who gave the order.

933
02:11:03,064 --> 02:11:07,526
Right, a buffer.
The family had a lot of buffers!

934
02:11:09,403 --> 02:11:13,573
You may find this very amusing, but
the members of this committee do not.

935
02:11:41,811 --> 02:11:43,979
Tell me something, Ma.

936
02:11:48,109 --> 02:11:51,778
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?

937
02:11:58,369 --> 02:12:00,245
He was being strong...

938
02:12:06,711 --> 02:12:08,336
Strong for his family.

939
02:12:18,139 --> 02:12:20,807
But by being strong for his family...

940
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:24,144
...could he...

941
02:12:26,063 --> 02:12:27,355
...lose it?

942
02:12:29,317 --> 02:12:34,696
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.

943
02:12:36,532 --> 02:12:39,826
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.

944
02:12:41,537 --> 02:12:43,371
No, I meant...lose his family.

945
02:12:47,710 --> 02:12:51,212
But you can never lose your family.

946
02:13:00,723 --> 02:13:02,557
Times are changing.

947
02:13:25,081 --> 02:13:27,540
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.

948
02:13:28,334 --> 02:13:30,043
Take it as a gift.

949
02:13:32,963 --> 02:13:37,133
If there's something I can do for you,
you come, we talk.

950
02:13:53,776 --> 02:13:56,653
Signora Colombo, why did you
come to see me?

951
02:13:59,615 --> 02:14:03,118
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.

952
02:14:05,788 --> 02:14:07,789
She's in bad trouble.

953
02:14:08,457 --> 02:14:12,460
Her neighbors complained to the
landlord about her dog.

954
02:14:13,921 --> 02:14:16,172
He told her to get rid of the animal.

955
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:21,970
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.

956
02:14:22,596 --> 02:14:26,391
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.

957
02:14:29,270 --> 02:14:32,105
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.

958
02:14:32,773 --> 02:14:34,441
I'm so ashamed!

959
02:14:34,817 --> 02:14:39,279
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.

960
02:14:42,116 --> 02:14:43,700
I'm sorry, but...

961
02:14:45,703 --> 02:14:49,164
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.

962
02:14:49,999 --> 02:14:51,458
I can't move!

963
02:14:52,835 --> 02:14:54,753
I want you to talk to him!

964
02:14:55,337 --> 02:14:58,006
Tell him I want to stay here!

965
02:15:05,806 --> 02:15:07,390
What's your landlord's name?

966
02:15:07,850 --> 02:15:09,893
His name is Signor Roberto.

967
02:15:10,478 --> 02:15:12,896
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.

968
02:15:13,522 --> 02:15:16,441
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...

969
02:15:17,526 --> 02:15:19,068
A real pig-sty, eh?

970
02:15:38,172 --> 02:15:42,133
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.

971
02:15:43,052 --> 02:15:46,346
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.

972
02:15:46,889 --> 02:15:51,142
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.

973
02:15:51,393 --> 02:15:55,438
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighborhood.

974
02:15:55,815 --> 02:15:59,442
I already rented the place
to another family.

975
02:16:04,990 --> 02:16:09,619
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.

976
02:16:10,871 --> 02:16:14,749
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.

977
02:16:15,292 --> 02:16:17,210
So let her stay.

978
02:16:17,294 --> 02:16:18,920
Impossible.

979
02:16:19,797 --> 02:16:21,130
Are you Sicilian?

980
02:16:21,549 --> 02:16:23,216
No, I'm Calabrese.

981
02:16:23,884 --> 02:16:27,178
We're practically paisan,
do me this favor.

982
02:16:27,763 --> 02:16:30,431
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.

983
02:16:31,433 --> 02:16:33,726
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.

984
02:16:34,270 --> 02:16:36,688
How much more a month?

985
02:16:37,815 --> 02:16:38,898
Five bucks.

986
02:16:43,779 --> 02:16:46,823
Here's six months increase in advance.

987
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:50,785
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.

988
02:16:51,245 --> 02:16:53,830
Come see me in another six months.

989
02:16:55,291 --> 02:16:58,293
Of course, the dog stays. Right?

990
02:16:59,086 --> 02:17:00,211
The dog stays.

991
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:08,136
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?

992
02:17:08,512 --> 02:17:12,557
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass
right into the street!

993
02:17:15,019 --> 02:17:16,769
Do me this favor.

994
02:17:17,646 --> 02:17:19,731
I won't forget it.

995
02:17:20,566 --> 02:17:23,860
Ask your friends in the
neighborhood about me.

996
02:17:24,987 --> 02:17:27,655
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favor.

997
02:17:34,496 --> 02:17:36,414
What a character!

998
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:49,260
That landlord is here...Roberto,
the one who owns those rat holes.

999
02:17:56,852 --> 02:18:00,188
He's been asking all around
the neighborhood about you.

1000
02:18:08,197 --> 02:18:10,990
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don Vito.

1001
02:18:12,117 --> 02:18:14,369
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?

1002
02:18:16,288 --> 02:18:18,331
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!

1003
02:18:19,667 --> 02:18:22,585
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!

1004
02:18:28,801 --> 02:18:31,719
I'm giving back the money you gave me.

1005
02:18:33,430 --> 02:18:39,185
Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!

1006
02:18:40,062 --> 02:18:44,816
Because after all, Don Vito,
money isn't everything.

1007
02:18:53,409 --> 02:18:55,159
Can I sit down?

1008
02:18:58,205 --> 02:19:01,207
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.

1009
02:19:02,251 --> 02:19:05,253
The rent stays like before!

1010
02:19:14,847 --> 02:19:16,305
I'll even lower it.

1011
02:19:19,143 --> 02:19:20,435
I'll lower it $5.

1012
02:19:24,773 --> 02:19:26,315
I'll lower it $10!

1013
02:19:32,781 --> 02:19:34,866
Can I offer you some coffee?

1014
02:19:37,244 --> 02:19:41,873
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!

1015
02:19:47,296 --> 02:19:49,756
You'll have to excuse me for now.

1016
02:19:55,137 --> 02:19:57,263
I wish I could stay longer!

1017
02:20:03,228 --> 02:20:05,646
Just call me and I'll be here!

1018
02:20:16,658 --> 02:20:19,494
He won't be back. He'll hide out
in the Bronx!

1019
02:20:35,177 --> 02:20:40,014
-Vito, what do you think?
-We'll make a big business!

1020
02:20:47,022 --> 02:20:50,191
-New York City.
-Would you speak up, please?

1021
02:20:50,901 --> 02:20:52,568
New York City.

1022
02:20:52,653 --> 02:20:56,280
-Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
-Yes, I am.

1023
02:20:56,365 --> 02:21:00,034
-Where was he born?
-Corleone, Sicily.

1024
02:21:00,202 --> 02:21:06,124
Did he at times use an alias that was
known in certain circles as Godfather?

1025
02:21:06,917 --> 02:21:13,089
Godfather is a term used by his friends.
One of affection and respect.

1026
02:21:13,924 --> 02:21:18,386
Mr. Chairman, I would like to verify
the witness' statement.

1027
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:23,558
For years many of my constituents
have been of Italian descent.

1028
02:21:23,892 --> 02:21:26,310
I've come to know them well.

1029
02:21:26,436 --> 02:21:30,648
They have honored me
with their support and their friendship.

1030
02:21:30,774 --> 02:21:35,987
I can proudly say that some of my
very best friends are Italian-Americans.

1031
02:21:37,239 --> 02:21:42,243
However, Mr. Chairman, unfortunately
I have to leave these proceedings

1032
02:21:42,411 --> 02:21:46,622
in order to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.

1033
02:21:47,749 --> 02:21:50,751
Before I leave, I do want to say this,

1034
02:21:50,836 --> 02:21:55,131
that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever

1035
02:21:55,215 --> 02:21:57,842
a slur upon the great Italian people.

1036
02:21:57,926 --> 02:22:01,095
I can state from my own knowledge
and experience

1037
02:22:01,180 --> 02:22:06,350
that Italian-Americans are among
the most loyal, most law-abiding,

1038
02:22:06,435 --> 02:22:09,937
patriotic, hard-working
American citizens in this land.

1039
02:22:11,023 --> 02:22:16,027
It would be a shame, Mr. Chairman,
if we allowed a few rotten apples

1040
02:22:16,111 --> 02:22:18,362
to give a bad name to the whole barrel.

1041
02:22:18,447 --> 02:22:24,035
Because from the time of Christopher
Columbus to the time of Enrico Fermi

1042
02:22:24,119 --> 02:22:26,245
to the present day,

1043
02:22:26,413 --> 02:22:30,666
Italian-Americans have been pioneers
in building and defending our nation.

1044
02:22:31,126 --> 02:22:36,339
They are the salt of the earth, and
one of the backbones of this country.

1045
02:22:42,429 --> 02:22:46,224
I'm sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague.

1046
02:22:46,308 --> 02:22:50,603
Mr. Corleone, you have been advised
as to your legal rights.

1047
02:22:50,687 --> 02:22:56,150
We have testimony from
a previous witness, one Willi Cicci.

1048
02:22:57,152 --> 02:23:01,572
He stated that you are head of the most
powerful Mafia family in the country.

1049
02:23:01,657 --> 02:23:03,950
-Are you?
-No, I'm not.

1050
02:23:04,034 --> 02:23:07,328
He testified that you are
personally responsible

1051
02:23:07,412 --> 02:23:11,415
for the murder of a New York
police captain in 1947

1052
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:15,086
and with him a man
named Virgil Sollozzo.

1053
02:23:15,254 --> 02:23:17,755
-Do you deny this?
-Yes, I do.

1054
02:23:17,923 --> 02:23:21,008
Is it true that in the year 1950

1055
02:23:21,093 --> 02:23:26,472
you devised the murder of the heads
of "the Five Families" in New York

1056
02:23:26,556 --> 02:23:30,142
to assume and consolidate
your nefarious power?

1057
02:23:30,227 --> 02:23:33,562
-It's a complete falsehood.
-Mr. Questadt.

1058
02:23:33,689 --> 02:23:38,401
Is it true you have a controlling interest
in three major hotels in Las Vegas?

1059
02:23:39,528 --> 02:23:44,699
No, it's not true. I own some stock in
some of the hotels there, but very little.

1060
02:23:47,327 --> 02:23:51,580
I also have stock in IBM and IT&T.

1061
02:23:52,666 --> 02:23:58,921
Do you have any control over gambling
and narcotics in New York State?

1062
02:23:59,006 --> 02:24:00,548
No, I do not.

1063
02:24:00,632 --> 02:24:04,218
Senator, my client
would like to read a statement.

1064
02:24:04,303 --> 02:24:09,890
Mr. Chairman, I think this statement
is totally out of order at this time.

1065
02:24:10,058 --> 02:24:15,896
Sir, my client has answered this
committee's questions with sincerity.

1066
02:24:16,064 --> 02:24:21,944
He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment,
so this statement should be heard!

1067
02:24:23,905 --> 02:24:28,868
No, I'll allow Mr. Corleone to read
his statement. I'll put it in the record.

1068
02:24:30,704 --> 02:24:33,831
In the hopes of clearing
my family name

1069
02:24:33,915 --> 02:24:37,877
to give my children their share
of the American way of life

1070
02:24:37,961 --> 02:24:41,005
without a blemish on their name
and background,

1071
02:24:41,131 --> 02:24:46,344
I have appeared before this committee
and given it all my cooperation.

1072
02:24:47,679 --> 02:24:53,225
I consider it a great personal dishonor
to have to deny that I am a criminal.

1073
02:24:54,269 --> 02:24:57,605
I wish to have the following noted
for the record...

1074
02:24:57,773 --> 02:25:01,817
That I served my country faithfully
in World War Two

1075
02:25:01,902 --> 02:25:07,114
and was awarded the Navy Cross
for actions in defense of my country.

1076
02:25:07,949 --> 02:25:12,244
That I have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime.

1077
02:25:12,412 --> 02:25:16,374
That no proof linking me to any
criminal conspiracy

1078
02:25:16,458 --> 02:25:21,337
whether it is called Mafia
or Cosa Nostra or any other name

1079
02:25:21,421 --> 02:25:23,756
has ever been made public.

1080
02:25:23,924 --> 02:25:25,883
I have not taken refuge
behind the Fifth Amendment,

1081
02:25:25,967 --> 02:25:29,136
although it's my right to do so.

1082
02:25:31,973 --> 02:25:37,561
I challenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me

1083
02:25:37,687 --> 02:25:43,609
and if they do not, I hope they will have
the decency to clear my name

1084
02:25:43,693 --> 02:25:47,321
with the same publicity
with which they have besmirched it.

1085
02:25:48,698 --> 02:25:54,245
I'm sure we're impressed. Particularly
with your love for our country.

1086
02:25:54,413 --> 02:25:57,164
We'll be in recess
until 10:00 a.m. Monday

1087
02:25:57,332 --> 02:26:02,086
when we will produce a witness who'll
corroborate the charges against you.

1088
02:26:02,254 --> 02:26:07,258
At which time you may very well
be subject to indictment for perjury.

1089
02:26:07,342 --> 02:26:11,846
I remind you that you're still
under subpoena. Adjourned!

1090
02:26:16,935 --> 02:26:18,644
Ten-to-one shot, you said.

1091
02:26:18,728 --> 02:26:23,482
A ten-to-one shot
he would take the Fifth, and I'd lose!

1092
02:26:23,567 --> 02:26:28,237
You sound like my bookie.
I owe that monkey my life.

1093
02:26:29,281 --> 02:26:32,825
-Well, just get a good night's sleep.
-Yeah.

1094
02:26:32,909 --> 02:26:35,077
You've got a big day tomorrow.

1095
02:26:35,162 --> 02:26:38,789
I've got you a new suit,
new shirt, new tie.

1096
02:26:39,458 --> 02:26:42,751
I'll shave you myself in the morning.

1097
02:26:42,919 --> 02:26:46,964
You'll look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow Americans.

1098
02:26:47,048 --> 02:26:52,261
Tomorrow... My life won't be worth
a nickel after tomorrow.

1099
02:26:53,263 --> 02:26:56,891
Come on! I saw this 19 times.

1100
02:26:57,976 --> 02:27:01,770
You've got a great home here,
for the rest of your life.

1101
02:27:01,938 --> 02:27:05,065
Nobody gets near you,
you're not going anywhere.

1102
02:27:05,233 --> 02:27:10,154
That's great. Beautiful.
Some deal I made.

1103
02:27:10,238 --> 02:27:13,073
You'll live like a king. You'll be a hero.

1104
02:27:13,158 --> 02:27:15,951
You'll live better here
than most people outside.

1105
02:27:16,119 --> 02:27:18,412
Some deal!

1106
02:27:20,999 --> 02:27:24,877
Alive. Pentangeli is alive.

1107
02:27:26,630 --> 02:27:31,926
-How did they get their hands on him?
-Roth. He engineered it, Michael.

1108
02:27:32,802 --> 02:27:35,179
When Frankie went to make a deal with
the Rosato brothers

1109
02:27:35,263 --> 02:27:37,306
they tried to kill him.

1110
02:27:37,390 --> 02:27:39,642
He thought you double-crossed him.

1111
02:27:40,685 --> 02:27:44,021
Our people with the detectives
said he was half dead, scared

1112
02:27:44,105 --> 02:27:46,815
and shouted that you'd turned on him.

1113
02:27:47,108 --> 02:27:51,278
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one and more.

1114
02:27:53,114 --> 02:27:58,827
The FBI has him airtight.
He's on an army base, 24 hour guards.

1115
02:27:58,995 --> 02:28:01,622
We can't get to him. You've opened
yourself to five counts of perjury.

1116
02:28:06,378 --> 02:28:09,380
What about Fredo?
What does he know?

1117
02:28:09,464 --> 02:28:13,133
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.

1118
02:28:13,301 --> 02:28:17,596
Roth, he played this one beautifully.

1119
02:28:24,896 --> 02:28:27,690
I'm going to talk to Fredo.

1120
02:29:06,938 --> 02:29:09,648
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

1121
02:29:11,192 --> 02:29:13,694
We have time.

1122
02:29:13,862 --> 02:29:17,031
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

1123
02:29:18,366 --> 02:29:20,492
I didn't know all that much.

1124
02:29:21,411 --> 02:29:26,248
What about now? Is there anything
you can help me out with?

1125
02:29:26,875 --> 02:29:29,084
Anything you can tell me now?

1126
02:29:31,046 --> 02:29:33,714
They've got Pentangeli.

1127
02:29:48,355 --> 02:29:52,066
I didn't know
it was going to be a hit, Mike.

1128
02:29:52,233 --> 02:29:54,526
I swear to God I didn't know.

1129
02:29:57,280 --> 02:30:01,617
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills.

1130
02:30:03,453 --> 02:30:06,538
He said that he wanted to talk.

1131
02:30:08,083 --> 02:30:14,254
He said that you and Roth
were in on a big deal together.

1132
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:21,136
And that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.

1133
02:30:21,221 --> 02:30:25,140
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations

1134
02:30:25,225 --> 02:30:29,603
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast,

1135
02:30:31,147 --> 02:30:33,732
it would be good for the family.

1136
02:30:35,276 --> 02:30:39,780
And you believed that story?
You believed that?

1137
02:30:39,948 --> 02:30:44,034
He said there was something in it
for me, on my own!

1138
02:30:44,119 --> 02:30:48,247
-I've always taken care of you, Fredo.
-Taken care of me?

1139
02:30:49,582 --> 02:30:52,376
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?

1140
02:30:53,378 --> 02:30:57,464
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

1141
02:30:58,550 --> 02:31:02,720
"Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that!"

1142
02:31:03,346 --> 02:31:07,891
"Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere."

1143
02:31:07,976 --> 02:31:11,061
"Let Fredo fetch somebody
at the airport!"

1144
02:31:11,146 --> 02:31:14,231
I'm your older brother,
but was stepped over!

1145
02:31:14,399 --> 02:31:18,152
-It's the way Pop wanted it.
-It's not the way I wanted it!

1146
02:31:18,945 --> 02:31:23,824
I can handle things, I'm smart!
Not like everybody says.

1147
02:31:23,992 --> 02:31:27,911
Like dumb. I'm smart
and I want respect!

1148
02:31:35,587 --> 02:31:40,799
Is there anything you can tell me about
this investigation? Anything more?

1149
02:31:48,808 --> 02:31:54,855
The Senate lawyer, Questadt.
He belongs to Roth.

1150
02:32:04,532 --> 02:32:06,283
Fredo,

1151
02:32:08,745 --> 02:32:11,371
you're nothing to me now.

1152
02:32:13,208 --> 02:32:15,667
Not a brother, not a friend.

1153
02:32:17,462 --> 02:32:20,464
I don't want to know you,
or what you do.

1154
02:32:21,549 --> 02:32:24,551
I don't want to see you at the hotels.

1155
02:32:24,636 --> 02:32:27,221
I don't want you near my house.

1156
02:32:29,182 --> 02:32:33,852
When you see our mother, I want
to know in advance, so I won't be there.

1157
02:32:35,438 --> 02:32:37,064
You understand?

1158
02:32:46,866 --> 02:32:48,826
Mikey.

1159
02:32:55,416 --> 02:32:59,253
I don't want anything to happen to him
while my mother's alive.

1160
02:33:49,137 --> 02:33:52,639
There's more people
than at a ballgame in here.

1161
02:33:52,807 --> 02:33:56,977
-Hey, there's Willi Cicci!
-Frankie Five-Angels...

1162
02:34:16,372 --> 02:34:18,957
This committee will come to order!

1163
02:34:21,711 --> 02:34:24,504
-State your name, please.
-Frank Pentangeli.

1164
02:34:24,589 --> 02:34:28,342
-Where were you born?
-Partinico, it's outside of Palermo.

1165
02:34:28,509 --> 02:34:30,552
Where do you live now?

1166
02:34:30,720 --> 02:34:35,933
I live in an army barracks
with the FBI guys.

1167
02:34:36,976 --> 02:34:41,438
We have here a witness
that will further testify

1168
02:34:41,564 --> 02:34:47,945
to Michael Corleone's rule of a criminal
empire that controls all gambling.

1169
02:34:48,196 --> 02:34:53,116
This witness has had no buffer
between himself and Michael Corleone.

1170
02:34:53,201 --> 02:34:56,411
He can corroborate enough charges

1171
02:34:56,496 --> 02:35:01,166
for us to recommend a charge
of perjury against Michael Corleone.

1172
02:35:01,334 --> 02:35:03,293
-Senator.
-Thank you, Chairman.

1173
02:35:04,671 --> 02:35:06,213
Mr. Pentangeli.

1174
02:35:07,423 --> 02:35:13,095
Mr. Pentangeli. Were you a member
of the Corleone family?

1175
02:35:13,262 --> 02:35:18,308
Did you serve under Caporegime,
Peter Clemenza,

1176
02:35:18,393 --> 02:35:22,938
and under Vito Corleone,
also known as the Godfather?

1177
02:35:28,653 --> 02:35:31,279
I never knew any Godfather.

1178
02:35:33,825 --> 02:35:35,951
I have my own family.

1179
02:35:39,372 --> 02:35:41,915
Mr. Pentangeli, you...

1180
02:35:42,083 --> 02:35:46,461
You are contradicting
your own sworn statement.

1181
02:35:46,587 --> 02:35:50,340
I ask you again, sir,
here and now under oath...

1182
02:35:50,425 --> 02:35:54,678
were you at any time a member of
a crime organization

1183
02:35:54,762 --> 02:35:56,638
led by Michael Corleone?

1184
02:35:56,723 --> 02:35:59,725
I don't know nothing about that!

1185
02:36:02,729 --> 02:36:06,690
I was in the olive oil business
with his father

1186
02:36:06,774 --> 02:36:09,443
but that was a long time ago.

1187
02:36:10,486 --> 02:36:13,572
We have a sworn affidavit.

1188
02:36:15,241 --> 02:36:19,953
Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered
on the orders of Michael Corleone.

1189
02:36:20,079 --> 02:36:24,583
Do you deny this confession, and do
you realize what will happen if you do?

1190
02:36:24,667 --> 02:36:27,836
The FBI guys promised me a deal

1191
02:36:27,962 --> 02:36:33,633
so I made up a lot of stuff about
Michael Corleone, just to please them.

1192
02:36:33,801 --> 02:36:37,804
But it was all lies. Everything!

1193
02:36:38,473 --> 02:36:40,640
They kept saying,

1194
02:36:40,725 --> 02:36:45,771
"Michael Corleone did this"
and "Michael Corleone did that".

1195
02:36:47,315 --> 02:36:51,318
So I said, "Yeah, sure. Why not?"

1196
02:36:51,486 --> 02:36:57,699
Mr. Corleone, would you kindly identify
the gentleman sitting to your left?

1197
02:36:57,784 --> 02:36:59,993
I can answer that.

1198
02:37:00,161 --> 02:37:02,537
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

1199
02:37:03,539 --> 02:37:07,876
-Is he related to the witness?
-He is, I believe, his brother.

1200
02:37:08,211 --> 02:37:12,839
-Will he come forward and be sworn?
-He doesn't understand English.

1201
02:37:13,007 --> 02:37:16,051
He came at his own expense
to aid his brother.

1202
02:37:16,886 --> 02:37:20,597
He's not under subpoena
and has an impeccable reputation.

1203
02:37:20,681 --> 02:37:24,476
-He knows nothing about this?
-To my knowledge, nothing.

1204
02:37:24,560 --> 02:37:28,814
I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.

1205
02:37:29,524 --> 02:37:31,608
-The witness is excused.
-Senator!

1206
02:37:32,693 --> 02:37:36,363
Senator! This committee
owes an apology!

1207
02:37:36,864 --> 02:37:40,867
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator!

1208
02:38:08,479 --> 02:38:12,482
-Michael, excuse me.
-Hello, darling.

1209
02:38:12,900 --> 02:38:16,403
The children are outside. We're going.

1210
02:38:17,738 --> 02:38:20,407
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.

1211
02:38:21,242 --> 02:38:23,660
Rocco?

1212
02:38:24,704 --> 02:38:27,289
I'll be in my room, Mike.

1213
02:38:30,042 --> 02:38:33,128
Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada.

1214
02:38:33,212 --> 02:38:36,631
I brought the children
to say goodbye to you.

1215
02:38:39,719 --> 02:38:42,262
I'm very happy for you.

1216
02:38:42,430 --> 02:38:46,933
I always knew you were too smart
to let any of them beat you.

1217
02:38:48,394 --> 02:38:52,981
-Why don't you sit down?
-No, I'm not going to stay long.

1218
02:38:53,149 --> 02:38:56,902
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.

1219
02:38:57,069 --> 02:39:02,115
Things that have been on my mind,
changes I want to make.

1220
02:39:02,283 --> 02:39:05,327
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.

1221
02:39:06,495 --> 02:39:11,208
-I wasn't going to say anything...
-What do you mean, "too late"?

1222
02:39:16,631 --> 02:39:19,299
What really happened with Pentangeli?

1223
02:39:25,097 --> 02:39:30,310
-His brother came and helped him.
-I didn't even know he had a brother.

1224
02:39:30,478 --> 02:39:32,270
Where is he now?

1225
02:39:33,606 --> 02:39:36,274
He's on a plane, back to Sicily.

1226
02:39:36,943 --> 02:39:39,486
All he had to do was show his face.

1227
02:39:41,155 --> 02:39:45,992
It was between the brothers, Kay.
I had nothing to do with it.

1228
02:39:53,834 --> 02:39:57,712
I don't want you going!
Not you, not the kids. No.

1229
02:39:58,839 --> 02:40:02,842
You're my wife and my children.
I love you and won't allow it.

1230
02:40:04,136 --> 02:40:07,973
You say you love me,
but talk about allowing me to leave!

1231
02:40:08,140 --> 02:40:11,851
Things between men and women
will not change.

1232
02:40:12,019 --> 02:40:15,897
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.

1233
02:40:16,065 --> 02:40:21,236
-Look what's happened to our son!
-Nothing's happened to him. He's fine!

1234
02:40:21,404 --> 02:40:24,614
-Anthony is not fine!
-I don't want to hear about it.

1235
02:40:24,782 --> 02:40:28,702
-Anthony is...
-I don't want to hear about it!

1236
02:40:30,037 --> 02:40:32,080
Over!

1237
02:40:44,093 --> 02:40:47,721
At this moment
I feel no love for you at all.

1238
02:40:48,806 --> 02:40:53,810
I never thought that would ever happen,
but it has.

1239
02:41:08,159 --> 02:41:10,243
Kay...

1240
02:41:13,080 --> 02:41:15,248
We're leaving tomorrow.

1241
02:41:15,958 --> 02:41:19,127
Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?

1242
02:41:19,211 --> 02:41:25,050
-Michael, you haven't heard me.
-Kay, what do you want from me?

1243
02:41:25,301 --> 02:41:31,681
Do you expect me to let you go,
to let you take my children from me?

1244
02:41:32,475 --> 02:41:38,063
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?

1245
02:41:38,147 --> 02:41:42,067
That I'd use all my power
to keep that from happening?

1246
02:41:42,902 --> 02:41:45,278
Don't you know that?

1247
02:41:46,947 --> 02:41:48,823
Kay...

1248
02:41:51,702 --> 02:41:56,331
In time, you'll feel differently.

1249
02:41:57,917 --> 02:42:00,835
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

1250
02:42:02,755 --> 02:42:04,756
I know that.

1251
02:42:06,759 --> 02:42:10,178
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.

1252
02:42:12,014 --> 02:42:13,098
Yes.

1253
02:42:14,350 --> 02:42:17,102
I know what that meant to you.

1254
02:42:19,146 --> 02:42:21,272
I'll make it up to you, Kay.

1255
02:42:22,149 --> 02:42:24,984
I swear I'll make it up to you. I'll...

1256
02:42:26,278 --> 02:42:28,196
I'm going to change.

1257
02:42:29,657 --> 02:42:33,827
I'll change. I've learned that I have
the strength to change.

1258
02:42:35,996 --> 02:42:38,998
Then you'll forget about
this miscarriage

1259
02:42:39,834 --> 02:42:44,712
and we'll have another child.
And we'll go on, you and I.

1260
02:42:46,048 --> 02:42:50,218
-We'll go on.
-Oh, Michael!

1261
02:42:51,345 --> 02:42:53,721
Michael, you are blind.

1262
02:42:55,558 --> 02:42:57,892
It wasn't a miscarriage.

1263
02:42:59,937 --> 02:43:01,479
It was an abortion.

1264
02:43:03,357 --> 02:43:08,528
An abortion, Michael.
Just like our marriage is an abortion.

1265
02:43:09,447 --> 02:43:12,907
Something that's unholy and evil!

1266
02:43:14,535 --> 02:43:16,870
I didn't want your son, Michael!

1267
02:43:17,705 --> 02:43:21,541
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

1268
02:43:23,461 --> 02:43:25,962
It was an abortion, Michael.

1269
02:43:26,046 --> 02:43:31,718
It was a son and I had it killed
because this must all end!

1270
02:43:33,304 --> 02:43:37,390
I know now that it's over. I knew it then.

1271
02:43:38,809 --> 02:43:43,771
There would be no way, Michael,
no way you could ever forgive me.

1272
02:43:44,231 --> 02:43:48,902
Not with this Sicilian thing
that's been going on for 2,000...

1273
02:43:56,827 --> 02:43:59,704
-You won't take my children.
-I will.

1274
02:43:59,788 --> 02:44:04,167
-You won't take my children!
-They're my children too.

1275
02:45:33,966 --> 02:45:37,510
Fredo, give this to Grandmother.

1276
02:47:52,312 --> 02:47:54,313
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.

1277
02:47:58,235 --> 02:48:01,279
Allow me the honor of
introducing someone.

1278
02:48:01,613 --> 02:48:04,449
My partner in America, in New York.

1279
02:48:05,117 --> 02:48:06,951
His name is Vito Corleone.

1280
02:48:07,661 --> 02:48:10,204
We'll send him olive oil from here.

1281
02:48:10,998 --> 02:48:12,457
To his company in America.

1282
02:48:17,254 --> 02:48:20,548
They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.

1283
02:48:30,267 --> 02:48:35,855
We'd like your blessing, and your
permission to start work.

1284
02:48:36,982 --> 02:48:39,859
Where is this young man
from New York?

1285
02:48:43,197 --> 02:48:46,365
Have him come closer.

1286
02:48:47,367 --> 02:48:50,203
I can't see him so good.

1287
02:48:57,211 --> 02:49:00,880
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.

1288
02:49:03,383 --> 02:49:05,092
Bless you!

1289
02:49:06,970 --> 02:49:08,554
What's your name?

1290
02:49:13,977 --> 02:49:17,146
You took the name of this town!

1291
02:49:17,689 --> 02:49:19,440
And what's your father's name?

1292
02:49:19,566 --> 02:49:23,236
His name was...Antonio Andolini.

1293
02:49:23,612 --> 02:49:27,240
Louder, I don't hear so good.

1294
02:49:30,702 --> 02:49:33,913
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...

1295
02:49:34,248 --> 02:49:36,958
...and this is for you!

1296
02:50:58,874 --> 02:51:01,500
Michael, say goodbye.

1297
02:52:04,731 --> 02:52:06,148
Hi, Al.

1298
02:52:18,203 --> 02:52:21,205
Can I speak with you
for a second, Tom?

1299
02:52:29,131 --> 02:52:30,840
Tom, where's Mike?

1300
02:52:32,092 --> 02:52:34,135
Waiting for you to leave.

1301
02:52:36,722 --> 02:52:41,267
-Can I talk with him?
-Sorry, Fredo. No chance.

1302
02:52:41,852 --> 02:52:45,146
-Can I see him?
-He's in the boathouse.

1303
02:52:58,243 --> 02:53:00,619
Michael, it's Connie.

1304
02:53:21,892 --> 02:53:23,476
Michael...

1305
02:53:26,480 --> 02:53:29,982
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

1306
02:53:38,492 --> 02:53:40,743
Is Kay coming?

1307
02:53:43,205 --> 02:53:44,872
No.

1308
02:53:53,006 --> 02:53:55,841
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

1309
02:53:55,926 --> 02:53:59,845
He asked for you
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

1310
02:54:03,517 --> 02:54:05,351
That's right.

1311
02:54:08,188 --> 02:54:11,565
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

1312
02:54:15,153 --> 02:54:17,530
Please, I want to talk to you.

1313
02:54:29,042 --> 02:54:33,045
Michael, I hated you for so many years.

1314
02:54:33,505 --> 02:54:38,843
I think I did things to myself,
to hurt myself, so that you'd know

1315
02:54:42,055 --> 02:54:44,181
that I could hurt you.

1316
02:54:50,272 --> 02:54:54,692
You were just being strong for all of us,
the way Papa was.

1317
02:54:55,277 --> 02:54:57,153
And I forgive you.

1318
02:55:01,825 --> 02:55:03,784
Can't you forgive Fredo?

1319
02:55:04,828 --> 02:55:09,456
He's so sweet,
and helpless without you.

1320
02:55:15,797 --> 02:55:19,633
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.

1321
02:55:29,477 --> 02:55:31,020
Connie.

1322
02:57:13,248 --> 02:57:15,874
Tom, sit down.

1323
02:57:27,595 --> 02:57:31,348
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

1324
02:57:32,726 --> 02:57:37,354
-Did you hear about it?
-I hear that he's in Israel.

1325
02:57:37,897 --> 02:57:42,526
The High Court in Israel
turned down his request to live there.

1326
02:57:42,694 --> 02:57:46,280
His passport's been invalidated,
except to return here.

1327
02:57:46,364 --> 02:57:49,116
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

1328
02:57:49,409 --> 02:57:53,329
He offered them a million dollars
if they'd let him live there.

1329
02:57:54,289 --> 02:57:58,292
-They turned him down.
-He's going to try Panama.

1330
02:57:58,418 --> 02:58:03,088
Panama won't take him.
Not for a million, not for ten million.

1331
02:58:03,465 --> 02:58:08,177
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.

1332
02:58:08,345 --> 02:58:11,347
He's had the same heart attack
for 20 years.

1333
02:58:11,514 --> 02:58:15,684
-That plane goes to Miami.
-That's right. That's where I want it met.

1334
02:58:16,811 --> 02:58:22,191
Impossible. They'll turn him over to the
Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI.

1335
02:58:22,359 --> 02:58:25,569
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

1336
02:58:25,653 --> 02:58:27,112
It would be
like trying to kill the President.

1337
02:58:27,197 --> 02:58:31,700
-There's no way we can get to him!
-Tom, you surprise me.

1338
02:58:34,496 --> 02:58:38,123
If anything in this life is certain,

1339
02:58:38,208 --> 02:58:41,418
if history has taught us anything,

1340
02:58:41,503 --> 02:58:44,129
it's that you can kill anyone.

1341
02:58:49,469 --> 02:58:54,390
-Rocco?
-Difficult. Not impossible.

1342
02:58:54,724 --> 02:58:56,433
Good.

1343
02:58:58,895 --> 02:59:02,481
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when I came in?

1344
02:59:06,152 --> 02:59:12,074
I thought you were going to tell me that
you were moving your family to Vegas

1345
02:59:13,451 --> 02:59:17,329
and that you'd been offered the Vice
Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.

1346
02:59:19,457 --> 02:59:24,294
-I thought you'd tell me that.
-Must I tell you every offer I turn down?

1347
02:59:28,508 --> 02:59:31,301
-Let's do business.
-All right.

1348
02:59:33,179 --> 02:59:36,181
Just consider this, Michael.
Just consider it.

1349
02:59:37,434 --> 02:59:39,560
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.

1350
02:59:39,644 --> 02:59:42,187
Are they worth it,
are they strong enough?

1351
02:59:42,689 --> 02:59:47,568
Is it worth it? You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?

1352
02:59:47,652 --> 02:59:52,990
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody
out, Tom. Just my enemies, that's all.

1353
03:00:00,707 --> 03:00:03,375
Are you with me in these things,
or what?

1354
03:00:05,503 --> 03:00:10,924
Because if not, you can take your wife,
your family and your mistress

1355
03:00:11,092 --> 03:00:14,219
and move them all to Las Vegas.

1356
03:00:17,348 --> 03:00:22,394
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've
always been loyal to you. What is this?

1357
03:00:26,983 --> 03:00:28,650
So...you're staying?

1358
03:00:30,695 --> 03:00:33,030
Yes, I'm staying.

1359
03:00:35,617 --> 03:00:37,743
What do you want me to do?

1360
03:00:38,244 --> 03:00:40,245
Hey, Anthony.

1361
03:00:40,788 --> 03:00:45,417
How would you like it if I taught you
how to catch the really big fish?

1362
03:00:45,502 --> 03:00:48,003
-Would you like that?
-Okay.

1363
03:00:48,171 --> 03:00:50,797
You know, when I was your age,

1364
03:00:51,257 --> 03:00:58,138
I went out fishing with all my brothers
and my father. Everybody.

1365
03:00:59,307 --> 03:01:02,809
I was the only one that caught a fish.

1366
03:01:04,812 --> 03:01:07,856
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?

1367
03:01:09,442 --> 03:01:13,237
Every time I put the line in the water
I said a Hail Mary

1368
03:01:13,404 --> 03:01:17,032
and every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.

1369
03:01:19,452 --> 03:01:23,622
Do you believe that? It's true.
That's the secret.

1370
03:01:25,708 --> 03:01:29,545
-Do you want to try it out on the lake?
-Okay.

1371
03:01:31,339 --> 03:01:32,673
What else have you got?

1372
03:01:59,242 --> 03:02:01,827
Everything will be okay.

1373
03:02:01,995 --> 03:02:05,914
-Did my brother go back?
-Yeah, don't worry.

1374
03:02:06,082 --> 03:02:11,003
He's ten times tougher than me,
my brother. He's old-fashioned.

1375
03:02:12,046 --> 03:02:15,340
He didn't want dinner,
just wanted to go home.

1376
03:02:15,425 --> 03:02:20,470
That's my brother! Nothing could get
him away from that two-mule town.

1377
03:02:20,638 --> 03:02:24,474
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.

1378
03:02:29,689 --> 03:02:31,648
Tom,

1379
03:02:32,358 --> 03:02:34,943
what do I do now?

1380
03:02:35,653 --> 03:02:37,654
Frankie.

1381
03:02:42,201 --> 03:02:46,204
You were always interested
in politics and history.

1382
03:02:47,707 --> 03:02:51,168
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

1383
03:02:51,336 --> 03:02:54,963
Yeah, I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.

1384
03:02:57,508 --> 03:03:03,263
You were around the old-timers, who
built the organization of the families,

1385
03:03:03,389 --> 03:03:08,810
basing them on the old Roman legions,
with "regimes," "capos" and "soldiers".

1386
03:03:10,063 --> 03:03:14,066
-And it worked.
-Yeah, it worked.

1387
03:03:14,859 --> 03:03:18,362
Those were the great old days,
you know.

1388
03:03:18,529 --> 03:03:21,657
We was like the Roman Empire.

1389
03:03:21,741 --> 03:03:25,243
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

1390
03:03:27,622 --> 03:03:29,581
Yeah,

1391
03:03:29,749 --> 03:03:32,125
it was once.

1392
03:03:36,547 --> 03:03:38,090
Frankie.

1393
03:03:48,559 --> 03:03:52,104
When a plot
against the Emperor failed

1394
03:03:53,356 --> 03:03:56,817
the plotters were always
given a chance

1395
03:03:58,778 --> 03:04:02,364
to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?

1396
03:04:02,448 --> 03:04:04,574
Only the rich guys.

1397
03:04:04,659 --> 03:04:09,663
The little guys got knocked off and all
their estates went to the Emperors.

1398
03:04:09,831 --> 03:04:15,043
Unless they went home and killed
themselves, then nothing happened.

1399
03:04:16,212 --> 03:04:20,507
And their families were taken care of.

1400
03:04:22,135 --> 03:04:25,512
That was a good break, a nice deal.

1401
03:04:26,139 --> 03:04:27,639
Yeah.

1402
03:04:28,558 --> 03:04:30,642
They went home

1403
03:04:31,853 --> 03:04:34,813
and sat in a hot bath

1404
03:04:34,981 --> 03:04:37,524
opened up their veins

1405
03:04:37,692 --> 03:04:40,402
and bled to death.

1406
03:04:41,571 --> 03:04:45,741
And sometimes they had a little party
before they did it.

1407
03:04:51,080 --> 03:04:53,415
Don't worry about anything,
Frankie Five-Angels.

1408
03:04:54,876 --> 03:04:58,170
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

1409
03:05:16,647 --> 03:05:19,775
-See you, Tom.
-Addio, Frankie.

1410
03:05:30,703 --> 03:05:33,830
Kay. You have to go.

1411
03:05:35,625 --> 03:05:38,960
-So pretty...
-Kay, please hurry. He's coming.

1412
03:05:47,762 --> 03:05:51,556
Anthony. Kiss Mama goodbye.

1413
03:05:54,185 --> 03:05:56,978
Anthony, kiss your mother goodbye!

1414
03:05:57,146 --> 03:06:02,234
Anthony, say goodbye to Mama.
Anthony. I love you, Anthony.

1415
03:06:03,361 --> 03:06:05,779
Kay, please.

1416
03:06:08,658 --> 03:06:10,617
All right.

1417
03:06:23,881 --> 03:06:26,258
Mary, come here.

1418
03:06:33,432 --> 03:06:35,016
Anthony.

1419
03:06:35,101 --> 03:06:38,103
Anthony, please. Kiss me once.

1420
03:08:17,203 --> 03:08:19,329
Easy.

1421
03:08:25,002 --> 03:08:28,088
Anthony! Anthony!

1422
03:08:28,214 --> 03:08:31,257
-He's here, we're going fishing.
-No!

1423
03:08:31,425 --> 03:08:34,761
Michael wants to take him to Reno now.

1424
03:08:34,845 --> 03:08:36,846
Shit!

1425
03:08:38,057 --> 03:08:41,518
Okay, kid, you have to go to Reno
with your pop.

1426
03:08:42,478 --> 03:08:46,439
-I'll take you fishing tomorrow, okay?
-Okay.

1427
03:08:50,069 --> 03:08:51,653
Hey, Anthony.

1428
03:08:51,737 --> 03:08:56,074
Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret.

1429
03:09:00,121 --> 03:09:01,496
Let's go.

1430
03:09:40,661 --> 03:09:44,831
-Mr. Roth, I must take you into custody.
-I understand.

1431
03:09:44,999 --> 03:09:48,126
What's your reaction
to the Israeli High Court ruling?

1432
03:09:48,294 --> 03:09:51,087
I'm a retired investor on a pension.

1433
03:09:51,255 --> 03:09:56,134
I went to Israel to live there as a Jew,
in the twilight of my life.

1434
03:10:02,475 --> 03:10:06,102
Hey, Frankie! Come on out,
let's play some Hearts.

1435
03:10:14,278 --> 03:10:15,987
Frankie!

1436
03:10:31,879 --> 03:10:34,756
Is it true you're worth
over 300 million dollars?

1437
03:10:34,924 --> 03:10:38,551
I'm a retired investor,
living on a pension.

1438
03:10:38,719 --> 03:10:42,263
I came home to vote
in the presidential election

1439
03:10:42,431 --> 03:10:45,850
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

1440
03:10:58,197 --> 03:11:00,615
Jesus Christ.

1441
03:11:01,659 --> 03:11:06,287
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1442
03:11:07,790 --> 03:11:10,375
Blessed art thou amongst women.

1443
03:11:11,168 --> 03:11:14,295
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1444
03:11:15,506 --> 03:11:19,717
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

1445
03:12:01,594 --> 03:12:06,764
Hey! Everybody, pay attention.
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.

1446
03:12:07,600 --> 03:12:10,310
-You know my brother Fredo.
-Sure.

1447
03:12:10,477 --> 03:12:15,231
This is my stepbrother Tom,
and that's his girl Theresa.

1448
03:12:15,316 --> 03:12:18,651
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.

1449
03:12:18,736 --> 03:12:21,571
Say hello to Carlo.
He's good-looking, isn't he?

1450
03:12:21,655 --> 03:12:23,239
Yes.

1451
03:12:23,407 --> 03:12:27,452
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.

1452
03:12:27,953 --> 03:12:31,831
Sit down. Talk to each other.

1453
03:12:31,999 --> 03:12:34,250
Hey, Mr. Einstein...

1454
03:12:37,588 --> 03:12:40,089
-The cake.
-Sally, get in here!

1455
03:12:40,257 --> 03:12:42,383
-I was scared.
-Come on.

1456
03:12:43,052 --> 03:12:46,387
-Where's your father?
-Christmas shopping.

1457
03:12:46,555 --> 03:12:48,932
Let's see that thing.

1458
03:12:50,643 --> 03:12:52,560
That's nice!

1459
03:12:52,645 --> 03:12:56,481
-Should I put the candles on now?
-Yeah. You help her, Carlo.

1460
03:12:57,608 --> 03:13:00,735
-What is that? Rum?
-Yeah.

1461
03:13:05,741 --> 03:13:08,993
Don't touch the antipasto
until Pop sees it.

1462
03:13:09,161 --> 03:13:11,829
He's not ugly...

1463
03:13:17,336 --> 03:13:23,591
What do you think of the nerve of those
Japs? Bombing us on Pop's birthday.

1464
03:13:23,676 --> 03:13:27,095
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.

1465
03:13:27,179 --> 03:13:29,847
Not surprising after the oil embargo.

1466
03:13:30,015 --> 03:13:34,519
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?

1467
03:13:34,687 --> 03:13:38,356
-30,000 enlisted this morning.
-Bunch of saps...

1468
03:13:38,524 --> 03:13:42,026
-Why are they saps?
-Let's not talk about the war.

1469
03:13:43,153 --> 03:13:44,988
You talk to Carlo.

1470
03:13:46,949 --> 03:13:50,535
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.

1471
03:13:50,619 --> 03:13:54,080
-That's Pop talking.
-You're right, that's Pop talking!

1472
03:13:54,206 --> 03:13:58,001
-They risk their lives for their country.
-Country isn't your blood.

1473
03:13:58,085 --> 03:14:04,007
-I don't feel that way.
-Then quit college and join the army!

1474
03:14:04,091 --> 03:14:05,591
I did.

1475
03:14:06,552 --> 03:14:09,512
I've enlisted in the Marines.

1476
03:14:11,724 --> 03:14:14,976
-Why didn't you come to us?
-What do you mean?

1477
03:14:15,060 --> 03:14:19,314
-Pop managed to get you a deferment.
-I didn't ask for it.

1478
03:14:20,065 --> 03:14:22,150
I didn't want it.

1479
03:14:23,319 --> 03:14:25,737
Come on! Knock it off!

1480
03:14:25,904 --> 03:14:29,657
-Punk!
-Sonny, sit down.

1481
03:14:32,661 --> 03:14:36,164
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

1482
03:14:39,251 --> 03:14:42,003
Go and show Carlo the tree.

1483
03:14:52,306 --> 03:14:57,310
Nice.

1484
03:14:57,936 --> 03:15:00,605
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.

1485
03:15:01,732 --> 03:15:04,484
That's swell, Mike. Congratulations.

1486
03:15:04,568 --> 03:15:06,694
Don't encourage him!

1487
03:15:06,779 --> 03:15:09,489
Get me a drink. Go on!

1488
03:15:13,327 --> 03:15:16,788
You don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.

1489
03:15:16,955 --> 03:15:21,167
Many times he and I have talked
about your future.

1490
03:15:22,961 --> 03:15:26,798
You've talked to my father
about my future?

1491
03:15:28,092 --> 03:15:32,387
-My future.
-Mikey, he has high hopes for you.

1492
03:15:32,471 --> 03:15:38,017
-I have my own plans for my future.
-Did you go to college to get stupid?

1493
03:15:38,102 --> 03:15:40,019
He's here!

1494
03:15:41,939 --> 03:15:43,898
Come on.

1495
03:15:46,151 --> 03:15:48,111
Stupid!

1496
03:16:05,379 --> 03:16:07,755
Surprise!

1497
03:16:10,843 --> 03:16:16,514
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

1498
03:16:16,723 --> 03:16:20,518
That nobody can deny
Nobody can deny...
