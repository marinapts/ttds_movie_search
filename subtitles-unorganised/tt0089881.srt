2
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,664
The hero of today's hunt
is Lord Ichimonji.

3
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,494
His was the arrow
that felled the boar.

4
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,468
Let us drink to him.

5
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:42,446
The infernal beast
charged right in front of me.

6
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,887
My horse reared, and down I went
before I could even draw my bow.

7
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,121
Father,

8
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,699
shall we have the boar roasted?

9
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:01,031
He was old.
His flesh would be tough and gamy.

10
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,204
Not fit to eat.

11
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,313
Just like me.

12
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,406
Think you could eat me?

13
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,749
You'd stick in our throats.

14
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,185
No, our purpose in joining your hunt

15
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,393
was to deepen our friendship.

16
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,152
Indeed.

17
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:28,660
And it is to cement the bonds
between our two houses

18
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,598
that I would have my daughter

19
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,329
marry your third son, Saburo.

20
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,132
Now wait a moment.

21
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,435
That's my wish as well.

22
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:43,114
Lord Ichimonji,
this is an excellent opportunity.

23
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,341
Give us your answer.

24
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:49,213
Whom would you choose
for your son, Saburo -

25
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,752
my daughter or Lord Ayabe's?

26
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,196
What a quandary.

27
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:02,293
Two daughters
but only one son.

28
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,239
A pity my second son, Jiro,
already has a wife.

29
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,151
Kyoami.

30
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,819
Come entertain us.

31
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,258
<i>From the far mountain</i>

32
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,692
<i>From the near mountain</i>

33
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,460
<i>Who comes hippety-hopping</i>

34
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,470
<i>With two tall blades
pointing out of his head</i>

35
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,609
<i>A hare</i>

36
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:30,013
Just one hare, Kyoami?

37
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,850
I think I see two.

38
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:37,926
They've come hopping through
the mountains to be eaten up by Father.

39
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,826
Hold your tongue, Saburo!

40
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,397
Don't be an ass!

41
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,852
It appears Lord Ichimonji is tired.

42
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,689
Let us withdraw until he awakens.

43
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,815
It's not like Father
to nod off in front of guests.

44
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,449
He's just feigning sleep.

45
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,957
After Saburo's insult,
how else could he save face?

46
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,620
He's never done this before.

47
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,289
It was only a boar hunt.

48
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,983
He used to rout an entire army
and be none the worse for wear.

49
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,955
It's impolite
to Lords Ayabe and Fujimaki.

50
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,666
Kyoami, wake Lord Ichimonji.

51
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,028
I'm more worried about Father.

52
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,600
He's not snoring
as he usually does.

53
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,874
- Father! Is something wrong?
- Are you ill?

54
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,180
So it was a dream.

55
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,125
I had a dream.

56
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,762
I was walking
through a desolate field...

57
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,676
never encountering another soul

58
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:14,937
no matter how far I went,

59
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:19,840
hearing no reply
no matter how loudly I shouted.

60
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,583
I was alone.

61
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,690
All alone in the whole wide world.

62
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,330
I was terrified.

63
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,111
How silly of me.

64
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,618
Taro's voice
brought me back,

65
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,184
and there you all were,
my beloved sons.

66
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,227
Taro...

67
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,196
Jiro...

68
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,459
and Saburo.

69
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:17,066
I've never seen you
like this, Father.

70
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,300
You make me uneasy.

71
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,570
Watch your tongue, Saburo!

72
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,908
Have you no gratitude
for your father's affection?

73
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:28,743
Actually, I too have difficulty
believing what Father just said.

74
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:33,150
We're utterly helpless
without Father's guidance.

75
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,154
Are you implying instead
that he relies on us?

76
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,390
Patience, now.

77
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,639
I've been thinking about that,

78
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,640
and I've come to a decision.

79
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,277
I want to tell you about it now.

80
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,483
This is as good a time as any -

81
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:06,457
especially with Lord Fujimaki
and Lord Ayabe in our company.

82
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,892
Ask them to join us.

83
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,241
I, Hidetora Ichimonji...

84
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:32,975
was born in a small castle
on the far side of that mountain.

85
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:39,790
In those days, this region
was in constant upheaval.

86
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,756
Lords great and small
vied for power.

87
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:47,393
As a lad of 17...

88
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,300
I rode forth from that small castle
with my banner raised.

89
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,668
For 50 years I waged war...

90
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,569
and at last made
the entire region my domain.

91
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:07,682
I hoisted the Ichimonji colors
atop that great castle.

92
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,221
Even after that,

93
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:15,086
I crossed lances a time or two
with Lords Fujimaki and Ayabe here,

94
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,188
but we have now set aside
our differences,

95
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,092
stabling the steeds of war

96
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,860
and cultivating
bonds of friendship.

97
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:31,638
But 70 years
have quickly come upon me.

98
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,681
As of this day,

99
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,517
I cede authority
over the house of Ichimonji

100
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,555
to my eldest son, Taro.

101
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,354
My lord!

102
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,030
- This is too sudden!
- My lord!

103
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,097
Not at all.

104
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,168
I've been planning this
for quite some time.

105
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,530
The day has
long been approaching

106
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,106
for me to step aside

107
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,337
and lay the mantle
on younger shoulders.

108
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,641
I tell you now:
That day has come.

109
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,444
I repeat.

110
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,814
From this moment forth,
Taro is head of the house of Ichimonji,

111
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,284
and lord of this domain.

112
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:25,429
I will yield the keep
of the First Castle to him

113
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,655
and move to the outer tower.

114
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,631
With me will come
30 of my close attendants,

115
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:34,704
and I shall retain the formal title
and privileges of Great Lord.

116
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,643
But all actual authority
shall rest with Taro.

117
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,506
This is my decree!

118
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,286
We bow to your will, Father.

119
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,883
But what of myself and Saburo?

120
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,927
What do you intend for us?

121
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,460
Jiro and Saburo,

122
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:07,332
I bestow upon you the Second
and Third Castles and their lands.

123
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:12,370
You will strengthen your fortifications
and aid Taro in defending the First Castle.

124
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,512
I shall divide my time

125
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,452
among the three castles,

126
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,247
and thus enjoy
my remaining years.

127
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:33,261
Alas, the ravages of age.

128
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,598
If I may, Father.

129
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,869
It is a tremendous honor

130
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,164
to be named
the head of our house,

131
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,466
but I must beg you to reconsider.

132
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:44,973
Why?

133
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:50,347
Though I am indeed
your eldest son and heir,

134
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,641
to rule in your place
is far beyond my abilities.

135
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,048
I have long prayed
to the god of war

136
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,381
that you might live
to be a hundred,

137
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,753
even if it means taking
from my own allotment of years.

138
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,220
My brother certainly has
a way with words.

139
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,023
I'd never have the nerve
to speak such honeyed phrases.

140
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,427
Makes me itch just to hear them.

141
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,805
Don't be so contrary.

142
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:18,602
Are you implying
Taro's words were mere flattery?

143
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,046
Father, pay no attention
to Saburo.

144
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,984
I share Taro's sentiment.

145
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,385
I would far prefer
to remain behind your shield,

146
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:36,550
but it's now our turn
to shield you from life's arrows

147
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,459
so that your remaining years
may be filled with ease.

148
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,459
Reassuring words, Jiro.

149
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,967
Bring me that quiver!

150
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,079
Break this in two.

151
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,192
Can you break this?

152
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,126
Now...

153
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,567
break these three arrows
together.

154
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,748
A single arrow is easily broken.

155
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,450
Not so three bundled together.

156
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:48,759
Even should a great catastrophe
threaten to overwhelm Taro,

157
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,695
if the three of you join forces
to meet the challenge,

158
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,839
the house of Ichimonji
and its domains will be safe.

159
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,709
Father, there are ways to break
even three arrows together.

160
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,517
More of your contrariness.

161
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,125
Stop playing the fool!

162
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,592
You're the one playing the fool -

163
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,059
talking nonsense all of a sudden.

164
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,826
- Nonsense?
- Yes! You've either gone senile or mad.

165
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,503
Silence!

166
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,602
You dare to insult your father?

167
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,504
What madness have I spoken?

168
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,245
What senile nonsense?

169
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,073
Very well, since you ask.

170
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,446
Consider the times
in which we live.

171
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,117
To survive, one must discard
loyalty and affection.

172
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,387
- I know that all too well.
- As well you should,

173
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,256
since the blood you've spilled
is beyond reckoning.

174
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,556
Your lifelong code has been
no pity, no mercy.

175
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,233
But remember, Father,

176
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,233
we too are children of this age,
weaned on chaos and strife.

177
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,406
Yet, because we are your blood,

178
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,804
you trust in our undying fidelity
as you dream of peaceful retirement.

179
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,811
To me, that is nothing
but madness and senility.

180
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,423
Very well. I see.

181
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:28,231
You're saying that someday
you might forget I am your father

182
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,900
and turn against me?

183
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:33,866
More nonsense still! What fool
announces his intent to betray?

184
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,097
Then will Taro or Jiro
turn against me?

185
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:40,335
You resent the fact
Father chose Taro to succeed him.

186
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,140
Saburo, is that why
you slander us this way?

187
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,013
You may be my brother,
but I'll only stand for so much.

188
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,950
Father, see what's happened
to your three arrows already?

189
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,182
Can a blood feud be far behind?

190
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,995
How dare you?

191
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:03,197
Would you trample
on your father's wishes?

192
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:07,369
Very well! If you insist these times allow
no bonds between parent and child,

193
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,309
then consider our bonds severed!

194
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,241
You are now a stranger to me!
Out of my sight!

195
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,642
You mustn't, my lord!

196
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,680
Silence, Tango.

197
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,477
My mistake was to dote on him
over the others.

198
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,850
I coddled him too much.

199
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:31,491
This swollen head, this insolence -
these are my own creation.

200
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,356
But it's too late for regrets.

201
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,525
When flesh is rotten,

202
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,534
it must be cut away,
even if it's your own!

203
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,674
Wait, my lord!
Master Saburo minces no words,

204
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,038
and what he says may seem
disrespectful and even brutal.

205
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,376
But it is his upright heart that leads him
to speak with unadorned candor.

206
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,711
If you consider
his words carefully,

207
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,182
you will find truth in them.

208
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,050
- Silence!
- No!

209
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:00,752
Desist!

210
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,392
I will not!

211
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,755
You...

212
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,532
No, my lord!

213
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,735
Have you lost your head,
my lord?

214
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,500
As your advisor,
it is my duty to speak frankly.

215
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,277
Brandishing your sword
will not make me budge!

216
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,347
- Insolence!
- I beg you, revoke your rash decision!

217
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,483
Your impudence matches Saburo's!

218
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:30,246
I won't have it!
I banish you both!

219
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,717
Father!

220
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,773
A terrible predicament.

221
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,246
What do you intend to do,
Master Saburo?

222
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,888
It's Father I'm worried about,
not myself.

223
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:09,421
It tears at my heart
to think what lies ahead for him.

224
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,858
You're a fool, Tango.

225
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,657
Why?

226
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,266
Defending me
only got you banished.

227
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,805
It's a mistake for you
to be separated from Father...

228
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,341
no matter
what the circumstances.

229
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,285
I think they may be after us.

230
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,397
Wait a moment, will you?

231
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:34,835
Why do you flee, son-in-law?
- Son-in-law?

232
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,843
Let me explain.

233
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,944
You incurred your father's wrath
and were exiled.

234
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:46,453
Lord Ayabe and I both
witnessed it all.

235
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:52,520
Now that you've been cast out
and are little more than a beggar -

236
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:57,727
Oh, forgive me!
How should I put it?

237
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,402
This is awkward -

238
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,937
It's all right. Now that I'm
little more than a beggar -

239
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,371
- The offer of marriage is off.
- Naturally.

240
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,309
No, you misunderstand!

241
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:12,882
Those were Lord Ayabe's words
when he withdrew his proposal.

242
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,414
But as I set out
on my way home,

243
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,823
I began thinking.

244
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:24,394
Your conduct showed
great strength of character.

245
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,831
You're a most interesting fellow.

246
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:30,866
Was I to let a man like you
slip through my fingers?

247
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,196
And so I turned back to find you,

248
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,602
only to have you flee.

249
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,069
Is my proposal
disagreeable to you?

250
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,336
I don't know what to say.

251
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:46,609
Then come stay with me
while you think it over.

252
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,311
You too, Tango.

253
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,817
I admire a man
with your backbone.

254
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,819
I want you to come as well.

255
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,498
It's most kind of you,

256
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,567
but I must decline your invitation.

257
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:08,729
No matter what lowly disguise
I must adopt,

258
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,340
I will remain near Lord Hidetora.

259
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,308
If you'll excuse me.

260
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,336
What is it?

261
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,708
Lord Hidetora's ladies
are moving to the outer tower.

262
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,179
They refuse to yield
to your retinue.

263
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,378
This is a blatant affront!

264
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,648
I am now the mistress
of this castle.

265
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,552
Etiquette demands
that they make way.

266
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:38,357
Why are my women kneeling
to Taro's wife?

267
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,330
It's outrageous!

268
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,004
I beg to differ.

269
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,637
Now that you've yielded
the throne to Taro,

270
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,372
it's only proper.

271
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:03,279
<i>He gives away his house
and gives away his lands</i>

272
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,123
<i>A generous man,
the village head</i>

273
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,054
<i>Now he's but a scarecrow</i>

274
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,525
<i>Standing out in the field</i>

275
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,762
Are you calling me a fool?

276
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,527
No, sire!
The fool kneels here before you.

277
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,998
Enduring ridicule,
I seek to entertain.

278
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:28,243
But you, my lord -
you've squandered your domain.

279
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,257
You know, Kaede...

280
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,869
now that it all belongs to me,

281
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:56,233
the view
is even more magnificent.

282
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,273
As I recall,

283
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,474
a battle standard
used to be kept there.

284
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:10,519
Yes, my father kept his standard
and suit of armor there.

285
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:11,814
What happened to them?

286
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,617
I gave them to Father's men
just now.

287
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,254
The armor is of no importance,

288
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,558
but the standard -

289
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,967
My lord,

290
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:28,230
that standard represents
the head of the house of Ichimonji.

291
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:33,467
But Father said he would retain
the title and privileges of Great Lord.

292
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,608
Are you then to be
merely a shadow?

293
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,282
What are you saying?

294
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:46,423
He made it clear
I am now lord of this domain.

295
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:49,953
In that case,

296
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,755
I suggest you act like a lord.

297
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,614
Attendants!

298
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,675
What?

299
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,879
You want the standard back?
- That's right.

300
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:21,920
What? One minute you give,
and the next you take back?

301
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,994
Silence!
We have orders from Lord Taro!

302
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:34,103
<i>The new lord
is a gourd in the wind</i>

303
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,064
<i>Swinging this way</i>

304
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,742
<i>Swinging that way</i>

305
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,778
<i>Spinning in the breeze
on its spindly vine</i>

306
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,374
<i>High in the keep</i>

307
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,848
<i>Dangles an empty gourd</i>

308
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,087
<i>Isn't it hilarious</i>

309
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,854
Insolent fool!

310
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,055
I'll teach you!

311
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,824
<i>The new lord
is a gourd in the wind</i>

312
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:38,035
<i>Swinging this way</i>

313
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,069
<i>Swinging that way</i>

314
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,331
<i>Spinning in the breeze
on its spindly vine</i>

315
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:49,909
<i>High in the keep
dangles an empty gourd</i>

316
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,241
<i>Isn't it hilarious</i>

317
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,384
<i>Who is it?</i>

318
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,852
<i>Ogura, from the keep.</i>

319
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:07,863
I bring a message, sire.

320
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,864
To celebrate
the transfer of power,

321
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,232
Lord Taro wishes to hold
a family gathering in the keep tonight.

322
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,930
He requests the honor
of your presence.

323
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,401
Lord Ikoma is invited as well.

324
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:05,553
You call this a family gathering?

325
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,261
Father,

326
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,725
won't you be seated?

327
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,864
You expect me to sit below you?

328
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,904
Who do you think I am?

329
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,402
My husband's
most honorable father.

330
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,771
Is that all?

331
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:30,670
What happened to the Great Lord?
Is he dead?

332
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,817
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not being silly!

333
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:47,788
I retain the title and standing
of Great Lord. Have you forgotten that?

334
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,967
Of course not.

335
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:56,506
But it seems you've forgotten, Father,
that you made me head of the house.

336
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,806
What are you talking about?

337
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,706
I've yielded the keep to you,

338
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,848
moved to the outer tower,
and reduced my retinue.

339
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:09,383
Their number may be few,
but their conduct is intolerable.

340
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,156
What am I to make of that song?

341
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,651
<i>Swinging this way</i>

342
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,763
<i>Swinging that way</i>

343
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,991
<i>Spinning in the breeze
on its spindly vine</i>

344
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:28,602
With such goings-on,
how am I to establish my authority?

345
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:32,173
They're brutish warriors
with no use for niceties.

346
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,045
You can't keep them
from enjoying a comic song.

347
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,476
There's such a thing
as going too far.

348
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,283
The fool's song
blatantly mocks me.

349
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,579
It was only natural
for my guard to defend my honor.

350
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,450
Yet you loosed your arrow
and killed my man.

351
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:50,024
I cannot let such things pass.

352
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,091
Just this once
I will overlook it,

353
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,364
but I must have your bond

354
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,129
that it will not happen again.

355
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,746
You will sign that statement

356
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,943
and seal it with your blood.

357
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,493
"Covenant"?

358
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,358
I'm astounded
you'd even suggest this.

359
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,728
Read it!

360
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,878
"Covenant.

361
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,673
Item:

362
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:47,742
I cede control over all Ichimonji lands
to my first son, Taro.

363
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,078
Item:

364
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:54,286
I declare my first son, Taro,
head of the house of Ichimonji.

365
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,425
Item:

366
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,221
Although I am his father,

367
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,830
I shall hereafter submit
to Taro's authority

368
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,933
and not act against his will.

369
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,962
I attest to the above
in the name of all the deities

370
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,572
and hereby affirm this covenant."

371
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:15,678
You expect me to sign and seal
this nonsense with my blood?

372
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,516
The items listed here

373
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,346
are nothing more
than what you yourself proclaimed

374
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:26,182
before Lord Ayabe
and Lord Fujimaki.

375
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,687
What does it change
to set it in writing?

376
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,237
Are you really my son?

377
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:24,780
- What a question!
- Is this how a son treats his father?

378
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,245
The hen pecks the cock

379
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,315
and makes him crow.

380
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,327
I cannot stay here!

381
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,796
Fortunately,

382
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,462
I have another son.

383
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,566
Thank you for your cooperation.

384
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:34,378
I was born and raised here
in this, my father's castle...

385
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,545
and sent forth from here

386
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,950
to marry you.

387
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,292
After our marriage,
my father and brothers

388
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,830
let down their guard...

389
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:55,939
and fell to your father's sword.

390
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:05,972
How I've longed for this day...

391
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,419
ever since
I returned to this castle.

392
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:36,813
It was in this very room
that my mother took her life.

393
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,848
My father plans to come here.

394
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,482
Taro has driven him
from the First Castle.

395
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,157
My brother's letter says

396
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:25,725
Father has become so willful and erratic,
it would be unwise to let him stay.

397
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:31,095
He adds that Father's counselor, Ikoma,
has secretly shifted his allegiance.

398
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,719
It's quite unlike Lord Taro
to use such harsh language.

399
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:57,650
If I may, my lord,
why do you just sit quietly by?

400
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,159
My question exactly.

401
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:03,424
You're the one who should
succeed Lord Hidetora.

402
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:07,070
Taro is no match for the task.

403
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,132
If we were you, we'd stake
our lives on a chance like this.

404
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:18,779
Are you saying
you'd stake your lives on me?

405
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,041
Exactly.

406
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,243
But dogs will abandon a master
who abandons the chase.

407
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,922
Shrink from this
and you become our quarry.

408
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,554
How the dogs howl!

409
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,028
I have given the situation
much thought.

410
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,030
Just because
I was born a year after Taro,

411
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:43,104
am I to grovel all my life
at his feet?

412
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:45,141
I will throw off these shackles!

413
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,407
Just what we wanted to hear.

414
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,511
Control your impudence.

415
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,013
Now listen.

416
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:56,178
Taro will be easy to handle,

417
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:59,618
but his wife, Lady Kaede,
is a different matter.

418
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,316
True.

419
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:06,419
Actually, she'd be
a perfect match for you.

420
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:10,697
Perhaps you should steal her.
- Don't be impertinent.

421
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,869
Our first concern is Father.

422
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:19,131
Though officially retired,
he still has 30 retainers -

423
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,469
seasoned warriors,
each worth a thousand men.

424
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,943
He'll soon arrive at my gate
in their company.

425
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,748
We need a plan.

426
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,885
<i>Open the gates!</i>

427
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,590
<i>It's Hidetora!</i>

428
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,694
The Great Lord is here!

429
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,664
I will see Su first.

430
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:21,262
Tell Jiro I'll see him later.

431
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:49,459
Su.

432
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,248
<i>Praise be</i>

433
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:14,117
<i>To the eternal Western Paradise</i>

434
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:19,027
<i>Praise be to the eternal Buddha</i>

435
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:23,029
<i>In 36 trillion manifestations</i>

436
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:27,169
<i>Praise be to Amida Buddha</i>

437
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,740
I thought I'd find you here.

438
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,380
Father!

439
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:42,552
Never mind the formalities.

440
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,622
It's been a long time.

441
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:48,886
Let me look at you.

442
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,854
Always that same sad face.

443
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,967
Every time I see you,
it tears at my heart.

444
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,112
It's worse
when you smile like that.

445
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,552
I burned down
your father's castle.

446
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,190
Your parents and family
all perished.

447
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,994
How can you smile at me?

448
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:29,990
You should be glaring at me
with hatred.

449
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,495
That would be easier to bear.

450
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,634
Go on, let your hatred show!

451
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,314
I do not hate you.

452
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:54,249
Everything is determined
by our karma from previous lives.

453
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,086
In all things I take comfort
in the Buddha's heart.

454
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,362
The Buddha again!

455
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:04,263
There is no Buddha in our world.
We live in a dark age

456
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:07,562
from which the Buddha's guardians
have been routed by the Asuras.

457
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,767
The Buddha's great mercy
can no longer help us.

458
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,168
Ah, Jiro!

459
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:17,712
I've come to be your guest.

460
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,651
I'm disappointed in Taro.
Let me tell you -

461
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:29,292
There's no need, Father.
Taro explained everything in his letter.

462
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:32,729
Taro wrote to you?

463
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:39,628
He says your guards
were vulgar and unruly.

464
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:43,136
I am to receive you
with the courtesy due my father,

465
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:48,539
but he orders me not to allow
your men inside the castle walls.

466
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,236
That's absurd!

467
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:53,809
How can I leave my men
to rot outside

468
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:56,747
while I alone enter the castle?

469
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:59,914
My brother is now
head of the clan.

470
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:04,185
I have no choice
but to obey him.

471
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,797
If you cannot abide
by his conditions,

472
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:10,728
then perhaps your best course

473
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:15,098
is to return to the First Castle
and apologize.

474
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:18,836
Apologize to Taro?

475
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:21,610
Return to the First Castle?

476
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,233
What's the meaning of this?

477
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,406
This is outrageous!

478
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:56,177
Stop!

479
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:05,147
Lord Kurogane!
Lord Shirane!

480
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,082
Why are we being
treated this way?

481
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,796
Lord Ikoma!

482
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:16,732
These are
Lord Hidetora's instructions.

483
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,691
This sudden visit

484
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,661
has caught
the castle unprepared.

485
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:26,104
Wait outside the walls
until the castle is ready.

486
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,552
I've heard enough.

487
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,485
Now I see.

488
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:52,401
You're no different...

489
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,171
from Taro.

490
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:03,279
You just want me out of the way.

491
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,877
That's not true.

492
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:09,575
Come alone and I'll welcome you
with open arms.

493
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:12,880
You only say that
because you know I can't.

494
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,120
You have stepped down.

495
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:23,327
Under your own son's protection,
what need can you have of retainers?

496
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,830
Only the wild beasts...

497
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,130
can live without
the company of their own.

498
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,402
I've heard enough excuses.

499
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:41,141
Open the gates!

500
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,324
What are you waiting for?

501
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,157
Don't worry.

502
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:53,591
My men aren't coming in.

503
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:55,890
I'm leaving!

504
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,792
Open the gates!

505
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,249
Close the gates!

506
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:31,223
I never want to see you again!

507
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,504
The villages are all deserted.

508
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:15,337
There's not a grain of rice
to be had anywhere.

509
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:19,538
The peasants must have taken it all
and fled to the hills.

510
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,383
My lord.

511
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:06,021
The Third Castle
is our only choice.

512
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:08,594
That was the first castle
you conquered.

513
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,859
We can go there
and make a fresh -

514
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,195
Fool!

515
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,771
If I could do that,

516
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:19,539
I wouldn't be wandering
the wilderness without food.

517
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,038
Think a moment.

518
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:27,942
Would the protectors
of the Third Castle

519
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:31,845
welcome the man who banished
their lord and master?

520
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,396
By order of Lord Taro,

521
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,864
head of the Ichimonji clan,

522
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:23,699
I have come to take possession
of this castle.

523
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:26,934
Open the gates!

524
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:46,361
Without Lord Saburo,

525
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,689
this castle means nothing to us.

526
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:51,090
Our sole desire

527
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:55,269
is to follow Lord Saburo
and die protecting him.

528
00:52:55,872 --> 00:53:00,138
Word has come that he is
in Lord Fujimaki's domain.

529
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,469
We go now to join him.

530
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,341
By your leave.

531
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:00,035
<i>Lord Tango!</i>

532
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,740
I've brought rice,
miso and salted plums.

533
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,244
I, Tango Hirayama,

534
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,880
though banished,
have followed my lord in disguise.

535
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:23,651
Seeing how you suffer,
I beg to offer you these provisions.

536
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,175
Is that really you, Tango?

537
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:44,770
Wait!

538
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:47,882
Circumstances prevent us
from accepting these provisions.

539
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:52,377
No matter how hungry, we will not
take charity from the peasants.

540
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,450
That's right.

541
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,823
The peasants' conduct
is unforgivable.

542
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:04,432
Burn down all their villages!

543
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,294
One moment, my lord!

544
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,631
You mustn't blame the peasants.

545
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:15,942
Lord Taro forced them to flee
their villages and hide from you.

546
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,810
What exactly did he do?

547
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:24,077
He issued a decree
banishing you

548
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,778
and declaring
that anyone who helps you...

549
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:30,383
must die.

550
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:13,102
You tried to warn me of this.

551
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:16,735
I should have taken it to heart.

552
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:19,207
I remain your humble servant,
my lord.

553
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,113
Go ahead and laugh, Tango.

554
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:29,444
Laugh at Hidetora's
wretched plight.

555
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:34,783
Betrayed by my own sons

556
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,856
and turned out of my castles,

557
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,090
I have no place to go.

558
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:44,494
That's not true, my lord.
You do have a place to go.

559
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,625
Master Saburo

560
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:50,169
has found refuge with Lord Fujimaki,
who wants him for a son-in-law.

561
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:52,739
Go to him.

562
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,704
No! Speak no more of that!

563
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:03,184
How could I ever face Saburo now?

564
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,555
My lord,
you must listen to me.

565
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:10,918
Saburo's only thought
is for your welfare.

566
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,623
It was at his bidding

567
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,992
that I followed you
disguised as I am.

568
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,263
It was he who insisted

569
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:23,797
that I stay close by
and see to your safety.

570
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:57,699
I bring news, sire.

571
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:01,138
Saburo's men have turned over
the Third Castle to Lord Ogura

572
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:04,609
and departed
for Lord Fujimaki's domain.

573
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:06,439
What?

574
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,716
Now we see
Lord Fujimaki's scheme.

575
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:13,746
First he makes Master Saburo
his son-in-law,

576
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:15,982
then he takes in
Saburo's warriors,

577
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:18,092
and finally your lordship himself.

578
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:21,752
Then he foments war
among your divided clan

579
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,766
and walks off with your domain
while you battle it out.

580
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:28,426
That's absurd!
Lord Fujimaki is not that kind of man!

581
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:32,267
We must go
to the Third Castle at once.

582
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:37,612
But the castle
is in Lord Ogura's hands.

583
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:40,510
What of it?
Ogura's a reasonable man.

584
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:44,312
What's that I smell?
Something stinks.

585
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,349
A very rotten stench.

586
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:51,120
My lord, Ogura has
only a handful of men.

587
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,455
We can easily overwhelm them
if necessary.

588
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:57,096
Bring my horse!

589
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,059
By all means hurry,

590
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:04,138
what with hell so near
and heaven so far!

591
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,637
Insolent brat!

592
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:08,402
If you don't like it, begone!

593
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,091
All we did...

594
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:30,460
was speak the truth.

595
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,250
<i>My lord!</i>

596
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:33,881
- My lord, the attackers are -
- I know!

597
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,115
Find Ikoma and Ogura for me!

598
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:38,589
But it's they
who've betrayed us!

599
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:43,095
The enemy is everywhere,
inside and out.

600
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,194
Hell is upon us!

601
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,781
Lord Taro is slain!

602
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:15,054
- What?
- A terrible shame!

603
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:17,486
It was a stray shot
from the tower!

604
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:32,033
Such are the vagaries of war.

605
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:35,504
The fates are kinder
to you than to Taro.

606
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:41,914
What about Father?

607
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:44,309
Harakiri, most likely.

608
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:06,763
- My lord, we're doomed!
- Prepare yourself!

609
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:09,033
Farewell, my lord!

610
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:33,878
Withdraw!

611
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:40,139
My lord!

612
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,611
The die is cast!
You must not falter!

613
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:46,439
You have but one path to follow.

614
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:50,175
It leads to absolute rule
of the house of Ichimonji.

615
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:53,047
There's no turning back.

616
01:15:56,284 --> 01:15:58,650
Lord Hidetora!

617
01:16:17,305 --> 01:16:19,466
My lord!

618
01:16:46,767 --> 01:16:48,291
Has he gone mad?

619
01:16:49,503 --> 01:16:50,834
He's better off for it!

620
01:16:51,072 --> 01:16:52,630
What are you saying?

621
01:16:53,174 --> 01:16:54,300
Please, my lord!

622
01:16:54,942 --> 01:16:56,341
You must reclaim your wits!

623
01:16:56,544 --> 01:16:59,672
In a world gone mad,
it's madness to be sane.

624
01:17:15,162 --> 01:17:17,460
What on earth do you see?

625
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:20,925
Forgive me!

626
01:17:23,938 --> 01:17:25,428
Ah, excellent!

627
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:28,903
Your madness finally shows you
the true nature of your sins!

628
01:17:30,645 --> 01:17:35,139
<i>Oh, the unspeakable horror</i>

629
01:17:35,616 --> 01:17:39,245
<i>On a withered plain I see</i>

630
01:17:39,654 --> 01:17:43,317
<i>All those I destroyed</i>

631
01:17:43,524 --> 01:17:46,584
<i>In all the many clans</i>

632
01:17:48,396 --> 01:17:53,356
<i>Phantom armies rise up</i>

633
01:17:54,001 --> 01:17:56,993
<i>One by one before me</i>

634
01:18:13,454 --> 01:18:15,183
<i>Who's there?</i>

635
01:18:15,456 --> 01:18:19,085
Travelers stranded by the storm.

636
01:18:19,293 --> 01:18:21,261
We beg shelter for the night.

637
01:18:23,197 --> 01:18:26,758
<i>My hovel is much too humble
for visitors.</i>

638
01:18:26,967 --> 01:18:28,525
We ask nothing special.

639
01:18:30,538 --> 01:18:34,406
<i>I have reasons
for wishing to be alone.</i>

640
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:37,844
Why? A contagious malady?

641
01:18:39,113 --> 01:18:40,080
<i>No.</i>

642
01:18:40,281 --> 01:18:41,646
Then, please!

643
01:18:42,817 --> 01:18:44,444
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

644
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,382
Listen.

645
01:18:47,588 --> 01:18:51,615
The one who seeks shelter
is Lord Ichimonji himself.

646
01:18:57,898 --> 01:18:59,593
We're coming in!

647
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:25,789
Our lord has taken ill.

648
01:19:28,929 --> 01:19:32,831
He's soaked to the bone.
Have you anything to cover him with?

649
01:20:04,298 --> 01:20:05,856
I'm cold.

650
01:20:06,066 --> 01:20:07,590
My lord.

651
01:20:15,576 --> 01:20:16,702
Is that you, Tango?

652
01:20:17,044 --> 01:20:21,037
Rejoice, Kyoami!
He's himself again.

653
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:24,540
More's the pity.

654
01:20:24,752 --> 01:20:26,515
He was better off mad.

655
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,489
Listen to me.

656
01:20:36,564 --> 01:20:38,327
I was attacked...

657
01:20:40,267 --> 01:20:44,431
by my own sons,
Taro and Jiro.

658
01:20:48,809 --> 01:20:51,073
And I was betrayed by Ikoma.

659
01:20:54,315 --> 01:20:56,408
Worse yet...

660
01:20:59,553 --> 01:21:01,885
I myself stood by and watched

661
01:21:02,356 --> 01:21:04,517
as my loyal followers
died in vain.

662
01:21:05,793 --> 01:21:07,727
By some twist of fate...

663
01:21:09,763 --> 01:21:11,526
I came out of it alive.

664
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:14,526
I should have died!

665
01:21:27,181 --> 01:21:29,411
You there! Woman!

666
01:21:32,186 --> 01:21:35,246
I am not a woman.

667
01:21:36,223 --> 01:21:39,386
I'm sorry. It's so dark.
We need a light.

668
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,985
I have no light...

669
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:45,296
and no use for one.

670
01:21:45,566 --> 01:21:47,124
What?

671
01:21:47,368 --> 01:21:49,495
Are you without sight?

672
01:22:18,432 --> 01:22:21,458
Are you not Lady Su's brother,

673
01:22:22,469 --> 01:22:24,528
young Lord Tsurumaru?

674
01:22:31,111 --> 01:22:32,942
Tsurumaru?

675
01:22:38,085 --> 01:22:40,212
It's been a very long time...

676
01:22:42,056 --> 01:22:43,819
Lord Hidetora.

677
01:22:46,894 --> 01:22:49,385
You remember me?

678
01:22:50,631 --> 01:22:52,622
How could I forget?

679
01:22:54,969 --> 01:22:56,937
I may have been only a boy,

680
01:22:57,137 --> 01:22:59,765
but never could I forget
the man

681
01:22:59,974 --> 01:23:02,169
who burned down
my father's castle

682
01:23:02,376 --> 01:23:04,776
and gouged out my eyes...

683
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,607
as the price
for letting me live.

684
01:23:11,919 --> 01:23:14,046
My sister taught me

685
01:23:14,955 --> 01:23:16,923
to pray to the Buddha

686
01:23:17,124 --> 01:23:20,651
and banish hatred from my heart,
but try as I might...

687
01:23:23,664 --> 01:23:26,224
not for one day
have I forgotten...

688
01:23:28,302 --> 01:23:31,362
not one night
have I slept in peace.

689
01:23:39,747 --> 01:23:41,442
Now then,

690
01:23:41,682 --> 01:23:46,051
I regret I cannot show you
the hospitality

691
01:23:46,253 --> 01:23:48,687
befitting a great lord.

692
01:23:49,623 --> 01:23:54,322
But I have a flute
my sister gave me.

693
01:23:59,933 --> 01:24:02,231
Perhaps I might play
a tune for you

694
01:24:03,137 --> 01:24:06,595
in place of the hospitality

695
01:24:07,207 --> 01:24:09,198
I'm unable to offer.

696
01:24:12,146 --> 01:24:14,876
This is the only pleasure

697
01:24:15,949 --> 01:24:17,610
that remains for me now.

698
01:25:42,336 --> 01:25:44,304
My lord!

699
01:25:47,741 --> 01:25:48,833
Lady Kaede,

700
01:25:49,042 --> 01:25:51,135
I bring a lock
of your husband's hair.

701
01:26:00,888 --> 01:26:04,380
Unhappily it falls to me

702
01:26:04,591 --> 01:26:06,650
to inform you
of his death in battle.

703
01:26:07,761 --> 01:26:09,786
I curse the fates that made it so.

704
01:26:12,866 --> 01:26:14,333
Lord Ogura...

705
01:26:16,069 --> 01:26:18,401
where are
my husband's remains?

706
01:26:19,873 --> 01:26:21,932
In this fierce heat,

707
01:26:22,142 --> 01:26:25,703
the body would have become
too unsightly for you to view.

708
01:26:26,647 --> 01:26:29,241
We cremated it
at the Third Castle

709
01:26:29,449 --> 01:26:32,384
and held funeral rites
at a nearby temple.

710
01:26:32,586 --> 01:26:34,486
Lord Ogura,

711
01:26:34,688 --> 01:26:36,986
where are his armor and helmet?

712
01:26:37,524 --> 01:26:39,116
Do you mock me?

713
01:26:39,993 --> 01:26:42,461
I'm now wearing
the armor he wore.

714
01:26:42,663 --> 01:26:45,928
Surely you recognize it.

715
01:26:47,968 --> 01:26:50,061
Of course.

716
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:53,731
I just couldn't believe

717
01:26:54,541 --> 01:26:59,444
you'd so quickly claim
these mementos of my husband...

718
01:27:01,014 --> 01:27:02,914
for yourself to wear.

719
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:06,044
I'm stung by your words.

720
01:27:07,154 --> 01:27:12,592
I thought my brother would be pleased
to see me return to his castle

721
01:27:12,793 --> 01:27:14,658
wearing his armor.

722
01:27:15,028 --> 01:27:18,259
But I see it was
a rash decision.

723
01:27:19,299 --> 01:27:20,732
Forgive me.

724
01:27:24,938 --> 01:27:27,702
Help me remove this armor!

725
01:27:31,545 --> 01:27:32,807
Lady Kaede,

726
01:27:33,013 --> 01:27:35,243
forgive my disrobing before you.

727
01:28:10,884 --> 01:28:14,479
Lords Ikoma and Ogura,
you've been of great service to us

728
01:28:14,688 --> 01:28:17,748
during these upheavals
in the house of Ichimonji.

729
01:28:18,659 --> 01:28:23,460
Please accept these humble tokens
as an expression of our gratitude.

730
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,400
These are
my parting gifts to you.

731
01:28:34,741 --> 01:28:35,673
Farewell.

732
01:28:38,278 --> 01:28:40,473
After careful consideration,

733
01:28:40,681 --> 01:28:44,276
Lord Jiro feels it unwise
to take into his service

734
01:28:44,584 --> 01:28:47,849
men who betrayed their masters
while serving as their counselors.

735
01:28:48,689 --> 01:28:50,884
His reasoning is unassailable.

736
01:28:51,124 --> 01:28:53,854
We are helpless to intervene.

737
01:28:54,061 --> 01:28:56,154
Please do not be offended.

738
01:28:56,363 --> 01:28:58,593
You do understand?
I'm so glad.

739
01:28:58,799 --> 01:29:00,767
If you'll excuse us, my lord.

740
01:29:10,877 --> 01:29:13,971
<i>Lady Kaede is here, sire.</i>

741
01:29:18,418 --> 01:29:19,646
Ask her to ascend.

742
01:30:24,084 --> 01:30:28,612
I'm afraid I was upset before
and spoke indiscreetly.

743
01:30:29,022 --> 01:30:30,922
I must apologize.

744
01:30:31,124 --> 01:30:34,787
Please think nothing of it.

745
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:44,234
They say your father
has gone mad.

746
01:30:49,376 --> 01:30:52,345
That must please you.

747
01:30:52,679 --> 01:30:55,113
Why would you say
such a thing?

748
01:30:56,049 --> 01:30:57,414
Lady Kaede,

749
01:30:57,617 --> 01:31:00,711
I merely spoke what I felt
was the ungilded truth.

750
01:31:00,954 --> 01:31:03,081
Forgive me
if I've caused offense.

751
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:07,117
But you must hate
my father fiercely

752
01:31:07,327 --> 01:31:10,490
for what he did to your family.

753
01:31:10,697 --> 01:31:12,096
Or am I mistaken?

754
01:31:15,469 --> 01:31:18,131
I could say much the same:

755
01:31:19,406 --> 01:31:21,931
Lord Jiro too must be
most pleased.

756
01:31:23,743 --> 01:31:27,941
After all, you are now head
of the Ichimonji clan.

757
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:43,629
This helmet is rightfully yours.

758
01:31:58,411 --> 01:32:01,574
I'm not blind, Lord Jiro!

759
01:32:01,848 --> 01:32:05,648
You drove your father mad, murdered
your brother and stole his lands!

760
01:32:05,852 --> 01:32:07,410
This is for my husband!

761
01:32:07,621 --> 01:32:08,747
You're wrong!

762
01:32:08,955 --> 01:32:10,980
You deny it even now?

763
01:32:13,827 --> 01:32:16,091
It wasn't me!
I didn't kill my brother!

764
01:32:16,296 --> 01:32:17,888
Then who did?

765
01:32:19,232 --> 01:32:22,224
Speak! Who was it?

766
01:32:28,174 --> 01:32:30,665
- Who was it?
- It wasn't me.

767
01:32:33,547 --> 01:32:35,412
Kurogane shot him.

768
01:32:35,615 --> 01:32:37,276
Hypocrite!

769
01:32:37,784 --> 01:32:40,810
Would you give the order,
then deny the blame?

770
01:32:42,222 --> 01:32:43,985
A fine leader you are!

771
01:32:56,069 --> 01:32:57,934
You contemptible weakling.

772
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:25,254
Now it's my turn to speak
the ungilded truth.

773
01:33:38,878 --> 01:33:40,607
Lord Jiro,

774
01:33:41,348 --> 01:33:46,183
I couldn't care less
about my husband's death.

775
01:33:47,387 --> 01:33:49,548
All I care about

776
01:33:50,156 --> 01:33:51,885
is myself!

777
01:33:53,693 --> 01:33:56,423
I refuse to live as a widow,
with my hair cut short,

778
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:59,497
or as a nun,
with my head shaved.

779
01:34:00,266 --> 01:34:02,666
This castle was my father's.

780
01:34:02,869 --> 01:34:04,598
I will not be driven from it!

781
01:34:11,878 --> 01:34:13,470
Lord Jiro,

782
01:34:14,014 --> 01:34:16,312
if you'll grant my request,

783
01:34:17,217 --> 01:34:19,549
I will say nothing.

784
01:34:20,153 --> 01:34:23,816
I'll tell no one
of your abominable crimes.

785
01:34:25,525 --> 01:34:29,518
I'll not speak out
in bitter reproach against you.

786
01:34:30,163 --> 01:34:33,792
If I did, I could throw
this land into turmoil!

787
01:34:35,301 --> 01:34:36,996
It's in my power...

788
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,608
to tear this domain to shreds!

789
01:34:48,982 --> 01:34:51,678
What do you say, Lord Jiro?

790
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,012
My... lord?

791
01:36:39,058 --> 01:36:41,117
Yes, Lady Kaede?

792
01:36:41,327 --> 01:36:42,885
I didn't hear that.

793
01:36:43,096 --> 01:36:45,496
How can you still be
so formal with me?

794
01:36:47,667 --> 01:36:49,658
After what we've done,

795
01:36:50,603 --> 01:36:52,798
I really should be...

796
01:36:53,973 --> 01:36:55,463
your wife.

797
01:37:04,818 --> 01:37:07,514
But I already have Su.

798
01:37:08,822 --> 01:37:10,983
Then am I to be
merely your concubine?

799
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:15,551
No!

800
01:37:18,231 --> 01:37:20,290
You must belong to me alone.

801
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:23,066
No one else can have you!

802
01:38:00,039 --> 01:38:01,802
You needn't cry, Kaede.

803
01:38:02,375 --> 01:38:05,310
I'd never make you
a mere concubine.

804
01:38:05,945 --> 01:38:09,437
But as long
as Lady Su remains -

805
01:38:10,617 --> 01:38:12,778
I'll think of something.

806
01:38:13,286 --> 01:38:15,083
What can you do?

807
01:38:16,990 --> 01:38:18,821
I'll divorce her.

808
01:38:19,559 --> 01:38:21,424
That will not do!

809
01:38:22,262 --> 01:38:26,460
I can't bear to think

810
01:38:26,699 --> 01:38:28,724
that another woman
has known your touch.

811
01:38:29,535 --> 01:38:32,800
She can't be allowed to live!

812
01:38:44,183 --> 01:38:46,014
Do you know where we are?

813
01:38:47,987 --> 01:38:51,753
In more peaceful times, this would
have been Tsurumaru's castle.

814
01:38:53,626 --> 01:38:56,390
You now take shelter
in the ruins of a castle

815
01:38:56,596 --> 01:38:58,461
that you yourself burned down.

816
01:39:04,304 --> 01:39:07,467
Must be nice
having no idea what's happening.

817
01:39:49,816 --> 01:39:51,408
Your helmet, my lord.

818
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:19,278
And those are your crest.

819
01:40:20,813 --> 01:40:22,906
Now you look even more grand.

820
01:40:55,648 --> 01:40:57,513
Look who's coming -
those demons!

821
01:40:58,184 --> 01:40:59,776
Two demons approaching!

822
01:41:13,132 --> 01:41:16,624
Dirty traitors!
You'll pay for your treason!

823
01:41:17,236 --> 01:41:18,794
No, wait!

824
01:41:19,005 --> 01:41:20,097
Let us explain!

825
01:41:20,306 --> 01:41:21,898
Excuses won't save you!

826
01:41:22,108 --> 01:41:25,635
Lord Hidetora told me
all about your treachery.

827
01:41:49,035 --> 01:41:51,230
My lord!

828
01:42:10,823 --> 01:42:12,916
Die, traitor!

829
01:42:14,794 --> 01:42:16,318
Jiro killed Taro!

830
01:42:17,196 --> 01:42:19,187
If Hidetora hadn't gone mad,

831
01:42:20,199 --> 01:42:22,463
he'd have been next!

832
01:42:22,668 --> 01:42:25,136
If he recovers his wits,
he'll be killed too!

833
01:42:43,623 --> 01:42:46,091
Jiro killed Taro!

834
01:42:46,292 --> 01:42:48,760
We must take Lord Hidetora
to Saburo at once!

835
01:42:49,195 --> 01:42:51,390
If only we could.

836
01:42:52,165 --> 01:42:55,498
Mention Saburo
and he runs away.

837
01:42:56,102 --> 01:42:59,868
He can't bring himself
to face Saburo after what happened.

838
01:43:00,072 --> 01:43:01,903
On that point he's sane.

839
01:43:02,108 --> 01:43:03,666
My lord.

840
01:43:05,845 --> 01:43:08,245
Why do you shrink
from Master Saburo?

841
01:43:10,917 --> 01:43:14,080
Let us go to him.

842
01:43:22,094 --> 01:43:25,393
No, our only choice
is to bring Saburo here.

843
01:43:25,598 --> 01:43:27,759
I'll go get him.

844
01:43:28,234 --> 01:43:31,397
I'll return as soon as I can.

845
01:43:32,705 --> 01:43:34,832
I leave our lord in your hands.

846
01:44:05,938 --> 01:44:07,462
My lord,

847
01:44:08,441 --> 01:44:11,638
you're allowing Lady Kaede
to lead you by the nose.

848
01:44:15,481 --> 01:44:18,314
If you wish to marry her, fine.

849
01:44:18,884 --> 01:44:22,081
But to kill Lady Su?

850
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:27,221
Sometimes it is necessary
to take a life,

851
01:44:27,426 --> 01:44:30,361
but to kill one
who needn't be killed -

852
01:44:31,564 --> 01:44:35,056
I'll have nothing to do
with such lunacy!

853
01:45:00,393 --> 01:45:01,826
Lord Kurogane.

854
01:45:02,995 --> 01:45:06,453
I trust the Second Castle
has ample stores of salt?

855
01:45:09,235 --> 01:45:10,702
Yes. Why?

856
01:45:11,237 --> 01:45:14,798
You'll need to bring
the head back wrapped in salt.

857
01:45:15,041 --> 01:45:16,975
Otherwise, in this heat,

858
01:45:17,176 --> 01:45:22,170
it'll be in such a frightful state,
we'll have to cover our eyes.

859
01:45:23,983 --> 01:45:26,577
For a woman
of Lady Su's beauty,

860
01:45:26,786 --> 01:45:29,277
that would be too cruel.

861
01:45:29,989 --> 01:45:34,255
Since you will see to it personally,
I'm sure there will be no mishaps.

862
01:45:35,828 --> 01:45:37,853
I leave it
in your capable hands.

863
01:46:03,789 --> 01:46:06,587
Why do I stay
with this crazy old man?

864
01:46:08,527 --> 01:46:10,961
If the boulder you're sitting on
begins to roll,

865
01:46:11,731 --> 01:46:13,790
you'd best jump clear.

866
01:46:20,473 --> 01:46:24,933
Otherwise you'll be crushed.

867
01:46:38,557 --> 01:46:40,582
Only a fool refuses to jump.

868
01:46:42,561 --> 01:46:44,461
This place -

869
01:46:45,398 --> 01:46:47,093
Where are we?

870
01:47:02,848 --> 01:47:04,679
We're in paradise!

871
01:47:26,405 --> 01:47:28,134
Damn it all!

872
01:47:29,775 --> 01:47:31,675
Ever since I was a child,

873
01:47:33,712 --> 01:47:35,873
I've been tending to him.

874
01:47:55,167 --> 01:47:56,725
Now be a good boy.

875
01:48:01,474 --> 01:48:03,169
Time for beddy-bye.

876
01:48:50,122 --> 01:48:53,182
I have returned, my lord!

877
01:49:15,748 --> 01:49:16,942
Approach!

878
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:50,371
You have been most diligent.

879
01:49:51,617 --> 01:49:53,380
At your service, my lady.

880
01:49:56,021 --> 01:49:59,479
In accordance
with your careful instructions,

881
01:49:59,692 --> 01:50:02,684
I have brought
the item you requested.

882
01:50:06,832 --> 01:50:09,266
Be so kind as to examine it.

883
01:50:20,312 --> 01:50:23,907
With your permission,
I will inspect it first.

884
01:50:52,311 --> 01:50:53,778
What is this?

885
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:57,510
Is this some kind of a joke?

886
01:50:57,716 --> 01:50:59,843
- Is something wrong?
- I'll not have it!

887
01:51:02,855 --> 01:51:04,618
What in the world?

888
01:51:06,258 --> 01:51:08,852
Lady Su must have been
a fox in disguise.

889
01:51:09,061 --> 01:51:11,120
Enough of your pranks!

890
01:51:11,330 --> 01:51:13,389
This is a statue from a shrine!

891
01:51:18,103 --> 01:51:20,936
A clever fox indeed!

892
01:51:22,074 --> 01:51:24,235
Now she's turned herself
to stone!

893
01:51:24,576 --> 01:51:26,373
Kurogane!

894
01:51:28,647 --> 01:51:30,911
Would you make a fool of me?

895
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:33,274
Heavens, no.

896
01:51:33,485 --> 01:51:36,010
We have a great many foxes
in these parts,

897
01:51:36,221 --> 01:51:39,247
and it's said
they often play tricks on humans.

898
01:51:43,128 --> 01:51:45,562
You must be very careful,
my lord.

899
01:51:45,764 --> 01:51:49,598
Foxes often work their evil
in the shape of a woman.

900
01:51:49,802 --> 01:51:53,932
In Central Asia,
a she-fox seduced King Pan Tsu

901
01:51:54,306 --> 01:51:56,797
and persuaded him
to kill a thousand men.

902
01:51:57,009 --> 01:52:01,878
In China, a she-fox became King Yu's
queen and brought down his kingdom.

903
01:52:02,081 --> 01:52:04,072
Here in Japan,
a white fox with nine tails

904
01:52:04,283 --> 01:52:07,946
caused great havoc in court
as Princess Tamamo,

905
01:52:08,153 --> 01:52:11,714
before reverting back
to her true form.

906
01:52:12,825 --> 01:52:17,057
They lost track of the white fox
after that,

907
01:52:17,262 --> 01:52:19,560
but it's been suggested

908
01:52:19,765 --> 01:52:22,529
she may have settled
in this area.

909
01:52:23,702 --> 01:52:26,227
So beware, my lord, beware.

910
01:52:26,872 --> 01:52:28,533
With your permission.

911
01:52:41,353 --> 01:52:46,381
I make one small request,
and this is how you respond?

912
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:48,457
How could you do this?

913
01:52:48,694 --> 01:52:50,525
You conspired with Kurogane
to humiliate me!

914
01:52:50,729 --> 01:52:52,526
No, you're mistaken!

915
01:52:52,765 --> 01:52:53,959
I won't hear it!

916
01:52:54,533 --> 01:52:56,933
Stop, Kaede!
This was all Kurogane's doing!

917
01:53:02,274 --> 01:53:04,333
It's always Kurogane.

918
01:53:05,077 --> 01:53:07,238
Is that man your only vassal?

919
01:53:08,514 --> 01:53:10,914
First he plays the villain
by killing Taro,

920
01:53:11,116 --> 01:53:13,914
then he plays the hero
by saving Su.

921
01:53:14,119 --> 01:53:16,246
And to think
this two-headed monster

922
01:53:16,455 --> 01:53:18,355
is your right-hand man!

923
01:53:19,424 --> 01:53:23,053
Until I have Su's head,

924
01:53:23,262 --> 01:53:25,196
you'll not see me again!

925
01:53:41,713 --> 01:53:44,011
Sister, I forgot my flute.

926
01:53:44,216 --> 01:53:45,683
There's no time now.

927
01:53:45,884 --> 01:53:47,476
But I've treasured it
since I was little.

928
01:53:47,686 --> 01:53:49,483
What can we do?

929
01:53:49,688 --> 01:53:52,452
Lord Kurogane said
your pursuers would be close behind.

930
01:53:52,724 --> 01:53:54,783
I'll go back for it.

931
01:53:55,093 --> 01:53:58,460
Your legs are weak.
I should be the one.

932
01:53:58,664 --> 01:54:01,326
No, we're almost to the ruins
of your family's castle.

933
01:54:01,533 --> 01:54:05,128
This is your only chance
to pray for your dead.

934
01:54:05,337 --> 01:54:08,568
Once you escape from here,
you might never return.

935
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:17,344
Come, Tsurumaru.
Let us hurry.

936
01:54:23,555 --> 01:54:26,149
There it is, Tsurumaru!

937
01:54:26,358 --> 01:54:28,724
Our castle... what's left of it.

938
01:54:28,927 --> 01:54:30,451
Where, Su?

939
01:54:30,662 --> 01:54:32,027
Over there.

940
01:54:37,870 --> 01:54:39,132
Where is it?

941
01:55:27,319 --> 01:55:29,310
Heaven and earth
have gone topsy-turvy.

942
01:55:29,821 --> 01:55:32,449
I was once the fool
who made him laugh.

943
01:55:33,158 --> 01:55:36,218
Now he's the fool,
and I'm the one laughing.

944
01:55:38,430 --> 01:55:41,888
Don't just stand there.
Say something.

945
01:55:42,701 --> 01:55:46,330
Blabber your nonsense
and I'll speak my truth...

946
01:55:47,639 --> 01:55:50,802
and we'll have a good laugh
comparing the two.

947
01:55:54,112 --> 01:55:56,580
Come on, old man!

948
01:56:08,327 --> 01:56:10,989
A serpent once had an egg
pure and white,

949
01:56:11,697 --> 01:56:14,461
while that of a bird
was speckled and dirty.

950
01:56:14,666 --> 01:56:16,793
This must be a castle.

951
01:56:18,937 --> 01:56:20,461
This is a stone wall.

952
01:56:20,672 --> 01:56:23,869
The bird gave up the speckled egg
to lay on the white one.

953
01:56:24,943 --> 01:56:26,035
This is strange.

954
01:56:26,244 --> 01:56:28,371
The egg cracked open
and out came a snake.

955
01:56:28,580 --> 01:56:31,640
Nothing but empty space
above the walls.

956
01:56:32,517 --> 01:56:33,882
Why is that?

957
01:56:34,086 --> 01:56:36,418
The bird was eaten
by the snake it hatched.

958
01:56:43,261 --> 01:56:44,990
What is this place?

959
01:56:48,333 --> 01:56:50,028
Who am I?

960
01:56:50,235 --> 01:56:51,998
You're a stupid bird!

961
01:56:56,041 --> 01:56:57,565
Saburo.

962
01:57:05,283 --> 01:57:07,808
The pain!

963
01:57:10,288 --> 01:57:13,519
I'm a worm.
Don't crush me.

964
01:57:14,826 --> 01:57:19,092
Crush you? Who'd bother
to crush a worm like you?

965
01:57:23,435 --> 01:57:26,495
Who are you?

966
01:57:50,662 --> 01:57:52,357
Someone's crying.

967
01:57:57,369 --> 01:57:59,394
Who could it be?

968
01:58:01,306 --> 01:58:03,069
Damn it!

969
01:58:03,308 --> 01:58:05,208
Man is born crying.

970
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:07,708
He cries and cries,
and then he dies!

971
01:59:40,805 --> 01:59:43,467
My lord,
Saburo has crossed the river

972
01:59:43,675 --> 01:59:45,233
and taken up a position
in Hachiman Field.

973
01:59:45,477 --> 01:59:49,470
That's odd. What does he hope
to do with so few men?

974
01:59:53,585 --> 01:59:56,281
- A messenger has come from Saburo.
- What?

975
01:59:56,588 --> 01:59:57,680
His message?

976
01:59:57,889 --> 02:00:00,084
Saburo has come
for your father.

977
02:00:01,393 --> 02:00:04,055
He will withdraw
as soon as he has him.

978
02:00:04,262 --> 02:00:06,059
<i>My lord!</i>

979
02:00:08,667 --> 02:00:10,601
Lord Fujimaki is at the border.

980
02:00:24,549 --> 02:00:26,210
I don't like this.

981
02:00:26,418 --> 02:00:29,182
I told Lord Fujimaki
I didn't want him here.

982
02:00:29,487 --> 02:00:31,352
There's nothing to fear.

983
02:00:31,556 --> 02:00:35,993
With him up there, the enemy
will be pinned down once they arrive.

984
02:00:36,194 --> 02:00:40,460
Meanwhile, we can safely fetch
your father from Azusano.

985
02:00:41,266 --> 02:00:44,724
But it's such
a massive show of force.

986
02:00:45,103 --> 02:00:49,062
One false move could mean war.

987
02:00:56,681 --> 02:00:59,081
Was it hasty of me to come?

988
02:01:00,051 --> 02:01:02,645
I came because I couldn't
just sit by and watch,

989
02:01:02,854 --> 02:01:05,220
though Saburo will surely
be angry with me.

990
02:01:06,291 --> 02:01:10,284
As long as we stay right here,
he shouldn't object.

991
02:01:23,541 --> 02:01:25,702
Prepare to march!

992
02:01:29,080 --> 02:01:31,708
My lord, this is not
the time to fight.

993
02:01:31,916 --> 02:01:34,612
Tell Saburo
he can have your father.

994
02:01:34,819 --> 02:01:36,582
Don't start a war.

995
02:01:37,022 --> 02:01:39,217
I can't let him have Father.

996
02:01:39,424 --> 02:01:44,418
Together they will accuse me
of treason and attack me.

997
02:01:45,330 --> 02:01:49,960
Even if we wanted to turn over
your father, we don't know where he is.

998
02:01:50,168 --> 02:01:53,103
Recent events have thrown
the whole domain into turmoil,

999
02:01:53,305 --> 02:01:56,172
and Fujimaki and Ayabe
are looking for an opening.

1000
02:01:56,441 --> 02:02:00,502
We should be securing our bulwarks,
not marching into battle.

1001
02:02:02,047 --> 02:02:03,810
<i>My lord,</i>

1002
02:02:04,149 --> 02:02:06,310
I bring a message
from Lady Kaede.

1003
02:02:07,952 --> 02:02:11,752
She awaits you with sake
to celebrate your departure for battle.

1004
02:02:14,893 --> 02:02:19,159
A warrior riding into battle
mustn't leave his heart with a woman.

1005
02:02:19,431 --> 02:02:21,160
You must refrain.

1006
02:02:47,659 --> 02:02:49,752
The enemy approaches.
As soon as they're here,

1007
02:02:49,961 --> 02:02:52,327
we'll slip through those woods
to find his lordship.

1008
02:02:52,530 --> 02:02:55,499
Be patient.
Koyata, rest the horses.

1009
02:02:56,735 --> 02:02:58,430
Dismount!

1010
02:03:00,171 --> 02:03:01,661
<i>Fool!</i>

1011
02:03:05,343 --> 02:03:08,005
You're letting Kurogane
sway you again.

1012
02:03:08,646 --> 02:03:09,977
You're wrong!

1013
02:03:10,248 --> 02:03:11,875
To fight now
is not in our favor.

1014
02:03:12,083 --> 02:03:14,984
The leader's prowess
determines victory or defeat.

1015
02:03:15,186 --> 02:03:17,882
You have nothing to fear
from Fujimaki or Ayabe.

1016
02:03:21,659 --> 02:03:23,183
Your mistake

1017
02:03:23,862 --> 02:03:27,958
was sparing your father
just because he went mad.

1018
02:03:29,934 --> 02:03:32,994
But how can I kill him
if I don't know where he is?

1019
02:03:35,907 --> 02:03:38,808
I'm sure Saburo
knows where to find him.

1020
02:03:40,211 --> 02:03:43,806
Why else would he have come?

1021
02:03:50,455 --> 02:03:52,218
All you need do

1022
02:03:53,358 --> 02:03:58,057
is send a messenger to Saburo
saying he can take your father,

1023
02:03:58,797 --> 02:04:03,393
then dispatch your assassins
to follow him.

1024
02:04:19,651 --> 02:04:21,846
I've lost my way.

1025
02:04:22,253 --> 02:04:24,312
All men lose their way.

1026
02:04:28,359 --> 02:04:30,020
This path...

1027
02:04:31,563 --> 02:04:33,258
Looks familiar.

1028
02:04:34,132 --> 02:04:36,259
I've come this way before.

1029
02:04:36,468 --> 02:04:39,232
Men have been wandering
the same paths forever.

1030
02:04:40,104 --> 02:04:42,504
If you don't like it, then jump!

1031
02:04:57,222 --> 02:04:59,656
My lord!

1032
02:05:32,090 --> 02:05:33,614
Up there.

1033
02:05:34,192 --> 02:05:35,921
Who is that?

1034
02:05:38,096 --> 02:05:39,290
Su!

1035
02:05:47,839 --> 02:05:49,932
Sister, whose voice was that?

1036
02:05:50,141 --> 02:05:53,668
This was her father's castle.

1037
02:05:54,913 --> 02:05:57,245
These are the ruins of the castle

1038
02:05:58,116 --> 02:06:00,050
that I burned down.

1039
02:06:02,854 --> 02:06:04,719
Why am I here?

1040
02:06:07,458 --> 02:06:09,449
Why is Su here?

1041
02:06:11,462 --> 02:06:12,986
And Tsurumaru too!

1042
02:06:18,503 --> 02:06:20,130
Is this a dream?

1043
02:06:20,705 --> 02:06:23,105
No, this must be hell!

1044
02:06:23,641 --> 02:06:25,131
I'm in hell!

1045
02:06:25,476 --> 02:06:27,501
I'm in the depths of hell!

1046
02:08:28,299 --> 02:08:29,630
Mount!

1047
02:10:23,948 --> 02:10:26,348
A message from Lord Jiro!

1048
02:10:48,940 --> 02:10:50,373
Agreed.

1049
02:11:01,452 --> 02:11:03,249
He says they won't stand
in our way.

1050
02:11:03,454 --> 02:11:06,617
We're to take Father
and leave promptly.

1051
02:11:07,758 --> 02:11:10,226
Let us go at once.

1052
02:11:10,428 --> 02:11:14,990
No. We mustn't
reveal his whereabouts.

1053
02:11:15,199 --> 02:11:17,565
We'll wait until dark.
- My lord.

1054
02:11:17,768 --> 02:11:20,066
Ayabe's forces are massing
on that ridge.

1055
02:11:49,667 --> 02:11:52,761
The vulture!
He smells blood.

1056
02:12:06,250 --> 02:12:08,218
Remain calm, my lord.

1057
02:12:09,353 --> 02:12:11,014
On that ridge we have Ayabe.

1058
02:12:12,323 --> 02:12:15,349
On the other,
Fujimaki awaits his chance.

1059
02:12:20,464 --> 02:12:22,796
This is the moment of truth.

1060
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:26,197
We must stand firm
and give them no excuse to attack.

1061
02:12:27,505 --> 02:12:31,635
He came to take Father,
yet he makes no move.

1062
02:12:31,842 --> 02:12:34,333
What's his plan?

1063
02:12:53,631 --> 02:12:55,599
Why is she taking so long?

1064
02:12:59,403 --> 02:13:02,702
I'll see what's keeping her.

1065
02:13:02,907 --> 02:13:04,397
No.

1066
02:13:05,009 --> 02:13:07,136
No, I don't need the flute.

1067
02:13:07,345 --> 02:13:09,870
You're acting like a child.

1068
02:13:10,247 --> 02:13:13,774
Sister, I don't ever want
to be alone again.

1069
02:13:14,685 --> 02:13:17,051
You won't be alone.

1070
02:13:24,195 --> 02:13:26,755
On this scroll is an image
of Amida Buddha.

1071
02:13:26,964 --> 02:13:29,933
It will protect you in my absence.

1072
02:13:31,635 --> 02:13:32,966
Sister!

1073
02:13:34,338 --> 02:13:37,068
I won't be gone long.

1074
02:13:38,109 --> 02:13:39,440
Sister!

1075
02:13:43,914 --> 02:13:46,109
My lord!

1076
02:13:57,395 --> 02:13:59,226
My lord!

1077
02:14:00,598 --> 02:14:04,898
I found Kyoami
in tears at Azusano.

1078
02:14:05,102 --> 02:14:07,502
Kyoami,
where's Lord Hidetora?

1079
02:14:09,173 --> 02:14:11,141
Forgive me!

1080
02:14:11,742 --> 02:14:15,644
I lost him.

1081
02:14:17,048 --> 02:14:20,745
You last saw my father
at Azusano?

1082
02:14:22,420 --> 02:14:25,048
We can no longer wait for dark.

1083
02:14:25,256 --> 02:14:26,883
Koyata!

1084
02:14:32,163 --> 02:14:36,862
Tango and I are going to Azusano.
Keep the enemy engaged here.

1085
02:14:37,802 --> 02:14:41,033
Ten of you
go with Lord Saburo!

1086
02:14:55,252 --> 02:14:56,947
They're on the move.

1087
02:14:58,122 --> 02:15:02,616
A detachment headed for Azusano,
with Saburo in the lead.

1088
02:15:04,795 --> 02:15:06,786
Gunnery captain!

1089
02:15:12,937 --> 02:15:15,235
Take your men to Azusano

1090
02:15:15,439 --> 02:15:17,532
and lay an ambush.

1091
02:15:18,542 --> 02:15:21,807
Whoever kills Saburo
will be the hero of this battle!

1092
02:15:22,346 --> 02:15:23,813
This is insanity!

1093
02:15:24,014 --> 02:15:26,744
Break your word
and it will mean war!

1094
02:15:27,451 --> 02:15:30,852
So be it.
It has to happen sometime.

1095
02:15:31,055 --> 02:15:35,048
- We'll have to fight the others too.
- What of it?

1096
02:15:35,659 --> 02:15:39,254
If Ayabe and Fujimaki
violate our borders,

1097
02:15:39,563 --> 02:15:44,000
we'll rout their forces
and make their lands our own!

1098
02:15:44,201 --> 02:15:47,796
Brave words,
but words don't win wars.

1099
02:15:48,005 --> 02:15:51,099
What happened to the man
who rebuked me for timidity?

1100
02:15:51,308 --> 02:15:55,574
Kaede was right.
You play the villain, but you're gutless!

1101
02:15:57,281 --> 02:15:59,772
Under her spell yet again?

1102
02:16:00,017 --> 02:16:01,712
Silence!

1103
02:16:01,919 --> 02:16:03,216
If you're opposed,
stay behind!

1104
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:06,753
If you fear the fight,
then begone!

1105
02:16:07,525 --> 02:16:09,049
My lord!

1106
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:12,251
How could I leave you, my lord?

1107
02:16:12,463 --> 02:16:14,090
Where would I go?

1108
02:16:16,133 --> 02:16:19,534
You have your orders, Captain!
Go!

1109
02:16:31,916 --> 02:16:33,440
Runner!

1110
02:16:34,552 --> 02:16:36,543
Take this message to Lord Saburo:

1111
02:16:36,754 --> 02:16:40,383
"Enemy gunners are on the way.
Be on guard."

1112
02:16:47,264 --> 02:16:48,993
Infantry...

1113
02:16:49,600 --> 02:16:51,693
forward!

1114
02:17:05,583 --> 02:17:07,483
He thinks he's clever.

1115
02:17:18,195 --> 02:17:19,594
All forces...

1116
02:17:20,531 --> 02:17:24,934
move into the woods!

1117
02:17:25,536 --> 02:17:27,436
Right face!

1118
02:17:29,173 --> 02:17:31,266
Forward!

1119
02:17:33,711 --> 02:17:36,612
Lord Saburo!

1120
02:17:57,768 --> 02:18:00,236
- Father!
- Lord Hidetora!

1121
02:18:00,971 --> 02:18:02,438
Father!

1122
02:18:04,708 --> 02:18:06,232
My lord!

1123
02:18:46,984 --> 02:18:49,418
Look at that sky!

1124
02:18:52,790 --> 02:18:54,951
Is this the other world?

1125
02:18:59,363 --> 02:19:01,331
Am I in paradise?

1126
02:19:03,967 --> 02:19:04,934
Father!

1127
02:19:05,135 --> 02:19:08,229
How can you be so cruel?

1128
02:19:08,706 --> 02:19:12,164
Why do you drag me
from my grave?

1129
02:19:14,211 --> 02:19:16,509
Father!

1130
02:19:20,784 --> 02:19:23,344
Don't you know me, Father?

1131
02:19:24,488 --> 02:19:26,012
Father!

1132
02:19:30,294 --> 02:19:31,886
Father?

1133
02:19:35,499 --> 02:19:38,127
Who are you calling father?

1134
02:19:41,472 --> 02:19:43,872
Wait. I remember now.

1135
02:19:47,277 --> 02:19:50,303
I had three sons.

1136
02:19:58,055 --> 02:20:00,319
Are you one of them?

1137
02:20:00,524 --> 02:20:03,152
Yes. I am Saburo.

1138
02:20:16,974 --> 02:20:20,239
- Saburo! Is it really you?
- Father!

1139
02:20:28,185 --> 02:20:32,144
I have no face to show you,

1140
02:20:32,756 --> 02:20:34,815
no words to excuse myself.

1141
02:20:35,659 --> 02:20:39,823
If you have poison for me,

1142
02:20:40,097 --> 02:20:42,088
I will drink it.

1143
02:20:43,267 --> 02:20:45,258
You mustn't talk like that.

1144
02:20:45,469 --> 02:20:47,960
I bear you no grudge.

1145
02:20:48,338 --> 02:20:51,364
Don't lie to me!
I've had my fill of honeyed words!

1146
02:20:58,515 --> 02:21:03,111
My lord, has Master Saburo
ever been one to lie?

1147
02:21:04,455 --> 02:21:07,322
False words roll freely
off many tongues,

1148
02:21:08,425 --> 02:21:11,292
but look at him, my lord.

1149
02:21:12,930 --> 02:21:16,798
These tears do not deceive.

1150
02:21:21,004 --> 02:21:22,528
Father,

1151
02:21:23,140 --> 02:21:25,734
come with me.

1152
02:21:26,143 --> 02:21:28,202
Come live with me

1153
02:21:28,512 --> 02:21:30,810
and forget this frightful dream.

1154
02:21:34,017 --> 02:21:38,545
Please forget what I did.

1155
02:21:39,857 --> 02:21:41,722
Forgive me.

1156
02:21:42,359 --> 02:21:45,726
I was a senile old fool.

1157
02:21:50,300 --> 02:21:51,961
Father!

1158
02:22:11,588 --> 02:22:13,351
All forces...

1159
02:22:17,961 --> 02:22:19,929
attack!

1160
02:23:19,656 --> 02:23:21,647
The enemy has taken cover
in the woods.

1161
02:23:22,225 --> 02:23:25,592
Our superior strength
is useless there.

1162
02:23:26,096 --> 02:23:29,190
Then we'll burn them out!

1163
02:23:53,690 --> 02:23:55,089
Charge!

1164
02:24:10,073 --> 02:24:11,700
Press the attack!

1165
02:24:12,476 --> 02:24:14,444
Press the attack!

1166
02:24:17,247 --> 02:24:18,339
Pull back!

1167
02:24:22,085 --> 02:24:23,074
Pull back!

1168
02:24:28,592 --> 02:24:30,583
We should be crushing them!

1169
02:24:30,794 --> 02:24:32,421
Forward!

1170
02:25:14,771 --> 02:25:16,363
My lord!

1171
02:25:23,180 --> 02:25:26,877
Ayabe's army has crossed the border.
He's marching on your castle!

1172
02:25:27,284 --> 02:25:28,945
What?

1173
02:25:29,152 --> 02:25:31,552
Ayabe is on that ridge!

1174
02:25:39,262 --> 02:25:42,527
Damn it!
Those troops are decoys!

1175
02:25:50,307 --> 02:25:53,037
Pull back!

1176
02:26:40,924 --> 02:26:42,050
After them!

1177
02:26:48,632 --> 02:26:50,099
After them!

1178
02:27:42,118 --> 02:27:43,745
Cease pursuit!

1179
02:27:56,566 --> 02:27:58,124
Again!

1180
02:28:15,118 --> 02:28:17,814
I have so much to tell you.

1181
02:28:18,521 --> 02:28:20,148
Saburo,

1182
02:28:21,091 --> 02:28:23,719
you and I will talk quietly alone,

1183
02:28:25,028 --> 02:28:28,464
just father and son.

1184
02:28:30,867 --> 02:28:33,267
That's all I want.

1185
02:28:34,537 --> 02:28:36,471
Nothing else.

1186
02:29:14,210 --> 02:29:16,144
He's dead.

1187
02:29:20,617 --> 02:29:22,551
I've got wits enough to see that!

1188
02:29:37,267 --> 02:29:39,201
Saburo's dead.

1189
02:29:40,770 --> 02:29:43,864
You and I live...

1190
02:29:45,141 --> 02:29:47,041
but Saburo is -

1191
02:29:59,622 --> 02:30:01,487
You can't die.

1192
02:30:04,127 --> 02:30:05,890
I have things to tell you...

1193
02:30:08,298 --> 02:30:10,129
forgiveness to beg.

1194
02:30:13,103 --> 02:30:14,934
How can this be?

1195
02:30:17,073 --> 02:30:20,941
Are you really gone forever?

1196
02:30:24,014 --> 02:30:25,709
Don't touch me!

1197
02:30:33,857 --> 02:30:36,417
It grows dark.

1198
02:30:38,161 --> 02:30:40,459
Wretched old age!

1199
02:30:41,097 --> 02:30:42,826
This is the end.

1200
02:30:47,437 --> 02:30:49,803
My lord!

1201
02:31:02,385 --> 02:31:05,149
No, my lord!

1202
02:31:11,594 --> 02:31:14,995
Kyoami, do not call
his spirit back.

1203
02:31:16,433 --> 02:31:19,402
Would you have him suffer
still more?

1204
02:31:26,009 --> 02:31:27,033
<i>Lord Saburo!</i>

1205
02:31:37,720 --> 02:31:39,585
A surprise attack
by Ayabe's forces

1206
02:31:39,789 --> 02:31:43,555
has sent the enemy in retreat
to the First Castle!

1207
02:31:44,027 --> 02:31:46,120
Victory is ours!

1208
02:31:48,731 --> 02:31:50,323
How can this be?

1209
02:31:54,204 --> 02:31:56,672
Of all things, at this moment,

1210
02:31:56,906 --> 02:31:59,500
why did Master Saburo
have to die?

1211
02:32:00,176 --> 02:32:03,339
Why did Lord Hidetora
have to go?

1212
02:32:05,682 --> 02:32:08,617
Are there no gods,
no buddhas?

1213
02:32:10,487 --> 02:32:12,421
If you exist, hear my words:

1214
02:32:12,722 --> 02:32:15,088
You're all cruel
and fickle pranksters!

1215
02:32:16,693 --> 02:32:18,593
You ease your boredom
in the heavens

1216
02:32:18,795 --> 02:32:21,958
by crushing us like worms!

1217
02:32:22,532 --> 02:32:23,931
Damn you!

1218
02:32:24,134 --> 02:32:26,796
Is it such sport
to see us weep and howl?

1219
02:32:27,003 --> 02:32:29,699
Stop it!
Do not curse the gods!

1220
02:32:31,141 --> 02:32:33,473
It is they who weep.

1221
02:32:35,245 --> 02:32:38,737
In every age they've watched us
tread the path of evil,

1222
02:32:38,982 --> 02:32:41,815
unable to live
without killing each other.

1223
02:32:42,819 --> 02:32:45,549
They can't save us
from ourselves.

1224
02:32:51,461 --> 02:32:52,894
Stop your crying!

1225
02:32:54,597 --> 02:32:56,428
Such is the way of the world.

1226
02:32:57,167 --> 02:32:59,692
Men live not for joy
but for sorrow,

1227
02:32:59,903 --> 02:33:02,371
not for peace
but for suffering.

1228
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:06,373
Look at those
in the First Castle.

1229
02:33:06,609 --> 02:33:10,170
Even now they vie for the greater
share of sorrow and suffering

1230
02:33:10,380 --> 02:33:12,610
and revel
in their mutual slaughter.

1231
02:33:25,461 --> 02:33:26,928
My lord!

1232
02:33:28,097 --> 02:33:31,362
We will defend this position.
You must go to the keep.

1233
02:33:50,186 --> 02:33:52,586
Inside!

1234
02:33:52,822 --> 02:33:55,814
Hurry up!
Close the gate!

1235
02:33:56,059 --> 02:33:57,856
Where's Lord Jiro?

1236
02:33:58,428 --> 02:34:02,592
Whose head is that,
Saburo's or Hidetora's?

1237
02:34:02,799 --> 02:34:05,666
Neither. It is another's,
on order of his lordship.

1238
02:34:06,002 --> 02:34:07,492
What?

1239
02:34:40,270 --> 02:34:41,999
Stop, Kurogane!

1240
02:34:43,273 --> 02:34:46,174
Who rules this domain,
you or Lady Kaede?

1241
02:34:46,376 --> 02:34:50,142
I pledged fealty to you,
but never to her!

1242
02:34:58,154 --> 02:34:59,519
She-fox!

1243
02:34:59,722 --> 02:35:03,715
Your vain schemes have destroyed
the house of Ichimonji!

1244
02:35:03,926 --> 02:35:06,759
Do you see now
how foolish you were?

1245
02:35:06,963 --> 02:35:08,794
On the contrary.

1246
02:35:10,333 --> 02:35:13,825
My sole desire
was to avenge my family

1247
02:35:14,237 --> 02:35:16,705
by watching
the house of Ichimonji fall

1248
02:35:16,939 --> 02:35:19,271
and seeing this castle burn.

1249
02:35:33,956 --> 02:35:35,617
Silence!

1250
02:35:37,527 --> 02:35:38,619
My lord,

1251
02:35:39,295 --> 02:35:41,627
we are undone.
Prepare to die.

1252
02:35:41,831 --> 02:35:44,356
I will follow you directly.

1253
02:42:28,938 --> 02:42:33,068
Directed by
AKIRA KUROSAWA

1254
02:42:35,611 --> 02:42:39,274
THE END
