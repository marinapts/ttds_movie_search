1
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,295
Do it!

2
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:49,615
You got him! You got him!

3
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:06,335
<i>I only ever met one man
I wouldn't wanna fight.</i>

4
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:08,015
I can't stop that.

5
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,935
Get out of here, you useless tit.

6
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:12,935
<i>When I met him, he was already the best
cut man in the business.</i>

7
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:14,255
Can you stop it?

8
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:17,615
<i>Started training and managing
in the '60s, but he never lost his gift.</i>

9
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:19,335
No.

10
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:28,375
Let me have a look at him.

11
00:01:28,695 --> 00:01:30,135
He's fine. He's fine.

12
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:32,495
He ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.

13
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:34,215
I'll give you one more round.

14
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:39,055
-Seconds out. Let's go.
-What do we do? Tell me what to do.

15
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,175
You let him hit you.

16
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:47,175
<i>Sometimes there's just
nothing you can do.</i>

17
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:50,375
<i>Cut's too wide, too close to the bone.</i>

18
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:53,015
<i>Maybe you got a severed vein...</i>

19
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:55,815
<i>...or you just can't get the coagulant
deep enough.</i>

20
00:01:56,895 --> 00:01:58,295
-Come on!
-Break. Break.

21
00:01:58,455 --> 00:02:01,015
<i>There are all kinds of combinations
you come up against...</i>

22
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:03,335
<i>...down in the different layers of meat...</i>

23
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:05,335
<i>...and Frankie knew
how to work every one.</i>

24
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:16,655
-That's it! Come on!
-What are you doing?

25
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:22,775
Knock him out, Willie!

26
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:32,815
<i>People love violence.</i>

27
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,215
<i>They'll slow down at a car wreck
to check for bodies.</i>

28
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,575
<i>Same people claim to love boxing.</i>

29
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:40,975
<i>They got no idea what it is.</i>

30
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,535
<i>Boxing is about respect.</i>

31
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:45,455
<i>Getting it for yourself...</i>

32
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:48,815
<i>...and taking it away from the other guy.</i>

33
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:53,975
I'll warm up the car.

34
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:55,495
Mr. Dunn?

35
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:57,575
I owe you money?

36
00:02:57,735 --> 00:02:58,935
No, sir.

37
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,535
I know your mama?

38
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:02,735
Don't rightly know, sir.

39
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:05,295
-Then what is it you want?
-I was on the undercard.

40
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:07,935
I won my fight too. Maggie Fitzgerald.

41
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:10,575
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

42
00:03:11,055 --> 00:03:12,975
-Did you happen to see it?
-Nope.

43
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:14,535
I did pretty good.

44
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,095
Thought you might be interested
in training me.

45
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:18,895
I don't train girls.

46
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:22,375
Maybe you should. People see me fight
say I'm pretty tough.

47
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:26,295
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

48
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:40,695
It's a mistake.

49
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,695
Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

50
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,255
Just push, will you?

51
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:53,935
-What did Hogan want?
-Offered us a title shot.

52
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:55,855
About time.

53
00:03:56,055 --> 00:03:57,935
I turned him down flat.

54
00:03:58,135 --> 00:04:01,375
Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.

55
00:04:05,175 --> 00:04:08,535
Been two or three more fights
for a long time now, Frankie.

56
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:11,015
Look, Willie,
you get one shot at the title.

57
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:13,095
You lose it,
it may not come around again.

58
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:16,935
Now, two or three more fights
and we'll be ready.

59
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:19,655
Whatever you say, Frankie.

60
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:24,455
<i>Frankie liked to say that boxing
is an unnatural act...</i>

61
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:27,575
<i>...that everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

62
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:30,695
<i>Sometimes...</i>

63
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,415
<i>...best way to deliver a punch
is step back.</i>

64
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,415
Well, do your best, Lord...

65
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:47,695
...protect Katy.

66
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:50,255
Annie too.

67
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:52,615
Other than that...

68
00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:56,575
...you know what I want,
there's no use me repeating myself.

69
00:04:57,015 --> 00:05:01,415
<i>But step back too far,
you ain't fighting at all.</i>

70
00:05:16,855 --> 00:05:19,255
-Bye.
-Bye.

71
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:22,895
Father, that was a great sermon.
Made me weep.

72
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:24,455
What's confusing you this week?

73
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,975
Oh, it's the same old
one-God-three-God thing.

74
00:05:27,135 --> 00:05:30,255
Frankie, most people figure out
by kindergarten it's about faith.

75
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:34,735
Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop
all rolled up in one big box?

76
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:38,895
You're standing outside my church
comparing God to Rice Krispies?

77
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:41,735
The only reason you come to Mass
is to wind me up.

78
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:43,855
-It won't happen this morning.
-I'm confused.

79
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:45,295
-No, you aren't.
-Yes, I am.

80
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:48,495
Then here's your answer:
There's one God.

81
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:50,095
Anything else? Because I'm busy.

82
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:52,975
-What about the Holy Ghost?
-He's an expression of God's love.

83
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:55,615
-And Jesus?
-Son of God. Don't play stupid.

84
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,055
What is he then?
Does that make him a demigod?

85
00:05:58,215 --> 00:06:00,495
There are no demigods,
you fucking pagan!

86
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:08,495
-Did you write your daughter?
-Absolutely.

87
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:10,135
Now you're lying to a priest.

88
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,735
You know what? Take a day off,
don't come to Mass tomorrow.

89
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:27,695
<i>Some people would say the most important
thing a fighter can have is heart.</i>

90
00:06:28,295 --> 00:06:31,535
<i>Frankie would say, "Show me a fighter
who's nothing but heart...</i>

91
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:34,735
<i>...and I'll show you a man
waiting for a beating. "</i>

92
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:46,015
<i>Think I only ever met one fighter
who was all heart.</i>

93
00:06:47,335 --> 00:06:50,695
My name's Dangerous Dillard
Fighting Flippo Bam-Bam Barch...

94
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:52,655
...out of Broward County, Texas!

95
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,975
<i>Danger showed up
a couple of years back.</i>

96
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:03,615
<i>He'd come visiting L.A. with Ervel,
his mama's new boyfriend.</i>

97
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:08,855
<i>Apparently Ervel got lost
and ended up back in Texas.</i>

98
00:07:09,615 --> 00:07:13,415
<i>Danger looked for him for about a week
before he introduced himself.</i>

99
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:20,015
Hey, you know, I gots nothing
against niggers.

100
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,335
Well, that's nice to hear.

101
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:27,895
Yeah, lots of people where
I comes from does...

102
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:31,535
...but my mama taught me
not to cause hurt to no man...

103
00:07:31,695 --> 00:07:33,295
...niggers or not.

104
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,975
You got a nice mama.
Anything else I can do for you?

105
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:38,335
<i>Just one of those questions you ask...</i>

106
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,575
<i>...but Danger wanted to give it
his best answer.</i>

107
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:44,615
Well, sir, I'd likes to become
the welterweight champion of the world.

108
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:49,575
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra...

109
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,375
...Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

110
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:55,455
...to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world!

111
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:58,135
Yo, Flip, shut up, man!
You ain't even ranked.

112
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:01,015
You gotta have at least one fight
to be ranked.

113
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:03,415
Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!

114
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:05,455
Hey, you a bad man, huh?

115
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:07,535
Get in the ring. Go a round with me.

116
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:10,415
-Shawrelle.
-I will.

117
00:08:10,935 --> 00:08:12,735
Leave him alone.

118
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:16,055
Danger, you go on back to training.

119
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:18,815
Will do, Mr. Scrap.

120
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:24,175
Them's some nice tights, Danger.

121
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:27,255
I'll give you that ass-whupping later,
Olive Oyl.

122
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:29,615
Hey, bro, those pants look
real pretty on you.

123
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:31,375
Give his mama back her tights.

124
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:35,215
<i>Shawrelle Berry had a left hook
that would move a tank...</i>

125
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:38,295
<i>...but he had a heart
the size of a split pea.</i>

126
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:42,495
<i>Frankie bought the Hit Pit
from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.</i>

127
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,815
<i>Bobby wanted to move to Florida,
and Frankie wanted some security.</i>

128
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:48,455
<i>Bobby died while he was packing.</i>

129
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:52,815
<i>And Frankie found out
most gyms lose money.</i>

130
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:55,975
I thought I told you I didn't want
Danger working out here anymore.

131
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,655
He ain't hurting nothing, Frankie.

132
00:08:58,295 --> 00:08:59,615
Well, he's hurting me.

133
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:03,775
Breaking my heart, watching him punch
the air like he thinks it's gonna punch back.

134
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:07,295
And how many times have I gotta tell you
that bleach is bleach?

135
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:10,895
Why can't you buy the cheap stuff?
You don't have to buy the expensive stuff.

136
00:09:11,095 --> 00:09:12,815
It smells better, Frankie.

137
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:15,415
Bleach smells like bleach.

138
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:27,135
-Hey, Scrap.
-Hey, Mr. Willie.

139
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,255
Hey, nice fight last night.

140
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,135
Nice fight.

141
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,935
-Big Willie.
-Hey, Sally.

142
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:46,495
-Nice fight.
-Thanks, man.

143
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:48,255
People are talking.

144
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:06,175
What the hell kind of language is that?

145
00:10:06,695 --> 00:10:08,055
What do you want?

146
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:11,375
I thought you might like to know
you got a fighter out there...

147
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:13,135
...not talking to another manager.

148
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:16,575
Not talking to another manager?

149
00:10:16,735 --> 00:10:18,295
And not just any manager.

150
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:20,975
Mickey Mack.

151
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:26,855
You came in here to tell me that Big Willie
is not talking to Mickey Mack.

152
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:29,335
Not a word. Neither one of them.

153
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:32,455
I'm trying to read here.

154
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:34,775
Well, if you think that's more important.

155
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:38,455
Who's your new girl?

156
00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:41,255
What?

157
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:53,295
Jesus Christ.

158
00:10:53,495 --> 00:10:54,735
Better hurry up.

159
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:57,615
She keeps hitting it like that,
she gonna break her wrists.

160
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:08,375
You're wasting your time.
I told you I don't train girls.

161
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,095
Thought you might change your mind.

162
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:14,135
Dozens of trainers train girls.
You won't have any trouble finding one.

163
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:16,695
Don't hardly need a dozen, boss.
You'll do fine.

164
00:11:16,855 --> 00:11:20,335
Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss,
and don't you be calling me that.

165
00:11:20,495 --> 00:11:23,095
-Willie, you ready to work?
-Anytime.

166
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:26,055
If I stop calling you boss,
will you train me?

167
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,295
No.

168
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,295
Then I might as well keep calling you it.

169
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:34,415
<i>She came from southwestern Missouri...</i>

170
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:38,455
<i>...the hills outside the scratch-ass
Ozark town of Theodosia...</i>

171
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:43,455
<i>...set in the cedars and oak trees
somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.</i>

172
00:11:43,655 --> 00:11:47,575
<i>She grew up knowing one thing:
She was trash.</i>

173
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,255
It's for my dog.

174
00:12:02,495 --> 00:12:07,735
<i>She'd come 1800 miles,
but Theodosia was still just over the hill.</i>

175
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:26,695
Working the bag, boss.

176
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:30,855
I'm not your boss.
And that bag's working you.

177
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:46,175
Give her her money back.

178
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:48,695
You sure?

179
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,695
-How much did she pay?
-Six months.

180
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:55,095
-Jesus Christ.
-No, I'll give it back.

181
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:57,615
No, don't be a smartass now, will you?

182
00:12:57,775 --> 00:13:00,295
Woman thinks I'll throw away
six months' worth of dues...

183
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:02,575
...just to get rid of her,
she's out of her mind.

184
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:05,295
-But just don't encourage her, understand?
-Okay.

185
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:09,095
And what's Danger doing out there?
What's he looking at?

186
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,535
Looks like a bottle of water.

187
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:17,895
He paid his dues?

188
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:22,415
Dues? Boy can't afford pants.
Want him to pay dues?

189
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:25,375
Get out of my office.

190
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:35,895
Fuck me.

191
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:21,615
Can't think of it as a bag.

192
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:29,015
I'm not a trainer,
but I can show you this if you'd like.

193
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:31,215
Appreciate any help I can get.

194
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:36,455
What you wanna do is,
you wanna think of it as a man, see?

195
00:14:36,615 --> 00:14:37,855
And he's constantly moving.

196
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:42,295
He's moving towards you, around you,
away from you. All right?

197
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:46,815
Don't hit him when he's coming towards you
because he's just gonna push you back...

198
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:50,175
...he's gonna smother your punches
and take your balance, right?

199
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:51,815
So you watch him real carefully.

200
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,175
Keep rotating.
That keeps your head moving.

201
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:57,935
And keep one shoulder back so you're
always ready to fire a power shot.

202
00:14:58,095 --> 00:15:02,655
Right? Go ahead, now. Good, good.
Keep rotating, keep moving. That's it.

203
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,895
Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

204
00:15:06,935 --> 00:15:09,815
Come on around.
Keep moving, keep moving.

205
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,535
-Good, good, good.
-Like that?

206
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:14,055
Yeah. Give it a few shots.

207
00:15:16,055 --> 00:15:18,455
Tuck that chin in, now.
Tuck that chin in.

208
00:15:19,415 --> 00:15:21,335
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

209
00:15:21,695 --> 00:15:25,135
Now, you get this down,
we'll put you on the speed bag.

210
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:29,895
You do have a speed bag.

211
00:15:40,535 --> 00:15:42,975
I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.

212
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:44,655
All right, you go on home now.

213
00:15:44,855 --> 00:15:47,575
-I'll walk out with you?
-No, I am home.

214
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:49,855
-Wanna see?
-Yeah.

215
00:15:58,455 --> 00:15:59,695
It's nice.

216
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:04,535
Would it bother you
if I worked a little longer?

217
00:16:05,535 --> 00:16:08,895
No, just pull the door closed
when you leave.

218
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:12,735
Thank you.

219
00:16:27,935 --> 00:16:29,895
<i>If there's magic in boxing...</i>

220
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:33,535
<i>...it's the magic of fighting battles
beyond endurance...</i>

221
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:38,775
<i>...beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys
and detached retinas.</i>

222
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:54,095

223
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:05,335
Okay, okay, fellas, watch the footwork.

224
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:07,255
Hey, that's it. That's it.

225
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:09,255
Hands up.

226
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:12,135
Jab, jab, jab.

227
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:26,935
Hey, Flip.

228
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:29,135
Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

229
00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:31,815
I think I found somebody you can beat.

230
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:36,815
I don't fights women.

231
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,175
Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro,
because you know why?

232
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,895
Because she--
Like, you, you could fight to him...

233
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:44,655
...and then you could kiss to him.

234
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,415
Then you fight to him one more time.

235
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,175
That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.

236
00:17:49,495 --> 00:17:51,695
-It's like poetry.
-You been reading and shit.

237
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:54,295
-Thanks, bro.
-That's a girl, man?

238
00:17:54,535 --> 00:17:58,735
Flip, I think you right. Look at her little
bitty titties. They're like mosquito bites.

239
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:01,455
Man, that's barely even a mouthful.
Let me see.

240
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,175
Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

241
00:18:03,335 --> 00:18:06,135
Spent so much time face down,
I thought the canvas had titties.

242
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:15,495
Canvas has titties.
Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.

243
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,095
Just humping the canvas.
Humping the floor.

244
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:31,295
Come on, bro. The floor having titties?
That's funny, bro.

245
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:34,335
Shut up, man.
What you laughing at?

246
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:37,095
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

247
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:39,575
Some titties right there, man.

248
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:44,415
Yo, when they start making those tights
for men, Flippy?

249
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:46,055
Punk.

250
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:49,975
All right, that's enough.
That's enough for the day.

251
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:55,255
-I'll give you a rubdown.
-Oh, I can't, Frankie.

252
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:58,335
Middle one's got a piano lesson.
I told Grace I'd drive her.

253
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:01,495
-Something wrong with Gracie's car?
-She hates that car.

254
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:04,815
Wants the old one back,
but the dealer said he's already got a buyer.

255
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:06,575
Maybe I should talk to the dealer.

256
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:09,335
I'd appreciate that.

257
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:10,775
Okay.

258
00:19:10,935 --> 00:19:13,615
-Thanks.
-See you later.

259
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,375
The man's a rubdown whore.
Today he doesn't want one.

260
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:27,215
You ever do any work around here?

261
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:30,535
Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.

262
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:35,655
Little girl seems to be coming along.

263
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:40,575
Yeah. It's almost like
someone's been helping her.

264
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:45,335
She might just be a natural.
Looks like she's got something.

265
00:19:47,415 --> 00:19:50,415
She's got my speed bag,
that's what she's got.

266
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:53,215
I wonder how the hell she got that.

267
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,855
I wonder.

268
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:06,375
I'm gonna need that speed bag back.

269
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:08,935
-This bag?
-Yes, that bag. That's my bag.

270
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:11,855
And if you're hitting it,
people will think I'm training you.

271
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:13,495
Is that such a bad thing, boss?

272
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:15,575
Yes. Yes, it is.

273
00:20:15,735 --> 00:20:18,775
Every time you touch it,
you're losing me business out here.

274
00:20:18,935 --> 00:20:22,095
-I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.
-Yeah.

275
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,775
Well, I can't just lend it
to anybody, you know.

276
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:27,215
I understand.

277
00:20:28,415 --> 00:20:29,415
Yeah.

278
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:33,975
Look, you seem like a nice girl.

279
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:36,975
-Can I give you some advice?
-I'd appreciate that.

280
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:39,975
You'll find a trainer in this gym
or somewhere else...

281
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:42,095
...that's gonna wanna train a girl.

282
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:44,375
It's the latest freak show out there.

283
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,855
The trouble is, they're gonna be
wasting your time...

284
00:20:47,015 --> 00:20:48,615
...because you're too old.

285
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:51,175
I don't feel that old.

286
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:54,735
Well, neither do I, but you don't see me
fighting 21 -year-olds, do you?

287
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:58,255
Takes about four years to train a fighter.

288
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:00,415
How old are you?

289
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:04,295
-Thirty-one until my next birthday.
-Oh, well, there you go.

290
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:05,935
Thirty-one.

291
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:09,615
You wouldn't start training to be
a ballerina at 31, would you?

292
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:11,655
Already been working it
for three years.

293
00:21:12,015 --> 00:21:15,335
And you can't hit a speed bag?
What kind of training is that?

294
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:17,295
Never had any, boss.

295
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,575
Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.

296
00:21:20,735 --> 00:21:22,735
Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

297
00:21:23,175 --> 00:21:25,775
I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

298
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:27,495
Yeah.

299
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:31,615
Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.

300
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:37,295
-You're not gonna cry now, are you?
-No, sir.

301
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:39,335
Yeah.

302
00:21:41,415 --> 00:21:42,855
Here.

303
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,255
-Keep the goddamn thing.
-No, you need it.

304
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:48,175
No, take the bag.

305
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:51,375
I haven't seen it in 20 years anyway.

306
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:55,735
I've had three since then.
Just enjoy it, will you?

307
00:21:55,895 --> 00:21:58,415
-I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.
-Yeah.

308
00:21:59,255 --> 00:22:00,935
Just don't lose it.

309
00:22:09,175 --> 00:22:10,655
Yeah, I know, Hogan...

310
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:13,495
...your guy's the champ,
so we don't split 50s...

311
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:16,215
...but if I don't see 40 percent--

312
00:22:17,055 --> 00:22:20,775
Look, you call me back when it's 60-40
or don't call me back at all.

313
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:32,095
-Hey, Willie.
-Hey, Frankie.

314
00:22:32,255 --> 00:22:33,775
Something wrong?

315
00:22:33,975 --> 00:22:37,655
I'm sorry to come by your house like this.
I know you don't like people dropping in.

316
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:41,055
Oh, you're not people, Willie.
You're welcome anytime. Come on in.

317
00:22:41,255 --> 00:22:43,975
I wanted to thank you
for getting Gracie's car back.

318
00:22:44,135 --> 00:22:45,895
Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.

319
00:22:46,055 --> 00:22:50,095
Paying an extra thousand dollars
for your own car ain't exactly a favor.

320
00:22:50,255 --> 00:22:52,015
Gracie cried when she saw it.

321
00:22:52,215 --> 00:22:53,775
Really?

322
00:22:54,695 --> 00:22:56,775
I also needed to talk with you
about business.

323
00:22:56,935 --> 00:23:00,775
Oh, yeah, well, I just got off the phone
with Hogan. We're all set for September.

324
00:23:00,975 --> 00:23:02,735
Everything but the split.

325
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,655
I gotta leave you, Frankie.

326
00:23:06,855 --> 00:23:08,015
What?

327
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:14,455
Willie, the title's just two fights away.

328
00:23:14,615 --> 00:23:18,695
It ain't that, it's--
It's like you said, I got one shot.

329
00:23:19,255 --> 00:23:21,655
If I win, I gotta make
as much as I can while I can.

330
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:25,455
I need somebody in the action
who can make things happen.

331
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:29,095
And I gotta make the change
before the fight.

332
00:23:29,255 --> 00:23:32,535
Only way this guy say he'd take me
is if he took me to the title.

333
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:36,415
So I get you the title fight,
and this guy takes you there?

334
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:37,775
Only way he'd do it.

335
00:23:38,655 --> 00:23:42,255
I'm sorry, Frankie. I know how long
you waiting on a title.

336
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,895
I wish it could've been with me.

337
00:23:45,655 --> 00:23:49,455
Mickey Mack's a businessman.
He can't teach you nothing.

338
00:23:50,215 --> 00:23:52,335
You already taught me
everything I need to know.

339
00:24:00,615 --> 00:24:03,415
<i>There's some things people
just don't want to hear.</i>

340
00:24:13,855 --> 00:24:18,415
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

341
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:22,695
...to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world.

342
00:24:22,855 --> 00:24:25,455
Danger, I'm wearing
these mitts for a reason.

343
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:29,455
Just working on my footwork, Mr. Scrap.

344
00:24:30,175 --> 00:24:33,975
Danger, you throw a punch
or get the hell out of this gym.

345
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:41,495
Danger, while you thinking about
that punch, I'll be right back.

346
00:24:42,775 --> 00:24:46,695
I'm thinking how I'm gonna hit it hard
for you, Mr. Scrap.

347
00:24:51,495 --> 00:24:57,455
<i>No one had the heart to tell Danger
that Hearns retired years ago.</i>

348
00:25:04,455 --> 00:25:06,415
I heard about Willie.

349
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:09,655
That's cold. That's dead cold.

350
00:25:09,815 --> 00:25:12,695
Of course, it wouldn't be so bad
if you weren't so damn old.

351
00:25:12,855 --> 00:25:15,655
Yeah, well, at least I can see
through both eyes.

352
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:18,215
Didn't do you
a lot of good though, did it?

353
00:25:19,575 --> 00:25:21,295
Well, I've got the gym.

354
00:25:21,495 --> 00:25:24,735
Don't need to be training fighters
at my age.

355
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,295
Willie tell you why?

356
00:25:27,455 --> 00:25:30,255
It was Mickey.
Mickey's got the connections.

357
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:33,615
Oh, it ain't about connections.
It's about you not believing in him.

358
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:36,335
Well, I found him,
I stuck with him for eight years.

359
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,415
How's that for not believing in him?

360
00:25:38,575 --> 00:25:41,815
You could've got him a title fight
two years ago. Hell, he knew that.

361
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:44,015
I'm amazed he stayed around this long.

362
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:47,295
Well, getting there and taking home
the belt are two different things.

363
00:25:47,455 --> 00:25:50,255
What was I supposed to do,
just put him in over his head?

364
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,695
Not protect him?

365
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:54,135
Oh, you were protecting him
from the championship.

366
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:57,655
-Yeah.
-Well, now it makes sense.

367
00:25:57,815 --> 00:26:01,255
Well, what about you, Scrap?
What did your manager do?

368
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:03,535
You were a hell of a fighter,
better than Willie.

369
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:06,895
He get you a title fight,
or did he just bust you out...

370
00:26:07,055 --> 00:26:10,375
...banging your head against other
people's fists until you lost your eye?

371
00:26:10,855 --> 00:26:12,575
I had my shot.

372
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:15,215
I went out swinging,
and no man can say I didn't.

373
00:26:15,415 --> 00:26:16,575
Yeah, well, I remember.

374
00:26:16,735 --> 00:26:20,335
And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter
spending the second half of his life...

375
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:23,575
-...cleaning up other people's spit.
-Yeah, right.

376
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:27,695
Right, you're the smart one.
You're the one learning Greek.

377
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:29,815
It's Gaelic.

378
00:26:29,975 --> 00:26:32,975
Well, you just protected yourself
out of a championship fight.

379
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,855
How do you say that in Gaelic?

380
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:42,535
Sorry.

381
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,775
Thanks.

382
00:27:51,055 --> 00:27:55,015
<i>The action continues as the champ
is battling Big Willie Jones...</i>

383
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:57,095
<i>...and commanding him
with rights and lefts.</i>

384
00:27:57,255 --> 00:27:59,815
<i>Up against the ropes,
he's hitting him with the left....</i>

385
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:03,335
<i>Boxing is an unnatural act.</i>

386
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:06,695
<i>Because everything in it is backwards.</i>

387
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:10,415
<i>You wanna move to the left...</i>

388
00:28:10,615 --> 00:28:13,815
<i>...you don't step left,
you push on the right toe.</i>

389
00:28:14,935 --> 00:28:18,295
<i>To move right, you use your left toe.</i>

390
00:28:18,455 --> 00:28:22,255
<i>Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do...</i>

391
00:28:22,415 --> 00:28:23,815
<i>...you step into it.</i>

392
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:29,095
<i>But Big Willie comes back. Oh, my God,
he hits the champ with a right hand.</i>

393
00:28:29,255 --> 00:28:31,575
<i>And the champ is down.</i>

394
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:33,935
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
the ref is in for the count.</i>

395
00:28:34,135 --> 00:28:37,335
<i>And Big Willie Jones
is the new champion of the world.</i>

396
00:28:37,495 --> 00:28:40,975
<i>It's unbelievable how
this has taken place tonight...</i>

397
00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:44,335
<i>...but there you have it, folks,
a new champion.</i>

398
00:28:45,815 --> 00:28:48,815
<i>Everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

399
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:05,095
Want a cheeseburger?

400
00:29:05,255 --> 00:29:06,975
-You bought me a cheeseburger?
-Yeah.

401
00:29:07,135 --> 00:29:09,095
I never see you buy anybody
a cheeseburger.

402
00:29:09,255 --> 00:29:12,175
Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it.
You want it?

403
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:15,295
Well, I guess the planet
can go back to spinning.

404
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:20,215
-You watch the fight?
-Yeah, I watched it.

405
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:22,575
Willie did good.

406
00:29:23,615 --> 00:29:25,175
That's what you've got to say?

407
00:29:25,335 --> 00:29:27,855
Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

408
00:29:28,815 --> 00:29:33,015
I see you been working on yourself,
learning to open up. That's good work.

409
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:34,855
You watch it?

410
00:29:35,095 --> 00:29:37,135
Yeah, I got HBO.

411
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:40,295
Now, how can you afford HBO?

412
00:29:40,455 --> 00:29:44,135
How long have I been telling you
to save your money?

413
00:29:44,295 --> 00:29:46,695
Ever since I fought
Louis "Typhoon" Johnson...

414
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:48,975
...at the Stadium Club
in Tupelo, Mississippi.

415
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:51,735
-That true?
-Yeah.

416
00:29:51,895 --> 00:29:55,415
Manager ran off
and left you and me to hitch home.

417
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:56,815
Don't you remember nothing?

418
00:29:57,015 --> 00:30:01,255
Well, I remember walking halfway
and thinking I was gonna be lynched.

419
00:30:01,455 --> 00:30:05,175
I remember you leaving me with my dick
in my hand behind that gas station.

420
00:30:05,335 --> 00:30:08,655
Yeah, well, I got a ride. The guy took off
before I hardly closed the door.

421
00:30:08,855 --> 00:30:11,215
I had to walk back two miles.

422
00:30:11,415 --> 00:30:14,415
Your conscience got the better of you,
that's what.

423
00:30:17,655 --> 00:30:19,535
What the hell's that?

424
00:30:19,895 --> 00:30:21,975
It's her birthday.

425
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:46,295
You're not breathing right.
That's why you're panting.

426
00:30:47,135 --> 00:30:49,175
So it's your birthday, huh?

427
00:30:49,335 --> 00:30:51,495
How old does that make you?

428
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:54,415
I'm 32, Mr. Dunn.

429
00:30:54,615 --> 00:30:58,015
I'm celebrating that I spent another year
scraping dishes and waitressing...

430
00:30:58,175 --> 00:31:00,055
...which is what I been doing since 13.

431
00:31:00,255 --> 00:31:05,055
And according to you, I'll be 37
before I can even throw a decent punch...

432
00:31:05,215 --> 00:31:07,855
...which after working this speed bag
for a month and getting nowhere...

433
00:31:08,015 --> 00:31:10,095
...I now realize may be God's simple truth.

434
00:31:10,295 --> 00:31:12,335
Other truth is, my brother's in prison...

435
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,935
...my sister cheats on welfare by pretending
one of her kids is still alive...

436
00:31:16,095 --> 00:31:18,575
...my daddy's dead,
and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

437
00:31:19,255 --> 00:31:21,895
If I was thinking straight,
I'd go back home...

438
00:31:22,055 --> 00:31:26,295
...find a used trailer,
buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

439
00:31:26,735 --> 00:31:30,055
The problem is, this is the only thing
I ever felt good doing.

440
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:33,135
If I'm too old for this, then I got nothing.

441
00:31:34,015 --> 00:31:35,695
That enough truth to suit you?

442
00:31:37,775 --> 00:31:39,015
This your speed bag?

443
00:31:39,175 --> 00:31:42,055
Put yours behind the counter.
Wish I could say I wore it out.

444
00:31:44,295 --> 00:31:47,335
Okay, just hold it. Hold it.

445
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:50,495
I'll show you a few things,
and then we'll get you a trainer.

446
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:52,215
No, sorry.

447
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,775
-You're in a position to negotiate?
-Yes, sir.

448
00:31:54,935 --> 00:31:58,735
Because I know if you train me right,
I'm gonna be a champ.

449
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:01,895
I seen you looking at me.

450
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:04,855
-Yeah, out of pity.
-Don't you say that.

451
00:32:05,015 --> 00:32:07,775
Don't you say that if it ain't true.

452
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:09,615
I want a trainer.

453
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:13,495
I don't want charity,
and I don't want favors.

454
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:20,655
If you're not interested,
then I got more celebrating to do.

455
00:32:22,935 --> 00:32:24,975
Stop, stop, stop.

456
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:28,975
Goddamn it, stop.
What the hell are you doing?

457
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:34,135
Okay.

458
00:32:34,455 --> 00:32:35,815
If I'm gonna take you on--

459
00:32:35,975 --> 00:32:39,335
-You won't never regret it.
-Look, just listen to me.

460
00:32:39,495 --> 00:32:42,215
-lf I take you on--
-I promise I'll work so hard.

461
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,655
God, this is a mistake already.

462
00:32:46,575 --> 00:32:48,135
I'm listening, boss.

463
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:53,295
If I take you on, you don't say anything,
you don't question me.

464
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:57,335
You don't ask why, you don't say
anything except maybe, "Yes, Frankie."

465
00:32:57,735 --> 00:33:00,495
And I'm gonna try to forget the fact
that you're a girl.

466
00:33:00,655 --> 00:33:01,815
That's all I ask.

467
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:04,375
And don't come crying to me
if you get hurt.

468
00:33:05,095 --> 00:33:07,015
-Alrighty.
-We got a deal.

469
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:09,295
No, not quite.

470
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:11,335
I'm gonna teach you how to fight...

471
00:33:11,495 --> 00:33:14,095
...then we'll get you a manager,
and I'm off down the road.

472
00:33:14,255 --> 00:33:17,695
-I hate to argue with you, but--
-Don't argue, that's the way we're doing it.

473
00:33:17,855 --> 00:33:21,455
I teach you all you need to know,
and you go off and make a million dollars.

474
00:33:21,655 --> 00:33:24,455
I don't care. You get your teeth
knocked out, I don't care.

475
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:27,695
I don't wanna hear about it.
That's just the way it's gonna be.

476
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:29,335
It's the only way I'll do it.

477
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:38,375
All right.

478
00:33:39,455 --> 00:33:44,215
Now, one of the things I've noticed around
the gym is you never move your feet.

479
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:47,535
You stand there just flat-footed.
You've gotta move your feet.

480
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,775
That's one of the best things
I can teach you.

481
00:33:49,975 --> 00:33:52,655
So here's what you do.

482
00:33:52,895 --> 00:33:55,215
You get yourself--
Bend your knees a little bit.

483
00:33:55,695 --> 00:33:59,095
Get in an athletic position.
Look like you're gonna hit something.

484
00:34:01,335 --> 00:34:04,135
-Move them how, boss?
-Just-- Go-- Hit the bag.

485
00:34:05,935 --> 00:34:07,655
-Stop.
-What'd I do wrong?

486
00:34:07,815 --> 00:34:09,895
Okay, you did two things wrong.

487
00:34:10,055 --> 00:34:13,255
One is you asked a question,
and two is you asked another question.

488
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:17,415
Now, what I want you to do,
it's not about hitting it hard...

489
00:34:17,575 --> 00:34:21,335
...it's how good you hit it. So watch me.

490
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:23,055
You can count with me if you want.

491
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:25,935
It's just count. On a one-count,
I hit right through the bag.

492
00:34:26,135 --> 00:34:28,015
-Can you show me that again?
-I just--

493
00:34:28,215 --> 00:34:30,135
Just say "one," please.

494
00:34:30,295 --> 00:34:31,735
-One.
-Okay.

495
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:33,655
-One. Okay.
-One.

496
00:34:33,815 --> 00:34:36,815
Yeah, just say "one." That's good.
That's good.

497
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:41,455
Then I move over to my right foot. You'll
see my weight is shifting to my right foot.

498
00:34:41,895 --> 00:34:46,615
Then I hit it with my back of my hand, sort
of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

499
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:51,935
Then I come over, and I shift to my left foot,
and I hit it with my right hand.

500
00:34:52,095 --> 00:34:54,575
And ice pick maneuver again.

501
00:34:54,735 --> 00:34:57,655
And I come over on my right foot
and hit it right.

502
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:01,775
Don't watch anything but my feet.

503
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:16,135
Just do it like that. Just keep practicing.

504
00:35:45,015 --> 00:35:48,655
<i>You show them how to stand,
keep their legs under their shoulders.</i>

505
00:35:56,735 --> 00:36:00,255
<i>To make a fighter,
you gotta strip them down to bare wood.</i>

506
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:01,855
Rest when you're dead.

507
00:36:02,015 --> 00:36:03,615
Come here.

508
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:10,495
<i>You can't just tell them
to forget everything you know...</i>

509
00:36:10,655 --> 00:36:13,575
<i>...you gotta make them forget it
in their bones.</i>

510
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:19,695
<i>Make them so tired
they only listen to you.</i>

511
00:36:19,855 --> 00:36:23,735
<i>Only hear your voice,
only do what you say, and nothing else.</i>

512
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:25,095
Move your feet.

513
00:36:25,255 --> 00:36:27,175
Move your feet around. Let's see you go.

514
00:36:41,335 --> 00:36:44,655
<i>Show them how to keep their balance
and take it away from the other guy.</i>

515
00:36:44,855 --> 00:36:48,415
Not so low. Look at me.
Right hook and just turn right.

516
00:36:52,615 --> 00:36:55,215
<i>How to generate momentum
off your right toe.</i>

517
00:36:56,855 --> 00:36:59,535
<i>And how to flex your knees
when you fire a jab.</i>

518
00:37:05,575 --> 00:37:09,655
<i>How to fight backing up, so that the
other guy doesn't wanna come after you.</i>

519
00:37:10,215 --> 00:37:12,335
<i>Then you gotta show them
all over again.</i>

520
00:37:12,535 --> 00:37:14,615
<i>Over and over and over...</i>

521
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:17,655
<i>...till they think they were born that way.</i>

522
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:20,535
Shift.

523
00:37:20,695 --> 00:37:22,535
Shift away.

524
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:26,575
Okay. That's enough for today.

525
00:37:26,735 --> 00:37:30,015
Good work. Good girl.

526
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:33,815
You think I ready for a fight, boss?

527
00:37:55,415 --> 00:37:58,735
Hey. Hey, come here.

528
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:02,575
You're not breathing.

529
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:05,815
Hate to disagree with you.

530
00:38:06,415 --> 00:38:09,135
Every time you get under pressure,
you're holding your breath.

531
00:38:09,295 --> 00:38:12,575
-Now, stop doing that.
-Okay.

532
00:38:12,735 --> 00:38:14,935
But other than that,
I'm doing pretty good, right?

533
00:38:15,455 --> 00:38:18,855
-I mean, for a girl.
-I don't train girls.

534
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:23,615
Think I might be ready
for a fight, boss?

535
00:38:23,775 --> 00:38:27,175
Well, we'll get a manager,
and we'll find out, won't we?

536
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:30,215
I'd like to,
but you been keeping me too busy.

537
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,495
-Got any family, boss?
-What?

538
00:38:41,975 --> 00:38:45,175
You been spending all this time with me,
I didn't know if you had any.

539
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:47,335
No.

540
00:38:48,975 --> 00:38:51,215
Well, I've got a daughter, Katy.

541
00:38:51,975 --> 00:38:53,135
That's family.

542
00:38:53,895 --> 00:38:55,895
We're not exactly close.

543
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,735
How much she weigh?

544
00:38:58,935 --> 00:39:00,175
What?

545
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:03,415
Trouble in my family
comes by the pound.

546
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:07,215
Yeah.

547
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:09,495
Not very big.

548
00:39:09,775 --> 00:39:13,575
Used to be real athletic.
Don't know if she kept it up.

549
00:39:19,415 --> 00:39:22,775
So, what do you think?

550
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:24,775
I ready for a fight?

551
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:32,015
Hey, Sally.

552
00:39:33,575 --> 00:39:35,015
Come here for a minute, will you?

553
00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:39,535
Frankie, I need to see you
in the back for a minute, okay?

554
00:39:40,175 --> 00:39:43,375
-Can I see you a minute?
-Sally here's a real good manager.

555
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:47,335
Has a couple of Golden Glove boys.
Looking for a girl, Sally?

556
00:39:47,535 --> 00:39:49,415
I'm looking for a good one.

557
00:39:49,815 --> 00:39:52,615
Well, see, there you go.

558
00:39:55,255 --> 00:39:56,975
Nice working with you, girlie.

559
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:02,935
-What'd you want?
-Nothing. It's nothing.

560
00:40:03,095 --> 00:40:07,055
I ain't lying, I've been watching you work.
You got a hell of a left.

561
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:08,775
Thank you.

562
00:40:10,615 --> 00:40:14,135
So you wanna give this a try?
See if it's a fit?

563
00:40:16,215 --> 00:40:19,255
-Yeah, sure.
-Good.

564
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:21,815
Because I think you're ready for a fight.

565
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:34,975
Break.

566
00:40:36,215 --> 00:40:39,175
What am I doing wrong, Sally?
Every time I get inside, she's on me.

567
00:40:39,335 --> 00:40:41,935
You're doing great.
You're wearing her down. Keep punching.

568
00:40:42,095 --> 00:40:45,255
-I ain't doing great, I'm losing.
-You're wearing her down.

569
00:40:46,855 --> 00:40:48,615
You okay, honey? Can you see okay?

570
00:40:50,055 --> 00:40:52,055
-Come on.
-Do it.

571
00:40:52,695 --> 00:40:54,655
Come on, let's do this!

572
00:40:58,615 --> 00:40:59,855
That's it!

573
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,535
Nice night, eh?

574
00:41:08,935 --> 00:41:11,535
Jesus Christ.

575
00:41:11,695 --> 00:41:13,455
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

576
00:41:13,815 --> 00:41:15,335
Hell of a fighter.

577
00:41:15,535 --> 00:41:17,495
11-0.

578
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:19,575
Your left. Keep your left up.

579
00:41:24,135 --> 00:41:26,135
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

580
00:41:26,295 --> 00:41:29,295
He's got Joey Adagio,
lightweight champ?

581
00:41:29,495 --> 00:41:30,895
Yeah.

582
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,015
Your left, damn it.

583
00:41:33,895 --> 00:41:38,375
Wouldn't have been my choice for
her first fight, but Sally's a good manager.

584
00:41:38,535 --> 00:41:41,135
-He must think she can take her.
-Jesus H.

585
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:43,855
Your left. Keep your left up.

586
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:47,135
You think she can hear you
from back here?

587
00:41:53,895 --> 00:41:57,495
Of course, if Maggie loses,
it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

588
00:41:57,655 --> 00:41:59,575
Might even help him.

589
00:41:59,735 --> 00:42:01,575
Lonnie's girl gets another win...

590
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:06,095
...Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight
fight Joey Adagio for the title.

591
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,615
Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

592
00:42:08,775 --> 00:42:10,135
Hey, what do I know?

593
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:12,935
I just come because I enjoy the fights.

594
00:42:13,095 --> 00:42:15,535
Mother of God.

595
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:17,815
Okay, break.

596
00:42:17,975 --> 00:42:20,255
Hey. Come here, come here.

597
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:21,775
Hey. Get over here.

598
00:42:21,935 --> 00:42:24,655
You're dropping your left hand.
Quit dropping your left hand.

599
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:27,415
Hey, Frankie,
you mind if I talk to my fighter?

600
00:42:27,575 --> 00:42:30,855
You're doing a hell of a job.
Is this the way you advise your lightweight?

601
00:42:31,335 --> 00:42:32,855
Dunn.

602
00:42:33,015 --> 00:42:35,415
-What are you doing?
-I'm talking. What are you doing?

603
00:42:35,575 --> 00:42:37,415
-Is this your fighter?
-It's my fighter.

604
00:42:38,695 --> 00:42:40,815
It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

605
00:42:41,015 --> 00:42:44,015
Fine, you take her.
She can't fight worth a shit anyway.

606
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:48,375
-Somebody tell me what's going on.
-I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.

607
00:42:48,535 --> 00:42:50,895
You telling me this is your fighter?

608
00:42:53,015 --> 00:42:55,255
Yeah, this is my fighter.

609
00:42:55,415 --> 00:42:57,055
Then you got 10 seconds.

610
00:42:57,335 --> 00:43:00,375
I keep holding my left up,
then I throw a punch and it keeps dropping.

611
00:43:00,535 --> 00:43:02,535
-Well, let it drop.
-That'd be a lot easier.

612
00:43:02,695 --> 00:43:03,815
She thinks she knows you.

613
00:43:03,975 --> 00:43:06,855
Every time you drop it,
she comes right over the top.

614
00:43:07,055 --> 00:43:10,135
So you just wait for her, see?
That's all she's thinking about.

615
00:43:10,295 --> 00:43:13,175
-When she cocks that right hand-- You hear?
-I hear you, boss.

616
00:43:13,335 --> 00:43:16,215
When she does, step to the side
and come with a good-night hook.

617
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:17,655
-Got one?
-Got it right here.

618
00:43:17,935 --> 00:43:20,495
-Okay.
-Fight, or I'm calling it.

619
00:43:20,655 --> 00:43:23,495
<i>-Go give it to her.
-The body knows what fighters don't.</i>

620
00:43:23,695 --> 00:43:24,855
<i>How to protect itself.</i>

621
00:43:25,495 --> 00:43:27,695
<i>A neck can only twist so far.</i>

622
00:43:27,895 --> 00:43:30,935
<i>Twist it just a hair more,
and the body says:</i>

623
00:43:31,095 --> 00:43:35,095
<i>"Hey, I'll take it from here because you
obviously don't know what you're doing. "</i>

624
00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:37,015
Neutral corner.

625
00:43:38,455 --> 00:43:40,215
-See the way she did that?
-Yeah.

626
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:43,215
Sugar Ray would do that.
Girl's got sugar.

627
00:43:43,415 --> 00:43:48,815
<i>"Lie down, now, rest, and we'll talk
about this when you regain your senses. "</i>

628
00:43:48,975 --> 00:43:51,095
<i>It's called the knockout mechanism.</i>

629
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:54,815
Don't get all carried away, now.
You did good.

630
00:43:54,975 --> 00:43:56,855
Thanks, boss.

631
00:43:57,215 --> 00:43:59,455
You.... You forgot the rule.

632
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,935
-Now, what is the rule?
-Keep my left up?

633
00:44:02,135 --> 00:44:04,975
It's to protect yourself at all times.

634
00:44:05,495 --> 00:44:07,015
Now, what is the rule?

635
00:44:07,175 --> 00:44:10,375
-Protect myself at all times.
-Good, good.

636
00:44:10,535 --> 00:44:12,655
You gave me away.
How was that protecting me?

637
00:44:14,215 --> 00:44:15,375
It wasn't.

638
00:44:16,415 --> 00:44:17,895
It's okay.

639
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:22,255
-I'll work on my left, boss.
-Drink your water.

640
00:44:23,335 --> 00:44:24,975
Other than that, how'd I do?

641
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:28,135
Fine. You did fine.

642
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,535
You gonna leave me again?

643
00:44:32,615 --> 00:44:34,215
Never.

644
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:38,575
That place you work, do they have
homemade lemon meringue pie there?

645
00:44:39,095 --> 00:44:41,615
-Sure.
-Not the kind with the canned-filling crap?

646
00:44:41,775 --> 00:44:45,295
Oh, big can, yay size.
Says "homemade" on the label.

647
00:44:47,695 --> 00:44:50,575
-I want you to take the weekend off.
-It's only Thursday.

648
00:44:51,775 --> 00:44:55,255
-You gonna argue with me?
-Know better than to do that, boss.

649
00:44:55,855 --> 00:44:57,575
Well, good.

650
00:44:57,735 --> 00:45:00,295
<i>All fighters are pigheaded
some way or other.</i>

651
00:45:00,735 --> 00:45:04,015
<i>Some part of them always thinks
they know better than you about something.</i>

652
00:45:04,175 --> 00:45:08,255
Can you spare a few minutes
for the Immaculate Conception?

653
00:45:09,815 --> 00:45:13,495
<i>Truth is, even if they're wrong...</i>

654
00:45:13,655 --> 00:45:16,535
<i>...even if that one thing
is gonna be the ruin of them...</i>

655
00:45:16,695 --> 00:45:21,335
<i>...if you can beat that last bit out of them,
then they ain't fighters at all.</i>

656
00:45:21,495 --> 00:45:24,655
-Thought I said I'd see you Monday.
-You sure did, boss.

657
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,455
That was last night.

658
00:45:26,615 --> 00:45:29,295
You said not to argue with you.

659
00:45:40,255 --> 00:45:42,855
Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.

660
00:45:43,015 --> 00:45:44,895
You want my advice?

661
00:45:45,055 --> 00:45:46,455
What?

662
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:48,775
Where are your shoes?

663
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:52,015
I'm airing out my feet.

664
00:45:53,695 --> 00:45:55,495
You got big holes in your socks.

665
00:45:56,495 --> 00:45:58,375
Oh, they're not that big.

666
00:46:00,095 --> 00:46:02,255
Didn't I give you money
for some new ones?

667
00:46:03,855 --> 00:46:05,455
These are my sleeping socks.

668
00:46:06,775 --> 00:46:09,335
My feet like a little air at night.

669
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:12,055
How come you're wearing them
in the daytime, then?

670
00:46:12,215 --> 00:46:15,095
Because my daytime socks
got too many holes in them.

671
00:46:17,295 --> 00:46:22,615
Well, if I give you some more money,
you buy some new socks.

672
00:46:22,935 --> 00:46:24,495
Please?

673
00:46:26,775 --> 00:46:30,455
Well, I'd be tempted,
but I couldn't say for sure.

674
00:46:30,615 --> 00:46:32,495
Might find its way to the track.

675
00:46:48,335 --> 00:46:51,415
It's over. It's over.

676
00:47:05,655 --> 00:47:08,215
<i>Didn't take Maggie long
to hit her stride.</i>

677
00:47:19,215 --> 00:47:20,575
I got the breathing thing down.

678
00:47:20,735 --> 00:47:24,135
No, you ain't breathing because you're
knocking them out in the first round.

679
00:47:24,335 --> 00:47:27,695
-Thought that was the point.
-The point is to get good.

680
00:47:28,335 --> 00:47:30,815
Can't get good if you keep
knocking them out first round.

681
00:47:30,975 --> 00:47:33,095
How am I gonna get you fights?

682
00:47:34,775 --> 00:47:37,015
Nobody wants to see
their fighter embarrassed, now.

683
00:47:37,175 --> 00:47:39,695
Why am I still doing
four-rounders, boss?

684
00:47:40,215 --> 00:47:42,375
Because you haven't got the lungs
for six rounds.

685
00:47:42,535 --> 00:47:45,615
I do if I keep knocking them out
in the first round.

686
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:52,495
<i>Frankie made her fight
one more four-rounder...</i>

687
00:47:52,655 --> 00:47:54,735
<i>...just to let her know who was boss.</i>

688
00:47:58,615 --> 00:48:01,495
Three, four, five...

689
00:48:01,655 --> 00:48:03,695
...six, seven....

690
00:48:03,895 --> 00:48:05,415
Sorry, boss.

691
00:48:05,575 --> 00:48:07,535
<i>Maggie left no doubt about it.</i>

692
00:48:16,095 --> 00:48:19,215
All right, let's do it.

693
00:48:20,295 --> 00:48:24,135
<i>Her first six-rounder
didn't go quite as smooth.</i>

694
00:48:38,295 --> 00:48:40,015
Get up!

695
00:48:40,535 --> 00:48:41,775
To your corner.

696
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:44,975
-Three, four, five...
-Get up.

697
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:47,295
-...six, seven...
-Get up.

698
00:48:47,455 --> 00:48:50,375
-...eight, nine, ten. It's over.
-You can do this.

699
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:55,895
<i>Maggie didn't knock her out
till the end of the first round.</i>

700
00:48:56,055 --> 00:49:00,015
<i>After that, no manager wanted
to put his fighter in with Maggie.</i>

701
00:49:03,895 --> 00:49:06,855
<i>Frankie had to go into his pocket
to get her decent fights...</i>

702
00:49:07,015 --> 00:49:10,855
<i>...sweetening the purse
by paying managers on the side.</i>

703
00:49:22,415 --> 00:49:24,775
<i>That only worked for so long.</i>

704
00:49:24,935 --> 00:49:27,935
<i>Then Frankie did something
he hated doing.</i>

705
00:49:28,095 --> 00:49:29,095
<i>He took a chance.</i>

706
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,455
Box.

707
00:49:37,615 --> 00:49:39,975
<i>He moved her up in class.</i>

708
00:49:40,175 --> 00:49:42,895
<i>That could've been a mistake.</i>

709
00:49:55,255 --> 00:49:56,615
Watch the right!

710
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:00,975
Watch it. Watch it.

711
00:50:07,615 --> 00:50:11,335
Break, break. Step back. Break. Time.

712
00:50:19,575 --> 00:50:21,935
Damn, damn, damn.

713
00:50:24,295 --> 00:50:25,695
Give us two seconds, will you?

714
00:50:25,855 --> 00:50:27,535
-Okay.
-Just two seconds.

715
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:30,415
-Your nose is broke.
-Oh, damn.

716
00:50:30,615 --> 00:50:32,295
-Fix it.
-I can't, I can't.

717
00:50:32,455 --> 00:50:34,855
-You can fix it.
-I can't. I've gotta call it.

718
00:50:35,055 --> 00:50:36,855
I've seen what you can do. Fix it.

719
00:50:37,215 --> 00:50:39,935
I can snap it back into place,
but I can't stop the bleeding.

720
00:50:40,095 --> 00:50:41,575
The ring doctor's gonna call it.

721
00:50:41,735 --> 00:50:44,855
Please, Frankie, if you
can stop the blood, I can beat her.

722
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:48,055
Bite down on this.

723
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:06,895
-Inhale.
-What?

724
00:51:07,095 --> 00:51:08,455
-Inhale.
-What?

725
00:51:08,855 --> 00:51:10,495
Breathe in.

726
00:51:21,295 --> 00:51:23,895
-Okay, huh?
-Yeah, it's okay.

727
00:51:24,135 --> 00:51:27,095
All right, you got 20 seconds
before this turns into a geyser...

728
00:51:27,255 --> 00:51:29,295
...and it's gonna spray
all over the front row.

729
00:51:29,495 --> 00:51:31,575
Twenty seconds, that's all you've got.

730
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:33,415
Now get going.

731
00:51:45,615 --> 00:51:47,375
Go to your corner.

732
00:51:48,495 --> 00:51:51,175
Three, four, five...

733
00:51:51,335 --> 00:51:54,895
-Come on, breathe. Breathe.
-...six, seven, eight...

734
00:51:55,055 --> 00:51:57,055
...nine, ten.

735
00:52:00,335 --> 00:52:01,735
<i>Mo cuishle.</i>

736
00:52:07,095 --> 00:52:08,735
-All right!
-Yeah!

737
00:52:10,535 --> 00:52:11,855
Right.

738
00:52:15,935 --> 00:52:17,615
What you reading?

739
00:52:18,495 --> 00:52:19,695
What's she saying?

740
00:52:20,255 --> 00:52:22,415
Wants to know what you're reading.

741
00:52:22,695 --> 00:52:25,415
It's Yeats. Keep your head back.

742
00:52:26,295 --> 00:52:28,175
Why don't you talk
a little Yeats to her.

743
00:52:28,335 --> 00:52:30,855
Show her what a treat that is.

744
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:33,295
When the hell they gonna get to her?

745
00:52:33,455 --> 00:52:35,615
I'm okay, Frankie.

746
00:52:36,335 --> 00:52:39,175
-What'd you learn tonight?
-Always protect myself.

747
00:52:39,335 --> 00:52:42,295
-What's the rule?
-Always protect myself.

748
00:52:42,455 --> 00:52:44,255
-Margaret Fitzgerald?
-Here.

749
00:52:48,615 --> 00:52:50,495
I'll be right here.

750
00:53:01,975 --> 00:53:04,335
-How you doing?
-Me?

751
00:53:04,495 --> 00:53:06,375
-Yeah, you.
-I'm not the one who's hurt.

752
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:12,775
Broken nose don't hurt that much.

753
00:53:13,495 --> 00:53:15,695
Why are you telling me that?

754
00:53:17,775 --> 00:53:19,055
No reason.

755
00:53:19,255 --> 00:53:23,255
<i>But some wounds are too deep
or too close to the bone.</i>

756
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:27,895
<i>And no matter how hard you work at it,
you just can't stop the bleeding.</i>

757
00:53:28,055 --> 00:53:31,295
-Did you write your daughter?
-Every week.

758
00:53:32,775 --> 00:53:35,655
I've no idea why you come to church.

759
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:10,095
<i>After her 12th straight knockout,
Frankie got a couple of real good offers.</i>

760
00:54:12,535 --> 00:54:15,055
<i>The first was to fight
Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman...</i>

761
00:54:15,215 --> 00:54:17,455
<i>...for the WBA welterweight title.</i>

762
00:54:19,335 --> 00:54:21,055
Billie "The Blue Bear."

763
00:54:21,215 --> 00:54:24,215
<i>Billie was a former prostitute
out of East Berlin.</i>

764
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:28,415
<i>Had a reputation for being
the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.</i>

765
00:54:46,095 --> 00:54:47,455
<i>Didn't seem to matter to her...</i>

766
00:54:47,615 --> 00:54:50,135
<i>...that something like that
could kill a person.</i>

767
00:54:51,015 --> 00:54:53,135
<i>And the crowds loved her.</i>

768
00:54:55,935 --> 00:54:58,775
<i>He turned it down
without even telling her.</i>

769
00:54:58,935 --> 00:55:01,135
<i>The next was to fight
the British champ...</i>

770
00:55:01,295 --> 00:55:04,455
<i>-...a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.
-Hello?</i>

771
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,135
Not interested.

772
00:55:09,855 --> 00:55:12,295
<i>He turned that down too.</i>

773
00:55:14,415 --> 00:55:16,615
That's a lot of money, boss.

774
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:20,095
Yeah, you're making money.
What are you still working here for?

775
00:55:20,255 --> 00:55:21,895
It's a title match, right?

776
00:55:22,055 --> 00:55:24,935
Are you British?
It's a title you can't take away.

777
00:55:25,095 --> 00:55:28,295
She's got nothing to lose,
you got nothing to win.

778
00:55:29,055 --> 00:55:31,495
Might still be a good fight.

779
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:35,055
Yeah, I just-- I just brought you up
to welterweight.

780
00:55:35,215 --> 00:55:38,535
Too good to fight these contenders,
you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

781
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,575
Didn't notice I was fighting
any contenders.

782
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:45,415
Well, you can get yourself
another manager any time you want.

783
00:55:46,455 --> 00:55:49,255
In fact, if you'd learn
to protect your face a little better...

784
00:55:49,415 --> 00:55:51,815
...I wouldn't have
to turn down this money.

785
00:55:55,055 --> 00:55:58,455
My face is out there so much it's a miracle
I haven't been knocked out yet.

786
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,910
No, you can't work here
anymore tonight.

787
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:31,630
I made us a reservation.

788
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:35,310
You might wanna shower.

789
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,870
Here you go.

790
00:56:58,070 --> 00:56:59,830
Here you go.

791
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:01,950
What's this?

792
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:05,270
Well, it ain't no big secret
what you're wishing for.

793
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,190
Go on and blow.

794
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:13,590
Thank you.

795
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:19,910
Thirty-three ain't so old.

796
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:23,350
I was still fighting at 39.

797
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:26,990
Fought for 23 years.

798
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,190
How's it going, Scrap?

799
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:33,950
Doing good, Mickey.

800
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:36,710
Doing good.

801
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:40,470
-What'll you have?
-Coffee.

802
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,950
You two not speaking?

803
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:50,510
Don't hardly know him.

804
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:59,270
I met Frankie right after
my 37th birthday.

805
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,710
He was picking up cut work.

806
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:07,190
He used to patch me up
when I thought it was impossible.

807
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:10,390
Good man to have in your corner.

808
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:13,150
Yes, he is.

809
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:17,750
He stayed with me
through my last fight in San Berdu.

810
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:21,790
My manager was off
getting drunk somewhere...

811
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:25,670
...and it was just Frankie and me.

812
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,190
I was taking a hellacious beating.

813
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,750
Everybody's got a particular number
of fights in him.

814
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:38,230
Nobody tells you what that number is.

815
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:41,710
Mine was 109.

816
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:44,470
I just didn't want to admit it.

817
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,390
Fourth round, this...

818
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:50,430
...cut opens up.

819
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:53,590
Blood starts pouring into my eye.

820
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:59,190
They should've stopped the fight, but,
hell, I was a black man in San Berdu.

821
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:01,470
Blood was what I was there for.

822
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:05,710
Round after round, I kept getting
Frankie to patch me up.

823
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:08,190
He's talking about
throwing in the towel...

824
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:11,550
...but he ain't my manager,
he can't throw in nothing.

825
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,710
Round after round...

826
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:17,110
...he's arguing with me.

827
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:22,350
And I'm almost laughing because, hell,
it's getting more to him than to me.

828
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:25,630
I go 15 rounds...

829
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,950
...Iose by decision.

830
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,870
Next morning, I lose the eye.

831
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:36,630
In 23 years, he's never said
a thing about it.

832
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:41,430
Doesn't have to. I can see it
in his face every time he looks at me.

833
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:43,990
Somehow...

834
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:47,470
...Frankie thinks he should've
stopped that fight...

835
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:50,550
...should've saved my eye.

836
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:56,590
Spends his life wishing he could
take back that 109th fight.

837
00:59:57,430 --> 01:00:00,230
I wanted to go to 110.

838
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:02,710
Thing is...

839
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,110
...if you wanna get to the title...

840
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,910
...maybe he's not the one
to take you there.

841
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,950
You tell Mr. Mack we'd be here tonight?

842
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:21,150
You go on, eat your cupcake.

843
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:23,950
No, I got it.

844
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:30,590
<i>It's the rule.</i>

845
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:33,070
<i>Always protect yourself.</i>

846
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:36,310
<i>People never take their own advice.</i>

847
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:41,310
<i>If she was gonna leave Frankie,
better she did it to him then.</i>

848
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:47,350
Mr. Mickey Mack?

849
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,750
I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

850
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:55,550
I hear you're a real good manager,
doing good things for Big Willie.

851
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,910
But I thought you should know
I ain't never leaving Mr. Dunn...

852
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:02,670
...so you don't need to make any more
excuses to bump into me.

853
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,950
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

854
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:14,510
<i>Maggie always did like
taking them out in the first round.</i>

855
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:50,070
<i>The letters always came back
marked the same way:</i>

856
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:52,310
<i>"Return to sender. "</i>

857
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:23,070
I'll make you some coffee.

858
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,550
What are you doing with your money?

859
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:29,150
-Saving it.
-Good girl.

860
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:34,190
You know, you save enough of it,
you ought to get yourself a little house.

861
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,630
Cash, no mortgage.

862
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:38,230
Gonna be a while before I can do that.

863
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:44,310
Yeah, well, it might be a stretch...

864
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,990
...but you gotta get yourself
a place of your own.

865
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:50,270
Go around wasting it on things
that don't matter and what do you got?

866
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,070
You understand?

867
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:55,990
Pretty soon, you wait long enough,
you got nothing.

868
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:58,030
Okay, soon as I get the money.

869
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:02,110
I made a lot of mistakes in my life. I'm just
trying to keep you from doing the same.

870
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:04,110
I know, boss.

871
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:07,750
-I'm not gonna live forever.
-What is it?

872
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:10,470
It's a tape on that girl in England
you're gonna fight.

873
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:13,830
If you're gonna go for the title,
we got some moves to-- Hey.

874
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,550
Hey, get the hell down.
You know how old I am?

875
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,230
-Thank you, boss. Thank you so much.
-Yeah.

876
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:23,670
You're welcome, darling. Here, just--
Here, let me put this in the machine.

877
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:25,750
What machine?

878
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:27,830
Don't have a TV, huh?

879
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:29,710
No.

880
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:32,030
Yeah!

881
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:35,110
All right. Okay.

882
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:43,310
-Ten minutes, love.
-Thank you.

883
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:44,990
Man says he loves me.

884
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:47,150
He's probably not
the first one to say that.

885
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:49,470
First since my daddy.

886
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:51,670
I win, you think he'll propose?

887
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:54,070
You win, I'll propose.

888
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,590
Look, I got you a gift here.

889
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,350
I think they gave you somebody else's.

890
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,390
No, no, this is it.

891
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:10,790
What's it mean?

892
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:14,630
I don't know.
Just something in Gaelic.

893
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:19,070
-It's beautiful.
-Yeah, I thought so.

894
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,990
-Yeah.
-Real silk thread.

895
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:28,630
From the United States
of America, the challenger...

896
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:31,990
...Maggie Fitzgerald.

897
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,670
<i>Mo cuishle.
Did you see what was on her robe?</i>

898
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,030
<i>-Mo cuishle. Mo cuishle.
-Mo cuishle.</i>

899
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:43,830
<i>She wasn't the main attraction.</i>

900
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:47,510
<i>She was on the undercard
of a middleweight title fight.</i>

901
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:49,790
<i>But ask someone who was there...</i>

902
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:52,830
<i>...they couldn't tell you who else
fought that night.</i>

903
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:00,310
Box.

904
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:21,470
<i>-Come on!
-Mo cuishle!</i>

905
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:26,150
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

906
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:28,870
<i>Mo cuishle!</i>

907
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:31,150
<i>Mo cuishle!</i>

908
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:35,830
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

909
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:45,910
She's tough.

910
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,910
I can't get inside.
I can't get close enough to hit her.

911
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:52,430
-You know why that is?
-Why?

912
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:54,710
She's a better fighter than you are.

913
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:58,790
She's younger, she's stronger,
and she's more experienced. Now...

914
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:01,070
...what are you gonna do about it?

915
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:10,470
Get in there.

916
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:12,670
Box.

917
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:30,350
Three, four, five, six...

918
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:35,470
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

919
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:39,550
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

920
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:49,590
<i>-Mo cuishle!
-Mo cuishle!</i>

921
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,550
I could ask someone, you know?

922
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:00,390
Good.

923
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,510
You find out, you let me know.

924
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:12,110
<i>Whatever it meant, the name stuck.</i>

925
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:16,630
<i>Maggie fought in Edinburgh and Paris,
Brussels and Amsterdam.</i>

926
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:19,510
<i>It was always mo cuishle.</i>

927
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,990
<i>Seems there are
Irish people everywhere...</i>

928
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:24,390
<i>...or people who wanna be.</i>

929
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,150
<i>By the time they came back
to the States...</i>

930
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:30,950
<i>...Maggie was in a whole new league.</i>

931
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:51,630
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

932
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:04,110
<i>After that they got another offer
to fight for the title.</i>

933
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,190
What's the split?

934
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,070
-Sixty-forty.
-Good.

935
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:15,030
We'll take 60 and you take 40,
being as that Maggie's the draw.

936
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:16,870
That little girl?

937
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:20,470
You think I'm wrong, really?
You think people are saying...

938
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:24,270
...that they wanna see some scabby Kraut
beat up on little Miss What's-Her-Name?

939
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:27,350
You find someone who says that,
and we'll take the 40.

940
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:36,230
There you go.

941
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:42,670
They're at 60-40,
but they'll come up to 50-50.

942
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:45,070
How's that girl doing?

943
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:48,230
Well, she's got a concussion
and a broken eardrum.

944
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,230
She be all right?

945
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:54,150
-And if she isn't?
-Maybe I should send her something.

946
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:58,310
Well, you could send her your check
if you'd like. I'm sure she'd take it.

947
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:04,790
Boss?

948
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:06,750
That little house we talked about?

949
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:08,510
I bought it.

950
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:11,430
Well, smart girl.

951
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:15,710
For my mama. It's only about a mile
from where she lives now.

952
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:17,910
No mortgage, just like you said.

953
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:22,070
You're a good daughter.

954
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:24,710
She don't know about it yet.

955
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:28,270
I was hoping maybe we could
stay an extra day, drive over there?

956
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,270
I know she wants to meet you.

957
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:35,270
Yeah, we could do that.

958
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:54,670
Oh, my God. Mama, come on out here.

959
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:56,910
Mary M.'s here.

960
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:17,190
-This is the Johnsons' old house.
-Not anymore.

961
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:24,430
It's all yours, Mama.
For you and Mardell and the kids.

962
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:28,230
-Mary M., you bought this for me?
-Yeah, all yours, free and clear.

963
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,030
Darling....

964
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:32,430
There's no fridge. No stove neither.

965
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,790
They'll be here before you move in.

966
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:38,270
-How much money did this cost you?
-Never mind that.

967
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:41,030
-You shouldn't have done this.
-You need a decent place.

968
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:44,350
You shouldn't have done it.
You should've asked me first.

969
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:48,750
Government's gonna find out about this,
they're gonna stop my welfare.

970
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:52,630
-Mama, no, they ain't.
-They are. You're fine, you're working...

971
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,550
...but I can't live without my welfare.

972
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:56,310
Mama, I'll send you money.

973
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:59,750
What about my medicine?
Medicaid gonna cut me off.

974
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:03,390
-How am I supposed to get my medicine?
-I'll send you more money.

975
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:05,910
I hope you don't expect J.D.
to move in with us.

976
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:07,270
He's getting out, you know.

977
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:10,350
Why didn't you just give me the money?

978
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,830
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

979
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:19,310
I didn't have to, Mama, but it's yours.

980
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:21,550
You want the money, sell it.

981
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:29,390
I don't--

982
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:37,510
I know you didn't mean
nothing hurtful...

983
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:39,990
...but sometimes you just
don't think things through.

984
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:43,510
-That's true, Mama.
-I'll try and keep the house.

985
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:46,230
I'm just worried about
all those expenses.

986
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:48,230
I'll send you some more money.

987
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:59,190
That man hitting you?

988
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:02,710
It's from the fight.

989
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:04,590
I'm a fighter, Mama.

990
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:07,310
Find a man, Mary M.

991
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,070
Live proper.

992
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:12,110
People hear about what you're doing
and they laugh.

993
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:15,190
Hurts me to tell you,
but they laugh at you.

994
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,510
Hi.

995
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:37,590
You ever own a dog?

996
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,230
Nope.

997
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:43,790
Closest I ever came was
a middleweight from Barstow.

998
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:49,950
My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.

999
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:51,750
Axel's hindquarters were so bad...

1000
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:55,350
...he had to drag himself
room to room by his front legs.

1001
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:58,390
Me and Mardell would bust up laughing...

1002
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:02,190
...watching him scoot
across the kitchen floor.

1003
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:06,310
Daddy, he was so sick by then,
he couldn't hardly stand himself.

1004
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:11,030
But one morning he got up,
carried Axel to his rig...

1005
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:15,430
...and the two of them went off
into the woods, singing and howling.

1006
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:19,470
But it wasn't till he got home
that night alone that I saw...

1007
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:22,190
...the shovel in the back of the truck.

1008
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:29,590
Sure miss watching
the two of them together.

1009
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:40,590
I got nobody but you, Frankie.

1010
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:45,550
Well, you've got me.

1011
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:51,910
At least, that is,
until we find you a good manager.

1012
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:03,350
Hey, can we stop just up here?

1013
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,310
Yeah.

1014
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:08,630
This place has
the best lemon pie around.

1015
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:11,630
None of that canned-filling crap.

1016
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:28,150
Now I can die and go to heaven.

1017
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:34,710
I used to come here with Daddy.

1018
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:38,270
Wonder if a place like this is for sale.

1019
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:40,870
I got a little bit of savings.

1020
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:50,030
That's fine, fine, thanks.

1021
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,590
Hey, what the hell's Danger looking at?

1022
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:59,510
Looks like another bottle of water.

1023
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:01,910
Wanna come to Vegas with us?

1024
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:06,830
Watch you suffer over the nickel slots?
My heart can't take that kind of pounding.

1025
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:10,470
Well, she's got a title shot.
The Blue Bear.

1026
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:12,550
Million dollars,
split right down the center.

1027
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:14,470
That's good, Frankie. That's real good.

1028
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:16,150
Well, I could use a good second.

1029
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:18,030
Can't find one,
I thought I'd ask you.

1030
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:20,190
Now, why the hell
would I wanna do that?

1031
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:24,590
Well, because you're a half-blind old fool
who never got there himself.

1032
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:28,350
I thought you might like to feel what
it's like to be in a ring on a title match.

1033
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:30,430
Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.

1034
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:33,910
No, you pick up somebody
there in Vegas.

1035
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:37,030
Somebody with young hands.

1036
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:40,110
You're not gonna cry now, are you?
I've already got one girl.

1037
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:43,630
I leave this place for one day...

1038
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:46,510
...got any idea what it would look like
when I come back?

1039
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:48,430
Kind of like it looks right now.

1040
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:49,990
Oh, go to hell.

1041
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:54,670
You tell Maggie don't come back here
without a belt.

1042
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:56,590
Will do.

1043
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:02,390
Hey, Mr. Scrap.

1044
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:05,710
I got a question,
but I feel real stupid asking it.

1045
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:07,990
No such thing as
a stupid question there, Danger.

1046
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:09,870
Okay.

1047
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:15,950
How'd you get all the ice in here
through this little tiny hole?

1048
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:18,110
I've been thinking on it.

1049
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:19,950
Can't figure it out.

1050
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:21,710
Why don't I show you, Danger.

1051
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:25,070
-You could do that? You could show me?
-I think so. I think so.

1052
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:30,070
Also, Mr. Scrap, I was kind of thinking
I might be ready for a fight.

1053
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:36,110
Well, I got the tickets. You ready?

1054
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:39,070
-We're flying?
-Would you rather drive?

1055
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:42,030
You're asking me?

1056
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:45,310
Would you rather fly,
or would you rather drive?

1057
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:48,110
So I finally get to decide something?

1058
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:49,630
That's what I'm saying.

1059
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:51,310
Fine.

1060
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:53,150
Fly there, drive back.

1061
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:57,030
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
How the hell we gonna do that?

1062
01:17:57,310 --> 01:17:58,870
You said it was up to me.

1063
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:10,790
Give them hell there, Danger.

1064
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:13,830
Hey, old school,
the toilet's overflowing.

1065
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:20,710
Hey, Flippy, come here for a minute.

1066
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:24,270
Jesus.

1067
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:27,030
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1068
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:29,550
Oh, God!

1069
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:34,990
Dumb-ass.

1070
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:37,710
Come on, Danger. Come on, Danger.

1071
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:39,230
Come on. Defense!

1072
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:42,030
Could be sitting up at the Mirage...

1073
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:44,630
...drinking mai tais...

1074
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:46,910
...Iooking at naked women.

1075
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:50,190
Come on, Danger,
put up your hands and fight.

1076
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:54,670
Danger, get out of there!

1077
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:03,470
Fight back! Come on!

1078
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:06,190
-There you go, Danger, there you go!
-Good job, man.

1079
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:08,270
Jab him with the left.
Come on.

1080
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:09,630
Come on.

1081
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:19,830
Hey, come on now, Flip.

1082
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:22,030
-What you doing? Let him go.
-All right. Okay.

1083
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:24,470
I got you. Come on, come on.

1084
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:27,470
It's all right.

1085
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:30,390
We don't need no corner trainer.

1086
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:31,830
How'd I do, Mr. Scrap?

1087
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:33,830
You did good, Danger. You did real good.

1088
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:36,030
You my man. You rock.

1089
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:38,070
Come on, Flip, man, you ain't done.

1090
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:40,870
You ain't even fight good yet.

1091
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:42,870
Anybody can lose one fight.

1092
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:45,430
Anybody can lose one, son.
You'll come back from this.

1093
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:47,150
You'll be champion of the world.

1094
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:49,510
No, I won't, Mr. Scrap.

1095
01:19:50,430 --> 01:19:52,070
I should have knowed.

1096
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:54,670
-Come on. We don't need to be talking.
-Let me help you.

1097
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:58,230
Oh, no, I can do her.
Just untie the Velcro for me.

1098
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:00,230
All right.

1099
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:04,950
Come on, don't take the gloves off, man.
You ain't even used them, Danger.

1100
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:08,950
Mind if I borrow this, Danger?

1101
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:11,790
Man, I thought your name was Danger.

1102
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:13,990
Come on, now.

1103
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:17,990
Oh, oh, I see. Now I get to fight
a retard and a old man.

1104
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:21,990
Call ESPN, because you can't
write this shit.

1105
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:32,430
Look out, Shawrelle. Easy, Shawrelle.

1106
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:34,750
Keep going, man.

1107
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:36,590
All right, man.

1108
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,030
He ain't so tough.

1109
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:47,230
One hundred and ten.

1110
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:53,550
Get a job, punk.

1111
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:26,550
Win this one, I'll tell you what it means.

1112
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:29,510
I got you some pipers.

1113
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:46,350
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1114
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:50,630
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1115
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:00,470
All right, now!

1116
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:50,630
I want you to jab her right in the tits...

1117
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:52,790
...until they turn blue and fall off.

1118
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:11,510
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the feature...</i>

1119
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:13,830
...presentation of the evening.

1120
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:18,350
In this corner, the challenger,
Maggie Fitzgerald...

1121
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:20,510
...in the red corner.

1122
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:22,230
In the blue corner...

1123
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:26,550
...the WBA welterweight champion
of the world...

1124
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:29,470
...Billie "The Blue Bear."

1125
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:34,230
Sweet Jesus.

1126
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:52,630
<i>Fitzgerald is pushing The Blue Bear
around the ring. She's coming on strong.</i>

1127
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:58,310
Challenger darts in, lands a combination
to the head and the body.

1128
01:23:58,470 --> 01:24:00,510
<i>-And a right hook stuns the champ.
-All right.</i>

1129
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:03,710
Break it up!

1130
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:08,470
Break it! Break it!

1131
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:16,990
Do that one more time,
it'll cost you a point, do you hear me?

1132
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:20,310
Go fight.

1133
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:29,710
You motherfucker.

1134
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:39,910
Come on. What the fuck?

1135
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:42,670
All right, that's it.
I'm gonna take away a point.

1136
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:44,990
One point deduction
off the blue corner.

1137
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:48,070
<i>--comes back, hits Fitzgerald....</i>

1138
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:49,590
Ref, open your eyes, you....

1139
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:10,470
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the first round
is in the books on this championship match.</i>

1140
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:16,110
-Hold onto that.
-There you go.

1141
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:22,990
-Looking good.
-You pull that crap one more time...

1142
01:25:23,150 --> 01:25:24,830
...you're disqualified.

1143
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:34,270
It's gonna be all right.

1144
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:36,110
Got no doubt, boss.

1145
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:41,310
Okay, just watch yourself.

1146
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,830
Stay away from this dame.

1147
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:57,390
Go to the neutral corner.
Neutral corner.

1148
01:25:58,310 --> 01:26:01,550
-Four, five, six...
-Stay down, you bitch.

1149
01:26:01,710 --> 01:26:04,950
...seven, eight, nine.

1150
01:26:17,430 --> 01:26:18,790
Yeah, yeah!

1151
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:21,830
Break it! Break it!

1152
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:32,110
<i>Fitzgerald continues to pummel
The Blue Bear. The East German champion....</i>

1153
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:46,990
Yes! Come on!

1154
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:48,630
I got it! I got it.

1155
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:56,430
Eyes are blurring, boss.

1156
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:59,270
-How many eyes you need to finish this?
-One's enough.

1157
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:04,110
-Good.
-Now...

1158
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:05,750
...what do I do about the Bear?

1159
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:08,750
Do you know that step into the outside
and hook into the liver?

1160
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:12,350
-I been doing that. She's made of steel.
-I don't want you to go to the liver.

1161
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:15,310
I want you to hit her right up
under her skinny ass, understand?

1162
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:18,430
Right in the sciatic nerve.
Just keep digging it in there.

1163
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:20,590
And just keep sticking her.
You hear that?

1164
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:23,630
-What about the ref?
-Keep between the ref and the Bear...

1165
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:25,470
...and everything will just be fine.

1166
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:29,350
This is yours. You keep your guard up.

1167
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:30,990
You keep it up.

1168
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:45,350
Oh, yeah!

1169
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:57,470
Break, break!

1170
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:07,510
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1171
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:37,510
Doctor.

1172
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:52,870
Come on.

1173
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:54,670
Breathe.

1174
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:57,310
That's it. Breathe.

1175
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,310
Good.

1176
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:00,950
Look at me. Concentrate on me.

1177
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:02,870
Breathe.

1178
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:04,990
Good.

1179
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:06,710
That's it.

1180
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:09,230
Breathe.

1181
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:57,390
How you feeling, darling?

1182
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:07,790
Growing a beard, boss?

1183
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:11,310
I thought it might help me
with the ladies.

1184
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:15,310
Can't say it does.

1185
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:43,870
Does it--? Does it hurt much?

1186
01:30:45,670 --> 01:30:47,710
Don't hurt at all.

1187
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:51,150
Well, that's good.

1188
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:58,110
Where's Frankie?

1189
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:01,510
Well, he's....

1190
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:03,950
He's out there talking to the doctors.

1191
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:07,110
Probably telling them how to do their job.

1192
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:13,430
They're telling him
I'm a C1 and C2 complete.

1193
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:21,070
Means that my spinal cord's so broke
they'll never be able to fix it.

1194
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:27,990
Gonna be frozen like this
the rest of my life.

1195
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:36,510
I asked them to tell him.
I don't know how he's gonna take it.

1196
01:31:44,590 --> 01:31:46,510
Did you see the fight?

1197
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:50,630
Of course I did.

1198
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:53,470
You had her cold, Maggie.

1199
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:57,870
I shouldn't have dropped my hands.

1200
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:03,670
I shouldn't have turned.

1201
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:12,150
Always protect myself.

1202
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:15,310
How many times he tell me that?

1203
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:17,830
Yeah...

1204
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:20,910
...he does like to repeat himself.

1205
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:27,750
Will you tell him I'm real sorry?

1206
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,030
No.

1207
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:35,870
I won't do no such thing, Maggie.

1208
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:56,710
Damnedest thing.

1209
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:02,070
So, what's the plan?

1210
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:06,070
I know you got one,
so you might as well tell me what it is.

1211
01:33:06,230 --> 01:33:07,950
It's your fault.

1212
01:33:08,510 --> 01:33:11,390
Yeah, it's your fault
she's lying in there like that.

1213
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:13,430
You kept after me until I trained her.

1214
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:16,710
I knew I shouldn't have done it,
her being a girl and all.

1215
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:20,070
Everything kept telling me not to.

1216
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:21,910
Everything but you.

1217
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:33,550
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1218
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:35,590
These doctors around here
don't know squat.

1219
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:38,590
Otherwise, why would they be
living out here in the desert?

1220
01:33:39,430 --> 01:33:41,590
As soon as you're able to be moved...

1221
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:45,390
...we'll find some place where
they've actually studied medicine.

1222
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:50,030
You just rest there, I'II....

1223
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,270
I'm on it.

1224
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:04,270
<i>Frankie must have called
every hospital in America...</i>

1225
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:07,150
<i>...looking for somebody
who'd tell him they could fix her.</i>

1226
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:11,190
<i>He came close twice,
till they checked her over...</i>

1227
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:13,430
<i>...said there was nothing to be done.</i>

1228
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:16,990
<i>Took two months till she was
stable enough to move.</i>

1229
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:24,470
They got nurses for that, you know.

1230
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:28,030
Yeah, but they're amateurs.

1231
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:43,790
<i>She developed skin ulcers
because she couldn't change positions.</i>

1232
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:55,910
Thank you.

1233
01:35:05,470 --> 01:35:08,710
<i>They made the six-hour trip
by ambulance.</i>

1234
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:22,350
Fly there, drive back.

1235
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:31,750
<i>The rehab center Frankie found
was a nice place.</i>

1236
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:33,950
<i>They took good care of Maggie.</i>

1237
01:35:34,110 --> 01:35:36,110
<i>She wouldn't have complained
if they hadn't.</i>

1238
01:35:37,350 --> 01:35:41,150
<i>Took several hours every day
to get her ready for the wheelchair.</i>

1239
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:48,350
One, two, three, up.

1240
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:52,910
<i>Since she couldn't breathe on her own...</i>

1241
01:35:53,070 --> 01:35:55,590
<i>...her respirators were always on.</i>

1242
01:35:56,790 --> 01:36:00,430
<i>Oxygen was pumped into her
24 hours a day.</i>

1243
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:28,790
<i>Maggie's mama called to say
they were all coming for a visit.</i>

1244
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:32,430
<i>She waited by the window
every day for the next two weeks.</i>

1245
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:34,630
Sure.

1246
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:37,270
<i>Frankie finally tracked them down.</i>

1247
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:41,270
<i>Learned they'd checked into their hotel
six days earlier.</i>

1248
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:44,670
<i>Kept leaving messages
which were never returned.</i>

1249
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:51,150
You don't have to hang around all day.

1250
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:57,670
I like it here. I don't mind.

1251
01:36:58,390 --> 01:37:02,190
In fact, if you weren't here,
I'd come here anyway to read my books.

1252
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:07,790
Mama will be here soon
to share some of the burden.

1253
01:37:08,150 --> 01:37:09,870
Well, it's no burden.

1254
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:12,150
Here.

1255
01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:15,350
Read this.

1256
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:26,150
Okay, okay, that's enough.

1257
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:27,990
That's terrible.

1258
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:33,270
Anyway, I'll tell you in English
what you were saying.

1259
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:37,470
It says:

1260
01:37:37,630 --> 01:37:41,030
<i>I will arise and go now
And go to Innisfree</i>

1261
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:45,550
<i>And a small cabin build there
Of clay and wattles made</i>

1262
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:50,670
<i>And I shall have some peace there
For peace comes dropping slow</i>

1263
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:55,750
<i>Dropping from the veils of the morning
To where the cricket sings.</i>

1264
01:37:58,030 --> 01:37:59,350
Not bad, huh?

1265
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:05,750
You gonna build a cabin, boss?

1266
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:08,150
-Me?
-Yeah.

1267
01:38:10,430 --> 01:38:13,070
You know, when you quit all this.

1268
01:38:14,950 --> 01:38:16,510
You mean boxing?

1269
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:19,590
No, I'll never quit.

1270
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:22,950
I like the stink too much, I guess.

1271
01:38:28,590 --> 01:38:30,990
You think?
Because I could see you there real easy...

1272
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:33,430
...with your books and lemon pie.

1273
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:38,310
How about you?
Would you like to go live in a cabin?

1274
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:42,430
I could learn how to bake.

1275
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:47,670
Well, then, I'II....

1276
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:49,910
Maybe I'll start looking then.

1277
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:12,190
Yeah.

1278
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:17,150
-Go ahead.
-All right. Okay, sounds good.

1279
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:23,190
Hi, I'm Frankie Dunn.
I met you back out in Missouri.

1280
01:39:23,350 --> 01:39:24,590
Where's my little girl?

1281
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:27,470
Don't you think you ought to go back
to the hotel and change?

1282
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:30,310
She doesn't know you've been here
a week visiting Woody and Mickey.

1283
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:33,790
We got business with my sister.
Why don't you just tell us where she is.

1284
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:36,590
Oh, you must be J.D.
And you must be the business guy?

1285
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:38,110
There's some rides you missed.

1286
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:40,830
Why don't you go back.
I'll tell her you couldn't make it.

1287
01:39:40,990 --> 01:39:43,150
I drove all the way here
to take care of my child.

1288
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:45,390
And you're suggesting
I'm not a good mother?

1289
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:47,150
Mary M. can't go nowhere.

1290
01:39:47,310 --> 01:39:50,190
If we could've taken her to Disneyland,
we would've.

1291
01:39:51,670 --> 01:39:52,790
Margaret Fitzgerald?

1292
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:54,870
Right down here, 301.

1293
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:56,790
-Come on, Mama.
-Let's go.

1294
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:05,030
And I saw myself breathing.

1295
01:40:05,230 --> 01:40:06,990
Like, my body was going up and down.

1296
01:40:07,190 --> 01:40:09,870
I thought,
"Why didn't somebody tell me?"

1297
01:40:13,230 --> 01:40:15,950
Your hair needs washing.
It's kind of greasy.

1298
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:30,790
It's just a....

1299
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:33,750
It's just some kind of legal thing.

1300
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:35,190
What is it?

1301
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:37,350
How we all doing here?

1302
01:40:37,510 --> 01:40:39,910
Sorry, darling,
but we ain't got a lot of time.

1303
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:44,110
Mr. Johnson's charging us a lot of money
to be here to make sure this is done proper.

1304
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:46,790
Why don't you just leave that.
I'll read it to her later.

1305
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:48,430
Hey, old man...

1306
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:50,030
...you part of our family?

1307
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:52,510
Stay the hell out of this.

1308
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:55,710
Read it to me, Mama.

1309
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:59,270
Well, it's just something legal
to protect your money.

1310
01:41:00,030 --> 01:41:01,510
Mama, you don't have to worry.

1311
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:05,590
The boxing commission's
paying for all this, everything.

1312
01:41:05,950 --> 01:41:07,990
But what if they don't, Mary M?

1313
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:10,870
Mr. Johnson says
they can take my house.

1314
01:41:11,030 --> 01:41:14,070
If you assign your assets to your mother,
no one can touch them.

1315
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:15,990
No doctors, no funeral expenses.

1316
01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:19,630
-Nothing.
-Yeah, look, why don't you just leave it.

1317
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:23,510
-Then I'll just read it to her later on--
-With respect, this ain't your business.

1318
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:27,270
All right. I'll be out in the hall.

1319
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:35,510
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

1320
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:38,750
You sign that paper...

1321
01:41:39,150 --> 01:41:41,150
...it'll take care of your family...

1322
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:43,590
...the way your daddy
would've wanted you to.

1323
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:50,070
How do you make your mark?

1324
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:53,670
Can you hold a pen?

1325
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:56,110
She gotta do it with her teeth, Mama.

1326
01:41:56,270 --> 01:41:58,230
You gotta put it in her mouth.

1327
01:41:59,590 --> 01:42:01,230
Here you go, honey.

1328
01:42:04,230 --> 01:42:06,190
Did you see the fight, Mama?

1329
01:42:06,470 --> 01:42:08,550
Honey, you know how I feel about that.

1330
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,550
I did pretty good.

1331
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:13,510
You lost, Mary M.

1332
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:17,950
Ain't your fault, the way I heard it,
but you lost.

1333
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:22,150
Don't wanna lose the rest
of what you got left.

1334
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:24,070
There you go.

1335
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:34,830
What happened to you?

1336
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:36,750
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

1337
01:42:38,550 --> 01:42:41,830
Mama, you take Mardell and J.D.
and get home.

1338
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:46,790
Before I tell that lawyer that you were
so worried about your welfare...

1339
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:50,030
...you never signed those house papers
like you were supposed to.

1340
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:55,070
So any time I feel like it,
I can sell that house...

1341
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:58,350
...from under your fat, lazy,
hillbilly asses.

1342
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:03,470
And if you ever come back,
that's exactly what I'll do.

1343
01:43:43,110 --> 01:43:47,070
Well, maybe someone ought
to count to 10.

1344
01:44:00,070 --> 01:44:02,110
Don't smell real pretty, does it, doc?

1345
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:06,470
We might have to lose it, Maggie.

1346
01:45:20,310 --> 01:45:23,030
They took my leg, boss.

1347
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:30,070
It's gonna be all right, you hear?

1348
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:34,150
I always hear your voice, boss.

1349
01:46:04,590 --> 01:46:06,070
You need anything?

1350
01:46:09,710 --> 01:46:12,230
<i>I need to know what "mo cuishle" means.</i>

1351
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:15,630
But you didn't win.

1352
01:46:16,190 --> 01:46:18,030
I don't have to tell you.

1353
01:46:21,590 --> 01:46:24,070
You're the meanest man I ever met.

1354
01:46:24,230 --> 01:46:26,430
No wonder no one loves you.

1355
01:46:29,870 --> 01:46:32,150
You remind me of my daddy.

1356
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:36,630
Well, he must have been...

1357
01:46:37,110 --> 01:46:40,270
...a very intelligent, handsome man.

1358
01:46:43,950 --> 01:46:46,990
You ain't gonna make me talk
no more Yeats, are you?

1359
01:46:48,830 --> 01:46:50,190
No, I was...

1360
01:46:51,630 --> 01:46:54,430
...Iooking at this catalog
from City College.

1361
01:46:56,630 --> 01:46:58,870
I thought I'd get you a wheelchair...

1362
01:46:59,310 --> 01:47:02,590
...maybe the kind that operates
by blowing through a straw.

1363
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:06,190
I thought maybe you'd like
to go back to school.

1364
01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:13,390
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

1365
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:17,190
Sure.

1366
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:20,390
Anything you want.

1367
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:24,910
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

1368
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:39,630
Don't even think about that.

1369
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:45,670
I can't be like this, Frankie.

1370
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:50,470
Not after what I done.

1371
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:52,550
I seen the world.

1372
01:47:55,470 --> 01:47:57,590
People chanted my name.

1373
01:47:58,550 --> 01:47:59,670
Well...

1374
01:48:01,550 --> 01:48:04,870
...not my name,
some damn name you gave me.

1375
01:48:07,790 --> 01:48:10,150
But they were chanting for me.

1376
01:48:13,550 --> 01:48:15,790
I was in magazines.

1377
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:22,070
You think I ever dreamed that'd happen?

1378
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:29,830
I was born at 2 pounds,
1 and a half ounces.

1379
01:48:33,110 --> 01:48:36,550
Daddy used to tell me
I fought to get into this world...

1380
01:48:39,790 --> 01:48:42,030
...and I'd fight my way out.

1381
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:49,590
That's all I wanna do, Frankie.

1382
01:48:51,670 --> 01:48:54,030
I just don't wanna fight you to do it.

1383
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:58,190
I got what I needed.

1384
01:49:02,030 --> 01:49:04,390
I got it all.

1385
01:49:07,790 --> 01:49:10,710
Don't let them keep
taking it away from me.

1386
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:20,350
Don't let me lie here till I can't hear
those people chanting no more.

1387
01:49:25,110 --> 01:49:27,310
I can't.

1388
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:29,990
Please.

1389
01:49:31,950 --> 01:49:34,310
Please, don't ask me.

1390
01:49:36,350 --> 01:49:38,350
I'm asking.

1391
01:49:41,790 --> 01:49:43,630
I can't.

1392
01:50:25,710 --> 01:50:27,590
Hello?

1393
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:34,750
<i>In the middle of the night...</i>

1394
01:50:34,910 --> 01:50:37,790
<i>...Maggie had found her own solution.</i>

1395
01:50:38,350 --> 01:50:40,430
<i>She had bit her tongue.</i>

1396
01:50:47,230 --> 01:50:49,950
Stop. Stop.

1397
01:50:53,270 --> 01:50:55,790
Look at me. Look at me.

1398
01:51:09,550 --> 01:51:13,150
<i>Nearly bled to death
before they stitched her up.</i>

1399
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:17,750
<i>She came around and ripped them out
before Frankie even got there.</i>

1400
01:51:18,030 --> 01:51:20,110
<i>They stitched her up again...</i>

1401
01:51:20,310 --> 01:51:23,350
<i>...padded the tongue
so she couldn't bite.</i>

1402
01:51:40,910 --> 01:51:43,150
You can't do it, you know that.

1403
01:51:44,910 --> 01:51:46,830
I do, Father.

1404
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:49,630
But you don't know how thick she is...

1405
01:51:49,790 --> 01:51:52,230
...how hard it was to train her.

1406
01:51:52,630 --> 01:51:56,350
Other fighters would do
exactly what you'd say to them...

1407
01:51:56,510 --> 01:52:01,750
...and she'd ask, why this and why that,
and then do it her own way anyway.

1408
01:52:02,430 --> 01:52:04,590
How she fought for the title, I....

1409
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:06,190
It wasn't by anything....

1410
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:09,270
Well, it wasn't by listening to me.

1411
01:52:17,950 --> 01:52:20,150
But now she wants to die...

1412
01:52:20,310 --> 01:52:22,470
...and I just wanna keep her with me.

1413
01:52:26,630 --> 01:52:30,670
And I swear to God, Father, it's....

1414
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:33,870
It's committing a sin by doing it.

1415
01:52:34,030 --> 01:52:37,310
By keeping her alive, I'm killing her.

1416
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:40,590
Do you know what I mean?
How do I get around that?

1417
01:52:41,870 --> 01:52:44,590
You don't. You step aside, Frankie.

1418
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:46,630
You leave her with God.

1419
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:50,670
She's not asking for God's help.
She's asking for mine.

1420
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:54,630
Frankie, I've seen you at Mass
almost every day for 23 years.

1421
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:56,750
The only person comes
to church that much...

1422
01:52:56,910 --> 01:52:58,510
...is the kind who can't
forgive himself for something.

1423
01:52:58,670 --> 01:53:00,950
Whatever sins you're carrying...

1424
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:03,790
...they're nothing compared to this.

1425
01:53:04,150 --> 01:53:08,150
Forget about God or heaven and hell.

1426
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:11,270
If you do this thing, you'll be lost.

1427
01:53:14,590 --> 01:53:16,750
Somewhere so deep...

1428
01:53:18,510 --> 01:53:20,830
...you'll never find yourself again.

1429
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:29,070
I think I did it already.

1430
01:53:50,070 --> 01:53:53,270
We're keeping her sedated
so she won't try that again.

1431
01:54:55,790 --> 01:54:58,350
I went to see Maggie this morning.

1432
01:55:00,030 --> 01:55:01,950
You must have been somewhere else.

1433
01:55:03,070 --> 01:55:04,870
Yeah.

1434
01:55:08,550 --> 01:55:10,550
You got a fight I don't know about?

1435
01:55:15,750 --> 01:55:17,910
It wasn't your fault.

1436
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:20,390
I was wrong to say that.

1437
01:55:20,630 --> 01:55:22,510
You're damn right.

1438
01:55:23,830 --> 01:55:25,110
I found you a fighter...

1439
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:28,670
...and you made her
the best fighter she could be.

1440
01:55:31,150 --> 01:55:32,550
I killed her.

1441
01:55:32,710 --> 01:55:34,510
Don't say that.

1442
01:55:34,870 --> 01:55:37,310
Maggie walked through that door
with nothing but guts.

1443
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:40,550
No chance in the world of being
what she needed to be.

1444
01:55:40,710 --> 01:55:43,950
A year and a half later, she's fighting
for the championship of the world.

1445
01:55:44,110 --> 01:55:45,310
You did that.

1446
01:55:47,470 --> 01:55:49,870
People die every day, Frankie.

1447
01:55:50,030 --> 01:55:51,830
Mopping floors, washing dishes.

1448
01:55:52,150 --> 01:55:54,030
And you know what
their last thought is?

1449
01:55:54,190 --> 01:55:56,550
"I never got my shot."

1450
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:59,230
Because of you, Maggie got her shot.

1451
01:56:00,430 --> 01:56:03,950
If she dies today, you know what
her last thought will be?

1452
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:07,070
"I think I did all right."

1453
01:56:14,350 --> 01:56:16,830
I know I could rest with that.

1454
01:56:19,390 --> 01:56:20,390
Yeah.

1455
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:22,710
Yeah.

1456
01:56:33,310 --> 01:56:34,950
Yeah.

1457
01:57:11,630 --> 01:57:12,990
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

1458
01:57:13,150 --> 01:57:14,590
Yeah.

1459
01:57:40,430 --> 01:57:41,990
All right.

1460
01:57:45,990 --> 01:57:48,350
I'm gonna disconnect your air machine...

1461
01:57:49,190 --> 01:57:51,350
...then you're gonna go to sleep.

1462
01:57:55,870 --> 01:57:58,510
Then I'll give you a shot, and you'II...

1463
01:57:59,550 --> 01:58:01,070
...stay asleep.

1464
01:58:06,190 --> 01:58:07,910
<i>Mo cuishle...</i>

1465
01:58:09,390 --> 01:58:12,830
...means "my darling, my blood."

1466
01:59:18,150 --> 01:59:20,830
<i>He gave her a single shot.</i>

1467
01:59:21,190 --> 01:59:25,230
<i>It was enough adrenaline
to do the job a few times over.</i>

1468
01:59:25,550 --> 01:59:28,310
<i>He didn't want her
going through this again.</i>

1469
02:00:16,110 --> 02:00:17,750
<i>Then he walked out.</i>

1470
02:00:18,350 --> 02:00:21,510
<i>I don't think he had anything left.</i>

1471
02:00:39,310 --> 02:00:41,430
<i>I went back to the gym.</i>

1472
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:45,230
<i>Waited, figuring he'd turn up
sooner or later.</i>

1473
02:01:04,070 --> 02:01:07,350
<i>And that's when a ghost
came through the door.</i>

1474
02:01:09,790 --> 02:01:12,710
I got to thinking what you said,
Mr. Scrap.

1475
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:15,350
What was that, Danger?

1476
02:01:16,910 --> 02:01:19,390
Anybody can lose one fight.

1477
02:01:20,590 --> 02:01:22,350
That's the truth.

1478
02:01:23,150 --> 02:01:25,590
Go on, put your gloves on.
You missed a lot of training.

1479
02:01:27,470 --> 02:01:29,870
Will do, Mr. Scrap. Sure thing.

1480
02:01:47,910 --> 02:01:50,910
<i>Frankie never came back at all.</i>

1481
02:02:05,070 --> 02:02:09,070
<i>Frankie didn't leave a note,
and nobody knew where he went.</i>

1482
02:02:09,390 --> 02:02:11,830
<i>I'd hoped he'd gone to find you...</i>

1483
02:02:11,990 --> 02:02:14,870
<i>...and ask you one more time
to forgive him.</i>

1484
02:02:15,030 --> 02:02:18,350
<i>But maybe he didn't have
anything left in his heart.</i>

1485
02:02:18,510 --> 02:02:21,710
<i>I just hope he found someplace
where he could find a little peace.</i>

1486
02:02:22,190 --> 02:02:25,150
<i>A place set in the cedars and oak trees.</i>

1487
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:28,590
<i>Somewhere between
nowhere and goodbye.</i>

1488
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:32,150
<i>But that's probably wishful thinking.</i>

1489
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:34,550
<i>No matter where he is...</i>

1490
02:02:35,070 --> 02:02:39,630
<i>...I thought you should know what kind
of man your father really was.</i>

1491
02:06:59,590 --> 02:07:01,510
