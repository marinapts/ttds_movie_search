1
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,799
<i>I believe we have a choice in this
world about how to tell sad stories.</i>

2
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,639
<i>On the one hand,
you can sugarcoat it.</i>

3
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,239
<i>The way they do in movies
and romance novels...</i>

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,799
<i>where beautiful people
learn beautiful lessons...</i>

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,079
<i>where nothing is too messed
up that can't be fixed...</i>

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,603
<i>with an apology
and a Peter Gabriel song.</i>

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,319
<i>I like that version as much
as the next girl does,</i>

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,081
<i>believe me.</i>

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,929
<i>It's just not the truth.</i>

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,406
<i>This is the truth.</i>

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,961
<i>Sorry.</i>

12
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,200
<i>Late in the winter
of my seventeenth year...</i>

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,759
<i>my mother decided
that I was depressed.</i>

14
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,319
She just eats like a bird,
she barely leaves the house.

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,999
I am not depressed, Mom.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,839
She's reading the same
book over and over.

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,999
She's depressed.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,559
I'm not depressed.

19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,039
<i>The booklets and the websites
always list depression as</i>

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,399
<i>a side effect of cancer.</i>

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,801
<i>Depression's not
a side effect of cancer.</i>

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,288
<i>It's a side effect of dying.</i>

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,008
<i>Which is what was happening to me.</i>

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,919
I may switch you to Zoloft.

25
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,599
Or Lexapro.

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,159
And twice a day instead of once.

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,839
- Why stop there?
- Hmm?

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,039
Really, just keep them coming.

29
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,919
I'm like the Keith Richards
of cancer kids.

30
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,519
Have you been going to that
support group I suggested?

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,079
Yeah, it's not my thing.

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,599
Support groups can be a great way

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,359
for you to connect
with people who are...

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,559
Who are... What?

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,919
on the same journey.

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,079
"Journey"? Really?

37
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,727
Give it a chance.

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,959
Who knows, you might even
find it enlightening.

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,119
All right.

40
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,006
Are you guys ready?

41
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,879
We are gathered here today

42
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,166
literally in the heart of Jesus.

43
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,079
We're here with J.C.

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,639
Who wants to share their
story with the group?

45
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,719
I'm Angel.

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,049
I have acute myeloid leukemia.

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,200
Sid. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

48
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,879
Hi, I'm PJ. Um,
I have neuroblastoma.

49
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,239
I'm Patrick.

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,439
Testicular.

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,726
<i>I'll spare you the gory details
of Patrick's ball cancer.</i>

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,639
<i>Basically, they found it
in his nuts...</i>

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,881
<i>they cut most of it out, and he
almost died, but he didn't die.</i>

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,159
<i>So now, here he is,
divorced, friendless...</i>

55
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,439
<i>living on his parents' couch...</i>

56
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,519
<i>exploiting his cancer-tastic
past in the heart of Jesus.</i>

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,839
<i>Literally.</i>

58
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,799
<i>To show us that one day,
if we're lucky...</i>

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,404
<i>we could be just like him.</i>

60
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,287
Who's next?

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,199
Hazel?

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,759
Um...

63
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,119
I'm Hazel.

64
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,839
Uh, thyroid, originally...

65
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,759
but now with quite the impressive

66
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,639
satellite colony in my lungs.

67
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,839
And how are you doing?

68
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,001
<i>Uh, you mean besides
the terminal cancer?</i>

69
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,288
All right, I guess.

70
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,962
We're here for you, Hazel.

71
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,328
Why don't I play another song?

72
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,359
<i>Christ is our friend</i>

73
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,359
<i>And he'll be there till the end</i>

74
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,679
<i>Christ is our friend</i>

75
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,159
<i>And he'll be there till the end</i>

76
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,687
<i>Christ</i>

77
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,370
Hey, sweet pea.

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,768
So... was it awesome?

79
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,639
"Yeah, Mom, it was awesome!"

80
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,039
<i>And that was my life.</i>

81
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,039
<i>Reality shows.</i>

82
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,519
<i>Doctor's appointments.</i>

83
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,079
<i>Eight prescription drugs,
three times a day.</i>

84
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,330
<i>But worst, worst, worst of all...</i>

85
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,519
<i>Support group.</i>

86
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,439
- You cannot make me.
- Of course we can.

87
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,959
We're your parents.

88
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,399
Come on, we've been through this.

89
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,599
You need to go.

90
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,879
You need to make friends,
and be a teenager.

91
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,279
Mom, if you want me
to be a teenager,

92
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,079
you don't send me to support group.

93
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,399
You gotta get me a fake ID
so that I can go to clubs...

94
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,119
and drink gimlets and take pot.

95
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,359
Uh, you don't "take" pot.

96
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,759
Well, that is the kind of thing
I would know with a fake ID.

97
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,727
Can you just get in the car, please?

98
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,719
<i>And so I went.</i>

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,159
<i>Not because I wanted to, or because
I thought it would help me...</i>

100
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,279
<i>but for the same reason
I did anything these days.</i>

101
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,439
<i>To make my parents happy.</i>

102
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,759
I really don't understand
why I can't just drive myself.

103
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,119
It's not like you're
gonna do anything.

104
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,119
You're just gonna sit here
and wait again.

105
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,599
Of course I'm not.

106
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,319
No, I've got stuff to do.
I'm gonna do errands.

107
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,479
Yeah.

108
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,959
I love you.

109
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,079
I love you, too.

110
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,011
Have fun.

111
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,319
<i>The only thing worse than
biting it from cancer...</i>

112
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,082
<i>is having a kid
bite it from cancer.</i>

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,799
Hey!

114
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,368
Make some friends.

115
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,439
Oh, sorry.

116
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,639
- I'll take the stairs.
- No problem.

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,241
Thank you.

118
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,526
Sorry.

119
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,206
My bad.

120
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,604
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,005
Oh, my God.

122
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,445
<i>So, who would like to start?</i>

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,604
Does anyone want to start?
Who wants to kick it off?

124
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,159
Go ahead.

125
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,479
I'm Beth. I have
spindle cell sarcoma.

126
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,491
It's been an okay week.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,039
Isaac, I know that you're facing
some challenges right now.

128
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,759
Do you want to share
with the group?

129
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,519
Or maybe your friend, here?

130
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,167
No, I'll share.

131
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,199
Hey, guys. Uh...

132
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,199
Hi, I'm Isaac.

133
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,199
I have retinoblastoma.

134
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,999
We had surgery on one eye
when I was younger...

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,759
so this is a glass eye.

136
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,159
And then I'm going in to the
hospital to have another surgery...

137
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,559
to take out the other eye.

138
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,199
So, after that surgery, I'm
just gonna be totally blind.

139
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,719
But I'm lucky, because I have this
beautiful, smoking hot girlfriend...

140
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,687
who's way out of my league. Monica.

141
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,439
And I have great friends like
Augustus Waters to help me out.

142
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,519
So, that's what's up. Thanks.

143
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,399
We're here for you, Isaac.

144
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,206
Thank you.

145
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,360
Your turn, Gus.

146
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,566
Yeah, sure.

147
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,079
Um, I'm Augustus Waters.

148
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,919
I'm 18 years old

149
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,959
and I had a touch of osteosarcoma
about a year-and-a-half ago.

150
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,087
So, I've lost this baby
as a result.

151
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,919
And, uh, now I'm part
cyborg, which is awesome.

152
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,399
But, really, I'm just
here at Isaac's request.

153
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,119
And how are you feeling, Gus?

154
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,079
I'm grand, yeah.

155
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,887
I'm on a roller coaster that
only goes up, my friend.

156
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,719
Maybe you'd like to share
your fears with the group?

157
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,731
My fears?

158
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,759
Oblivion.

159
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,919
Oblivion?

160
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,279
Yeah.

161
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,839
You see, I intend to live
an extraordinary life.

162
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,439
To be remembered.

163
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,639
So, I'd say if I have any fears,

164
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,368
it would be to not do that.

165
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,762
Would anyone else in the
group like to speak to that?

166
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,679
Hazel?

167
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,884
Unexpected.

168
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,239
I just want to say
that there's gonna

169
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,319
come a time when
all of us are dead.

170
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,959
There was a time before humans

171
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,759
and there's gonna be a time after.

172
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,119
It could be tomorrow, it could
be a million years from now.

173
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,159
And when it does,
there will be no one left...

174
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,639
to remember Cleopatra or
Muhammad Ali or Mozart...

175
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,129
let alone any of us.

176
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,719
Oblivion's inevitable.

177
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,448
And if that scares you, then
I suggest you ignore it.

178
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,604
God knows it's what
everyone else does.

179
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,970
Well, that's some good advice.

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,288
And I like all this because it's
really nice to hear everybody...

181
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,284
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

182
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,925
- Always.
- Always.

183
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,645
- Always.
- Always.

184
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,803
"Literally."

185
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,759
I thought we were
in a church basement...

186
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,399
but apparently we were literally
in the heart of Jesus.

187
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,729
Oh, yeah.

188
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,039
What's your name?

189
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,559
Hazel.

190
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,559
No, what's your full name?

191
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,049
Hazel Grace Lancaster.

192
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,359
What?

193
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,439
I didn't say anything.

194
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,559
Why are you looking
at me like that?

195
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,279
Because you're beautiful.

196
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,399
Oh, my God.

197
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,128
I enjoy looking
at beautiful people.

198
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,719
See, I decided a while back...

199
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,279
not to deny myself the simpler
pleasures of existence.

200
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,039
Particularly, as you
so astutely pointed out,

201
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,399
we're all gonna die pretty soon.

202
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,759
Okay, well, that's great.
But I am not beautiful.

203
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,879
Hey, Gus.

204
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,527
Hi, Lisa.

205
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,799
I like it when you say it first.

206
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,879
I like it when you say it first.

207
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,079
Okay.

208
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,559
Always.

209
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,079
Always.

210
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,719
What is with the "always"?

211
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,319
"Always" is, like, their thing.

212
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,526
They'll "always" love
each other, and whatnot.

213
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,847
They probably texted "always" to each
other 14 million times this year.

214
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,846
He's got to be hurting her boob.

215
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,639
Let's go watch a movie.

216
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,119
- What?
- Hmm?

217
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,599
Huh?

218
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,567
Um...

219
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,839
I'm free later this week,
we could...

220
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,885
No, I mean now.

221
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,839
You could be an axe murderer.

222
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,959
There's always that possibility.

223
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,239
Come on, Hazel Grace.
Take a risk.

224
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,887
I don't...

225
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,799
Really?

226
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,519
That is disgusting.

227
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,599
What?

228
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,119
What, do you think that
that's cool or something?

229
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,479
You just ruined this whole thing.

230
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,319
- The whole thing?
- Yes, this whole thing!

231
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,879
Oh, man.

232
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,279
Ugh. And you were
doing really well, too.

233
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,159
God! There's always
a hamartia, isn't there?

234
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,479
And yours is even though
you had freaking cancer...

235
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,319
you're willing to give
money to a corporation...

236
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,959
for the chance to acquire
even more cancer?

237
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,839
Let me just tell you that not
being able to breathe sucks!

238
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,479
It totally sucks.

239
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,241
"Hamartia"?

240
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,519
It's a fatal flaw.

241
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,319
Ah, a fatal...

242
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,399
Hazel Grace,

243
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,923
they don't actually hurt
you unless you light them.

244
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,639
Hmm?

245
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,730
I've never lit one.

246
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,319
It's a metaphor, see?

247
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,083
You put the thing that does the
killing right between your teeth...

248
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,721
but you never give it
the power to kill you.

249
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,919
A metaphor.

250
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,651
Hey, sweetheart.
Is it <i>Top Model</i> time?

251
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,519
No. Uh...

252
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,770
I've made plans
with Augustus Waters.

253
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,879
Whoa!

254
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,359
Oh, my God.

255
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,879
Ooh!

256
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,199
Yeah, I failed my test
a couple times.

257
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,559
You don't say.

258
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,119
Actually, the fourth time
I took the test,

259
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,079
it was going about
how this is going.

260
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,999
And when it was over...

261
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,399
the instructor looks over
at me, and she says...

262
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,079
"Your driving, while unpleasant,
is not technically unsafe."

263
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,159
Cancer perk.

264
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,489
Total cancer perk.

265
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,159
So, tell me about you.

266
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,491
Um, I was 13 when they found it.

267
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,359
<i>Pretty much worst-case scenario.</i>

268
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,679
<i>Thyroid, stage four.</i>

269
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,361
<i>Not much they could do.</i>

270
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,843
<i>Which didn't stop them, of course.</i>

271
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,559
<i>Surgery.</i>

272
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,239
<i>Radiation.</i>

273
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,719
<i>Chemo.</i>

274
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,526
<i>More radiation.</i>

275
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,848
<i>All of which worked for a while.</i>

276
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,319
<i>But, then stopped working.</i>

277
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,439
<i>And then one day, my lungs
started filling up with water.</i>

278
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,599
Nurse! We need a nurse right now!

279
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,879
<i>I couldn't breathe.</i>

280
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,559
<i>No one could get it under control.</i>

281
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,049
You can let go, sweetie.

282
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,719
Don't be afraid.

283
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,439
<i>That should have been the end.</i>

284
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,565
Oh, my God.

285
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,239
<i>But then something
strange happened.</i>

286
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,119
<i>The antibiotics kicked in.</i>

287
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,279
<i>They drained the fluid
from my lungs.</i>

288
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,006
<i>I got some strength back.</i>

289
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,959
<i>Next thing I know, I found
myself in an experimental trial.</i>

290
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,439
<i>You know, the ones that are famous</i>

291
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,439
<i>in the Republic of
Cancervania for not working.</i>

292
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,959
<i>It's called Phalanxifor.</i>

293
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,959
<i>It didn't work in over
70% of the patients...</i>

294
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,679
<i>but for some reason
it's been working for me.</i>

295
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,279
So, they called it
"The Miracle."

296
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,079
Of course, my lungs still
suck at being lungs...

297
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,639
but, theoretically, they could
continue to suck like this...

298
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,479
for, I don't know, a while maybe.

299
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,119
So, are you back in school?

300
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,119
I got my GED, so I'm
taking classes at MCC.

301
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,599
Whoa! A college girl!

302
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,079
Well, that explains
the aura of sophistication.

303
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,681
Oh! Careful!

304
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,599
Oops.

305
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,046
Welcome to my humble abode.

306
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,088
Uh, my folks call them
"encouragements."

307
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,519
Don't ask.

308
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,479
Hi, guys!

309
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,319
- Hey!
- Augustus, hi.

310
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,445
New friend?

311
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,679
Yeah. This is Hazel Grace.

312
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,199
Hey. Oh, it's just "Hazel."

313
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,439
How's it going, "Just Hazel"?

314
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,319
Hi, Hazel, how are you?

315
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,199
Yeah, we're going downstairs. Bye.

316
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,723
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Nice to meet you, too.

317
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,639
This is it.

318
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,959
Augusto World.

319
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,279
This is my room.

320
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,325
Wow.

321
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,039
It's an impressive collection.

322
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,359
Yeah, I used to play.

323
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,519
Do you mind if I sit down?

324
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,122
Yeah. Make yourself at home.

325
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,800
<i>Mi casa es tu casa.</i>

326
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,811
Sorry, the, um, stairs...

327
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,244
and the standing...

328
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,002
Yeah, I understand.

329
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,079
Seriously, are you okay?

330
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,359
Yeah, yeah.

331
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,239
All right. What's your story?

332
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,763
I already told you.

333
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,559
I was diagnosed when I was 13...

334
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,810
No, no, no. Not your cancer
story, your real story.

335
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,319
Your interests, your hobbies,

336
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,079
your passions, your weird fetishes.

337
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,399
"Weird fetishes"?

338
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,239
Think of something. The first
thing that pops in your head.

339
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,887
Something you love.

340
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,079
<i>An Imperial Affliction.</i>

341
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,919
Okay. What's that?

342
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,239
It's a novel.

343
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,079
It's my favorite novel.

344
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,199
Wait, does it have zombies in it?

345
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,279
Zombies? No!

346
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,679
Stormtroopers?

347
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,759
No, it's not that kind of a book.

348
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,879
Okay, what's it about?

349
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,720
Uh, cancer.

350
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,399
It's about cancer?

351
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,399
But not like that.
Trust me, it's amazing.

352
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,439
The author, his name
is Peter Van Houten.

353
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,079
He's the only person I've ever
come across in my life...

354
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,599
who, A, understands what
it's like to be dying...

355
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,919
but, B, hasn't actually died.

356
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,479
Okay.

357
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,119
I will read this horrible book
with this very boring title...

358
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,799
that does not include
zombies or Stormtroopers.

359
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,731
And in exchange...

360
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,959
you will read this.

361
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,279
This haunting,

362
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,201
yet brilliant novelization
of my favorite video game.

363
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,764
<i>"Counterinsurgence."</i>

364
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,999
Yeah, don't laugh. It's awesome.

365
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,080
It's about honor, and sacrifice,
and bravery, and heroism.

366
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,959
It's about embracing your destiny,

367
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,319
and leaving a mark on the world.

368
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,479
Well, thank you.

369
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,799
Wait, your hands are so cold.

370
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,399
Well, they're not so much cold
as just under-oxygenated.

371
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,119
- Hazel Grace?
- Hmm?

372
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,404
I love it when you
talk medical to me.

373
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,121
That's different.

374
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,567
Did he give it to you?

375
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,805
By "it," do you mean herpes?

376
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,439
Wow.

377
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,799
Yes, I did.

378
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,129
It's a mother's dream.

379
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,039
Hey, don't worry.

380
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,879
Oh, my God, Mom.
I'm not worried.

381
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,479
It's not a big deal.

382
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,719
Yeah.

383
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,608
We just hung out, it's not like
I'm waiting for him to call me.

384
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,999
<i>- Is that what...?
- Yeah.</i>

385
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,599
Because I thought
those were peppers.

386
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,279
Today, in China,

387
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,440
International Goji Berry Day.

388
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,239
Isn't that great?

389
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,599
I like the color.

390
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,679
Mmm-hmm.

391
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,759
- This is the dry.
- Uh-huh. Very good.

392
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,010
- They're good, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

393
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,328
So, do they eat a lot of goji
berries on Goji Berry Day?

394
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,599
I did something with the dessert...

395
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,879
just to try to keep
the goji berry theme going.

396
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,209
Because they're
an amazing antioxidant.

397
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,079
Well, I like it.

398
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,719
We should do it every year.

399
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,959
- Every year.
- We should do it every year.

400
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,039
I know.

401
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,369
I really do like these.

402
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,089
Honey, would you like
to be excused?

403
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,239
What?

404
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,999
<i>Hazel Grace.</i>

405
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,319
Welcome to the sweet torture of
reading <i>An Imperial Affliction.</i>

406
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,759
<i>But now I'm breaking all the rules!</i>

407
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,319
Are you okay?

408
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,399
<i>And now I'm breaking all the rules</i>

409
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,999
Uh... Me? Yeah,
I am excellent.

410
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,762
I am, however, with Isaac, and...

411
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,444
Isaac, does Support Group Hazel
make this better or worse?

412
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,479
<i>I've been wasting all my time</i>

413
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,159
Isaac! Focus on me.

414
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,479
<i>Been wasting all my time</i>

415
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,759
How fast can you get here?

416
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,839
Um...

417
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,279
<i>Great. Well,
the door's open.</i>

418
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,879
I gotta run. Bye.

419
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,319
Hello?

420
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,199
Hazel.

421
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,290
Isaac, Hazel Grace from the
Support Group is here.

422
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,841
- Hi.
- Hi.

423
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,799
Uh... A gentle reminder...

424
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,199
Isaac's in the midst of a
psychotic episode right now.

425
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,679
You look really nice, by the way.

426
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,839
I like this color on you.

427
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,439
Thank you.

428
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,405
Isaac.

429
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,559
Isaac, Hazel's here.

430
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,999
Hey, Isaac.

431
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,199
Hey, Hazel.

432
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,879
How you doing?

433
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,519
I'm doing okay.

434
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,964
It seems Isaac and Monica are
no longer a going concern.

435
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,799
Oh, Isaac, I'm so sorry.

436
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,199
Do you want to talk about it?

437
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,849
No, I just want to cry
and play video games.

438
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,159
However, you know, it doesn't
hurt to talk to him...

439
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,719
if you have any sage words
of feminine advice.

440
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,919
I actually think that his
response is fairly appropriate.

441
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,599
"Pain demands to be felt."

442
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,690
You're quoting my book.

443
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,679
She said she wanted to break up
with me before the surgery...

444
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,079
because she couldn't handle it.

445
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,079
I'm about to lose my eyesight,
and she can't handle it.

446
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,559
I kept saying "always" to her.
Like, "Always."

447
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,999
And she kept talking over me

448
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,602
and not saying it back, and...

449
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,439
It was like I was gone
already, you know?

450
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,879
You know, sometimes...

451
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,119
people don't understand
the promises

452
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,399
that they're making
when they make them.

453
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,001
I know, but...

454
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,119
I feel like such a loser.

455
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,439
I still have her necklace on.

456
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,759
Take it off.

457
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,566
Dude, take that off.

458
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,759
Yeah.

459
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,279
Here we go, man.
Here we go.

460
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,723
I just want to kick something.

461
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,239
Don't hit that, don't hit that.

462
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,841
Uh...

463
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,405
- Hit this.
- Sorry.

464
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,559
I've been wanting to call
you for a few days now...

465
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,159
but I've been waiting
until I could form

466
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,250
a coherent thought about
<i>An Imperial Affliction.</i>

467
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,119
One second.

468
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,881
Isaac.

469
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,799
Pillows don't break.

470
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,084
You need to break something.

471
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,725
Try this.

472
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,839
- The trophy?
- Yeah.

473
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,919
Are you sure?

474
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,599
I've been looking for a way to tell
my father I kind of hate basketball.

475
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,770
Go to town!

476
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,439
Always!

477
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,999
<i>An Imperial Affliction.</i>

478
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,879
Yes. I'm so glad that you liked it.

479
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,679
Yes, I did.
But the ending.

480
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,359
I know.
It is rather abrupt.

481
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,759
"Rather abrupt"? Are you kidding?
It's evil!

482
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,119
I mean, I understand
that she dies...

483
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,639
but there's an unwritten
contract between author and...

484
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,839
- Gus?
- Yeah?

485
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,999
- Cool?
- Sure.

486
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,559
Between author and reader.

487
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,519
And I feel like ending your book
in the middle of a sentence...

488
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,519
violates that contract,
don't you think?

489
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,679
Okay, yes.

490
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,119
I know what you mean...

491
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,719
but, to be completely honest,

492
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,479
I think it's just so truthful.

493
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,439
You just die in the middle of life.

494
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,840
You die in the middle
of a sentence.

495
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,479
And, I don't know...

496
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,279
But I really would like to know

497
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,087
what happens to everyone
after Anna dies.

498
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,959
Like Anna's mother.

499
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,559
Yes, and the Dutch Tulip Man.

500
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,399
And Sisyphus the Hamster.

501
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,079
Yes!

502
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,799
Have you tried contacting
this Peter Van Houten fellow?

503
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,759
I've written him so many letters,

504
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,399
but he's never responded.

505
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,879
Apparently, he moved to Amsterdam

506
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,811
and became a recluse, and...

507
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,919
- Shame.
- Yeah.

508
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,239
Isaac...

509
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,808
You feeling better, buddy?

510
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,843
That's the thing about pain.

511
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,759
It demands to be felt.

512
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,011
I'll help you clean this up.

513
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,919
<i>Hazel Grace.</i>

514
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,079
Augustus Waters.

515
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,719
I cannot stop thinking
about this goddamn book.

516
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,999
<i>You're welcome.</i>

517
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,719
However, we do need closure,
don't you think?

518
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,439
That is exactly what I was asking

519
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,919
Van Houten for in my letters.

520
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,759
But he never responded.

521
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,805
Um, nope.

522
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,399
"Dear Mr. Waters...

523
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,599
"I am writing to thank you for
your electronic correspondence.

524
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,679
"I am grateful to anyone

525
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,239
<i>"to read my book."</i>

526
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,599
Augustus?

527
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,361
<i>Yes?</i>

528
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,959
What are you doing?

529
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,039
<i>I may have found...</i>

530
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,399
Van Houten's assistant,
emailed her.

531
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,333
Augustus!

532
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:39,439
She may have forwarded
that email on to Van Houten.

533
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,639
<i>Shall I continue?</i>

534
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,599
Oh, my God. Yeah, go, go, go!

535
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,879
"I am particularly
indebted to you, sir."

536
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,799
Hazel Grace,
he just called me "sir."

537
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,599
Augustus, keep reading,
keep reading!

538
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,279
"Both for your kind words about
<i>An Imperial Affliction...</i>

543
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,159
You did not, you did not!

544
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,239
<i>Of course I did.</i>

545
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,079

Oh, my God.

Do you think that I...

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,679
Check your inbox.

Oh, my God, Augustus.

I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out.

559

<i>Dear Mr. Peter Van Houten,</i>

560
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,919
<i>my name is Hazel Grace Lancaster.</i>

561
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,599
<i>My friend Augustus Waters...</i>

562

<i>who read your book
at my recommendation...</i>

564
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,119
<i>I hope you will not mind that
he shared that email with me.</i>

565
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,519
<i>I was wondering if you wouldn't mind
answering a few questions I have...</i>

566
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,039
<i>about what happens
after the end of the book.</i>

567
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,719
<i>Specifically the following.</i>

568
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,891
<i>Does Anna's mom marry
the Dutch Tulip Man?</i>

569
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,839
<i>And is the Dutch Tulip Man
up to something...</i>

570
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,965
<i>or is he just
completely misunderstood?</i>

571
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,119
<i>Lastly, I was hoping you could shed
some light on Sisyphus the Hamster.</i>

572
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,839
<i>These questions have
haunted me for years...</i>

573
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,519
<i>and I don't know how long I have
left to get answers to them.</i>

574
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,839
<i>I know that these are not
important literary questions...</i>

575
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,079
"and that your book is full of
important literary questions...

576
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,799
"but I would just
really like to know.

"Yours, with great admiration,

581
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,159
Not bad.

582
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,239
You think?

583
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,479
Yeah, I mean,
it's a bit pretentious...

584
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,079
<i>but then again, Van Houten
uses words like "tendentious"</i>

585
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,079
<i>and "Bacchanalia," so...</i>

586
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,170
I think he'll like it.

587
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,519
Is it really 1:00 AM?

588

<i>Is it?</i>

589
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,441
Yeah, I guess it is.

590
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,045
I should probably go to sleep.

591
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,722
Okay.

592
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,725
Okay.

593
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,204
Okay.

594
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,051
Okay.

595
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,645
Perhaps "okay"
will be our "always."

596
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,649
Okay.

597
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,771

Hazel?

611
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,839
- Mom!
- Hazel, what's wrong?

612
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,999
Mom, look at this.

613
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,648
Come here. Come here, come here.

614
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,486
Look.

615
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,519
- What?
- Yeah.

616
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,326
Peter Van Houten!

617
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,039
Look what he said!

618
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,359
"Should ever you find
yourself in Amsterdam"!

619
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,639
I have to go!

620
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,719
That's incredible.

621
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,399
He invited us to Amsterdam.

622
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,559
Amsterdam!

623
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,719
- Wow!
- Can we go?

624
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,721
I mean, do you think
we could actually go?

625
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,039
I mean, Amsterdam!

626
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,879
I want you to have everything
you want in the world.

627
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,239
But we don't have
the money, you know?

628
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,519
Just getting all the
equipment over there.

629
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,159
How do we do that?

630
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,491
Yeah, duh. I'm sorry.

631
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,084
Hey, you, I am so sorry.

632
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,930
It's okay.

633
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,439
Why don't you just ask
the Genies? Use your wish.

634
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,359
I already used it.
Pre-Miracle.

635
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,371
What'd you use it on?

636
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,569
Not Disney.

637
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,799
Hazel Grace, you did not
go to Disney World.

638
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,119
- You did not use your last dying wish...
- I was 13.

639
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,399
to go to Disney World.

640
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,679
And Epcot Center.

641
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,959
Oh, my God.

642
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,639
It was actually a really fun trip!

643
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,839
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

644
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,079
I met Goofy!

645
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,279
Now I'm just embarrassed.

646
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,479
Why are you embarrassed?

647
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,279
I can't believe I have a crush on
a girl with such cliche wishes.

648
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,564
Terrible.

649
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,206
You coming?

650
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,679
<i>The most important
thing in any MRI...</i>

651
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,408
<i>is to lie completely still.</i>

652
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,284
<i>But that day,
it was almost impossible.</i>

653
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,639
Hey, Gus! How are you?

654
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,605
Hi, Mrs. Lancaster.

655
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,159
Hey. Rik Smits jersey?

656
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,639
- Yeah, it is indeed.
- I loved that guy.

657
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,799
I'm Augustus Waters.

658
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,289
Nice to meet you.
I'm Michael.

659
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,359
- It's good to see you.
- Hi, Mrs. Lancaster.

660
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,042
Good to see you.

661
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,479
Hi, Hazel Grace.

662
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,159
Hi.

663
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,762
How would you like to go
on a picnic with me?

664
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,808
Um, I would love to go
on a picnic with you.

665
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,159
Shall we?

666
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,359
No. Let me...

667
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,885
I smell like hospital,
so I should just change.

668
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,159
So, uh...

669
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,799
you're a survivor yourself, huh?

670
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,879
Yeah.

671
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,079
I didn't cut this fellow
off for the hell of it.

672
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,239
Although it does make an
excellent weight-loss strategy.

673
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,365
Legs are very heavy.

674
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,999
How's your health now?

675
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,399
It's great. NEC for 14 months.

676
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,519
- Really?
- Yeah.

677
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,479
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah.

678
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,764
I'm very lucky.

679
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,441
Hey, listen, Gus.

680
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,565
You have to understand,
Hazel's still pretty sick.

681
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,919
And she will be
the rest of her life.

682
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,439
And she's gonna want to
keep up with you.

683
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,519
She's that kind of girl. But
the truth is, her lungs...

684
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,201
Ready, Gus?

685
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,161
Yeah.

686
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,719
All right. See you soon.

687
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,560
All right.

688
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,399
Oh!

689
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,359
Such a beautiful day.

690
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,439
Yeah.

691
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,959
Is this where you take all
of your romantic conquests?

692
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,879
Every last one of them.

693
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,721
That's probably why
I'm still a virgin.

694
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,802
You are not still a virgin.

695
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,239
Are you really?

696
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,639
Let me show you something.

697
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,251
See this circle?

698
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,639
That is a circle of virgins.

699
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,241
Uh-huh.

700
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,411
And this...

701
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,722
is 18-year-old dudes with one leg.

702
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,124
- Oh...
- So, yeah.

703
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,450
<i>Funky Bones</i> by Joep Van Lieshout.

704
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,119
He sounds quite Dutch.

705
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,359
And he is.

706
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,279
Much like Rik Smits.

707
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,609
And tulips.

708
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,399
Sandwich?

709
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,479
Let me guess.

710
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,208
Dutch cheese and tomato.

711
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,684
Sorry, the tomatoes are Mexican.

712
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,890
How dare you!

713
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,159
Hmm.

714
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,319
How cool is this?

715
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,839
They're using a skeleton
as a playground.

716
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,010
Think about that.

717
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,919
You do love your symbols.

718
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,919
Speaking of which,
you're probably wondering...

719
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,119
why you're sitting here eating
a bad cheese sandwich...

720
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,559
and drinking orange juice with
a guy in a Rik Smits jersey.

721
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,959
It actually has crossed my mind.

722
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,439
Well, Hazel Grace,
like so many before you...

723
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,089
and listen, I say this with
the utmost of affection...

724
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,079
you used your wish moronically.

725
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,959
Okay, we've been
through this. I was 13.

726
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,079
Hush! I am in the midst
of a grand soliloquy, here.

727
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,159
You were young, impressionable...

728
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,279
the Grim Reaper staring
you right in the face...

729
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,319
and it led you to rush into making
a wish you didn't really want.

730
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,039
But, how could little Hazel Grace,

731
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,599
having never read
<i>An Imperial Affliction...</i>

732
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,239
know that her one true wish was
to visit Mr. Peter Van Houten...

733
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,399
in his Amsterdam exile.

734
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,321
But I didn't save it, so...

735
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,961
It's a good thing I saved mine.

736
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,919
So, you're saying...

737
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,359
I'm not gonna give you my
wish or anything, Hazel.

738
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,039
If that's what you're thinking.

739
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,641
However...

740
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,008
I, too, have an interest in meeting
this Mr. Peter Van Houten...

741
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,079
and I don't really think
it would make much sense...

742
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,239
to meet him without the
girl who introduced me

743
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,439
to the book in the first place...

744
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,919
now, would it?

745
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,879
So I talked to the Genies,
and they're all for it.

746
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,050
We leave in a month.

747
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,279
No.

748
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,086
Mmm-hmm.

749
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,967
Oh, my God.

750
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,119
Oh, my God!

751
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,165
Augustus!

752
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,569
Thank you!

753
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,239
Apparently, they... I don't know
if they do this that often,

754
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,159
but they're willing to
bring me, too, and...

755
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,959
That's incredible.

756
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,719
Hazel, that's so beautiful.

757
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,839
I know.

758
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,679
And a little insane.

759
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,439
Oh, it's super insane. It's...
It's... It's... It's crazy!

760
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,639
- Well...
- It's Amsterdam!

761
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,959
He just met you...

762
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,319
- I know!
- ...and he's giving you his wish.

763
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,719
Well, we're sharing the wish. We're...
I mean, he... He... Yeah. We're sharing it.

764
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,731
That's sweet.

765
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,959
Unless...

766
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,799
What?

767
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,079
Is he your boyfriend? Is that...

768
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,079
Stop it! Do not...
He is not my...

769
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,639
Mom, focus,
we're talking about Amsterdam.

770
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,599
- I like him so much. I...
- Stop.

771
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,079
Pay attention. Please! Can I go?

772
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,889
Right, as your mom,
I love this idea.

773
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,566
And I... I think we
should talk to Dr. Maria.

774
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,559
Okay.

775
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,679
I don't know.

776
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,039
But you said that
the PET scan was encouraging.

777
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,839
Well, the PET scan is encouraging,

778
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,159
but we don't know how long
it will stay that way.

779
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,759
Okay, I'm not seeking political asylum.
It's a few days. It's a vacation!

780
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,319
- It's true.
- What if you get sick?

781
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,839
In a foreign country?

782
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,999
They have doctors in
Amsterdam. And cancer.

783
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,999
Well, not all cancers are alike, and
yours is particularly unusual, Hazel.

784
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,519
The only way I could ever
authorize a trip like this

785
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,759
would be if someone
familiar with your case...

786
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,879
What if my mom came?

787
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,599
Wait, what?

788
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,239
What if you came?

789
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,366
I'm... I'm sure the Genies would
hook it up. They're loaded.

790
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,959
That just might work.

791
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,324
<i>And then this happened.</i>

792
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,639
Hey.

793
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,401
Hi.

794
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,168
- Hey.
- You're okay.

795
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,519
So, what happened?

796
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,639
The usual.

797
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,799
Fluid in the lungs
preventing oxygenation.

798
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,402
They put a tube in.

799
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,399
They drained a liter
and a half last night.

800
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,199
The good news is...

801
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,199
no tumor growth.

802
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,564
No new tumors in your body.

803
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,959
We're so relieved.

804
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,279
This is just a thing, Hazel.

805
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,451
It's a thing we can live with.

806
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,319
Mr. Lancaster.

807
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,679
How's she doing?

808
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,039
Better.

809
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,199
Yeah, thank you.
Much, much better.

810
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,999
Uh, they won't let me in.
It's family only.

811
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,759
Yeah, sorry.

812
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,719
Yeah, I get it.

813
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,526
Um...

814
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,719
Could you just tell her I was here?

815
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,999
Yeah, of course.
Of course I will.

816
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,399
- Okay.
- Gus, listen, why don't you go home?

817
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,399
Get some rest.

818
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,604
Okay.

819
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,519
Normally, the tumors start
resisting the treatment...

820
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,839
and that hasn't happened here...

821
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,319
Yet.

822
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,159
On the other hand...

823
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,359
the drug may be
worsening the edema.

824
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,439
The truth is...

825
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,279
very few people have been on
Phalanxifor as long as Hazel has.

826
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,199
We really don't know
the long-term effects.

827
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,559
What we're trying to do is
prevent endothelial growth...

828
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,199
which, when overexpressed, can
contribute to disease, decay...

829
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,719
vascular inhibition...

830
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,279
and the spread of the tumors

831
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,879
we're working so hard to eradicate.

832
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,599
The survival rate of patients
with severe endothelial growth...

833
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,886
decreases exponentially the
more the condition advances.

834
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,487
You can let go, sweetie.

835
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,566
Don't be afraid.

836
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,205
Oh, my God.

837
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,919
I'm not gonna be a mom anymore.

838
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,121
I have a question.

839
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,879
Yes, Hazel?

840
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,639
Can I still go to Amsterdam?

841
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,865
- That would not be wise at this juncture.
- Why not?

842
00:41:22,866 --> 00:41:24,759
Is there any way we can
make that trip happen?

843
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,559
It would increase some risks.

844
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,239
But so does going to the mall.

845
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,959
Yes, but an airplane?

846
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,919
But they have oxygen on airplanes.

847
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,199
You're stage four.

848
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,087
This is an opportunity
that I may never get again.

849
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,399
Ever.

850
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,319
If the medication is working, I
don't understand why I can't...

851
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,599
Perhaps there's a scenario...

852
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,247
No.

853
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,599
I don't know any other
way to say this, Hazel.

854
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,281
You're just too sick.

855
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,289
I'm sorry.

856
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,799
Hello?

857
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,289
Yeah, just a sec.

858
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,090
Hi. Gus... again.

859
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,404
Sorry, she's asleep.

860
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,007
Yeah. Uh, okay.

861
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,849
All right. Bye-bye.

862
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,160
I know what you're thinking.

863
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,439
It's not fair to him.

864
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,041
It's not.

865
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,079
He doesn't need this in his life.

866
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,599
Nobody does.

867
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,929
A lot more trouble than it's worth.

868
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,971
No, you're right.

869
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,879
Your mom and I were just
saying the same thing.

870
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,324
I mean, it could be time we
tossed you out on the street.

871
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,483
Drop you off in an orphanage
somewhere, make you their problem.

872
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,487
I'm serious.

873
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,287
We're not sentimental people.

874
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,083
<i>Hazel Grace.</i>

875
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,439
Hi, Augustus.

876
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,407
<i>Are you okay?</i>

877
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,926
No.

878
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,243
<i>What's the matter?</i>

879
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,279
<i>Talk to me.</i>

880
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,884
I don't know.

881
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,729
Everything.

882
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,879
I want to go to Amsterdam, Gus.

883
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,199
And I want Van Houten to tell us

884
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,882
what happens after his book.

885
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,643
I also don't really want
this particular life.

886
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,639
I mean, it's really just the sky.

887
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,839
The sky is making me sad.

888
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,799
And there's this pathetic
old swing set...

889
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,961
that my dad built for me
when I was a kid and...

890
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,399
It's just everything, I guess.

891
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,642
<i>Well, I demand to see
this swing set of tears.</i>

892
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,839
I do see your point.

893
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,841
This is one sad swing set.

894
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,762
Hazel Grace, I hope you realize...

895
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,799
that you trying to
keep your distance from me

896
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,119
in no way lessens
my affection for you.

897
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,359
All your efforts to keep me
from you are gonna fail.

898
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,450
Look. Uh...

899
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,691
I like you.

900
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,759
And I like hanging out
with you and everything...

901
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,330
but I can't let this
go on any further.

902
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,479
Why not?

903
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,079
Because I don't want to hurt you.

904
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,559
I wouldn't mind.

905
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,159
- No, you don't understand.
- I do understand.

906
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,199
You don't understand.

907
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,639
I know what you're trying to say.

908
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,959
Hazel, I'm saying I wouldn't mind.

909
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,759
It'd be a privilege to have
my heart broken by you.

910
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,328
Gus, I'm a grenade.

911
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,839
One day I'm gonna explode...

912
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,807
and I'm gonna obliterate
everything in my wake and...

913
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,039
I don't know, I feel like
it's my responsibility...

914
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,483
to minimize the casualties.

915
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,409
A grenade?

916
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,960
I mean, that's why I
don't have a hamster.

917
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,010
Well, we gotta do something
about this frickin' swing set.

918
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,201
Okay.

919
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,130
"Swing set needs home."

920
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,650
"Desperately lonely swing set

921
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,729
"needs loving home."

922
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,319
"Lonely, vaguely
pedophilia swing set

923
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,686
"seeks the butts of children."

924
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,679
No. No.

925
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,119
No? No?

926
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,563
I like it.

927
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,720
That's why.

928
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,363
In case you're wondering, that's
why I like you, Hazel Grace.

929
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,999
You're just so busy
being you, you have

930
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,080
no idea how utterly
unprecedented you are.

931
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,799
You can't say stuff like that.

932
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,129
What? That's how I
speak to all my friends.

933
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,360
I know, I know. Friends.

934
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,282
Friends.

935
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,119
Friends!

936
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,484
You can't do that!

937
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:30,770
"Dear Hazel, received word via
the Genies that you will...

938
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,399
"you'll be visiting us
with Augustus Waters

939
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,923
"and your mother on the fourth."

940
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,839
Mom?

941
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,279
Yeah?

942
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,211
Mom!

943
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,959
- What's wrong?
- Sorry.

944
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,759
No, I was just taking a bath.

945
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,359
Did you email the Genies to tell
them that the trip was off?

946
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,319
Because Van Houten's
assistant just emailed me...

947
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,730
and she said that she
thinks we're still coming.

948
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,806
What?

949
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,719
I was supposed to tell
you with your dad.

950
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,959
Mom.

951
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,244
We're going to Amsterdam.

952
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,439
You're se...
We're going to Amsterdam?

953
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,159
We're going to Amsterdam.

954
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,559
We figured the whole
thing out. We're going.

955
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,039
Doctor Maria, everybody knows.

956
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,959
- But only for three days, not six.
- Oh, my God.

957
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,279
But everything. An
oncologist is set there.

958
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,199
Everything.
We're just so good.

959
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,006
I love you.

960
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,287
I love you so much.

961
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,208
I love you.

962
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,039
- Here, sit down.
- We're going to Amsterdam.

963
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,768
We're going to Amsterdam.

964
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,479
- We're going to Amsterdam.
- You can come talk to me.

965
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,081
You've got a phone call to make.

966
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,089
Call him!

967
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,079
Okay, lungs, you keep your
shit together for one week.

968
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,365
You got it?
One more week.

969
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,039
Oh. Oh, wait, the food.

970
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,641
What did you forget?

971
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,599
Do you have my passport?

972
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,725
Yeah, I've got it.

973
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,999
It's like I said to the Genies...

974
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,365
"I travel in style,
or I don't travel at all."

975
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,719
Mom, we're going to Amsterdam!

976
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,846
We are going to
Amsterdam, right now.

977
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,124
Hello, Lancasters.

978
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,126
Gus. Hey. Nice to see you.

979
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,559
I'll take that, sir.

980
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,889
Gus, you're so inventive!

981
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,681
Okay, Hazel Grace?

982
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,169
Okay!

983
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,319
What's in your nose?

984
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,399
Jackie!

985
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,799
I'm really sorry about that.

986
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,239
No, it's totally fine.

987
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,119
It's called a "cannula."
And it helps me breathe.

988
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,079
See this little friend right here?

989
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,599
He feeds oxygen through your tube.

990
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,239
Will it help me breath, too?

991
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,491
Maybe. Do you want to try it?

992
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,521
Okay.

993
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,241
Come here.

994
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,919
There ya go.

995
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,885
It tickles!

996
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,446
Wow, yeah, that's something.

997
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,479
I think I'm breathing better.

998
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,199
I would love to give it to you,

999
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,959
but I kind of could use the help.

1000
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,079
- Thanks for letting me try it.
- You're welcome.

1001
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,639
All right, Jackie, let's go.

1002
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,279
- Thank you. Take care.
- Bye.

1003
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,959
<i>Flight 1721 is now prepared to
begin boarding at gate 46...</i>

1004
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,959
- I think that's us.
- That's us.

1005
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,239
We are going to Amsterdam!

1006
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,966
Oh, my God.

1007
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,531
Come on, help me.

1008
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,159
- What, are they wet?
- Wet hands.

1009
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,808
- I'm sorry about that.
- Gross! Get outta here! Stop it!

1010
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,239
Have you never been
on a plane before?

1011
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,841
No.

1012
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,370
It's exciting.

1013
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,639
- Sir?
- Uh-huh?

1014
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,079
There's no smoking on this plane.

1015
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,399
Or any plane.

1016
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,999
I don't smoke.

1017
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,839
Yeah, it's just a metaphor.

1018
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,119
He puts the killing thing
in his mouth...

1019
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,759
but he doesn't actually give
it the power to kill him.

1020
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,250
Well, that metaphor, it's
prohibited on today's flight.

1021
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,900
<i>Flight attendants, prepare
for take off, please.</i>

1022
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,647
Thanks.

1023
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,681
Okay?

1024
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,079
Gus, this is what it's like
to drive in a car with you.

1025
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,170
Ha-ha-ha-ha...

1026
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,127
Oh...

1027
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,199
Oh!

1028
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,559
Oh, my God, we're flying.

1029
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,759
We're flying!

1030
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,959
Look at the ground!

1031
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,439
Look.

1032
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,283
Nothing has ever looked like
this in all of human history!

1033
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,163
Look at the cars.
They're like...

1034
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,479
You two are so adorable.

1035
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,439
We're just friends.

1036
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,849
Well, she is, I'm not.

1037
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,279
Oh, my!

1038
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,530
Whoa!

1039
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,559
<i>Get away from her, you bitch!</i>

1040
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,329
Look at this, Hazel.

1041
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,965
This is so crazy.

1042
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,719
Whoa.

1043
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,879
What?

1044
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,999
Look at the stained glass.

1045
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,199
It's amazing.

1046
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,450
Oh, I'm gonna check us in.

1047
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,439
We better get you dressed...

1048
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,341
because you have reservations
for two tonight,

1049
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,159
- for dinner at Oranjee.
- Oh.

1050
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,759
And it says, "Enjoy.
Mr. Peter Van Houten."

1051
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,799
So, I looked it up
and it sounds amazing.

1052
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:01,450
The guide book says it's
fancy and very romantic.

1053
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,359
Right. Fancy...

1054
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,639
Oh, God.

1055
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,447
But, okay, what...

1056
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,724
will you wear?

1057
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,319
Is that for me?

1058
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,519
Oh, my God.
It's so beautiful.

1059
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,724
I'm just saying.

1060
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,999
You're just saying?

1061
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,079
What, you're saying
that you're totally fine...

1062
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,559
with your teenage daughter running
free with an older boy...

1063
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,159
in a city that's famous
for its vice

1064
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,364
and debauchery is
totally fine with you?

1065
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,239
Yeah, that's pretty much
exactly what I'm saying.

1066
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,039
Gus!

1067
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,079
Oh, you look so handsome!

1068
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,319
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Wow.

1069
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,319
Hazel, Gus is here...

1070
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,968
looking incredible!

1071
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,126
I hear this restaurant
is unbelievable.

1072
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,679
Wow.

1073
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,441
What?

1074
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,605
You look gorgeous.

1075
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,566
Thanks.

1076
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,446
Whoa!

1077
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,720
Wow.

1078
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,486
This is it.

1079
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,799
Oranjee. Yeah, this is it.

1080
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,481
Oh, yeah.

1081
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,647
Your table, Mr. and Mrs. Waters.

1082
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,760
Thank you.

1083
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,119
Thanks, Gus.

1084
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,131
You are very welcome.

1085
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,839
The champagne is our gift. Enjoy.

1086
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,359
Thank you.

1087
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,246
Good evening.

1088
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,361
<i>Voilà.</i>

1089
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,086
- Okay?
- Okay.

1090
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,441
Whoa.

1091
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,279
That is amazing.

1092
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,679
Do you know what Dom Pérignon said

1093
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,203
after he invented champagne?

1094
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,879
"Come quickly," he said.
"I'm tasting the stars."

1095
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,439
Welcome to Oranjee.

1096
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,567
Would you like a menu, or will
you have the chef's choice?

1097
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,439
Chef's choice sounds wonderful.

1098
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,759
- Mmm.
- And, sir, um...

1099
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,719
something tells me we're gonna
need a little bit more of this.

1100
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,879
We have bottled all the
stars for you this evening,

1101
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,970
my young friends.

1102
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,489
- Ooh!
- I think that's ours.

1103
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,959
Dragon carrot risotto for the lady.

1104
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,971
Thank you.

1105
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,607
And for the gentleman.

1106
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,083
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1107
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,006
Mmm.

1108
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,679
I want this dragon carrot
risotto to become a person...

1109
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,919
so that I can take it
to Vegas and marry it.

1110
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,959
I like your suit.

1111
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,359
Thank you. It's the first
time I've ever worn it.

1112
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,959
That's not the suit
you wear to funerals?

1113
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,119
No.

1114
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,370
That one is not nearly this nice.

1115
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,679
When I first got sick...

1116
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,011
they told me I had an 85 percent
chance of being cancer-free.

1117
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,839
Great odds.

1118
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,799
But that meant a year of
torture, the loss of my leg...

1119
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,721
and, still, a 15 percent
chance it might fail.

1120
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,439
Just before the surgery...

1121
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,090
I asked my parents if I could
buy a really nice suit.

1122
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,679
So, it's your death suit.

1123
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,959
That's what it is.

1124
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,879
I have one of those. I got it
for my fifteenth birthday.

1125
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,720
A dress.

1126
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,921
I don't necessarily think I'd
wear it on a date, though.

1127
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,206
So, we're on a date?

1128
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,639
Hey, you watch it.

1129
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,243
We are Mr. and Mrs. Waters.

1130
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,919
Oh. That's just because
she can't speak English.

1131
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,439
We should be, though, if they ask.
You know?

1132
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,639
Remember what you said about Vegas?

1133
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,879
Yeah.

1134
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,369
Do you think I could
join in on that deal?

1135
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,079
God?

1136
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,806
Maybe.

1137
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,159
How about angels?

1138
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,239
Mmm, no.

1139
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,679
- Afterlife?
- Mmm...

1140
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,799
No.

1141
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,359
Well, maybe. I don't know.

1142
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,239
I guess I wouldn't go
as far as to say "no"...

1143
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,411
but I would like some evidence.

1144
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,919
What about you?

1145
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,959
- Absolutely.
- Really?

1146
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,759
I mean, not like a heaven where
you ride on a unicorn all day...

1147
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,999
and live in a mansion
made of clouds...

1148
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,759
but yes, I definitely
believe in something.

1149
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,599
I mean, otherwise...

1150
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,884
what's the point?

1151
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,399
Maybe there is no point.

1152
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,525
I won't accept that.

1153
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,522
I am in love with you.

1154
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,966
You heard me.

1155
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,479
Augustus...

1156
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,525
I am in love with you.

1157
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,559
And I know that love is just
a shout into the void...

1158
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,359
and that oblivion is inevitable.

1159
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,999
And that we're all doomed...

1160
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,331
and that one day...

1161
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,890
all of our labors
will be returned to dust.

1162
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,279
And I know that
the sun will swallow

1163
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,839
the only Earth we will ever have.

1164
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,169
And I am in love with you.

1165
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,086
Sorry.

1166
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,761
More stars?

1167
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,559
No, thank you.

1168
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,799
I think we'll just have the check.

1169
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,999
No, sir.

1170
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,171
Your meal has been paid
by Mr. Van Houten.

1171
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,439
What?

1172
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,639
I don't really get that shirt.

1173
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,119
Mmm.

1174
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,399
But Van Houten will get it.

1175
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,119
There are, like, fifty Magritte
references in <i>An Imperial Affliction.</i>

1176
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,679
"This is not a pipe."

1177
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,999
But it is a pipe.

1178
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,886
But it's not.

1179
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,839
It is a drawing of a pipe.

1180
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,399
See?

1181
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,399
A drawing of a thing
is not the thing itself.

1182
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,719
Nor is a T-shirt of a drawing
of a thing, the thing itself.

1183
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,879
Hey, you.

1184
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,799
When did you get so grown up?

1185
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,765
Who's ready for some answers?

1186
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,045
Me!

1187
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,879
This is it.

1188
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,687
I'm so excited,
I can barely breathe.

1189
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,925
As opposed to normal?

1190
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,483
Get out of here.

1191
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,164
Lidewij?

1192
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,245
- Hi!
- Hi, I'm Augustus.

1193
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,519
- Lidewij.
- Hazel.

1194
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,799
Please, come in.

1195
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,401
Thank you.

1196
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,199
Peter! They're here!

1197
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,848
Who the hell is "they," Lidewij?

1198
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,399
They are Augustus and Hazel...

1199
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,843
the young fans with whom
you've been corresponding.

1200
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,559
The Americans?

1201
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,650
You invited them.

1202
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,839
Please, come in.

1203
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,283
You know why I left
America, Lidewij.

1204
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:00,366
To never have to
encounter Americans.

1205
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,919
You're American.

1206
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,399
Incurably so.

1207
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,411
Get rid of them.

1208
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,199
I will not do this, Peter.

1209
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,279
Please, be nice.

1210
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,484
Come in, please.

1211
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,404
Sorry, let me clear this for you.

1212
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,526
Thank you.

1213
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,199
Which of you is Augustus Waters?

1214
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,847
I am.

1215
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,971
And that's Hazel.

1216
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,039
Mr. Van Houten, thank you so
much for writing back to us.

1217
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,839
Clearly an error in judgment.

1218
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,359
Yours are the first missives
to which I've replied,

1219
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,719
and look where it got me.

1220
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,039
Scotch?

1221
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,559
Uh...

1222
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,241
No, thank you.

1223
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,479
Just me, then, Lidewij.

1224
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,048
Another scotch and soda, please.

1225
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,639
Perhaps some
breakfast first, Peter?

1226
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,810
She thinks I have
a drinking problem.

1227
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,319
I also think the Earth is round.

1228
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,319
So, you like my book.

1229
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,479
- We love your book.
- Yeah.

1230
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,199
We love it.

1231
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,519
Augustus...

1232
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,639
He made his wish meeting
you so that we could talk.

1233
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,119
- No pressure.
- Yeah.

1234
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,644
Did you dress like her on purpose?

1235
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,441
Kind of.

1236
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,359
And, incidentally, sir,
we both really

1237
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,279
wanted to thank you
for dinner last night.

1238
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,999
And for the champagne.

1239
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,279
It was amazing.

1240
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,759
It was magical.

1241
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,159
We bought them dinner last night?

1242
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,489
It was our pleasure.

1243
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,801
You've come a long way.

1244
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,639
What can I do for you?

1245
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,519
We have some questions...

1246
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,799
obviously, about what happens
at the end of your book.

1247
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,359
Uh, specifically to those
who Anna leaves behind.

1248
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,599
Like her mom,
the Dutch Tulip Man...

1249
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,680
How familiar are you
with Swedish hip-hop?

1250
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,479
I would say, limited.

1251
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:21,608
Uh, Lidewij, play
Bomfalleralla immediately.

1252
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,925
Okay.

1253
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,799
We don't speak Swedish, sir.

1254
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,239
Who the hell speaks Swedish?

1255
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,679
The important thing is not what
nonsense the voices are saying...

1256
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,442
but what the voices are feeling.

1257
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,039
Are you messing with us?

1258
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,086
Like, is this some
sort of performance?

1259
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,126
Gus, sit down.

1260
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,399
All right, so at the end
of the book, Anna's...

1261
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,606
Let's imagine
you're racing a tortoise.

1262
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,719
The tortoise has
a ten-yard head start.

1263
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,679
In the time it takes you
to run ten yards...

1264
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:08,119
the tortoise has moved maybe
one yard, and so on, forever.

1265
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,439
You're faster than the tortoise,

1266
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,799
but you can never
catch him, you see?

1267
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,439
You can only decrease his lead.

1268
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,119
Now, certainly, you can
run past the tortoise...

1269
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,879
as long as you don't contemplate
the mechanics involved.

1270
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,159
But the question of "how?"

1271
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,119
turns out to be so complicated...

1272
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,159
that no one really solved it...

1273
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,719
until Cantor's proof
that some infinities

1274
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,845
are bigger than other infinities.

1275
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,369
I assume that answers
your question.

1276
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,759
Hazel, I'm sorry. I have
no idea what's going on.

1277
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,603
Yet you seemed so intelligent
in print, Mr. Waters.

1278
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,328
Has the cancer found its
way into your brain?

1279
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,201
Peter.

1280
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,399
Can we, for one second,
just focus on Anna?

1281
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,039
Please?

1282
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,719
I understand that the story ends

1283
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:01,959
in the middle of a sentence...

1284
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:05,679
because she dies, or that she
becomes too sick to continue...

1285
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,239
I am not interested in
talking about that book.

1286
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,999
But that doesn't mean that her family
and friends don't have a future, right?

1287
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,840
Right?

1288
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,959
I said I'm not interested.

1289
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,359
But you promised!

1290
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,679
Nothing happens! They're fiction!

1291
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,919
They cease to exist the
moment the novel ends.

1292
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,679
But they can't!

1293
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,559
I get it in a literary sense
or whatever, but...

1294
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,119
I can't do this, Lidewij.

1295
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,679
It's impossible
not to imagine what...

1296
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,919
I will not indulge
your childish whims.

1297
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,679
I refuse to pity you in the manner

1298
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,839
in which you are accustomed.

1299
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,839
- I do not want your pity!
- Of course you do!

1300
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,359
Like all sick kids, your
existence depends on it.

1301
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:39,279
- You are fated to live out your days...
- Peter!

1302
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,479
as the child you were
when diagnosed.

1303
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:45,319
A child who believes there is
a life after a novel ends.

1304
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,959
And we as adults, we pity this.

1305
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,439
So, we pay for your treatments,
your oxygen machines.

1306
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,839
Peter, that's enough.

1307
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,959
You are a side-effect
to an evolutionary process...

1308
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,239
that cares little
for individual lives.

1309
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,207
You are a failed
experiment in mutation.

1310
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,839
Listen, douchepants...

1311
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,119
there is nothing that you're gonna
tell me about my disease...

1312
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,959
that I don't already know.

1313
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,719
I came here for one thing
and one thing only.

1314
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,879
That is for you
to tell me what happens

1315
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,239
at the end of this goddamn book!

1316
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,439
I can't tell you.

1317
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,639
- Bullshit!
- I can't.

1318
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,651
Then make something up!

1319
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,329
I want you to leave.

1320
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,679
Have you ever stopped
to ask yourself...

1321
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,479
why you care so much
about your silly questions?

1322
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,844
Oh, go fuck yourself.

1323
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,199
Hey, it's okay.

1324
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,961
It's okay.

1325
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,091
I'll write you a sequel.

1326
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,039
All right? I'll write you a sequel.

1327
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:13,405
It'll be better than any piece of
shit that drunk guy could write.

1328
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,719
It'll have blood, and
guts, and sacrifice.

1329
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,446
You'll love it.

1330
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,439
So sorry that I spent your
wish on that asshole.

1331
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,646
No, you did not spend it on him.
You spent it on us.

1332
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,768
Hazel and Augustus!

1333
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,286
I'm very sorry.

1334
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,359
Circumstance has made him cruel.

1335
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,399
I thought meeting you
would help him...

1336
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,559
that he could see that his
work has shaped real lives.

1337
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:49,290
But... I'm very sorry.

1338
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,479
Perhaps we can do some sightseeing?

1339
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,119
Have you been to
the Anne Frank house?

1340
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,799
I'm not going anywhere
with that man.

1341
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:55,999
No.

1342
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,959
He is not invited.

1343
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:11,001
I'm afraid there's no elevator.

1344
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,319
Oh. That's all right.

1345
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,799
There are many stairs.

1346
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:15,959
- Steep stairs.
- I can do it.

1347
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,919
- Hazel, we don't have to...
- I can do it.

1348
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,159
Let's go.

1349
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,599
<i>Frank's family came from
Frankfurt, in Germany.</i>

1350
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,124
<i>Anne Frank's diary would
become world famous.</i>

1351
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,799
<i>It's difficult in times like these.</i>

1352
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,599
<i>It's a wonder I haven't
abandoned all my ideals.</i>

1353
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,044
<i>They seem so absurd
and impractical...</i>

1354
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,564
<i>yet I cling to them
because I still believe...</i>

1355
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,803
<i>in spite of everything, that
people are truly good at heart.</i>

1356
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,529
<i>It's utterly impossible
for me to build my life...</i>

1357
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,959
Shall we?

1358
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,403
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1359
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,159
Hazel, I'll carry it if you want.

1360
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,524
I got it.

1361
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,279
Wow.

1362
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:33,282
So this is the actual bookcase
that hid the Frank family.

1363
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,081
Whoa.

1364
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,039
I got it.

1365
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,404
Thank you.

1366
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,039
<i>We're much too young to
deal with these problems...</i>

1367
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,799
<i>but they keep thrusting
themselves on us...</i>

1368
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,879
<i>until, finally, we're forced
to think up a solution.</i>

1369
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,119
You okay, Hazel?

1370
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,719
Yeah.

1371
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,159
Don't worry, take your time.

1372
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,039
Sorry.

1373
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,119
Yeah?

1374
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,801
Yeah.

1375
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:31,719
<i>And yet, when I look
up at the sky...</i>

1376
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:35,559
<i>I somehow feel that everything
will change for the better.</i>

1377
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:38,559
<i>That this cruelty, too, will end.</i>

1378
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,639
You Okay?

1379
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,447
Yeah.

1380
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,839
Hazel, I think that's enough.

1381
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,159
You don't need...
You know?

1382
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,559
Uh-huh.

1383
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,208
I got this.

1384
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,044
<i>All is as it should be.</i>

1385
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:26,409
<i>God wishes to see people happy.</i>

1386
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,042
<i>- Where there is hope...</i>
- Hazel.

1387
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,525
<i>there is life.</i>

1388
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,159
- Well done.
- Yeah.

1389
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,279
You okay?

1390
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:53,927
Yeah.

1391
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,081
This is it, look.

1392
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,079
All right?

1393
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,251
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.

1394
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,921
Thanks.

1395
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,685
The only member of the Frank
family to survive was Otto.

1396
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,728
Anne's father.

1397
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,965
<i>At such moments...</i>

1398
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,519
<i>I can't think about the misery...</i>

1399
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:35,248
<i>but about the beauty
that still remains.</i>

1400
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:41,567
<i>Try to recapture the
happiness within yourself.</i>

1401
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:45,602
<i>Think of all the beauty
in everything around you...</i>

1402
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,802
<i>and be happy.</i>

1403
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,759
Bravo.

1404
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,884
<i>I fell in love with him
the way you fall asleep.</i>

1405
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,999
<i>Slowly, and then all at once.</i>

1406
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:22,884
it just sort of ends right above
where the knee would be...

1407
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,641
and tapers off.

1408
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,239
What?

1409
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,559
My leg.

1410
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,239
You know, just so you're prepared.

1411
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,887
Gus...

1412
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,042
get over yourself.

1413
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,799
Wait.

1414
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,085
I can't, it's stuck.

1415
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,839
I love you so much,
Augustus Waters.

1416
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,839
I love you too, Hazel Grace.

1417
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:13,522
So, so much.

1418
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,248
Augustus, I can't breathe.

1419
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,044
It's okay.

1420
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,925
Hazel.

1421
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,479
You're so beautiful.

1422
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,679
Stop.

1423
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:48,169
No, you're so beautiful.

1424
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,999
I'm so lucky.

1425
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,489
I'm so lucky.

1426
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,119
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1427
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,799
I can't believe you
called him "douchepants."

1428
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,479
- I know!
- You did?

1429
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,799
How did you come up with that?

1430
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,719
I don't know, it just came out.

1431
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,239
I was so angry.

1432
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,319
What a monster.

1433
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,599
Mom, it was awful.

1434
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,119
Then what happened?

1435
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:26,079
We went to Anne Frank House.

1436
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,159
Oh, you did?

1437
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,319
- It was really awesome.
- Was that incredible?

1438
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,479
It was so awesome.

1439
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,081
And after that?

1440
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,241
We just walked around.

1441
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,839
That sounds lovely.

1442
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,399
Oh, my gosh,

1443
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,919
we probably still have
a few hours, right?

1444
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,399
Should we go to
the Van Gogh Museum?

1445
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,919
Whatever you want.

1446
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,319
Probably don't have time
to do everything, but...

1447
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:51,129
You're just gonna have
to come back, is all.

1448
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:55,567
Could you just not be
ridiculous right now, please?

1449
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:59,159
Hazel, I'm not being ridiculous.

1450
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,762
I'm being positive.

1451
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,199
Mrs. Lancaster?

1452
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,519
Yeah?

1453
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,964
Do you think Hazel and I can
just have a little time alone?

1454
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,239
Sure, Gus.

1455
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,519
Um, I am gonna run to the room...

1456
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:22,444
and be ready whenever you
guys want to do something.

1457
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,642
Want to go for a walk?

1458
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,169
What is it?

1459
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:25,008
Just before you went into the
hospital, there was this...

1460
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,689
I felt an ache in my hip.

1461
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:37,362
So, I had a PET scan...

1462
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:43,131
and it lit up like
a Christmas tree.

1463
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:52,169
The lining of my chest
and my liver...

1464
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,202
Everywhere.

1465
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:06,208
I'm sorry.

1466
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,847
I should've told you.

1467
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,284
It's so unfair.

1468
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:40,762
Apparently, the world is not
a wish-granting factory.

1469
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,289
Hey, listen.

1470
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,439
Don't you worry about me,
Hazel Grace, okay?

1471
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,279
I'm gonna find a way
to hang around here

1472
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,919
and annoy you for a long time.

1473
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,039
Are you in pain?

1474
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,641
No.

1475
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,324
I'm okay.

1476
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,325
You're okay?

1477
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,809
Okay.

1478
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:36,491
I don't suppose you can
just forget about this?

1479
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,685
You know, just treat
me like I'm not dying.

1480
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,761
I don't think you're
dying, Augustus.

1481
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,251
You've just got a touch of cancer.

1482
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:57,684
Would it be absolutely ludicrous...

1483
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,359
if we just made out?

1484
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,530
Right now?

1485
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,523
Probably.

1486
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,409
Oh...

1487
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,159
So how are your eyes, Isaac?

1488
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,559
They're good.

1489
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,639
They're not in my head,
is the only problem.

1490
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:20,439
Besides that...

1491
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:23,959
Well, um, it appears my entire
body's made out of cancer now.

1492
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,289
So, sorry to one-up you, dude.

1493
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,159
Did you, uh...
write his eulogy yet?

1494
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:30,319
- Dude.
- What?

1495
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,439
- What?
- I haven't told her yet, Isaac.

1496
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,839
What are you talking about?

1497
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:35,959
Oh.

1498
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:37,199
Sorry.

1499
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,131
Augustus?

1500
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,039
I need speakers at my funeral.

1501
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,319
So, I was hoping
that you and Isaac,

1502
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,888
but mostly you...

1503
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:50,319
would be, um,

1504
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,319
kind enough to whip something up.

1505
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,048
I would love to do that.

1506
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,650
Thank you.

1507
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,199
You guys are cute.

1508
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,131
Makes me sick.

1509
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,799
You guys are gross.

1510
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,639
Have you heard from Monica?

1511
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,239
Nope, not a thing.

1512
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,399
She hasn't even texted you
to make sure you're okay?

1513
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,239
- Not once.
- I hate that girl.

1514
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,399
But there are tons of other girls.

1515
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,879
You guys don't have
to worry about me.

1516
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:24,639
In support group,
there's this new girl...

1517
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:26,319
and she has these humongous...

1518
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,923
How do you even know that?

1519
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,239
I'm blind, but I'm not that blind.

1520
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,524
- Hazel Grace?
- Hmm.

1521
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,847
Do you happen to have five dollars?

1522
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,719
Okay, so, now what?

1523
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,079
Hey, guys?

1524
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,047
I smell eggs. That eggs?

1525
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,679
Is it there?

1526
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,520
- It's there.
- Mmm-hmm.

1527
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:07,879
I'm nervous.

1528
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,119
Nervous?

1529
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,439
Is Monica in there?

1530
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,119
It doesn't matter where Monica is.

1531
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:14,279
This is not about Monica.
This is about you.

1532
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,799
- Okay. Can I have an egg?
- Hazel Grace...

1533
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:17,959
egg me.

1534
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:19,079
Egged.

1535
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,806
Isaac.

1536
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,399
All right, here we go.

1537
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,240
- You got this.
- All right. Come on.

1538
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,479
I didn't hear anything.

1539
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,809
It's all right. A little
more to your left.

1540
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,879
Wait, throw to my left, or
should I aim a little left?

1541
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:39,439
Aim left.

1542
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,279
- Okay.
- Left-er.

1543
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,799
Gus, I think we should
wait until dark.

1544
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,919
It's all dark to Isaac.

1545
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:47,399
Dude, I'm not deaf.
I'm just blind.

1546
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,119
So I can hear when you
make fun of my disability.

1547
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,799
- I'm sorry.
- And I don't love it.

1548
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,639
- Where do I throw?
- Just throw hard.

1549
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,079
Yes.

1550
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,599
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1551
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,839
What? What?

1552
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,479
I hit it! I hit it!

1553
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,119
Now I know exactly
where to line it up.

1554
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,404
That was so exhilarating!

1555
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:06,210
Keep it going. Keep going.

1556
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,839
Keep throwing, keep throwing.

1557
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,441
Give me more, give me
more, give me more!

1558
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,439
Oh!

1559
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,759
Oh, stop, stop, stop!

1560
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:16,279
- Isaac.
- Oh.

1561
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,839
Hello. Are you Monica's mother?

1562
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,999
- I am.
- Hello, ma'am.

1563
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,919
Your daughter, she's done
a great injustice.

1564
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:27,090
So we've come here seeking revenge.

1565
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,759
You see, we may not
look like much...

1566
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:31,519
but between the three of us, we
have five legs, four eyes...

1567
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,439
and two-and-a-half
working pairs of lungs.

1568
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,759
But we also have two dozen eggs...

1569
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:39,887
so if I were you,
I would go back inside.

1570
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,359
- Dude, it actually worked?
- Yep.

1571
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:48,959
That was the stupidest speech
I've ever... That actually worked?

1572
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,881
There you go. Hold on.

1573
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,879
This feels so good!

1574
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,759
Augustus?

1575
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,759
<i>Hazel Grace.</i>

1576
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,839
Hi.

1577
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:41,359
Oh, my God. Hi, hi. I love you.

1578
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,559
<i>I'm at the gas station.</i>

1579
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:44,599
You're what?

1580
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,999
<i>Something is wrong.</i>

1581
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,079
<i>You gotta...</i>

1582
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,842
<i>Can you come?
Can you come and help me?</i>

1583
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,164
Gus!

1584
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,041
Gus.

1585
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:11,409
Babe, what's going on?

1586
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,719
Look.

1587
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,401
Gus, it's infected.

1588
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:20,888
Take a deep breath.

1589
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,399
Gus, I have to call somebody.

1590
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,759
No, no. Please don't
call 9-1-1. Please.

1591
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,279
Don't call my parents or 9...

1592
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,959
I will never forgive you
if you call them.

1593
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,279
Gus, what are you doing here?

1594
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,245
What are you doing here?

1595
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,923
I wanted to buy cigarettes.

1596
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,559
I don't know what
happened to my pack.

1597
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,479
I might have lost it or something,

1598
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:41,411
or they took it, but I just...

1599
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,319
I wanted to do something
for myself, you know?

1600
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,039
I wanted to do it myself.

1601
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,279
- I have to call 9-1-1.
- No!

1602
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:49,519
I have to.

1603
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,406
No!

1604
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,839
Hi, 9-1-1?
Um, we need an ambulance.

1605
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,839
I hate myself!

1606
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:00,999
My name is Hazel Grace Lancaster.

1607
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,159
Please hurry.

1608
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:04,679
We're in a silver Jeep
at the gas station.

1609
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:06,879
<i>I wish I could say
that Augustus Waters</i>

1610
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:09,399
<i>kept his sense of
humor until the end.</i>

1611
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:13,971
<i>That not for a single moment
did his courage waver.</i>

1612
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,445
<i>But that is not what happened.</i>

1613
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,759
It hurts so much.

1614
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:30,488
I'm so stupid.

1615
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:44,004
Baby, it's okay. It's okay.

1616
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,725
Hazel?

1617
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,679
Will you tell me a story?

1618
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,645
A story?

1619
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,159
Or, like, a poem?

1620
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:03,242
I do know... I... I know a poem.

1621
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,004
Will you tell me it?

1622
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:13,208
<i>The Red Wheelbarrow</i>
by William Carlos Williams.

1623
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:18,524
"So much depends upon
a red wheelbarrow

1624
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:22,763
"Glazed with rain water

1625
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:27,925
"beside the white chickens."

1626
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:36,290
That's it? Is that all?

1627
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,726
No, no, no, of course not.
Of course not.

1628
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:46,689
"So much depends upon...

01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,999
How's he doing?

1635
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,999
He's had a tough night, Hazel.

1636
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,251
His blood pressure's low.

1637
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:04,724
His heart...

1638
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,325
What about the chemo?

1639
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:10,521
They are gonna stop the chemo.

1640
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,011
Can I see him?

1641
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,759
We'll tell him you were here.

1642
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:24,359
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1643
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,999
Yeah.

1644
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,999
I'm just gonna hang out for
a while, if you don't mind.

1645
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,045
Yeah, of course.

1646
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,800
Take your time.

1647
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,011
Here we go, bud.

1648
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,279
- Good?
- All right, sweetie.

1649
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:12,211
Okay.

1650
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:21,241
Hi.

1651
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,443
What are you thinking about?

1652
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,001
Oblivion.

1653
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,285
I know it's kid's stuff
or whatever, but...

1654
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:13,799
I always thought I would be a hero.

1655
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,759
I always thought I'd have
a grand story to tell.

1656
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,931
You know, something they would
publish in all the papers, and...

1657
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:23,291
I mean, I was supposed
to be special.

1658
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,919
You are special, Augustus.

1659
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:27,521
Yeah, I know. But...

1660
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,399
you know what I mean.

1661
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:32,685
I do know what you mean,
I just don't agree with you.

1662
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:40,641
You know this obsession you
have with being remembered?

1663
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:43,601
- Don't get mad.
- I am mad.

1664
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:47,446
I'm mad because I think you're
special. And is that not enough?

1665
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,599
You think that the only way
to lead a meaningful life...

1666
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:56,039
is for everyone to remember
you, for everyone to love you.

1667
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:59,239
Guess what, Gus.
This is your life, okay?

1668
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:01,359
This is all you get.

1669
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,479
You get me,
and you get your family,

1670
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:05,719
and you get this world,
and that's it.

1671
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:08,079
And if that's not enough for you,

1672
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:10,921
then I'm sorry,
but it's not nothing.

1673
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:15,328
Because I love you.

1674
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:19,361
And I'm gonna remember you.

1675
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:25,439
I'm sorry. You're right.

1676
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,719
I just wish you
would be happy with that.

1677
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,560
Hey.

1678
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,767
It's a good life, Hazel Grace.

1679
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,202
It's not over yet, you know.

1680
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:04,839
Oh, Augustus.

1681
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:08,079
<i>One of the less bullshitty
conventions of the cancer genre...</i>

1682
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:12,279
<i>is the convention known as
the "Last Good Day"...</i>

1683
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:16,199
<i>when it seems like the inexorable
decline has suddenly plateaued...</i>

1684
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:20,039
<i>when the pain is,
just for a minute, bearable.</i>

1685
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:22,959
<i>The problem, of course, is that
there's no way of knowing...</i>

1686
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:25,289
<i>that your last good day
is your last good day.</i>

1687
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:30,159
<i>At the time, it's just
another decent day.</i>

1688
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:38,239
Hello, Augustus.

1689
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:41,446
<i>Good evening, Hazel Grace.</i>

1690
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:43,359
<i>A quick question for you.</i>

1691
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,122
<i>Did you ever write that eulogy
I asked you to prepare?</i>

1692
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:48,079
I may have.

1693
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,519
<i>Do you think you could
find your way down...</i>

1694
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:51,839
<i>to the literal Heart of Jesus
in the next few minutes?</i>

1695
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:54,199
Maybe. Is everything okay?

1696
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,609
<i>I love you, Hazel Grace.</i>

1697
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:01,479
- Can I have the keys?
- Oh.

1698
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:03,919
- Where you going? We're gonna eat something.
- I have to go.

1699
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,159
Hazel, you have to be hungry.
You didn't even eat lunch.

1700
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,319
I'm just not hungry.

1701
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:09,199
Hazel, you cannot not eat.

1702
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,359
I'm aggressively un-hungry.

1703
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:13,159
Hazel, I know Gus is sick, but you
got to take care of yourself.

1704
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:14,559
This has nothing to do with Gus.

1705
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:15,959
Well, then you've
got to stay healthy.

1706
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:18,159
Come on, just eat something, honey.

1707
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,879
"Stay healthy"?

1708
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:22,559
Okay, I'm not healthy,
and I'm gonna die.

1709
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,519
Do you realize that? I'm dying,
and you're gonna be here...

1710
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:27,319
and you're not gonna have anyone
to look after, or hover around...

1711
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:28,999
and you're not gonna be a mother
anymore, and I'm sorry...

1712
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,679
but there's nothing
I can do about that.

1713
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:31,919
So, can I please go?

1714
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:33,759
Why would you say that to me?

1715
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,239
Because you said that.

1716
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:36,919
What are you talking about?

1717
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:38,885
In the ICU.

1718
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,406
Hazel...

1719
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,843
That's not the truth.
I was wrong.

1720
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,119
All right?

1721
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:50,119
Even if you died...

1722
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:51,881
"When."

1723
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:58,169
Even when you die...

1724
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:02,563
I'll always be your mother.

1725
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:07,521
It's the greatest
thing I'll ever be.

1726
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,919
That is my biggest fear, Mom.

1727
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,399
When I am gone...

1728
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:14,959
you're not gonna
have a life anymore.

1729
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,879
You're just gonna sit and
you're gonna stare at walls...

1730
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:19,119
or you're gonna
off yourselves or...

1731
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:22,769
Hazel, honey,
we're not gonna do that.

1732
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,719
Losing you...

1733
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:31,044
That is gonna hurt like hell.

1734
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:37,727
But you of all people know it's
possible to live with pain.

1735
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:42,410
You just do it.

1736
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:50,959
I'm taking classes in social work.

1737
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,879
Wait, you're what?

1738
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,481
Yeah, um...

1739
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:57,639
You know, if I can take
what we've been through...

1740
01:45:57,640 --> 01:46:01,722
and help other people,
maybe counsel families...

1741
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,119
Mom, how could you
not tell me this?

1742
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:06,479
We didn't want you
to feel abandoned.

1743
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,570
Feel abandoned?

1744
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:12,090
You guys, this is...

1745
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,199
This is the best news.

1746
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:19,040
You go.

1747
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:21,801
Okay?

1748
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,561
Baby.

1749
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,159
Straight ahead, yeah.

1750
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:30,125
To your left, a little bit.

1751
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:31,839
That's a step, right?

1752
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,279
Yeah, put your hand out.

1753
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:34,919
There's a podium to your right.

1754
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:37,249
Yeah, perfect.

1755
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,119
Beautiful.

1756
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:49,919
Hi.

1757
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:50,999
You're late.

1758
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,279
How you doing? You look
ravishing, Hazel Grace.

1759
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:56,008
I know, right?

1760
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:02,119
What's going on, guys?

1761
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:03,881
Tell her, Gus.

1762
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:06,768
I wanted to attend my own funeral.

1763
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:10,879
I mean, I'm hopeful that I'll be
able to attend as a ghost, but...

1764
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:14,679
However, just in case
it doesn't work out...

1765
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:18,329
I decided to plan this pre-funeral.

1766
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,761
Ready?

1767
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:27,039
Augustus Waters was a
cocky son of a bitch.

1768
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,119
But we forgave him.

1769
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:31,239
Not because of his
superhuman good looks...

1770
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:33,239
or because he only got 19 years

1771
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,279
when he should've gotten way more.

1772
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,879
18 years, buddy.

1773
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,359
Dude, come on. Really?

1774
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:40,639
I'm assuming you have a little more
time, you interrupting bastard.

1775
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:43,321
Interrupt me in the middle of my eulogy.
You're supposed to be dead.

1776
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:48,839
But when the scientists
from the future...

1777
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:52,159
come to my house with robot eyes...

1778
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:55,127
and they tell me to try them on...

1779
01:47:57,320 --> 01:48:01,129
I'm gonna tell those scientists
to piss off, because...

1780
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:05,403
because Gus, I don't even want
to see a world without you.

1781
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,439
I don't.

1782
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,884
I don't want to see a world
without Augustus Waters.

1783
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:16,119
Then, having made my point, I'll
probably put the robot eyes on...

1784
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:18,239
because, you know,
they're robot eyes.

1785
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:20,285
Sounds awesome.

1786
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,559
And I don't know... Um...

1787
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:27,119
This is just so hard.

1788
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:28,559
Um...

1789
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,924
Godspeed.

1790
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:32,199
Yeah.

1791
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:35,087
Hazel, can I get a hand here?

1792
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:46,129
To the right, a little bit.

1793
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:51,928
Yeah, and turn around.
Sit down. There you go.

1794
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:58,522
It's down to you, Hazel Grace.

1795
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:24,719
Hello.

1796
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:29,006
My name is Hazel Grace Lancaster...

1797
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,479
and Augustus Waters was the
star-crossed love of my life.

1798
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,439
Ours was an epic love story...

1799
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:40,359
and I probably won't be able to
get more than a sentence out...

1800
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:44,043
without disappearing
into a puddle of tears.

1801
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:47,439
Like all real love stories...

1802
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:49,359
ours will die with us.

1803
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:51,291
As it should.

1804
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:58,247
You know, I'd kind of hoped that
he would be the one eulogizing me.

1805
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:01,448
Because there's really
no one else...

1806
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:07,009
Yeah, no. Um...

1807
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:11,399
I'm not gonna talk about our
love story, because I can't.

1808
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:16,369
So, instead,
I'm gonna talk about math.

1809
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:22,559
I am not a mathematician,
but I do know this.

1810
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,879
There are infinite numbers
between zero and one.

1811
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:31,319
There's point-one, point-one-two,
and point-one-one-two, and...

1812
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:34,287
and an infinite
collection of others.

1813
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:37,239
Of course,
there is a bigger infinite

1814
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:39,959
set of numbers
between zero and two...

1815
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:44,451
or between zero and a million.

1816
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:49,965
Some infinities are simply
bigger than other infinities.

1817
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:54,645
A writer that we used
to like taught us that.

1818
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:58,439
You know, I want more numbers...

1819
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:00,769
than I'm likely to get.

1820
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:05,051
And, God...

1821
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:08,159
do I want more days
for Augustus Waters

1822
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:10,046
than what he got.

1823
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,771
But, Gus...

1824
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:18,845
my love...

1825
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:22,480
I cannot tell you
how thankful I am...

1826
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:25,928
for our little infinity.

1827
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,971
Hold on.

1828
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:48,961
You gave me a forever...

1829
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:53,039
within the numbered days.

1830
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,563
And for that, I am...

1831
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,848
I am eternally grateful.

1832
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,927
I love you so much.

1833
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:12,368
I love you, too.

1834
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:36,048
<i>Augustus Waters died eight
days later in the ICU.</i>

1835
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:40,488
<i>When the cancer,
which was made of him...</i>

1836
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:45,529
<i>stopped his heart, which
was also made of him.</i>

1837
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,759
<i>It was unbearable.</i>

1838
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:48,964
<i>The whole thing.</i>

1839
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:52,686
<i>Every second, worse than the last.</i>

1840
01:53:58,120 --> 01:54:00,079
<i>One of the first things
they ask you in the ER...</i>

1841
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:03,524
<i>is to rate your pain
on a scale from one to ten.</i>

1842
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:06,959
<i>I've been asked this question
hundreds of times...</i>

1843
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:09,199
<i>and I remember once...</i>

1844
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:11,199
<i>when I couldn't catch my breath</i>

1845
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:13,643
<i>and it felt like
my chest was on fire...</i>

1846
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:16,319
<i>the nurse asked me
to rate the pain.</i>

1847
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:19,890
<i>Though I couldn't speak,
I held up nine fingers.</i>

1848
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:22,559
<i>Later, when I started
feeling better...</i>

1849
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:25,925
<i>the nurse came in
and she called me a fighter.</i>

1850
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:29,008
<i>"You know how I know?"
she said.</i>

1851
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:31,962
<i>"You called a ten a nine."</i>

1852
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:34,319
<i>But that wasn't the truth.</i>

1853
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:37,764
<i>I didn't call it a nine
because I was brave.</i>

1854
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:44,360
<i>The reason I called it a nine was
because I was saving my ten.</i>

1855
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,125
<i>And this was it.</i>

1856
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,879
<i>This was the great
and terrible ten.</i>

1857
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:55,165
<i>"I will fear no evil,
for You are with me...</i>

1858
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:58,959
"Your rod and your staff,
they comfort me.

1859
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:02,159
"You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.

1860
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:06,599
"You anoint my head with oil.
My cup overflows.

1861
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:11,199
"Surely, goodness and love will
follow me all the days of my life...

1862
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:13,839
"and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord...

1863
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,771
"forever."

1864
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:22,088
Augustus Waters
fought hard for many years.

1865
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:26,759
His battle was a courageous
one, and his strength...

1866
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:28,479
What a load of shit, huh, kid?

1867
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:31,128
was a source of inspiration
for each and every one of us.

1868
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:35,371
Let us pray.

1869
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:38,959
We thank You, Lord, for the
life of Augustus Waters...

1870
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:40,479
We need to fake-pray now.

1871
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:43,679
...for his strength
and his courage.

1872
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:47,439
Lord, we ask that You be with
us today, that You be close...

1873
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:50,159
that You comfort
his friends and family.

1874
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:52,603
Thank You for Your presence, Lord.

1875
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:55,119
All this we pray in Jesus' name.

1876
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:56,279
Amen.

1877
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:57,879
Amen.

1878
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:02,839
Now, we are going to hear
from Gus' special friend...

1879
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:05,602
Hazel Lancaster.

1880
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:20,445
Not that it really matters,
but I was his girlfriend.

1881
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:03,919
There's a beautiful quote
in Gus' home that reads...

1882
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:06,761
"If you want the rainbow, you
have to deal with the rain."

1883
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:12,679
Even in his last few days...

1884
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:13,799
Um...

1885
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:15,159
<i>I didn't believe a word.</i>

1886
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:18,081
He was always able
to crack a smile.

1887
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:20,290
<i>But that's okay.</i>

1888
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:25,890
<i>I knew this was
the right thing to do.</i>

1889
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:30,925
<i>Funerals, I'd decided,
are not for the dead.</i>

1890
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:33,319
<i>They're for the living.</i>

1891
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:35,279
Hey, want some company?

1892
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:36,479
No, I'm okay.

1893
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:40,239
I'm just gonna drive
for a bit by myself.

1894
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:41,921
Love you.

1895
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:45,119
Love you.

1896
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:47,006
You spoke beautifully.

1897
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:49,199
I'll see you soon.
Drive safe.

1898
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:50,881
Okay.

1899
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:16,881
May I?

1900
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:22,409
<i>Omnis cellula e cellula.</i>

1901
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:27,519
Your boy Waters and I corresponded
quite a bit in his last days.

1902
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,679
Oh. So, you read your fan mail now?

1903
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:31,719
I wouldn't exactly call him a fan.

1904
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:33,679
He detested me.

1905
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:37,439
But he was quite insistent
I attend his funeral...

1906
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:39,879
and tell you what became
of Anna and her mother...

1907
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:41,919
so here I am.

1908
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:44,719
And that's your answer,
<i>"Omnis cellula e cellula."</i>

1909
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:46,446
"Life comes from life."

1910
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:48,519
I'm really not in the mood.

1911
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:49,799
You don't want an explanation?

1912
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:51,359
No, I don't.

1913
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:54,039
Thank you, though.
Have a great life.

1914
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:55,919
You remind me of her.

1915
01:58:57,200 --> 01:59:00,644
I remind a lot of people
of a lot of people.

1916
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:03,404
My daughter was eight.

1917
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:10,047
And she suffered
beautifully for so long.

1918
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:14,408
She had leukemia like Anna?

1919
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:17,090
Just like Anna.

1920
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:23,039
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1921
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:26,849
And I'm sorry for yours. And
sorry for ruining your trip.

1922
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,879
You didn't ruin our trip.

1923
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:31,005
We had an amazing trip.

1924
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:37,239
Are you familiar with
the Trolley Problem?

1925
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:41,199
There's a thought experiment
in the field of ethics...

1926
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:43,119
known as the Trolley Problem.

1927
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:45,239
Philippa Foot was an
English philosopher...

1928
01:59:45,240 --> 01:59:46,879
Oh, my God.

1929
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:49,199
Hazel, I'm trying to
explain something to you.

1930
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:50,319
I'm trying to give you
what you wanted.

1931
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:51,519
No, you're not!

1932
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:53,319
You are a drunk,
and you're a failure...

1933
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:54,919
and I need you to get out
of my car right now...

1934
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:59,047
so that I can go home, and
be by myself and grieve!

1935
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:01,964
You'll want to read this.

1936
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:05,599
I don't want to read anything.

1937
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:07,804
Can you just get out of my car?

1938
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:13,319
Please get out of my car!

1939
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:14,879
Fine.

1940
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:24,049
Can I come in?

1941
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:38,009
I'm so, so sorry.

1942
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:41,691
Yeah.

1943
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:51,399
It was a privilege,
though, wasn't it?

1944
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:53,365
To love him?

1945
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,490
Gives you an idea
how we feel about you.

1946
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:17,845
Hazel?

1947
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,807
There's a friend here to see you.

1948
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:24,766
Do you know if it hurt or whatever?

1949
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:29,039
Apparently he was struggling
for breath for a long time...

1950
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:32,325
and then eventually
he just went unconscious.

1951
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:35,085
It wasn't great or anything.

1952
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:37,970
Dying sucks.

1953
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:42,084
Gus really loved you, you know?

1954
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:44,000
I know.

1955
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:47,999
He wouldn't shut up about it.

1956
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,199
Yeah.

1957
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:52,239
It was annoying. He
talked about you so much.

1958
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:53,759
I didn't find it that annoying.

1959
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:56,681
I know. I know you didn't.

1960
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:08,039
Did you get that letter
from your author friend?

1961
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:10,130
Ew. He's not my friend.

1962
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:11,359
How do you know about that?

1963
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:12,919
Well, I was talking
to him at the cemetery...

1964
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:17,279
and he said he came all this way
to give that letter to you.

1965
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:19,519
Yeah, well, I'm over it.

1966
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:22,599
I have no interest in reading another
word of that asshole's again.

1967
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:24,759
No, he didn't write it.
Gus wrote it.

1968
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:26,199
What?

1969
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,839
Apparently Gus wrote something down

1970
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:29,965
and then sent it to Van Houten.

1971
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:34,490
Oh, my God.

1972
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:47,804
<i>Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good
person, but a shitty writer.</i>

1973
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:51,039
<i>You're a shitty person,
but a good writer.</i>

1974
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:53,239
<i>I think we'd make a good team.</i>

1975
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:55,039
<i>I don't want to ask you
for any favors...</i>

1976
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:58,479
<i>but if you have the time, and from
what I saw, you have plenty...</i>

1977
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:00,239
<i>please fix this for me.</i>

1978
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:03,002
<i>It's a eulogy for Hazel.</i>

1979
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:07,879
<i>She asked me to write one,
and I'm trying.</i>

1980
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:11,759
<i>I just... I could
use a little flair.</i>

1981
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:15,330
<i>See, the thing is, we all
want to be remembered.</i>

1982
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:19,445
<i>But Hazel's different.</i>

1983
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,639
<i>Hazel knows the truth.</i>

1984
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:25,399
<i>She didn't want a million admirers.
She just wanted one.</i>

1985
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:27,206
<i>And she got it.</i>

1986
02:04:27,240 --> 02:04:31,239
<i>Maybe she wasn't loved widely,
but she was loved deeply.</i>

1987
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:34,081
<i>And isn't that more
than most of us get?</i>

1988
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:39,119
<i>When Hazel was sick,
I knew I was dying...</i>

1989
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:41,882
<i>but I didn't want to say so.</i>

1990
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:48,639
<i>She was in the ICU, and I
snuck in for 10 minutes...</i>

1991
02:04:48,640 --> 02:04:52,050
<i>and I sat with her,
before I got caught.</i>

1992
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:55,959
<i>Her eyes were closed.
Her skin, pale.</i>

1993
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:58,719
<i>But her hands
were still her hands.</i>

1994
02:04:58,720 --> 02:05:02,279
<i>Still warm, and her nails were painted
this dark blue-black color...</i>

1995
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:05,319
<i>and I just held them.</i>

1996
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:08,730
<i>And I willed myself to imagine
a world without us...</i>

1997
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,921
<i>and what a worthless world
that would be.</i>

1998
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:17,199
<i>She's so beautiful.</i>

1999
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:19,039
<i>You don't get tired
of looking at her.</i>

2000
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:20,719
<i>You never worry if she's
smarter than you...</i>

2001
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:23,084
<i>because you know she is.</i>

2002
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:27,240
<i>She's funny without
ever being mean.</i>

2003
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:30,651
<i>I love her.</i>

2004
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:31,999
<i>God, I love her.</i>

2005
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,126
<i>I'm so lucky to love her,
Van Houten.</i>

2006
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:44,999
<i>You don't get to choose if
you get hurt in this world...</i>

2007
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,763
<i>but you do have a say
in who hurts you.</i>

2008
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:51,442
<i>And I like my choices.</i>

2009
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:54,648
<i>I hope she likes hers.</i>

2010
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:57,524
<i>Okay, Hazel Grace?</i>

2011
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:01,331
Okay.
