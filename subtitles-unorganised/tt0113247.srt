1
00:00:19,555 --> 00:00:24,555
You murderers!
It's easy to gun us down! We only got rocks!

2
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:28,555
H A T E

3
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:41,675
This film is dedicated to friends and family

4
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,035
who died while it was in the making.

5
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:50,435
Heard about the guy
who fell off a skyscraper?

6
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:53,520
On his way down past each floor,

7
00:00:53,688 --> 00:00:56,065
he kept saying to reassure himself:

8
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:59,025
"So far so good..."

9
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,695
"so far so good..."

10
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:08,285
How you fall doesn't matter.

11
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:11,496
It's how you land!

12
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:48,087
More rioting in the projects outside the city.

13
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,255
Last night a mob of youths

14
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,885
attacked a police station
in the Muguet projects.

15
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:58,054
Pitched battles left 14 officers injured.

16
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:00,015
33 arrests were made.

17
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:03,853
A mall and nearby buildings
were damaged by looters

18
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:06,396
who dispersed around 4 a.m.

19
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:10,484
Alleged police brutality
sparked the riots 2 days ago.

20
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:14,446
A local teen was severely beaten
under questioning.

21
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:16,239
The officer was suspended.

22
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:20,410
The victim, Abdel Ichaha, is in hospital

23
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:22,370
in critical condition.

24
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,581
Got a looter under arrest, a minor.

25
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,985
SAYID: FUCK THE POLICE

26
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,201
Vinz! Where the fuck is he?

27
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:46,704
What?
- Whadda ya mean "what"?

28
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:48,707
Can't fuckin' say hello?

29
00:06:48,874 --> 00:06:50,792
Chill, Sayid. What's up?

30
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,877
Tell your bro to come out.

31
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,213
What for?
- Tell him!

32
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,757
What for?
- Just tell him!

33
00:06:57,924 --> 00:06:59,342
What for?

34
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,594
Is this a TV game show?

35
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:04,306
Quit hollering!

36
00:07:04,514 --> 00:07:08,100
You guys made enough noise last night!

37
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,396
You see me last night? I wasn't here.

38
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:12,647
Shut up!

39
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:14,482
Don't play dumb!

40
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:16,942
You'll burn next, asshole!
- Idiot!

41
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:20,822
You gonna get him?
- Don't asshole me, asshole!

42
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:23,282
You still there? Beat it!

43
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,827
If I wake him, he'll get mad. You try!

44
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:29,455
I hope the cops tan your hide!

45
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:46,680
Vinz...

46
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:49,809
Shut up, Sayid.

47
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:54,105
Shut up? Be nice or you're history, fuckface!

48
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:56,649
Go away. You stink!

49
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,819
You want to play this early? One...

50
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:00,778
Two...

51
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:02,112
Three.

52
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:04,114
You lose.

53
00:08:04,324 --> 00:08:05,825
Fuck your sister.

54
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:08,744
I told you not to talk about her!

55
00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:11,039
She sucks Donald Duck. Get lost!

56
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:11,914
Jew boy!

57
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:15,501
You bogus kike, you're nowhere!

58
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:17,920
I saw a cow.
- What?

59
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:19,004
A cow.

60
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:20,256
Got some smoke?

61
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:21,883
In the box.

62
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:29,348
Last night, during the riot,
I dashed behind a building:

63
00:08:29,515 --> 00:08:32,142
Wham! I ran right into a cow.

64
00:08:32,393 --> 00:08:33,393
Really?

65
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:35,979
Stop smoking, your brain's fried!

66
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:38,566
Off my bed! I'll say you're taking drugs!

67
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:41,235
I'll cut your throat, hang you up,

68
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:44,113
you'll drown in your blood!

69
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,239
Granma!

70
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:48,826
Get off the bed.

71
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:50,619
You get out.

72
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:51,953
Stay off my bed!

73
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:55,583
Get lost, you snitch!

74
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,668
Move it.

75
00:08:57,835 --> 00:09:00,045
Watch your mouth with my sister!
You'll skip temple!

76
00:09:00,212 --> 00:09:02,589
Got any salt?
- Respect your granma!

77
00:09:02,757 --> 00:09:03,924
You my father?

78
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:05,342
What about Dad?

79
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:08,178
You my mother now?

80
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:10,264
Go to school!

81
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:12,266
It burned down.

82
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:14,351
Burned down! Savages!

83
00:09:14,518 --> 00:09:18,021
Start that way and soon you'll skip temple!

84
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:20,107
Granma!
- What?

85
00:09:20,274 --> 00:09:21,441
I didn't burn the school!

86
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,486
And you don't go to temple!

87
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:26,780
You win! I surrender!

88
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:29,449
If everyone ran from an argument,

89
00:09:29,617 --> 00:09:31,702
there'd be a stampede, already!

90
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:34,621
But we'd all be going the same way!

91
00:09:34,872 --> 00:09:36,039
Mazeltov!

92
00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:38,083
You talkin' to me?

93
00:09:56,101 --> 00:10:00,021
You talkin' to me, mothafucka!

94
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,243
...the guy says: "For cash, I'd even murder!"

95
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:17,789
He tells his friend: "I'd even waste you."

96
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:20,083
The friend freaks, so the guy says:

97
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,794
"Don't worry, you're a buddy.

98
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:26,673
"I won't waste you for cash,
I'll do it for free!"

99
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,217
What a killer line! "For free!"

100
00:10:29,426 --> 00:10:33,012
"I'll waste you for free!" What a line, Vinz!

101
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,264
I got it the first time.

102
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:37,267
Tell your brother to come see me!

103
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:41,271
What a killer put-down!
"I'll waste you for free!"

104
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,607
Shut up and gimme the joint.

105
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:49,487
A killer line!
- Killer.

106
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:54,784
"I'd waste you for free."
Can't do better than that!

107
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,413
Why you so uptight?

108
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:06,338
Mothafucka!

109
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:11,927
Bastards wrecked everything!

110
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,931
Check that!

111
00:11:22,187 --> 00:11:24,397
I don't believe it!

112
00:11:26,107 --> 00:11:28,317
How'd they get the car in?

113
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:31,738
The doorway's too narrow.

114
00:11:32,947 --> 00:11:35,157
Chill, Sayid! There he is.

115
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:37,910
He must be pissed off.

116
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,247
Took him two years to get this gym!

117
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:00,016
Your dope's good, Vinz.

118
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,394
Not mine. It's Hubert's.

119
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,609
Don't bogart, Sayid.

120
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:12,445
Thought you quit smoking?

121
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:14,030
Me too.

122
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:18,200
What happened here?

123
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:19,702
Guess.

124
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:21,411
A fire?

125
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:25,082
You win the prize, Einstein!

126
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,750
Kiss mine, cousin!

127
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:29,378
I knew it'd go up in smoke one day.

128
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:31,922
So why'd you bust ass to get it?

129
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:34,216
'Cause he wanted to, dickface!

130
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:35,634
You're the dick.

131
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:37,512
You know who did it?

132
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,471
I don't want to know.

133
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:43,392
How'd the car get in here?

134
00:12:43,935 --> 00:12:46,228
The doorway's not big enough.

135
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:56,780
We dissed them, spit on them!

136
00:12:56,948 --> 00:12:59,659
But the cops didn't move an inch.

137
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:03,954
Then the mothers stepped aside
to make a path...

138
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:14,882
Then these plainclothes pigs
came out with wooden clubs.

139
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:18,051
They hit a homeboy, like real bad!

140
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:21,013
Kept clubbing him till we tore into 'em.

141
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,600
I kicked a pig right in the head!

142
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:36,778
That's a Yamaha.

143
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,572
More like your Mom on a Harley!

144
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,492
It's Mohammed's bike. He fixed the exhaust.

145
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,204
No, it's Vinz's Mom on a Yamaha!

146
00:13:45,412 --> 00:13:46,830
Which Mohammed?

147
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:49,666
Farida's brother?

148
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,918
Farida with the driver's licence?

149
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:54,296
No, Farida from the supermarket.

150
00:13:56,131 --> 00:13:58,049
Anyway, it was a scene.

151
00:13:58,217 --> 00:14:02,346
You should've been there Hubert.
It was intense.

152
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,140
Tear gas, 2 nights in a cop shop,

153
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,101
all the fists you can eat,

154
00:14:08,268 --> 00:14:10,019
getting hell at home:

155
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:13,773
"Sorry cousin, but I ain't buyin'!"

156
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:19,654
Gimme a break!
It was war against the pigs, in living color!

157
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:23,074
I was trying to make some cash.

158
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:25,911
Your bogus riot fucked it up!

159
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:29,748
When a brother goes down, I stand up!

160
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:33,292
What brother? Do I know the guy?

161
00:14:33,502 --> 00:14:38,340
I won't take hits for a homeboy gangsta I don't know.

162
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:42,718
Let's go.

163
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:45,096
I mean it!

164
00:14:45,263 --> 00:14:46,973
Abdel's no gangsta.

165
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,977
OK, but I'm not faster than a speeding bullet!

166
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,652
Hey, hands off the hot dogs!

167
00:14:59,861 --> 00:15:00,861
Gimme one.

168
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:02,322
And go broke?

169
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:03,948
Don't make us cry!

170
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:06,826
I'll make you cry, Sayid!

171
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:09,078
Everyone pays the same!

172
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:11,539
Except Hubert, it's his building.

173
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:12,706
A buck?

174
00:15:12,874 --> 00:15:14,917
A buck for one, OK two!

175
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:18,045
You're a drag!

176
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:19,589
You should try one.

177
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:21,966
Got a buck?
- Yeah, for me!

178
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:22,842
Here.

179
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:26,262
No way, I'll remember this!

180
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,180
So remember.
- Never forget.

181
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,477
Don't be a jerk. I'll pay later.

182
00:15:34,104 --> 00:15:36,731
How? With your sister?

183
00:15:36,898 --> 00:15:39,233
Don't talk that way about her!

184
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,568
Chill out, you bogus Arab!

185
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:44,822
Sayid! Come back with that!

186
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,289
Got any change?

187
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:55,750
We're broke!

188
00:15:56,376 --> 00:15:58,252
2 bits.
- We're broke.

189
00:15:58,753 --> 00:16:01,589
...The judge says I go to jail,

190
00:16:01,756 --> 00:16:03,549
or do jobs for the City.

191
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:06,009
Community service? The pits!

192
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:09,180
Ever do it? Jail's bad enough!

193
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:11,182
You'd rather do time?

194
00:16:11,474 --> 00:16:13,058
Your bro stole a dog!

195
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:15,519
Liar!
- His mouth is full!

196
00:16:15,728 --> 00:16:17,146
Put it on my tab.

197
00:16:17,313 --> 00:16:19,189
Liar! Your nose is growing!

198
00:16:19,982 --> 00:16:21,858
I'll bust your nose, Sayid!

199
00:16:23,653 --> 00:16:24,904
Beat it!

200
00:16:36,832 --> 00:16:38,500
A.45!

201
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,420
Like the gun in "Lethal Weapon."

202
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:45,632
We saw that movie together!
It was a 9mm. Glock!

203
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:48,134
What?
- No, it wasn't!

204
00:16:48,302 --> 00:16:50,429
That was a Desert Eagle.

205
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:54,475
He shot at the truck!

206
00:16:54,642 --> 00:16:56,894
That wasn't "Lethal Weapon"!

207
00:16:57,353 --> 00:17:00,314
What are you talking about?

208
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:05,652
A cop lost his handgun during the riot.

209
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,446
That's a good one!

210
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:12,159
I don't know the pig who lost his piece.

211
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:15,454
But I'd like to know who found it!

212
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:17,247
No joke!

213
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:24,546
...I'll sleep, eat, lift weights.

214
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:27,257
Everyone's been inside, except me.

215
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:30,677
A month for theft is pathetic!

216
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:32,346
Not in your league!

217
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:36,557
What league? I was never inside!
- You got nabbed.

218
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:38,726
I quit in time!

219
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:40,854
Come look!

220
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:42,856
We got visitors.

221
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:45,150
Over here!

222
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:47,652
It's the mayor!

223
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:52,073
Up Your Honor, Mr. Mayor! Mothafucka!

224
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,911
Cut the stereo!

225
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:00,916
Who's in charge here? You, Nordeen?

226
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,960
What's going on here?

227
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:06,379
Think you're in Disneyland?

228
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:09,800
You're not allowed up here.
You gotta go down.

229
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,218
We're causing no trouble.

230
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:15,429
Still, you've got to get off the roof.

231
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:17,223
We like it up here.

232
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:18,642
Off the roof.

233
00:18:19,393 --> 00:18:22,896
You learn that shit at Notre Dame?

234
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,026
Cut it out! Quiet everyone!

235
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,657
I'll handle this!
- Forget it!

236
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:36,784
You can't stay here!

237
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:40,830
So fold your little tents, grab your chairs...

238
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:43,791
and let's all go downstairs nice and easy.

239
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:44,792
OK!

240
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,087
Who's gonna make us leave?

241
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:50,423
Your goons or you, in your little uniform?

242
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,883
Nordeen, we're doing our job.

243
00:18:56,263 --> 00:18:57,847
Leave us alone!

244
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:03,394
Don't talk to me like that, I don't know you.

245
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:04,561
Now get lost!

246
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:06,063
Sitting duck!

247
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:08,358
Your mother drinks Bud!

248
00:19:15,532 --> 00:19:18,868
Anyone who wants to stay, stay! Heat's off.

249
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:21,871
I'm staying.
- You're going.

250
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:23,998
Let me stay, Nordeen.

251
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:26,292
What did I say?
- You said go.

252
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:28,461
So what do you do?
- I go!

253
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:31,839
OK, I'm going!

254
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:33,966
Vinz, c'mon!

255
00:19:35,552 --> 00:19:37,303
Don't play tough guy!

256
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,805
You always wimp out!

257
00:19:58,741 --> 00:20:00,409
...You see 'em in porn stores.

258
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,994
What are they called?

259
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,328
G-strings.

260
00:20:03,496 --> 00:20:05,206
What?
- G-strings, moron.

261
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:07,917
She had one on, I swear it.

262
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:09,835
I fucked her like an animal.

263
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:12,087
We were in the room...

264
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,758
she kept screaming for more.

265
00:20:16,926 --> 00:20:20,512
Guy next door pounded
the wall we were so noisy.

266
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:24,016
You dreamt you fucked her!

267
00:20:24,392 --> 00:20:26,310
What?

268
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:29,272
You know the bitch?
- I know her, she has AIDS.

269
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:32,107
Get outta here!

270
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:34,651
Hi, we're from TV.
- What's this?

271
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:36,904
Were you in the riot last night?

272
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:38,655
Did you break things, burn cars?

273
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:42,409
We look like looters, lady?
- I didn't say that.

274
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,786
So what do we look like?
- Nothing special.

275
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:47,706
Get out the car! This ain't Thoiry.

276
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,583
We got work to do.

277
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,295
What kind of work?
Stirring up shit?

278
00:20:53,546 --> 00:20:55,631
For a juicy scoop!
- No camera!

279
00:20:56,674 --> 00:21:00,010
Quit snooping in the 'hood,
fuckface! Stop taping!

280
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:02,555
Quit taping, dickhead!

281
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:04,973
This ain't Thoiry!

282
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,645
What's with all the assholes today?

283
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:12,606
That fuckin' broad...

284
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,360
What's Thoiry?

285
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,863
A drive-in safari park.

286
00:21:21,282 --> 00:21:22,950
This ain't no zoo!

287
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:26,369
Open up, WalMart!

288
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:29,539
You fuckin' jerks.

289
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:31,917
Talk nice, we're in France.

290
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,629
It's 1 p.m. And you're in bed?

291
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,760
What's with the hair net?

292
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:43,846
Lay off!

293
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:46,848
You a movie star, WalMart?

294
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:48,683
What's this shitty TV?

295
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:50,602
Watch where you sit!

296
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,103
Just sweat pants!

297
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:54,982
Where's the new TV?

298
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:56,316
It's too big to move.

299
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,694
I came by for my cash. Where were you?

300
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:02,906
I don't have it.

301
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,283
Don't you know what happened?

302
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:09,871
Go see what your pals did.

303
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,797
Foued's brother did that.

304
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:20,882
So what?

305
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,092
Give me his address.

306
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,638
Look what he did to my car!

307
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,640
Look what he did!

308
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:31,100
Just look!

309
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:33,269
Leave that alone.

310
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:37,691
I lost ten grand! I can't work now.

311
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:40,819
WalMart, it's just a car!

312
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,155
That's what you say!

313
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,157
You don't realize.

314
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,451
It's all I got.

315
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,578
Cut it out!

316
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:51,829
Leave that alone!

317
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,789
A homeboy's dying, fuck your car!

318
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:57,502
"A homeboy!" Big deal!

319
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,420
You disgust me!

320
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:02,798
That car's all I have. It's my life!

321
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:07,136
They're showing the riot!
- My car's more important!

322
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,554
Look, the riot.

323
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,473
Some TV!
- Sure, bust it!

324
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,934
Fix the antenna!
- I'm trying!

325
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:14,894
It's David!

326
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,854
How'd he get on TV?

327
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,773
I was over there, they missed me!

328
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:23,778
Fix it! I can't see a thing!
- This TV sucks!

329
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:27,323
How'd that fucker get on TV?

330
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,617
Hey, gimme my money!

331
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:32,786
I don't have it. Snoopy has it.

332
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:36,082
Gimme my coat and get outta my face!

333
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,292
You guys must be happy.

334
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,003
A cop lost his gun in the riot.

335
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,591
I hope the guy who finds it

336
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,135
uses it uptown, not here for once!

337
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,011
Forget it,

338
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,804
we'll get even!

339
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:58,354
You know that show, "Candid Camera"?

340
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,441
So this celebrity's sure he's been set up.

341
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,070
His buddy's fixed it with the camera guys.

342
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,615
The celebrity thinks they're out to get him.

343
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:12,451
He always eats in the same joint.

344
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,704
He's sure they'll film him there.

345
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,542
The others convince him there's a hidden camera.

346
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:23,337
He sees the TV truck,
a camera behind the mirror

347
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:26,924
and the guy with him pretends to act weird.

348
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,594
The celebrity thinks he'll fool 'em,

349
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:34,806
pretending he hasn't noticed.

350
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:38,435
He thinks all hell will break loose.

351
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:43,315
But they just film him, jumpy,
waiting for shit to happen.

352
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,816
So you see this guy...

353
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,111
Cut it out, Sayid!

354
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,696
Wasn't me!
- Then who?

355
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:54,242
The celebrity's sweating, trying to act cool.

356
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,162
Each time the waiter passes

357
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,205
he thinks it'll happen.

358
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:03,210
Then a guy asks him for his autograph.

359
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,462
The celeb thinks it's a trick

360
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,089
and Starts ranting at the guy,

361
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:12,844
who doesn't know what's up, so he gets mad.

362
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,931
They Start fighting,

363
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,642
and the Candid Camera guys have to break it up.

364
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,645
It was a killer punch out.

365
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,397
Then what?

366
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,276
That's all.

367
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,332
Who was the celebrity?

368
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,751
Dunno, but he was real famous.

369
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,503
I don't remember.

370
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:05,021
This looks like trouble. See ya.

371
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,455
WE'RE THE FUTURE

372
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,804
What did they want?

373
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,099
"Don't get mad, get even."

374
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:45,228
It's Abdel's brother. He's got a pump gun.

375
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,814
Party time!

376
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,279
We go visit Abdel in the hospital?

377
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,619
I gotta show you something...

378
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,755
That's real steel!

379
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,633
Get a load of it.
- What a mother!

380
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,477
What'll you do with it?

381
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,686
Stop it, Hubert.

382
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:28,896
What you gonna do with it?

383
00:27:29,063 --> 00:27:30,939
Depends if Abdel dies.

384
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,108
You gonna kill a cop?

385
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,902
Best way to get respect!

386
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:37,696
Smoking a cop will get you respect?

387
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,907
It'll even up the score.

388
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:43,243
I coulda got you a piece.
- This one's special.

389
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,079
Think you're on a mission?

390
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:48,999
Well, I did find the gun. Leave me alone!

391
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:52,419
Will it help Abdel?
- It'll help us.

392
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,215
Stop fronting!

393
00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:57,841
You pussy!

394
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,551
You're headed for big shit!

395
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,470
I'll do my thing, you do yours.

396
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:05,140
I don't want to know.
- So don't ask!

397
00:28:09,103 --> 00:28:10,938
One thing's sure...

398
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,399
With that piece you're the big man.

399
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,409
Hey, wait for me!

400
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,296
Fuck it...

401
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,971
What the fuck ya doin'?

402
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:47,099
OK, don't have a shit fit!

403
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:22,718
Sorry, fellas, you can't go in.

404
00:29:22,885 --> 00:29:24,595
Let us in. We came to see Abdel.

405
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:26,680
Sorry, I have my orders.

406
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:30,392
Just a couple of minutes. Then we'll leave.

407
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,018
He's our friend.

408
00:29:32,895 --> 00:29:36,064
The docs won't let you in. He's in a coma.

409
00:29:36,231 --> 00:29:37,857
We won't make trouble!

410
00:29:38,484 --> 00:29:40,485
If I let you in,

411
00:29:40,652 --> 00:29:42,820
I'll lose my job.
- Sure, flunkey!

412
00:29:42,988 --> 00:29:45,865
Tone it down. His family's here.

413
00:29:46,033 --> 00:29:48,160
They need peace and quiet!

414
00:29:48,327 --> 00:29:51,705
We're not as good as reporters?

415
00:29:51,872 --> 00:29:53,123
Get going!

416
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,416
Hands off, man!

417
00:29:56,251 --> 00:29:58,378
You gonna make me leave?

418
00:29:58,545 --> 00:30:00,672
Gonna shoot me? Pull out your pop gun!

419
00:30:02,257 --> 00:30:03,841
What's going on here?

420
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:05,552
Look at that fuckface!

421
00:30:06,511 --> 00:30:09,138
We came to see our pal Abdel!

422
00:30:10,515 --> 00:30:12,516
We won't leave till we see him.

423
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:14,685
Beat it, before I take you in.

424
00:30:14,853 --> 00:30:15,937
Oh, yeah?

425
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:17,397
You shut up!

426
00:30:19,608 --> 00:30:20,442
Move 'em out!

427
00:30:24,863 --> 00:30:28,366
We can be nice or nasty.
It's up to you!

428
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:31,911
Calm down!

429
00:30:32,412 --> 00:30:35,039
Lieut., these kids made trouble.

430
00:30:35,206 --> 00:30:37,291
I got the ringleader.

431
00:30:38,668 --> 00:30:40,378
He did nothing.
- I arrested the leader.

432
00:30:40,545 --> 00:30:42,421
What leader?
- He means Sayid.

433
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:43,464
Sure, Uncle Tom!

434
00:30:53,016 --> 00:30:55,143
Things aren't bad enough.

435
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,520
You had to go to the hospital?

436
00:30:58,021 --> 00:30:59,272
They were only doing their job.

437
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:01,107
Doing their job?

438
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:03,943
Shut your yap, once and for all!

439
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,403
You shut yours!
- Don't talk to me like that!

440
00:31:06,613 --> 00:31:09,324
Same to you!
- Shut up, will ya!

441
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:10,658
Shit!

442
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:12,451
You don't know a fucking thing!

443
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:13,703
What do you know?

444
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,705
Cut it out, asshole.

445
00:31:15,872 --> 00:31:17,999
Watch your tongue!
- If you watch yours!

446
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:21,961
The bastards who beat up Abdel
will go to jail!

447
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:24,088
You're dreaming.

448
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:26,132
The cops at the hospital

449
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:28,300
protect Abdel and his family.

450
00:31:28,926 --> 00:31:31,762
You just fuck things up!

451
00:31:32,305 --> 00:31:35,391
You idiot, you got it all wrong.

452
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:39,144
Those cops are just protecting Abdel!

453
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:43,524
Most cops don't beat on you.
They protect you!

454
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:47,195
Who protects us from you?

455
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:07,065
Never do it again!

456
00:33:07,232 --> 00:33:08,816
Who writes your jokes?

457
00:33:08,984 --> 00:33:11,027
Watch your tongue!

458
00:33:11,195 --> 00:33:13,030
Watch your mother!

459
00:33:15,908 --> 00:33:17,826
You ever trash me again,

460
00:33:17,993 --> 00:33:20,036
you go to central lock-up.

461
00:33:20,204 --> 00:33:22,998
Your brother can bail you out.

462
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:25,792
I didn't ask no favors.
- I did it for your brother.

463
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:28,294
He'd rip you apart!

464
00:33:29,755 --> 00:33:31,381
You're the ripper.

465
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:40,765
About the boxing gym:
I can get you a City grant.

466
00:33:41,058 --> 00:33:43,310
You'll get another gym.

467
00:33:44,311 --> 00:33:47,897
Kids want to punch more than bags now!

468
00:33:48,065 --> 00:33:52,110
It's hopeless.
Once I could talk to the kids. No more.

469
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:57,240
And they know me!
A rookie cop wouldn't last a month.

470
00:33:57,407 --> 00:34:00,034
An Arab in a police station
doesn't last an hour!

471
00:34:01,661 --> 00:34:04,747
I have to go.
Try to keep cool.

472
00:34:04,998 --> 00:34:07,542
Yeah, we'll try.

473
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:10,336
Outta my face, you fucker!

474
00:34:10,504 --> 00:34:12,005
OK!

475
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:15,466
You shook his hand?

476
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:17,844
He's always been cool with me.

477
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:20,138
You don't shake a pig's hand!

478
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:25,059
You shoot him, I shake his hand!
You're a fuckin'pain!

479
00:34:25,227 --> 00:34:27,312
And you're out of it!
Look!

480
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:29,689
I knew it!

481
00:34:29,856 --> 00:34:31,691
You acted so weird at the hospital.

482
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:33,776
Take it easy.
- Let me see.

483
00:34:35,695 --> 00:34:36,695
You didn't tell us?

484
00:34:37,572 --> 00:34:39,073
You didn't want to know!

485
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,158
Packing that!
You retard!

486
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:44,037
I'm a big boy.
Quit preaching!

487
00:34:44,454 --> 00:34:46,164
I'll bust your chops!

488
00:34:46,373 --> 00:34:48,666
Stop it!

489
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:52,503
You feel big with that gun!
I'll kick your ass!

490
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:53,796
Like how?

491
00:34:53,963 --> 00:34:56,799
Cut it out. Let's grab a sandwich.

492
00:34:57,383 --> 00:34:59,134
You shut up!

493
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:00,677
I'm splittin'.

494
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:02,596
So split!

495
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,308
Stay with us.

496
00:35:05,558 --> 00:35:07,142
Sayid, let him split!

497
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:10,605
Don't go!

498
00:35:10,772 --> 00:35:12,023
Back off.

499
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:18,154
What's with him?

500
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:23,158
Jerk thinks too much.

501
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:41,343
Where's Mom?
- Explain this to me.

502
00:35:41,511 --> 00:35:43,471
I can't now.

503
00:35:51,395 --> 00:35:52,729
Well?

504
00:35:53,898 --> 00:35:54,982
What's the answer?

505
00:35:55,191 --> 00:35:56,108
I don't know.

506
00:35:56,275 --> 00:35:58,819
You never know.
- OK, I never know.

507
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,613
Hi, Mom.

508
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:02,281
How's the kid brother?

509
00:36:02,448 --> 00:36:03,824
He's fine.

510
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:07,453
But your brother in jail isn't so good.

511
00:36:07,703 --> 00:36:09,204
What's with Max?

512
00:36:09,372 --> 00:36:11,582
He needs textbooks.

513
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:13,208
What for?

514
00:36:13,376 --> 00:36:17,213
To get a high school diploma
while he's inside.

515
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,176
He never made grade school!

516
00:36:23,469 --> 00:36:25,679
Hands off the pots!

517
00:36:26,555 --> 00:36:27,806
I didn't do nothing!

518
00:36:28,057 --> 00:36:30,517
I dunno how I'll buy his books.

519
00:36:30,684 --> 00:36:31,851
By the way...

520
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:35,313
There's the money
for the power bill.

521
00:36:41,111 --> 00:36:43,404
And my machine?
- What machine?

522
00:36:43,614 --> 00:36:47,075
My new sewing machine!

523
00:36:47,243 --> 00:36:49,954
Shit, I forgot to ask WalMart.

524
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,831
Mine's ready to croak.

525
00:36:52,998 --> 00:36:55,333
Patou, go study in your room.

526
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:58,170
Mom.
- Don't argue.

527
00:36:59,296 --> 00:37:01,756
Who's WalMart? That fence in Tower B?

528
00:37:01,924 --> 00:37:04,009
No, he's in Tower D.

529
00:37:04,176 --> 00:37:05,802
I don't know him.

530
00:37:06,053 --> 00:37:07,971
Could he get us textbooks?

531
00:37:08,138 --> 00:37:09,889
That's not his line, Mom.

532
00:37:10,057 --> 00:37:11,725
Officials now admit

533
00:37:11,892 --> 00:37:15,645
that a policeman lost his gun
in the riot last night.

534
00:37:15,854 --> 00:37:17,939
It is still missing.

535
00:37:18,106 --> 00:37:22,193
We asked locals if a loose gun is dangerous

536
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:24,571
in this explosive situation...

537
00:37:24,947 --> 00:37:25,947
What a fuck up!

538
00:37:26,156 --> 00:37:28,157
They burned down the gym.

539
00:37:29,743 --> 00:37:34,873
I'm sick of the projects.
I want out. It's getting worse.

540
00:37:35,082 --> 00:37:38,168
I'm sure Vinz helped torch the gym.

541
00:37:39,419 --> 00:37:41,796
He's going wild, like Max.

542
00:37:43,382 --> 00:37:45,008
I have to get out.

543
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:47,677
I have to leave this place.

544
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:51,472
If you see a grocery, buy me a lettuce.

545
00:37:51,723 --> 00:37:52,890
No credit for you.

546
00:37:53,058 --> 00:37:56,644
My granma's a regular here!
So I'm 2 bits short!

547
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:00,189
You're not your granma.

548
00:38:01,024 --> 00:38:02,650
Hands off!
- Just looking!

549
00:38:02,818 --> 00:38:05,153
Got two bits?
- How about one?

550
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,488
One OK?
- One not OK.

551
00:38:08,615 --> 00:38:11,659
Gimme a coin, you dinosaur!

552
00:38:11,826 --> 00:38:13,410
No coins for you.

553
00:38:13,578 --> 00:38:15,621
OK... Now what?

554
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:17,832
So what'll it be?

555
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:20,793
I saw you!
- You saw what?

556
00:38:20,961 --> 00:38:23,672
Gimme the red peppers. They're cheaper.

557
00:38:24,422 --> 00:38:26,966
My granma'll kill me! She hates 'em.

558
00:38:29,427 --> 00:38:31,762
So shoot the Chink, grab the green peppers!

559
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,890
It'll make granma's day!

560
00:41:04,248 --> 00:41:07,167
Fuck, fuck the po-lice...

561
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:57,592
He's intense.

562
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,427
Killer!

563
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:02,180
A mother killer!

564
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:13,065
Sayid, check out the cow.

565
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:15,360
Fuck off with your cow!

566
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,362
I swear!
- You said you'd cut my hair.

567
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,573
The same cow! I saw it!

568
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,074
You're the cow!

569
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:24,786
It was the same fuckin' cow!

570
00:42:24,995 --> 00:42:26,663
You gotta believe me!

571
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:27,997
Shut up!

572
00:42:32,127 --> 00:42:35,421
I'm Segnor Duck...

573
00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:42,637
I fucka you, I fucka her, I fucka him...

574
00:42:42,804 --> 00:42:46,224
OK Granma! So they're red peppers!

575
00:42:47,183 --> 00:42:49,727
You know this cow business.

576
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:51,687
It's a weird trip.

577
00:42:51,855 --> 00:42:55,441
Don't wreck my hair!

578
00:42:55,608 --> 00:42:58,235
I gotta get laid! So watch it!

579
00:42:58,403 --> 00:43:00,321
I can mow a lawn, I'll try.

580
00:43:00,488 --> 00:43:01,155
A lawn?

581
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:03,365
Sit your ass down.

582
00:43:04,325 --> 00:43:06,201
It's hot, Vinz.
- What?

583
00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:08,204
A cop's piece is hot.

584
00:43:08,371 --> 00:43:11,874
You said that already. Sit still, loser!

585
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:14,085
I'll whack you.

586
00:43:14,377 --> 00:43:16,087
Don't move.

587
00:43:16,504 --> 00:43:18,422
If Abdel dies, you'll kill?

588
00:43:18,589 --> 00:43:21,550
Wanna be the next Arab iced by the pigs?

589
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:22,009
Well, me neither.

590
00:43:22,135 --> 00:43:24,136
Well, me neither.

591
00:43:24,303 --> 00:43:26,304
So now you're an Arab!

592
00:43:26,472 --> 00:43:28,599
They think we're full of shit.

593
00:43:28,766 --> 00:43:31,894
But I'm not bullshitting about this, Sayid.

594
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:35,022
Watch it!

595
00:43:35,231 --> 00:43:36,690
It's cool.

596
00:43:36,858 --> 00:43:39,944
Is this gun legit for a cop? What'd you do?

597
00:43:40,111 --> 00:43:41,987
Nothing, I swear it!

598
00:43:42,154 --> 00:43:44,531
Why swear?

599
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:45,950
Because it's nothing.

600
00:43:46,117 --> 00:43:47,368
I'm cold there!

601
00:43:47,576 --> 00:43:50,036
It's cold in this room!

602
00:43:52,331 --> 00:43:55,542
I'll even it out, it'll be great!

603
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,170
I got a date! Lemme see!

604
00:43:58,379 --> 00:44:00,130
No fuckin' trust!

605
00:44:00,965 --> 00:44:01,965
I didn't see!

606
00:44:02,174 --> 00:44:03,425
You didn't look!

607
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:06,386
Trust me, dammit!

608
00:44:07,304 --> 00:44:08,805
It's a nice hole.

609
00:44:08,973 --> 00:44:10,391
A nice what?

610
00:44:10,558 --> 00:44:13,560
Trust me, or no haircut!

611
00:44:16,814 --> 00:44:18,273
Look at me, Sayid!

612
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,108
Get outta here!

613
00:44:20,276 --> 00:44:21,986
Don't get bummed out!

614
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:25,698
It's the style in New York.

615
00:44:25,906 --> 00:44:28,783
The killer cut, so stop whining!

616
00:44:28,951 --> 00:44:29,868
New York?

617
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:33,705
They got hair like this in New York?
I look punk!

618
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:34,706
Honest!

619
00:44:34,957 --> 00:44:35,957
Don't laugh!

620
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:38,585
Give us a kiss, Sayid.

621
00:44:38,752 --> 00:44:40,420
Outta my face!

622
00:44:40,587 --> 00:44:43,464
No hard feelings, sucker!

623
00:44:46,593 --> 00:44:49,137
Hey pooch, your master's an asshole!

624
00:44:56,478 --> 00:44:58,021
There's your sister.

625
00:45:04,153 --> 00:45:06,488
Why're you here?
- And you?

626
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:08,782
I'm asking the questions!

627
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,368
You should be in school.

628
00:45:11,577 --> 00:45:13,954
Get outta here!

629
00:45:15,372 --> 00:45:17,582
Get lost, you cows.

630
00:45:18,834 --> 00:45:20,252
You still here?

631
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:24,255
Get lost!

632
00:45:24,715 --> 00:45:26,341
You talk to my friends!

633
00:45:26,508 --> 00:45:28,051
To Vincent.

634
00:45:28,218 --> 00:45:32,055
The name's Vinz, not Vincent!
And don't talk to him!

635
00:45:32,264 --> 00:45:35,266
Get a move on!
- Don't push!

636
00:45:39,479 --> 00:45:41,689
Coming tonight?
- Where?

637
00:45:41,857 --> 00:45:44,818
Jason's brother's in a prize fight.

638
00:45:44,985 --> 00:45:47,278
Got tickets?
- Freebies.

639
00:45:47,446 --> 00:45:48,864
Killer!

640
00:45:50,657 --> 00:45:52,367
Who cut your hair, Sayid?

641
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:55,786
Kids these days!

642
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:57,121
Check that!

643
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:03,938
Shit's happenin'!

644
00:47:15,408 --> 00:47:17,701
Abdel's my brother, pig!

645
00:47:20,163 --> 00:47:21,747
You're gonna pay!

646
00:47:23,499 --> 00:47:24,458
Step on it!

647
00:47:25,084 --> 00:47:26,251
It's stalled!

648
00:47:26,502 --> 00:47:28,420
Outta the car, freeze!

649
00:47:39,307 --> 00:47:41,642
Drop the gun!

650
00:47:46,022 --> 00:47:47,565
Freeze!

651
00:48:08,794 --> 00:48:09,794
Get back!

652
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,298
Get the fuck out!

653
00:48:12,464 --> 00:48:14,674
Riot cops are coming!

654
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,926
Get back, scum!

655
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:30,106
Vinz, Hubert, this way!

656
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,320
This way!

657
00:48:37,698 --> 00:48:38,865
Freeze!

658
00:48:42,244 --> 00:48:44,245
You crazy?

659
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:48,958
Where were you?

660
00:48:49,585 --> 00:48:51,628
We fucked your mother!

661
00:48:57,384 --> 00:49:00,970
I swear the pig was right in my sights.

662
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:04,140
I had him like I have you now!

663
00:49:05,601 --> 00:49:08,228
The sucker froze, shit his pants.

664
00:49:08,395 --> 00:49:10,647
Without Hubert, I'd have smoked him!

665
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:12,732
Right in the mother!

666
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:16,277
Hubert slugged him so hard he went into orbit!

667
00:49:16,445 --> 00:49:17,154
No!

668
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,572
I swear it!

669
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:20,115
Slugged a pig?

670
00:49:21,116 --> 00:49:23,076
You were great!

671
00:49:33,879 --> 00:49:37,007
THE WORLD IS YOURS

672
00:50:15,253 --> 00:50:17,171
Now what do we do?

673
00:50:20,633 --> 00:50:23,927
I gotta call to get my bucks.

674
00:50:30,518 --> 00:50:32,478
Got Snoopy's address?

675
00:50:33,146 --> 00:50:35,690
I'll wait, but not forever!

676
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:42,446
This cost me a $3 chocolate milk!
I'd better collect!

677
00:50:42,947 --> 00:50:45,616
You want some, Vinz?

678
00:50:46,034 --> 00:50:47,034
Want some?
- No.

679
00:50:47,201 --> 00:50:48,285
You sure?

680
00:50:49,954 --> 00:50:51,997
Want some, Cousin Hubie?

681
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,667
You're already chocolate!

682
00:51:00,298 --> 00:51:02,925
Will you guys stop sulking?

683
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,596
Who's sulking? Not me!

684
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,474
Unbelievable!
- Ask him!

685
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,224
A couple of kids!

686
00:51:11,392 --> 00:51:15,395
Who's the kid?
- 2 kids worrying over jackshit!

687
00:51:15,563 --> 00:51:18,023
I'm 100% behind you!

688
00:51:18,774 --> 00:51:21,151
Wanting to kill a cop is jackshit!

689
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,449
Tell your buddy to back off!
I never said I wanted to.

690
00:51:26,782 --> 00:51:27,491
Yes, you did!

691
00:51:27,658 --> 00:51:28,450
Yes!
- No!

692
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:30,453
I didn't say that!

693
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,663
I said if Abdel died,

694
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:35,582
I'd smoke a cop. Not for the hell of it!

695
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,001
Without my gun back there,

696
00:51:38,169 --> 00:51:40,004
we'd have been history!

697
00:51:40,171 --> 00:51:42,381
My name's not Rodney King!

698
00:51:42,548 --> 00:51:44,299
Not the same thing!

699
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:47,803
Expect us to bring you gifts in jail?

700
00:51:48,512 --> 00:51:52,599
I expect nothing!
Not from a guy who kisses cop ass!

701
00:51:54,101 --> 00:51:55,769
Go ahead, laugh!

702
00:51:55,936 --> 00:51:57,771
Laugh!

703
00:51:57,938 --> 00:52:01,066
I'm fuckin' sick of the goddam system!

704
00:52:01,233 --> 00:52:05,070
We live in rat holes,
you do fuck-all to change things!

705
00:52:05,279 --> 00:52:07,364
Neither do you!

706
00:52:07,573 --> 00:52:09,950
You're my homeys, so I'll tell you:

707
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:12,077
If Abdel dies, I hit back.

708
00:52:12,244 --> 00:52:14,120
I'll whack a pig!

709
00:52:16,415 --> 00:52:19,709
So they know we don't turn the other cheek now!

710
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:22,003
Wow, what a speech!

711
00:52:22,171 --> 00:52:25,007
Half Moses, half Mickey Mouse.

712
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:28,760
Forget it, Vinz. You're out of your league.

713
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:31,638
If Abdel dies, we lose a friend?

714
00:52:31,805 --> 00:52:32,555
Right!

715
00:52:32,723 --> 00:52:35,392
If a cop dies, do all cops go away?

716
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:39,479
You're just one guy!
You can't blow 'em all away!

717
00:52:39,688 --> 00:52:41,773
Who made you a preacher?

718
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,609
You know what's right and wrong?

719
00:52:44,776 --> 00:52:47,653
Why do you side with the assholes?

720
00:52:47,821 --> 00:52:49,948
Who's the asshole?

721
00:52:50,115 --> 00:52:54,619
In school we learnt that hate breeds hate!

722
00:52:54,786 --> 00:52:57,914
I didn't go to school, I'm from the street!

723
00:52:58,081 --> 00:52:59,707
Know what it taught me?

724
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:03,545
Turn the other cheek, you're dead mothafucka!

725
00:53:04,171 --> 00:53:09,301
Bullshit! You pointed a gun at a cop!
We coulda been killed!

726
00:53:09,468 --> 00:53:11,469
Nothing like a good shit!

727
00:53:12,637 --> 00:53:16,807
You believe in God? That's the wrong question.

728
00:53:16,975 --> 00:53:19,268
Does God believe in us?

729
00:53:19,478 --> 00:53:23,064
I once had a friend called Grunwalski.

730
00:53:23,273 --> 00:53:26,484
We were sent to Siberia together.

731
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:30,363
When you go to a Siberian work camp,

732
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:33,407
you travel in a cattle car.

733
00:53:33,575 --> 00:53:37,662
You roll across icy steppes for days,

734
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:40,122
without seeing a soul.

735
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:42,667
You huddle to keep warm.

736
00:53:42,959 --> 00:53:47,630
But it's hard to relieve yourself,
to take a shit,

737
00:53:47,797 --> 00:53:50,174
you can't do it on the train,

738
00:53:50,383 --> 00:53:53,302
and the only time the train stops

739
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:57,140
is to take on water for the locomotive.

740
00:53:57,307 --> 00:54:00,351
But Grunwalski was shy.

741
00:54:00,518 --> 00:54:02,811
Even when we bathed together,

742
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,647
he got upset.

743
00:54:04,814 --> 00:54:08,275
I used to kid him about it.

744
00:54:08,693 --> 00:54:13,531
So, the train stops
and everyone jumps out to shit

745
00:54:13,698 --> 00:54:15,616
on the tracks.

746
00:54:15,784 --> 00:54:19,162
I'd teased Grunwalski so much

747
00:54:19,329 --> 00:54:22,540
that he went off on his own.

748
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:25,584
The train Starts moving,

749
00:54:25,752 --> 00:54:27,962
so everyone jumps on,

750
00:54:28,213 --> 00:54:30,840
because it waits for nobody.

751
00:54:31,341 --> 00:54:33,634
Grunwalski had a problem:

752
00:54:33,843 --> 00:54:36,887
He'd gone behind a bush

753
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:39,015
and was still shitting.

754
00:54:39,474 --> 00:54:43,686
So I see him come out from behind the bush,

755
00:54:43,853 --> 00:54:48,482
holding up his pants with his hands.

756
00:54:48,691 --> 00:54:51,318
He tries to catch up.

757
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:53,695
I hold out my hand,

758
00:54:53,863 --> 00:54:56,699
but each time he reaches for it

759
00:54:56,866 --> 00:54:58,617
he lets go of his pants

760
00:54:58,785 --> 00:55:01,078
and they drop to his ankles.

761
00:55:01,454 --> 00:55:03,205
He pulls them back up,

762
00:55:03,372 --> 00:55:05,123
Starts running again,

763
00:55:05,291 --> 00:55:08,752
but they fall back down,

764
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,380
when he reaches out for me.

765
00:55:12,924 --> 00:55:15,092
Then what happened?
- Nothing.

766
00:55:15,593 --> 00:55:16,969
Grunwalski...

767
00:55:18,137 --> 00:55:19,972
froze to death.

768
00:55:22,058 --> 00:55:22,975
Good day.

769
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,691
Why'd he tell us that?

770
00:55:40,076 --> 00:55:42,453
I got the address. I'll call you.

771
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:47,832
Why'd he tell us that?

772
00:56:03,891 --> 00:56:06,184
'Xcuse me, I'm just out of the hospital.

773
00:56:06,352 --> 00:56:08,437
I haven't eaten for 2 days.

774
00:56:08,604 --> 00:56:12,441
My child's hungry, I need your spare change...

775
00:56:14,568 --> 00:56:17,279
I wanna date with Mina!

776
00:56:17,446 --> 00:56:19,364
I'll lasso her!

777
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:23,118
What d'you want? My dad's in jail,

778
00:56:23,285 --> 00:56:25,829
my mom's in jail, my whole family is!

779
00:56:25,996 --> 00:56:28,081
Get a job like everyone else!

780
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:30,917
What is this, Mardi Gras?

781
00:56:33,921 --> 00:56:35,756
I want Mina!

782
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:42,679
I'm homeless, my welfare ran out.

783
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:46,933
I got out of a halfway house...

784
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,560
It's a block away.

785
00:56:49,937 --> 00:56:50,520
Thanks.

786
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,146
Have a nice day, sir.

787
00:56:52,314 --> 00:56:53,398
Thanks.

788
00:56:57,903 --> 00:57:00,363
The pigs are fuckin' polite around here!

789
00:57:01,698 --> 00:57:03,741
Even called me sir!

790
00:57:15,003 --> 00:57:17,463
Maybe he won the lottery!

791
00:57:22,219 --> 00:57:24,512
Damn, it's locked!

792
00:57:25,722 --> 00:57:27,890
What's his real name?

793
00:57:28,058 --> 00:57:30,852
I only know him as Snoopy.

794
00:57:38,026 --> 00:57:40,903
Yes?
- Sorry to bother you.

795
00:57:41,071 --> 00:57:42,739
I'm looking for...

796
00:57:42,989 --> 00:57:44,156
Snoopy.

797
00:57:44,783 --> 00:57:46,993
It sounds weird.
- Very funny!

798
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,121
The fucker hung up.

799
00:57:51,956 --> 00:57:53,207
You try.

800
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:55,418
Why me?
- Try!

801
00:57:56,002 --> 00:57:58,003
Darkie and me will get shot at!

802
00:58:00,757 --> 00:58:02,258
Hello.
- Yes?

803
00:58:02,425 --> 00:58:04,301
Is Snoopy there?

804
00:58:05,136 --> 00:58:07,221
No, but Charlie Brown is!

805
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:14,061
You fucked it up, you asshole!

806
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:15,313
Stop that!

807
00:58:15,522 --> 00:58:17,315
Sorry to bother you.

808
00:58:17,482 --> 00:58:21,819
Our pal Snoopy lives here,
we don't know his real name.

809
00:58:21,986 --> 00:58:25,364
Stop ringing! You thinka da world is yours?

810
00:58:25,531 --> 00:58:27,449
Unreal!

811
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,080
No, we're staying!

812
00:58:36,751 --> 00:58:38,752
So call the cops, you spic!

813
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,670
Sayid?

814
00:58:40,797 --> 00:58:42,131
Snoopy?

815
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,967
What floor?
- 5th.

816
00:58:45,218 --> 00:58:46,302
We're coming!

817
00:58:48,846 --> 00:58:50,681
Snoopy? Is no name!

818
00:58:50,848 --> 00:58:52,683
You always make a trouble!

819
00:59:05,863 --> 00:59:07,906
Were you followed?
- No.

820
00:59:08,074 --> 00:59:09,784
No one?
- Nobody!

821
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,202
You sure?
- Why?

822
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:12,661
Because...

823
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:17,123
You cool?

824
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:18,667
Great!

825
00:59:18,834 --> 00:59:20,335
Check that kitchen.

826
00:59:20,795 --> 00:59:22,296
Who's this dude?

827
00:59:24,215 --> 00:59:26,967
Nice space! You win the lottery?

828
00:59:27,134 --> 00:59:30,804
A guy loaned it to me. He ain't gettin' it back!

829
00:59:30,971 --> 00:59:34,140
This is no apartment, it's a palace!

830
00:59:34,475 --> 00:59:35,475
I don't believe it.

831
00:59:35,684 --> 00:59:38,061
Bitchin' apartment!

832
00:59:38,229 --> 00:59:41,148
Snoopy, meet Vinz.

833
00:59:43,442 --> 00:59:45,277
This is Cousin Hubert!

834
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,238
We've met before!

835
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,740
Line of coke?
- No.

836
00:59:49,907 --> 00:59:51,491
You sure?
- No thanks.

837
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:54,411
A little line of coke?

838
00:59:54,578 --> 00:59:57,205
No one for coke?

839
00:59:57,581 --> 00:59:59,624
How's your bro?
- OK.

840
00:59:59,792 --> 01:00:01,543
Mean fuckin' dude!

841
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:04,003
He still a maniac?
- And you?

842
01:00:04,171 --> 01:00:06,172
Fuckin' A! Watch!

843
01:00:06,966 --> 01:00:08,384
So you got my cash?

844
01:00:08,759 --> 01:00:09,926
My bread!

845
01:00:10,135 --> 01:00:13,513
Make it snappy, Snoopy!

846
01:00:13,681 --> 01:00:15,808
Cut the bullshit!

847
01:00:19,144 --> 01:00:20,311
Come get it.

848
01:00:21,063 --> 01:00:23,231
Comin' at you, Bruce Lee!

849
01:00:29,404 --> 01:00:31,280
Hands off!
- What?

850
01:00:31,448 --> 01:00:33,908
Not for kids! It's my gun!

851
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:38,705
So what? I got a piece too.

852
01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:41,750
Let's see!

853
01:00:42,626 --> 01:00:44,002
Whip it out.

854
01:00:48,048 --> 01:00:48,965
Fuck!

855
01:00:49,132 --> 01:00:50,466
Don't, Vinz!

856
01:00:50,676 --> 01:00:51,760
He knows guns.

857
01:00:51,969 --> 01:00:55,305
A snub-nosed Smith & Wesson Magnum 44.

858
01:00:56,098 --> 01:00:57,182
Watch it!

859
01:00:57,391 --> 01:00:58,475
It's loaded.

860
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:00,726
Mean piece.

861
01:01:01,645 --> 01:01:03,188
You're a gangsta.

862
01:01:04,398 --> 01:01:06,108
It's for self-defense.

863
01:01:06,274 --> 01:01:08,275
You into magic?

864
01:01:08,443 --> 01:01:09,360
Watch.

865
01:01:09,736 --> 01:01:10,903
One bullet.

866
01:01:15,075 --> 01:01:16,242
I missed.

867
01:01:16,785 --> 01:01:17,952
You're nuts!

868
01:01:18,161 --> 01:01:21,163
That's live ammo!
- It's an old trick!

869
01:01:21,915 --> 01:01:22,999
Cool it.

870
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:26,586
We up the stakes: 2 bullets!

871
01:01:27,587 --> 01:01:28,754
Snoopy!

872
01:01:28,922 --> 01:01:31,633
Wiggin' out, guys?

873
01:01:32,217 --> 01:01:33,968
You're nuts.

874
01:01:34,135 --> 01:01:35,219
Gimme!

875
01:01:37,138 --> 01:01:38,305
Your turn.

876
01:01:38,473 --> 01:01:40,391
Let's go, he's fried.

877
01:01:40,558 --> 01:01:41,475
Gonna do it?

878
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,270
Gimme.
- Do it!

879
01:01:45,897 --> 01:01:47,398
I did it, you do it!

880
01:01:47,565 --> 01:01:49,441
Man, you want trouble?

881
01:01:49,609 --> 01:01:51,319
Do it!

882
01:01:52,237 --> 01:01:53,488
Chill, guys!

883
01:01:55,782 --> 01:01:57,200
Stop, Vinz!

884
01:01:57,367 --> 01:01:58,701
You aiming at me?

885
01:01:58,868 --> 01:02:00,703
You're off your head!

886
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:02,747
You bet I'm aiming at you!

887
01:02:02,914 --> 01:02:05,041
No one fucks with me!

888
01:02:05,959 --> 01:02:08,419
I'm not some ass-wipe!

889
01:02:09,754 --> 01:02:11,172
Wanna see a gun?

890
01:02:11,339 --> 01:02:12,965
A fuckin' gun?

891
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:18,762
Sayid, get him out!

892
01:02:20,515 --> 01:02:22,225
We're outta here!

893
01:02:25,353 --> 01:02:28,147
Up your mother's slash, sucker!

894
01:02:29,315 --> 01:02:30,315
Look!

895
01:02:34,487 --> 01:02:37,531
That's right, asshole!

896
01:02:38,032 --> 01:02:39,116
He was bluffing!

897
01:02:39,325 --> 01:02:43,579
Now I'll never get my cash!

898
01:02:43,746 --> 01:02:46,874
Leave us out of your games, Vinz!

899
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:51,795
Games? We got a pal in the hospital!

900
01:02:51,963 --> 01:02:53,964
Don't take on the world!

901
01:02:54,131 --> 01:02:56,299
You got the wrong build!

902
01:02:56,467 --> 01:03:00,304
I'm not like you, Mr. Black Hercules, right?

903
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:01,764
Go fuck yourself!

904
01:03:02,139 --> 01:03:03,306
Fuck myself?

905
01:03:10,898 --> 01:03:12,649
Alright, kids!

906
01:03:12,817 --> 01:03:14,360
Who're you?
- Easy!

907
01:03:14,527 --> 01:03:16,654
You had your fun!

908
01:03:16,862 --> 01:03:18,321
Easy!

909
01:03:21,534 --> 01:03:23,160
Search them.

910
01:03:23,327 --> 01:03:26,121
Fast work! In my 'hood, the cops come

911
01:03:26,288 --> 01:03:28,498
a week after you're dead!

912
01:03:28,749 --> 01:03:30,208
Hey, you!

913
01:03:31,335 --> 01:03:34,296
You together?
- I don't know them.

914
01:03:34,463 --> 01:03:35,922
Why you here?

915
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:38,050
I live with my aunt!

916
01:03:38,217 --> 01:03:39,384
What's her name?

917
01:03:39,593 --> 01:03:41,344
Mrs. Zyl...

918
01:03:42,846 --> 01:03:46,975
Got I.D.?
- I'm on the level...

919
01:03:54,441 --> 01:03:56,401
Easy!

920
01:03:56,568 --> 01:03:58,569
Freeze!

921
01:03:58,779 --> 01:04:00,322
Don't move, boy!

922
01:04:01,198 --> 01:04:02,198
You know him?

923
01:04:02,366 --> 01:04:03,825
Who?
- Your pal.

924
01:04:03,992 --> 01:04:05,576
I don't know him.

925
01:04:06,787 --> 01:04:09,331
We'll see about that, wise guy!

926
01:04:10,374 --> 01:04:12,459
This is humiliating!
- Too bad.

927
01:04:14,253 --> 01:04:15,796
What's this?

928
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,714
Good stuff!

929
01:04:18,048 --> 01:04:20,508
I'm keeping it.

930
01:04:22,386 --> 01:04:24,679
Afghan's the best.

931
01:04:25,138 --> 01:04:27,181
Good buzz going up and down.

932
01:04:27,349 --> 01:04:29,893
Same with Black Bombay.

933
01:04:30,143 --> 01:04:32,311
Lebanese can really vary.

934
01:04:32,479 --> 01:04:36,399
This is crap but I'll keep it... Well?

935
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:40,069
The little fucker outran me. Take them in.

936
01:04:40,237 --> 01:04:41,780
Get in the back.
- Why me?

937
01:04:41,947 --> 01:04:43,323
Get in!

938
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,213
Listen, scumbag. You know what I think of you?

939
01:04:59,464 --> 01:05:01,465
You're like poodle shit on a sidewalk.

940
01:05:01,633 --> 01:05:03,926
I can't take a step

941
01:05:04,094 --> 01:05:08,473
without squashing your ugly dog-turd face.

942
01:05:09,015 --> 01:05:12,101
So watch where the dog dumps you!

943
01:06:08,366 --> 01:06:09,700
You're all alone!

944
01:06:10,326 --> 01:06:12,077
Far from the slums...

945
01:06:12,662 --> 01:06:14,080
and your looter pals.

946
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:17,500
Pick it up with your feet.

947
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:20,210
Like your people do back home.

948
01:06:21,504 --> 01:06:23,797
They're great with their feet.

949
01:06:25,299 --> 01:06:27,426
This is the hard part.

950
01:06:31,472 --> 01:06:34,808
OK, there's no big hurry.

951
01:06:34,976 --> 01:06:37,186
In 2 hours, they may be free.

952
01:06:37,353 --> 01:06:39,188
Make the most of it.

953
01:06:41,691 --> 01:06:45,444
How 'bout a bullet in the back of your head?

954
01:06:45,945 --> 01:06:47,780
A nice little bullet?

955
01:06:47,947 --> 01:06:50,324
You gotta stop in time.

956
01:06:50,491 --> 01:06:52,868
You need self-control.

957
01:06:53,035 --> 01:06:54,661
Gotta be a pro.

958
01:06:54,829 --> 01:06:57,498
This takes control.

959
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:01,209
Don't get mad! It won't last!

960
01:07:04,422 --> 01:07:07,258
You got something to say?

961
01:07:07,883 --> 01:07:11,094
Don't touch him!

962
01:07:11,512 --> 01:07:13,889
You know this one?

963
01:07:14,098 --> 01:07:15,974
The Shanghai Squeeze.

964
01:07:16,183 --> 01:07:18,226
It's an oldie.

965
01:07:20,187 --> 01:07:23,023
Wait, I think he's thirsty.

966
01:07:24,817 --> 01:07:26,193
Fucker!

967
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,487
Don't hurt yourself!

968
01:07:28,696 --> 01:07:30,989
Take it easy!

969
01:07:32,157 --> 01:07:34,200
Don't get me aroused.

970
01:07:34,535 --> 01:07:36,662
You look like a bitch from behind!

971
01:07:36,829 --> 01:07:40,332
A nice bitch to suck me off!

972
01:07:42,084 --> 01:07:43,543
Blow jobs!

973
01:07:43,836 --> 01:07:45,671
Bitches to suck my dick!

974
01:07:46,255 --> 01:07:49,091
That's the way. Then you relax!

975
01:07:49,425 --> 01:07:52,094
But it's hard to stop in time.

976
01:07:52,261 --> 01:07:54,429
You gotta stay in control.

977
01:07:58,559 --> 01:07:59,726
That's the trick.

978
01:07:59,935 --> 01:08:01,394
I like his face.

979
01:08:01,562 --> 01:08:02,562
He's cute.

980
01:08:03,147 --> 01:08:05,023
What was the name?

981
01:08:06,775 --> 01:08:10,361
Are you cute?
- Yes! I'm cute!

982
01:08:10,779 --> 01:08:13,448
I'm cute!

983
01:08:15,409 --> 01:08:17,077
Which one?
- He's Hubert.

984
01:08:17,244 --> 01:08:18,703
That's no Hubert!

985
01:08:18,871 --> 01:08:20,747
He's French, he's Sayid.

986
01:08:20,914 --> 01:08:22,790
Sayid? That's pretty!

987
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:26,044
Is Sayid a French name?

988
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:28,588
Aren't they pretty?

989
01:08:29,381 --> 01:08:31,841
Take a good look!

990
01:08:33,927 --> 01:08:36,012
The little guy's excited.

991
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:39,223
Leave him alone!

992
01:08:46,898 --> 01:08:48,983
It's so easy to go too far!

993
01:08:49,151 --> 01:08:52,237
But you mustn't! Though you're dying to!

994
01:08:52,946 --> 01:08:55,740
Right, you Arab sonofabitch?

995
01:08:58,577 --> 01:09:00,245
OK, let's go.

996
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:24,185
Sir!

997
01:09:24,352 --> 01:09:26,228
We'll miss the last train!

998
01:09:26,396 --> 01:09:27,647
Forget it.

999
01:09:27,856 --> 01:09:28,940
Bastard!

1000
01:09:29,149 --> 01:09:31,860
Did I talk to you?

1001
01:10:03,558 --> 01:10:05,142
Yo, Vinz!

1002
01:10:06,686 --> 01:10:08,354
Where's Sayid and Hubert?

1003
01:10:08,521 --> 01:10:10,898
Dunno. They pissed me off tonight.

1004
01:10:11,107 --> 01:10:13,567
You guys are always fussin'!

1005
01:10:44,015 --> 01:10:45,433
Your sister's hot.

1006
01:10:46,142 --> 01:10:48,435
Shut up, asshole.

1007
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:50,729
Sorry, but she's hot.

1008
01:10:50,896 --> 01:10:52,772
You don't stand a chance.

1009
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:54,983
Don't you try.

1010
01:10:56,277 --> 01:10:58,529
Don't even look at her!

1011
01:10:58,696 --> 01:11:00,322
Check the turn!

1012
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:03,283
I won't try 'cause she's pregnant.

1013
01:11:03,451 --> 01:11:07,454
Don't diss my sis', butthead!

1014
01:11:19,258 --> 01:11:21,259
Brothers, I gotta make it

1015
01:11:21,427 --> 01:11:23,720
by any means necessary

1016
01:11:23,929 --> 01:11:26,306
'cos my mind's playin' tricks on me.

1017
01:11:31,937 --> 01:11:33,480
You won't let us in?

1018
01:11:33,647 --> 01:11:35,440
Beat it!

1019
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:41,321
That nigger bouncer never lets us in!

1020
01:11:41,488 --> 01:11:43,281
We know his bro for 10 years!

1021
01:11:43,449 --> 01:11:46,660
And he still gives us shit!

1022
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:48,870
Drives me crazy!

1023
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:51,957
What's up with the flare gun?

1024
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:54,752
Where you going?

1025
01:11:55,085 --> 01:11:56,628
Don't be a hot dog!

1026
01:11:59,423 --> 01:12:00,590
Stop!

1027
01:12:01,258 --> 01:12:04,135
I told you I'd be back!

1028
01:12:05,762 --> 01:12:07,680
Not so big now, fuckface!

1029
01:12:07,848 --> 01:12:11,142
You and your stinkin' club!

1030
01:12:11,476 --> 01:12:14,604
Fuck your club!

1031
01:12:14,771 --> 01:12:17,148
Goddam nigger!

1032
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:37,376
That cop made us miss it.

1033
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,255
Dickless fuckin' Tracy!

1034
01:12:53,852 --> 01:12:55,562
When's the next one?

1035
01:12:55,979 --> 01:12:57,397
Tomorrow morning.

1036
01:13:38,438 --> 01:13:40,356
How much did Snoopy owe you?

1037
01:13:40,523 --> 01:13:41,273
What?

1038
01:13:41,482 --> 01:13:43,150
What'd he owe you?

1039
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:44,569
One.

1040
01:13:44,736 --> 01:13:46,946
$1,000?
- No, $100.

1041
01:13:47,155 --> 01:13:48,239
What?

1042
01:13:48,531 --> 01:13:50,783
All this shit for a lousy $100!

1043
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:53,702
It's the principle that counts.

1044
01:13:55,705 --> 01:13:57,498
Principle!

1045
01:13:59,751 --> 01:14:02,211
Coyote's a bad motherfucker.

1046
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:04,964
Roadrunner's a pussy.

1047
01:14:05,256 --> 01:14:07,716
Pick between Tweetie and Sylvester.

1048
01:14:08,384 --> 01:14:10,177
Fuck you and Tweetie!

1049
01:14:10,344 --> 01:14:13,472
I don't take shit from a guy who sees cows!

1050
01:14:13,639 --> 01:14:17,017
I say Sylvester's the real gangsta.

1051
01:14:17,643 --> 01:14:19,519
Bottom line! 'Nuff said!

1052
01:14:19,687 --> 01:14:23,357
Can't talk with you guys if you won't listen.

1053
01:14:23,524 --> 01:14:25,150
'Cause you listen?

1054
01:14:25,318 --> 01:14:27,862
You got it all wrong.

1055
01:14:28,029 --> 01:14:32,158
I say Tweetie's the baddest. He always wins.

1056
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:34,034
That's bullshit!

1057
01:14:34,327 --> 01:14:37,163
Sylvester fucks Tweetie and you!

1058
01:14:37,788 --> 01:14:39,122
Come again?

1059
01:14:39,874 --> 01:14:42,084
Who does he fuck? Me?

1060
01:14:42,293 --> 01:14:44,211
Anyway, Sylvester's a black brother.

1061
01:14:44,378 --> 01:14:46,004
A black brother?

1062
01:14:46,422 --> 01:14:47,589
Full of shit!

1063
01:14:48,299 --> 01:14:50,676
Shall we, gentlemen?

1064
01:14:50,843 --> 01:14:52,678
What can we lose?

1065
01:15:00,519 --> 01:15:04,105
It's positively frightful!

1066
01:15:11,113 --> 01:15:12,823
Is this guy famous?

1067
01:15:14,825 --> 01:15:17,536
He will be when he grows up!

1068
01:15:34,887 --> 01:15:38,390
There's Champagne, Cinzano, Bogardi...

1069
01:15:38,599 --> 01:15:40,392
I don't drink.
- I mean Bacardi.

1070
01:15:40,559 --> 01:15:41,559
Outta my way.

1071
01:15:43,103 --> 01:15:44,521
I want peanuts.

1072
01:15:48,067 --> 01:15:49,526
Cheers, Charles!

1073
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:51,986
Hey, Charles!

1074
01:15:52,154 --> 01:15:54,948
Behave, asshole!

1075
01:15:57,409 --> 01:15:59,953
Let 'em through, Sayid!

1076
01:16:01,163 --> 01:16:02,956
Check out the babes!

1077
01:16:03,123 --> 01:16:05,124
That's what I call women!

1078
01:16:06,001 --> 01:16:07,961
The sister is hot.

1079
01:16:09,504 --> 01:16:10,671
Do me a favor.

1080
01:16:10,839 --> 01:16:12,549
I'm not going!

1081
01:16:12,883 --> 01:16:15,427
Who bought the tacos last week?

1082
01:16:15,594 --> 01:16:17,721
You owe me one.

1083
01:16:17,888 --> 01:16:19,222
Get me the sister.

1084
01:16:19,556 --> 01:16:20,723
Awright.

1085
01:16:21,642 --> 01:16:23,435
There's just two!

1086
01:16:23,602 --> 01:16:25,103
Who cares?
- Shut up!

1087
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:27,438
Get her for me, Hubert!

1088
01:16:33,653 --> 01:16:36,030
Excuse me, my name's Hubert.

1089
01:16:36,531 --> 01:16:40,660
My friend's a romantic, he's really shy.

1090
01:16:40,827 --> 01:16:43,204
He'd love to meet you.

1091
01:16:43,413 --> 01:16:44,831
That's him.

1092
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:47,959
What d'ya say?

1093
01:16:48,126 --> 01:16:50,419
Look what you did to me!

1094
01:16:51,296 --> 01:16:52,964
He's really cool.

1095
01:16:53,131 --> 01:16:56,467
He's too nice.
- OK, then!

1096
01:16:56,635 --> 01:16:57,969
C'mon Sayid!

1097
01:16:59,095 --> 01:17:00,179
Hold this.

1098
01:17:02,057 --> 01:17:04,225
Haven't we met before?

1099
01:17:04,434 --> 01:17:05,810
Don't I wish!

1100
01:17:05,977 --> 01:17:07,228
Hi, girls!

1101
01:17:07,395 --> 01:17:08,062
I'm Sayid.

1102
01:17:10,231 --> 01:17:12,566
Please don't lean on the painting.

1103
01:17:12,734 --> 01:17:13,818
You're the painting!

1104
01:17:15,695 --> 01:17:16,529
I'm good at what?

1105
01:17:16,696 --> 01:17:17,863
Guess, babe!

1106
01:17:18,073 --> 01:17:19,908
We heard you were shy!

1107
01:17:20,075 --> 01:17:23,495
Shy? That's my middle name!

1108
01:17:24,287 --> 01:17:26,831
What's your number? We'll go out.

1109
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,500
You're all alike!

1110
01:17:29,709 --> 01:17:31,836
He said you wanted to talk.

1111
01:17:32,045 --> 01:17:34,505
Talk? What about?

1112
01:17:35,882 --> 01:17:38,676
Lighten up! We were ready to talk,

1113
01:17:38,843 --> 01:17:42,930
but with your attitude, how can we respect you?

1114
01:17:43,097 --> 01:17:46,475
Who are you? The Wonderbra bitch?

1115
01:17:46,643 --> 01:17:49,103
Who asked you?
- I'm asking you!

1116
01:17:49,312 --> 01:17:50,938
He's nuts.

1117
01:17:51,356 --> 01:17:53,691
What are you staring at?

1118
01:17:54,192 --> 01:17:55,443
Got a screw loose?

1119
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:57,611
You're the screw.

1120
01:17:59,405 --> 01:18:02,324
Stop!
- What's wrong with you?

1121
01:18:03,117 --> 01:18:06,620
Leave us alone, we didn't ask you over!

1122
01:18:06,788 --> 01:18:08,498
Gentlemen, please!

1123
01:18:08,664 --> 01:18:10,707
It's cool, Pops!

1124
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:14,712
Nobody's been hurt! What's your beef?

1125
01:18:14,921 --> 01:18:17,757
Keep your heads, please.
- Please what?

1126
01:18:18,925 --> 01:18:20,009
Let's go!

1127
01:18:20,551 --> 01:18:22,177
Pretty please!

1128
01:18:22,345 --> 01:18:24,805
Let's all calm down!

1129
01:18:25,139 --> 01:18:26,390
Stop that!

1130
01:18:26,557 --> 01:18:27,933
Stop your friend.

1131
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,852
You're not my friend! Fuck you!

1132
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:34,314
Know what?

1133
01:18:34,774 --> 01:18:36,901
Go suck cocks in hell!

1134
01:18:37,068 --> 01:18:40,446
With your mothers!
- You're all ugly!

1135
01:18:40,613 --> 01:18:43,157
I'm fuckin' sorry, sir!

1136
01:18:46,285 --> 01:18:48,495
Have fun, mothafuckas!

1137
01:18:51,791 --> 01:18:53,209
Troubled youth!

1138
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:55,293
We shoulda swiped a bottle.

1139
01:18:55,461 --> 01:18:58,463
I got the sucker's charge card!

1140
01:18:58,631 --> 01:19:01,300
Hubert! Up to your old tricks!

1141
01:19:01,467 --> 01:19:03,552
Like riding a bike: You don't forget.

1142
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:06,263
Mr. David Moe?

1143
01:19:08,432 --> 01:19:10,058
He's not here?

1144
01:19:10,809 --> 01:19:12,310
We keep it for him!

1145
01:19:12,478 --> 01:19:14,229
Give it to me.

1146
01:19:16,065 --> 01:19:17,816
What's the score?

1147
01:19:17,983 --> 01:19:19,150
Killer!

1148
01:19:19,568 --> 01:19:21,361
Know what I'm saying?

1149
01:19:22,738 --> 01:19:24,865
Your name's not David!

1150
01:19:25,032 --> 01:19:26,992
And cabs don't take plastic.

1151
01:19:27,159 --> 01:19:28,410
Just this once.

1152
01:19:28,619 --> 01:19:30,746
Gimme a break!

1153
01:19:35,501 --> 01:19:36,668
You fart?

1154
01:19:37,086 --> 01:19:38,504
It was you. Who else?

1155
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:41,047
It stinks. Had to be you.

1156
01:19:41,215 --> 01:19:42,299
That's not my stink.

1157
01:19:42,466 --> 01:19:43,967
I know your farts.

1158
01:19:44,134 --> 01:19:46,594
Mothafucka, we're locked out.

1159
01:19:52,351 --> 01:19:53,351
Who farted?

1160
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,894
He did.
- He did.

1161
01:19:56,688 --> 01:19:58,564
Can't you tell?

1162
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:01,526
It was him.

1163
01:20:01,693 --> 01:20:03,903
Your ass reeks.

1164
01:20:04,905 --> 01:20:08,491
Motherfucking goddam steering wheel!

1165
01:20:08,659 --> 01:20:10,786
Cut the poetry

1166
01:20:10,952 --> 01:20:12,828
and pull the thing!

1167
01:20:12,996 --> 01:20:16,416
Jean-Claude does this in five seconds flat.

1168
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:17,667
Which Jean-Claude?

1169
01:20:17,876 --> 01:20:18,876
The mailman?

1170
01:20:19,086 --> 01:20:22,672
No, that's Sylvie's boyfriend.

1171
01:20:22,839 --> 01:20:25,299
This guy got 2 years for car theft.

1172
01:20:25,509 --> 01:20:27,719
Move it, bust the fucker!

1173
01:20:27,886 --> 01:20:31,139
Use your foot!

1174
01:20:52,786 --> 01:20:54,120
Don't be a sissy.

1175
01:20:54,287 --> 01:20:56,664
Who's a sissy?

1176
01:21:01,252 --> 01:21:03,379
Relax, Max.

1177
01:21:13,348 --> 01:21:16,726
"Night of the Living Car!"

1178
01:21:18,728 --> 01:21:20,604
The wipers!

1179
01:21:25,318 --> 01:21:27,278
Rip open that plastic box.

1180
01:21:27,445 --> 01:21:29,196
Open sesame!

1181
01:21:31,532 --> 01:21:35,369
Connect the green wire to the red one.

1182
01:21:35,536 --> 01:21:37,913
Nah, that's for the blinkers.

1183
01:21:38,081 --> 01:21:40,458
How'd they do it in on TV?

1184
01:21:40,625 --> 01:21:42,835
Fuck TV!

1185
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,756
Start the mother!

1186
01:21:50,677 --> 01:21:51,844
Who the fuck's he?

1187
01:21:54,097 --> 01:21:55,890
Freaked me out!

1188
01:21:56,974 --> 01:21:58,642
Who the fuck are you?

1189
01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:00,478
Huh?
- What you doin'?

1190
01:22:00,645 --> 01:22:01,729
Nothing.

1191
01:22:01,938 --> 01:22:03,731
So go somewhere else.

1192
01:22:03,898 --> 01:22:05,899
Move, you'll get us nabbed.

1193
01:22:06,067 --> 01:22:07,234
It's my wife...

1194
01:22:07,443 --> 01:22:08,527
What about her?

1195
01:22:09,987 --> 01:22:10,862
She left me.

1196
01:22:11,822 --> 01:22:13,949
Do we fuckin' care?

1197
01:22:15,952 --> 01:22:18,079
Don't wait for the law, Start it.

1198
01:22:18,246 --> 01:22:20,039
Move!

1199
01:22:20,206 --> 01:22:22,416
The red wire to the green wire.

1200
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:25,252
Lay off, that's for the horn!

1201
01:22:25,419 --> 01:22:26,586
Try the blue, jerk!

1202
01:22:27,546 --> 01:22:30,966
You do it! If you're so smart.

1203
01:22:31,133 --> 01:22:32,300
I'll kill you!!

1204
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:35,888
You're a drag.

1205
01:22:36,806 --> 01:22:39,016
That wire's for the horn.

1206
01:22:39,892 --> 01:22:40,642
No, that's the horn!

1207
01:22:42,812 --> 01:22:44,647
Sayid's right.

1208
01:22:44,814 --> 01:22:46,732
You see?

1209
01:22:46,899 --> 01:22:49,818
Who was right? We do it my way!

1210
01:22:49,985 --> 01:22:51,611
Gimme some metal!

1211
01:22:51,779 --> 01:22:53,238
Move it!

1212
01:22:54,532 --> 01:22:56,533
You're a good guy. What's your name?

1213
01:22:58,702 --> 01:23:00,328
You got a name?

1214
01:23:02,873 --> 01:23:05,500
At least we put it to good use!

1215
01:23:07,044 --> 01:23:09,421
Ready? Watch this.

1216
01:23:22,434 --> 01:23:24,269
Anyone know how to drive?

1217
01:23:24,687 --> 01:23:27,231
Vinz does.
- Wait a second.

1218
01:23:27,398 --> 01:23:30,067
I never learned, I got no licence.

1219
01:23:30,317 --> 01:23:32,444
He does. He was in the Army.

1220
01:23:32,611 --> 01:23:34,904
The Navy! I can't drive.

1221
01:23:35,489 --> 01:23:36,740
I can!

1222
01:23:36,949 --> 01:23:38,325
Shut up!

1223
01:23:40,202 --> 01:23:41,202
Vinz?
- What?

1224
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:45,499
You took that bitch around Israel in a Mercedes.

1225
01:23:45,999 --> 01:23:48,876
Not the same thing!

1226
01:23:49,044 --> 01:23:51,212
That was different. It was... uh...

1227
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:53,840
It was an automatic...

1228
01:23:54,383 --> 01:23:55,300
More like a dream!

1229
01:23:58,053 --> 01:24:00,054
You guys are so lame!

1230
01:24:02,975 --> 01:24:04,601
Now what?

1231
01:24:06,353 --> 01:24:09,689
Sorry, but a cop car's coming.

1232
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,899
Where?
- That's a cop car.

1233
01:24:12,067 --> 01:24:13,067
It's real close.

1234
01:24:15,821 --> 01:24:18,198
On three, we're outta here, OK?

1235
01:24:18,824 --> 01:24:19,533
Ready?

1236
01:24:19,699 --> 01:24:20,199
Three!

1237
01:24:27,666 --> 01:24:29,167
Freeze!

1238
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:34,964
Out of the way!

1239
01:24:52,023 --> 01:24:54,692
Sometimes you feel so fuckin' small...

1240
01:24:55,235 --> 01:24:57,236
Got any more bullshit wisdom?

1241
01:24:57,404 --> 01:25:00,323
"The early bird catches the worm."

1242
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:02,950
"A stitch in time saves nine."

1243
01:25:03,159 --> 01:25:06,120
"Haste makes waste."

1244
01:25:06,287 --> 01:25:08,747
"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity."

1245
01:25:08,915 --> 01:25:12,084
I save that one for special occasions.

1246
01:25:12,794 --> 01:25:15,171
Holy fuck!

1247
01:25:15,755 --> 01:25:17,882
I'm wasted.

1248
01:25:18,091 --> 01:25:20,301
Your shit is dope!

1249
01:25:22,303 --> 01:25:23,387
Sayid, watch it!

1250
01:25:24,973 --> 01:25:25,890
He's a big boy!

1251
01:25:26,099 --> 01:25:28,017
Spray cans!
- You're the can!

1252
01:25:28,935 --> 01:25:32,438
What was that old guy
in the john trying to say?

1253
01:25:32,605 --> 01:25:36,150
Talked about God and shitting.
What was the point?

1254
01:25:36,317 --> 01:25:37,735
I see skinheads.

1255
01:25:37,902 --> 01:25:39,153
You're the skinhead.

1256
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:40,237
Fuck Nazis!

1257
01:25:40,405 --> 01:25:42,865
The point is: God's inside you,

1258
01:25:43,074 --> 01:25:44,617
so He helps you dump!

1259
01:25:44,784 --> 01:25:47,077
God loves your bowels.

1260
01:25:47,286 --> 01:25:48,370
Pass the joint.

1261
01:25:51,749 --> 01:25:53,208
Check this shit out:

1262
01:25:54,293 --> 01:25:58,338
"Pinhead is to skinhead, as teeny is to weenie."

1263
01:25:58,506 --> 01:26:00,716
Get my drift?

1264
01:26:01,008 --> 01:26:02,592
Out of the way.

1265
01:26:12,895 --> 01:26:16,815
Vinz, Know the one about the guy
falling off a skyscraper?

1266
01:26:17,108 --> 01:26:20,152
On the way down he says to himself:

1267
01:26:20,319 --> 01:26:24,906
"So far so good... so far so good..."

1268
01:26:27,576 --> 01:26:29,703
I heard it with a rabbi.

1269
01:26:30,246 --> 01:26:34,583
Like us in the projects. So far so good,

1270
01:26:35,126 --> 01:26:36,585
but how will we land?

1271
01:26:37,169 --> 01:26:40,547
I feel like an ant lost in intergalactic space.

1272
01:26:44,218 --> 01:26:46,595
Watch, I'll switch off the Eiffel Tower.

1273
01:26:52,726 --> 01:26:54,978
That only works in movies.

1274
01:26:55,145 --> 01:26:56,521
Mothafucka!

1275
01:26:56,689 --> 01:26:57,940
You in a movie?

1276
01:26:58,148 --> 01:26:59,941
In a porn flick with your mother!

1277
01:27:00,109 --> 01:27:01,860
Look who's talking!

1278
01:27:02,027 --> 01:27:05,363
Yours sticks carrots up her ass!

1279
01:27:07,408 --> 01:27:09,535
You're the carrot!

1280
01:27:18,544 --> 01:27:20,671
THE WORLD IS YOURS

1281
01:27:32,558 --> 01:27:35,477
THE WORLD IS OURS

1282
01:27:43,151 --> 01:27:46,904
How did they get the car in the gym?

1283
01:27:47,072 --> 01:27:49,616
Search me... Ask God!

1284
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:50,533
Very funny.

1285
01:28:00,085 --> 01:28:03,213
Look at those sheep in the system.

1286
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:08,384
They look cute in their fancy leather jackets.

1287
01:28:08,552 --> 01:28:10,178
But they're scumbags.

1288
01:28:10,345 --> 01:28:13,890
They ride escalators, carried by the system.

1289
01:28:14,474 --> 01:28:16,809
They vote far right, but aren't racists.

1290
01:28:16,977 --> 01:28:20,146
They can't move without escalators.

1291
01:28:20,313 --> 01:28:21,939
The worst!

1292
01:28:24,943 --> 01:28:26,319
Racist!

1293
01:29:05,567 --> 01:29:07,402
WAR IN BOSNIA

1294
01:29:15,827 --> 01:29:17,870
ABDEL ICHAHA DIES

1295
01:29:41,811 --> 01:29:43,312
Where's Vinz?

1296
01:29:51,279 --> 01:29:53,364
Mothafucka!

1297
01:30:12,842 --> 01:30:13,759
What?

1298
01:30:15,970 --> 01:30:17,221
Dumb fuck!

1299
01:30:17,388 --> 01:30:20,307
What did I do?

1300
01:30:22,601 --> 01:30:23,518
Why hit me?

1301
01:30:27,356 --> 01:30:28,899
What did I do?

1302
01:30:30,901 --> 01:30:32,652
What'd I do, asshole?

1303
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,363
You suck big time!

1304
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:36,114
So what'd I do?

1305
01:30:36,282 --> 01:30:38,492
Help me, Sayid! Please.

1306
01:30:38,659 --> 01:30:41,411
Help you what? What'd I do?

1307
01:30:41,579 --> 01:30:42,830
Abdel's dead now!

1308
01:30:43,038 --> 01:30:44,831
He's sick of your shit!

1309
01:30:44,999 --> 01:30:46,083
What shit?

1310
01:30:46,292 --> 01:30:48,377
What the fuck I do?

1311
01:30:49,295 --> 01:30:52,965
You wanna kill a pig, go right ahead.

1312
01:30:54,466 --> 01:30:56,176
But you're on your own.

1313
01:30:56,427 --> 01:30:58,137
We're outta here.

1314
01:31:02,224 --> 01:31:03,725
Get lost.

1315
01:31:04,226 --> 01:31:05,852
Both of you!

1316
01:31:07,479 --> 01:31:10,148
I don't need you!

1317
01:31:13,527 --> 01:31:16,571
I know who I am and where I come from!

1318
01:31:16,738 --> 01:31:19,198
So go home and shut up!

1319
01:31:19,366 --> 01:31:21,743
Fuck your mother!

1320
01:31:38,802 --> 01:31:40,136
Don't bug me, Sayid.

1321
01:31:40,304 --> 01:31:41,930
Think we should've...

1322
01:31:45,559 --> 01:31:46,893
Just what we need!

1323
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:48,227
A nigger!

1324
01:31:49,688 --> 01:31:52,899
You're the fucker who dissed us from the roof!

1325
01:31:53,066 --> 01:31:55,193
The gang banger from the roof?

1326
01:31:55,402 --> 01:31:58,071
Let's see you fight!

1327
01:32:01,825 --> 01:32:03,243
Hold him!

1328
01:32:08,081 --> 01:32:10,625
Come back!

1329
01:32:10,834 --> 01:32:12,544
You fuckin' asshole!

1330
01:32:12,711 --> 01:32:13,711
I done nothing!

1331
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,588
Faster than a speeding bullet?

1332
01:32:15,755 --> 01:32:18,048
I done nothing!

1333
01:32:18,758 --> 01:32:20,009
Check it out!

1334
01:32:21,595 --> 01:32:22,846
Whadda you say?

1335
01:32:31,688 --> 01:32:33,981
Get the fuck in there!

1336
01:32:44,075 --> 01:32:45,534
Whatcha gonna do?

1337
01:32:47,829 --> 01:32:49,664
You think I'm all talk?

1338
01:32:49,831 --> 01:32:51,832
I'm all talk?

1339
01:32:54,169 --> 01:32:57,755
Watch! Don't try and stop me!

1340
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:01,425
Vinz, don't do it!
- Let him!

1341
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:04,345
Do your good deed!

1342
01:33:05,096 --> 01:33:06,096
Shut up!

1343
01:33:06,848 --> 01:33:08,307
There are good cops.

1344
01:33:08,474 --> 01:33:11,476
But the only good skinhead is a dead one!

1345
01:33:11,978 --> 01:33:13,479
Shoot him.

1346
01:33:13,646 --> 01:33:16,982
We took your shit all day. Fuckin' shoot him!

1347
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:18,943
You got the piece.

1348
01:33:22,947 --> 01:33:24,198
Shoot!

1349
01:33:26,826 --> 01:33:27,451
Shoot!

1350
01:33:32,165 --> 01:33:33,624
Fuck his mother!

1351
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,084
Shoot!

1352
01:33:38,421 --> 01:33:41,674
Abdel's dead! Get even, for fuck's sake!

1353
01:33:41,841 --> 01:33:43,634
Do it for Abdel!

1354
01:33:47,889 --> 01:33:48,889
Shoot!

1355
01:33:59,275 --> 01:34:01,276
Get outta here!

1356
01:34:30,222 --> 01:34:31,765
See ya tomorrow.

1357
01:34:44,987 --> 01:34:46,238
Take it.

1358
01:34:50,492 --> 01:34:52,160
Gonna sing a love song?

1359
01:34:52,328 --> 01:34:53,704
Go home, loser.

1360
01:34:53,871 --> 01:34:56,915
Let's go, Vinz.

1361
01:34:57,124 --> 01:34:58,542
Later, Hubert.

1362
01:34:59,418 --> 01:35:01,336
Hear the one about the nun?

1363
01:35:01,503 --> 01:35:03,963
This drunk guy comes out of a bar,

1364
01:35:04,173 --> 01:35:07,676
and walks up to a nun in this big black cape.

1365
01:35:07,843 --> 01:35:11,471
Wham! He slugs her in her teeth. She goes down

1366
01:35:11,638 --> 01:35:14,307
and he keeps on pounding her.

1367
01:35:16,059 --> 01:35:18,311
After about 5 minutes he stops,

1368
01:35:18,687 --> 01:35:21,064
looks at her and says:

1369
01:35:21,273 --> 01:35:23,274
"You're not so tough, Batman!"

1370
01:35:23,442 --> 01:35:25,652
That's a killer!

1371
01:35:25,986 --> 01:35:28,029
He thought the nun was Batman!

1372
01:35:28,196 --> 01:35:30,406
I heard it with a rabbi.

1373
01:35:31,491 --> 01:35:32,491
Over here, you!

1374
01:35:32,909 --> 01:35:34,285
What's the matter?

1375
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:36,121
I know you!

1376
01:35:38,874 --> 01:35:40,375
You were on the roof!

1377
01:35:52,095 --> 01:35:53,679
What're you doin'?

1378
01:35:55,474 --> 01:35:57,350
Got a problem, you fuck?

1379
01:35:57,851 --> 01:35:59,852
Scared without your pals?

1380
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:02,271
Not so tough now!

1381
01:36:02,439 --> 01:36:04,732
Look at him!

1382
01:36:31,885 --> 01:36:34,137
It's about a society falling...

1383
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:38,516
On the way down it keeps telling itself:

1384
01:36:38,808 --> 01:36:40,643
"So far so good...

1385
01:36:41,519 --> 01:36:43,312
"so far so good...

1386
01:36:44,272 --> 01:36:46,399
"so far so good..."

1387
01:36:47,901 --> 01:36:49,902
How you fall doesn't matter.

1388
01:36:51,488 --> 01:36:53,156
It's how you land!
