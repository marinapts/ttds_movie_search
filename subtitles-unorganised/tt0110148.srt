1
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:08,372
So you want me to tell
you the story of my life.

2
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:11,959
Like I said, that's what I do.
I interview people.

3
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,710
I'm a collector of lives.

4
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,545
FM radio, KFRC.

5
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:18,215
You'll need a lot of tape for my story.

6
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:20,968
No problem. I got a bag full of tape.

7
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:24,388
You followed me here, didn't you?

8
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,890
Yeah, I suppose I did.

9
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:29,309
You seemed very interesting.

10
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,229
This is where you live?

11
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,647
No.

12
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,399
It's just a room.

13
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:40,237
What do you say we get started?

14
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,742
What do you do?

15
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:46,494
I'm a vampire.

16
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:51,582
I haven't heard that before.

17
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,335
You mean this literally, I take it?

18
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:55,920
Absolutely.

19
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:59,090
I was waiting for you in that alley.

20
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,509
Watching you watching me.

21
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:04,345
And then you began to speak.

22
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,515
What a lucky break for me.

23
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:09,601
Perhaps lucky for both of us.

24
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:15,690
You said you were...

25
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:17,525
...waiting for me.

26
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:21,195
What were you going to do?
Kill me, drink my blood?

27
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:22,447
Yes.

28
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:25,617
But you needn't be concerned now.

29
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:31,372
You really believe this, don't you,
that you're a vampire?

30
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:34,042
We can't begin this way.

31
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,960
Let me turn on the light.

32
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:40,048
- I thought vampires didn't like light.
- We love it.

33
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,635
I only wanted to prepare you.

34
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,971
Christ!

35
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:48,806
Don't be frightened.

36
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:51,476
I want this opportunity.

37
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:53,729
How the hell did you do that?

38
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:55,397
The same as you do.

39
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:58,400
A series of simple gestures.

40
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,986
Only I moved too fast for you to see.

41
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:03,906
I'm flesh and blood...

42
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:05,658
...but not human.

43
00:05:06,158 --> 00:05:09,328
I haven't been human for 200 years.

44
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:12,331
Please...

45
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,841
How can I put you at ease?

46
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:25,844
Shall we begin like "David Copperfield"?

47
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:27,179
"I am born...

48
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:28,555
"...I grew up."

49
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:34,770
Or shall we begin when I was
born to darkness, as I call it.

50
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:39,024
That's where we should start,
don't you think?

51
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,112
You're not lying, are you?

52
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:45,864
Why should I lie?

53
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:50,244
<i>1791 was the year it happened.</i>

54
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,042
<i>I was 24.</i>

55
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:59,295
<i>Younger than you are now.</i>

56
00:05:59,795 --> 00:06:03,048
<i>But times were different then.
I was a man at that age.</i>

57
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:07,304
<i>The master of a large plantation,
just south of New Orleans.</i>

58
00:06:10,557 --> 00:06:13,059
<i>I had lost my wife in childbirth.</i>

59
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:16,479
<i>She and the infant had been
buried less than half a year.</i>

60
00:06:17,564 --> 00:06:19,816
<i>I would've been happy to join them.</i>

61
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:24,821
<i>I couldn't bear the pain of their loss.</i>

62
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:27,574
<i>I longed to be released from it.</i>

63
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:42,339
<i>I wanted to lose it all:</i>

64
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:44,007
<i>My wealth...</i>

65
00:06:44,674 --> 00:06:46,176
<i>... my estate...</i>

66
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:48,261
<i>... my sanity.</i>

67
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,438
How many aces are in a deck?

68
00:06:58,855 --> 00:07:00,690
Are you calling me a cheat?

69
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:06,613
No, I'm calling you a piece of stinking offal!

70
00:07:12,285 --> 00:07:15,121
You lack the courage of your convictions.
Do it!

71
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,626
<i>Most of all, I longed for death.</i>

72
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,544
<i>I know that now.</i>

73
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:22,880
<i>I invited it.</i>

74
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:26,384
<i>A release from the pain of living.</i>

75
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:50,324
<i>My invitation was open to anyone.</i>

76
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:53,244
<i>To the whore at my side.</i>

77
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:56,414
<i>To the pimp that followed.</i>

78
00:07:58,582 --> 00:08:01,585
<i>But it was a vampire that accepted.</i>

79
00:08:27,946 --> 00:08:29,948
Give me your money or you die!

80
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,485
Do you still want death?

81
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:08,820
Or have you tasted it enough?

82
00:09:08,987 --> 00:09:10,155
Enough.

83
00:09:19,748 --> 00:09:22,918
<i>He left me there, on the banks
of the Mississippi...</i>

84
00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:27,089
<i>... somewhere between life and death.</i>

85
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:48,194
Who are you?
What're you doing in my house?

86
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,739
I've come to answer your prayers.

87
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,619
Life has no meaning anymore... does it?

88
00:10:00,581 --> 00:10:02,750
The wine has no taste.

89
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:04,919
The food sickens you.

90
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:08,006
There seems no reason for any of it...
does there?

91
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:15,555
What if I could give it back to you?

92
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:17,473
Pluck out the pain...

93
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:19,600
...and give you another life?

94
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:22,562
One you could never imagine.

95
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:25,732
And it would be... for all time.

96
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:29,444
And sickness...

97
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:31,112
...and death...

98
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,615
...could never touch you again.

99
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:36,784
Don't be afraid.

100
00:10:37,577 --> 00:10:40,079
I'm going to give you the choice...

101
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:41,247
...l...

102
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:43,082
...never had.

103
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:55,095
<i>That morning, I was not yet a vampire...</i>

104
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:58,098
<i>... and I saw my last sunrise.</i>

105
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:01,101
<i>I remember it completely...</i>

106
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:05,147
<i>... and yet I can't recall
any sunrise before it.</i>

107
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:11,111
<i>I watched the whole magnificence
of the dawn for the last time...</i>

108
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:13,113
<i>... as if it were the first.</i>

109
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:19,787
<i>And then I said farewell to sunlight...</i>

110
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,914
<i>... and set out to become...</i>

111
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:23,040
<i>... what I became.</i>

112
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:46,480
Have you said your good-byes to the light?

113
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:10,380
I've drained you...

114
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:12,674
...to the point of death.

115
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:15,885
If I leave you here...

116
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:17,387
...you'll die.

117
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:19,472
Or...

118
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:23,727
...you can be young always, my friend...

119
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:26,730
...as we are now.

120
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:30,191
But you must tell me...

121
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:32,152
...will you come...

122
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:33,361
...or no?

123
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,533
Yes.

124
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:45,248
Yes.

125
00:13:48,604 --> 00:13:50,481
Your body's dying.

126
00:13:50,773 --> 00:13:52,441
Pay no attention.

127
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:54,986
It happens to us all.

128
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:26,268
Now look...

129
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,687
...with your vampire eyes.

130
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:48,665
What did you see?

131
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,668
No words can describe it.

132
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:55,839
Might as well ask Heaven what it sees.

133
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:57,716
No human can know.

134
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:01,845
<i>The statue seemed to move, but didn't.</i>

135
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:05,349
<i>The world had changed,
yet stayed the same.</i>

136
00:15:06,725 --> 00:15:10,687
<i>I was a newborn vampire,
weeping at the beauty of the night.</i>

137
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:18,737
Perhaps you'd like another cigarette?

138
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,699
I would. It's not bothering you, is it?

139
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:26,870
I don't assume it would.
It's not like you'll die from cancer.

140
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:29,206
I don't think so.

141
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,585
- What about crucifixes?
- Crucifixes?

142
00:15:33,752 --> 00:15:35,712
Can you look at them?

143
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,800
Actually, I'm quite fond of
looking at crucifixes.

144
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:41,761
And the stake through the heart?

145
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:43,054
Nonsense.

146
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:44,430
And coffins?

147
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,724
Coffins.

148
00:15:46,891 --> 00:15:49,602
Coffins, unfortunately, are a necessity.

149
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,606
Don't worry.

150
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:55,775
Soon...

151
00:15:56,276 --> 00:15:59,737
...you'll be sleeping as
soundly as you've ever slept.

152
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:03,283
And when you awake...

153
00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:06,244
...l'll be waiting for you...

154
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:09,622
...and so will all the world.

155
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:21,592
<i>Blood, I was to find,
was a necessity as well.</i>

156
00:16:22,593 --> 00:16:26,472
<i>I awoke the next evening with
a hunger I had never felt.</i>

157
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:30,268
Once you taste this...

158
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:33,605
...you'll never go to another tavern again.

159
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:35,773
You think so?

160
00:16:36,774 --> 00:16:39,819
But what if I'd rather taste your lips?

161
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,947
My lips are even sweeter still.

162
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:00,174
My friend...

163
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:03,135
...should taste those lips.

164
00:17:03,344 --> 00:17:04,470
Is his...

165
00:17:04,678 --> 00:17:05,846
...kiss...

166
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,222
...as deep...

167
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:08,807
...as yours?

168
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:11,852
<i>Deeper, ma chrie.</i>

169
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:47,346
I will not take her life.

170
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:50,224
I've done it for you.

171
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,561
She's dead...

172
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:57,898
...as a doornail, my friend.

173
00:18:05,073 --> 00:18:08,410
It's so easy, you almost feel sorry for them.

174
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,751
You'll get used to killing.

175
00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:19,504
Just forget about that mortal coil.

176
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:22,924
You'll become accustomed to it,
all too quickly.

177
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:32,350
Are you not hungry?

178
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:34,185
<i>Au contraire, ma chrie.</i>

179
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:36,271
He could eat the whole colony.

180
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:56,374
I will finish it.

181
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,709
Now leave us.

182
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:07,552
Can't you pretend, you fool?

183
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:10,222
Don't give the game away.

184
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:12,725
We're lucky to have such a home.

185
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:24,987
Pretend to drink, at least.

186
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:32,495
Such fine crystal shouldn't go to waste.

187
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:54,934
I know.

188
00:19:55,184 --> 00:19:57,186
It gets cold so quickly.

189
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,105
We can live like this?

190
00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:00,690
On animal blood?

191
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:04,026
I wouldn't call it living. Call it surviving.

192
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:07,280
Useful trick if you're on a ship for a month.

193
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:12,952
There's nothing in the world
now that doesn't hold some...

194
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:14,370
Fascination.

195
00:20:15,454 --> 00:20:16,539
Yes.

196
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:20,876
- I'm bored with this prattle.
- We can live without killing.

197
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,212
It's possible.

198
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:23,964
Anything is possible.

199
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:26,049
But just try it for a week.

200
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:30,971
Come into New Orleans and let
me show you some real sport.

201
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:44,484
<i>Lestat killed two, sometimes three a night.</i>

202
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,070
<i>A fresh young girl...</i>

203
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:50,115
<i>... was his favorite for
the first of the evening.</i>

204
00:20:50,824 --> 00:20:54,328
<i>For seconds, he preferred a gilded,
beautiful youth.</i>

205
00:20:55,912 --> 00:20:59,333
<i>But the snob in him
loved to hunt in society.</i>

206
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,170
<i>The blood of the aristocrat
thrilled him best of all.</i>

207
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:06,923
The trick is not to think about it.

208
00:21:07,257 --> 00:21:08,675
You see that one?

209
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,260
Widow St. Clair.

210
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,598
She had that gorgeous young fop
murder her husband.

211
00:21:15,015 --> 00:21:16,391
How do you know?

212
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:19,353
Read her thoughts.

213
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:23,357
Read her thoughts.

214
00:21:29,196 --> 00:21:30,530
I can't.

215
00:21:32,282 --> 00:21:34,953
The "dark gift" is different for each of us.

216
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:39,457
But one thing is true of everyone.
We grow stronger as we go along.

217
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,377
Just take my word for it.

218
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:46,047
She blamed a slave for his murder.

219
00:21:46,214 --> 00:21:48,299
Imagine what they did to him.

220
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,136
Evil-doers are easier, and they taste better.

221
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:25,670
Where are we going?

222
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:34,429
Nowhere.

223
00:22:35,513 --> 00:22:38,683
Now, young man, you really amaze me!

224
00:22:41,436 --> 00:22:44,690
I'm old enough to be your grandmother.

225
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:01,290
Oh, yes, that's the melody.

226
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,459
I remember it.

227
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:17,056
Murderer!

228
00:23:17,556 --> 00:23:18,891
<i>My little papillons!</i>

229
00:23:18,974 --> 00:23:21,477
My butterflies, he killed them!

230
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,815
You... whining coward of a vampire...

231
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:30,569
...who prowls killing rats and poodles!
You could've finished us!

232
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,738
You've condemned me to Hell!

233
00:23:32,821 --> 00:23:34,448
I don't know any Hell.

234
00:23:39,411 --> 00:23:41,246
That's more like it!

235
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:42,831
Anger! Fury!

236
00:23:42,998 --> 00:23:45,584
That's why I chose you!

237
00:23:50,756 --> 00:23:53,342
But you can't kill me, Louis.

238
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:01,434
Feed...

239
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:03,770
...on what you will.

240
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,106
Rats, chickens...

241
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:07,440
...poodles.

242
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:10,360
I'll leave you to it...

243
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,779
...and watch you come around.

244
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:14,114
Remember:

245
00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:16,616
Life without me...

246
00:24:16,783 --> 00:24:18,451
...would be even more...

247
00:24:18,618 --> 00:24:19,953
...unbearable.

248
00:25:19,013 --> 00:25:21,015
Consider yourself lucky.

249
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:25,269
In Paris, a vampire must be
clever for many reasons.

250
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,271
Paris?

251
00:25:27,605 --> 00:25:30,441
Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.

252
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:33,110
You came from Paris?

253
00:25:33,277 --> 00:25:35,613
As did the one who made me.

254
00:25:37,365 --> 00:25:40,701
Tell me about him.
You must've learned something from him.

255
00:25:42,954 --> 00:25:45,289
I learned absolutely nothing.

256
00:25:46,374 --> 00:25:49,043
I wasn't given a choice, remember?

257
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,296
You must know something
about the meaning of it all.

258
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,132
Why? Why should I know these things?

259
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:56,801
Do you know them?

260
00:25:56,968 --> 00:25:58,219
That noise...

261
00:25:58,302 --> 00:26:00,388
...it's driving me mad!

262
00:26:00,554 --> 00:26:03,808
We've been here for weeks
with nothing but that noise!

263
00:26:03,975 --> 00:26:05,559
They know about us.

264
00:26:05,726 --> 00:26:09,647
They watch us dine on empty plates
and drink from empty glasses.

265
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:11,565
Come...

266
00:26:11,732 --> 00:26:13,484
...to New Orleans then.

267
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:17,488
The Paris Opera's in town.
We can try some French...

268
00:26:17,655 --> 00:26:18,991
...cuisine.

269
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:22,828
Forgive me if I have a
lingering respect for life.

270
00:26:25,497 --> 00:26:27,916
You'll soon run out of chickens, Louis.

271
00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:02,409
<i>Monsieur Louis?</i>

272
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:04,870
You don't want any supper?

273
00:27:06,622 --> 00:27:07,873
<i>No, ma chrie.</i>

274
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:11,043
We're worried about you, Master.

275
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:15,797
When is it that you go riding in the field?

276
00:27:17,132 --> 00:27:20,177
And how long since you've
been to the slave quarter?

277
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:25,140
Everywhere there is death.

278
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:30,145
Are you still our master at all?

279
00:27:30,313 --> 00:27:32,231
That will be all, Yvette.

280
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:35,652
I will not go unless you listen to me.

281
00:27:37,403 --> 00:27:39,989
You must send away this friend of yours.

282
00:27:41,074 --> 00:27:43,660
The slaves are all frightened of him...

283
00:27:45,244 --> 00:27:47,413
...and they are frightened of you.

284
00:27:52,835 --> 00:27:55,004
I'm frightened of myself.

285
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,055
Hear me now!

286
00:28:45,472 --> 00:28:47,474
This place is cursed!

287
00:28:47,641 --> 00:28:48,976
Damned!

288
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,895
And, yes, your master is the Devil!

289
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:55,566
Get out while you can! You're all free!

290
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:57,401
Do you hear me?

291
00:28:58,485 --> 00:28:59,570
Run!

292
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:00,613
Run!

293
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:02,823
Save yourselves!

294
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,124
Perfect! Perfect!

295
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,962
Just burn the place!
Burn everything we own!

296
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,673
Have us living in a field, like cattle!

297
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,967
You thought you could have it all.

298
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,551
Shut up, Louis!

299
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,137
Come on!

300
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,743
Where are we?

301
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,247
Where do you think, my idiot friend?

302
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,916
We're in a nice, filthy cemetery.

303
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,252
Are you happy?

304
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,921
Is this fitting? Proper enough?

305
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,340
We belong in Hell.

306
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,259
What if there is no Hell?

307
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,554
Or they don't want us there?
Ever think of that?

308
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,349
<i>But there was a Hell.</i>

309
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:55,103
<i>And no matter where we moved to,
I was in it.</i>

310
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,774
<i>We rented rooms on the
waterfront of New Orleans.</i>

311
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,361
Your skin is icy.

312
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,469
Your friend has no head for wine.

313
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,308
Don't worry.

314
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:36,604
I can warm that cold skin of
yours better than she can.

315
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:38,147
Do you think so?

316
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:40,650
Why...

317
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,777
...you're warm now!

318
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:46,155
But the price is high.

319
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,824
Your pretty friend, I exhausted her.

320
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,913
Soft.

321
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,500
So soft.

322
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:02,129
I can see you lying on a bed of satin.

323
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,299
Such things you say.

324
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:08,928
Do you know what manner of bed?

325
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:37,874
Should we put out the light?

326
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,716
And then put out the light.

327
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:02,482
But once I've put out thy light...

328
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:05,485
...I cannot...

329
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:09,239
...give it vital breath again.

330
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:13,076
Its needs must wither.

331
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:26,757
For you, Louis.

332
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:28,760
You can pretend it's wine.

333
00:33:38,895 --> 00:33:40,146
She's not dead!

334
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:44,192
You're in love with your mortal nature.
You resist what can bring you peace.

335
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:45,652
You call this peace?

336
00:33:45,735 --> 00:33:49,530
We're predators, whose all-seeing
eyes give them detachment!

337
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:52,367
- The girl, Lestat!
- Take her! End that hunger!

338
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,451
No!

339
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:01,793
Now, my child.

340
00:34:03,753 --> 00:34:06,130
You're tired, you want to sleep!

341
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,266
It's a coffin!

342
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:19,143
A coffin! Let me out!

343
00:34:19,936 --> 00:34:21,437
I'm not dead!

344
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:26,150
It's your coffin, enjoy it. Most of us
never get to know what it feels like.

345
00:34:26,317 --> 00:34:27,819
Why do you do this?

346
00:34:27,902 --> 00:34:32,615
I like to do it. I enjoy it.
Take your aesthete's taste to purer things.

347
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:35,660
Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it!

348
00:34:35,827 --> 00:34:38,579
For do not doubt you are a killer, Louis!

349
00:34:45,796 --> 00:34:48,465
- What's that?
- It's a coffin.

350
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:51,510
So it is. You must be dead.

351
00:34:53,095 --> 00:34:54,847
I'm not dead, am I?

352
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,515
You're not dead.

353
00:34:56,598 --> 00:34:57,850
Not yet.

354
00:34:58,017 --> 00:34:59,685
Finish this now!

355
00:34:59,852 --> 00:35:01,020
You finish it!

356
00:35:01,103 --> 00:35:02,813
Save me from him!

357
00:35:03,105 --> 00:35:04,106
Save me!

358
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:07,693
You'll let me go?

359
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:10,321
I can't die like this!

360
00:35:10,696 --> 00:35:11,947
I need a priest.

361
00:35:12,031 --> 00:35:14,908
My friend is a priest.
He'll hear your sins before you die.

362
00:35:14,992 --> 00:35:17,036
Unless... I make her one of us.

363
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:18,120
No!

364
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:22,207
Then take her, Louis, end her suffering!
End yours!

365
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:24,335
No!

366
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,897
Now...

367
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,899
...are you happy?

368
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:52,238
My God!

369
00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:55,867
To think you...

370
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:58,370
...are all I have to learn from.

371
00:36:01,873 --> 00:36:03,917
In the Old World...

372
00:36:04,751 --> 00:36:07,420
...they called it the "dark gift."

373
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,258
And I gave it to you.

374
00:36:34,197 --> 00:36:37,200
<i>Don't go that way, Monsieur.
It's the plague.</i>

375
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:40,787
- Go back the way you came!
- The way I came...

376
00:36:56,344 --> 00:36:57,262
Mama.

377
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:23,331
Please help us.

378
00:37:23,623 --> 00:37:26,000
Papa left us and didn't come back.

379
00:37:33,841 --> 00:37:36,469
<i>Please, wake Mama, Monsieur.</i>

380
00:38:03,496 --> 00:38:05,998
My philosopher. My martyr.

381
00:38:06,165 --> 00:38:08,542
"Never take a human life."

382
00:38:10,294 --> 00:38:12,546
This calls for a celebration.

383
00:38:22,224 --> 00:38:25,018
There's still life in the old lady yet.

384
00:38:28,397 --> 00:38:29,815
Come back!

385
00:38:30,023 --> 00:38:32,192
You are what you are!

386
00:38:34,194 --> 00:38:36,196
Merciful death.

387
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,741
How you love your precious guilt.

388
00:38:49,251 --> 00:38:51,336
<i>Her blood coursed in my veins...</i>

389
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,380
<i>... sweeter than life itself.</i>

390
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:55,966
<i>And, as it did, Lestat's words
made sense to me.</i>

391
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:57,968
<i>I knew peace only when I killed.</i>

392
00:38:58,051 --> 00:39:02,764
<i>When I heard her heart in that terrible
rhythm, I knew what peace could be.</i>

393
00:39:36,758 --> 00:39:40,762
All I need to find you, Louis,
is follow the corpses of rats.

394
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:50,980
Pain is terrible for you.

395
00:39:52,273 --> 00:39:55,985
You feel it like no other creature,
because you're a vampire.

396
00:39:57,654 --> 00:39:59,947
You don't want it to go on.

397
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,199
No.

398
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:07,997
Then do what it is in your nature to do...

399
00:40:08,164 --> 00:40:11,793
...and you will feel as you felt
with that child in your arms.

400
00:40:13,795 --> 00:40:15,797
Evil is a point of view.

401
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:18,800
God kills indiscriminately...

402
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:21,844
...and so shall we.

403
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:27,642
For no creatures under God are as we are.
None so like Him...

404
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,102
...as ourselves.

405
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:33,690
I have a gift for you.

406
00:40:35,108 --> 00:40:36,443
Come.

407
00:40:40,364 --> 00:40:41,365
Please.

408
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,006
- She's here.
- What are you saying?

409
00:40:58,507 --> 00:41:00,050
You need...

410
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:02,011
...company...

411
00:41:02,094 --> 00:41:04,305
...more congenial than mine.

412
00:41:09,393 --> 00:41:11,395
Remember how you wanted her?

413
00:41:12,396 --> 00:41:14,023
The taste of her?

414
00:41:15,899 --> 00:41:18,027
I thought I'd killed her.

415
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,406
Don't worry.

416
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:26,035
Your conscience is clear.

417
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:40,257
Claudia.

418
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,767
Listen to me.

419
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,436
You're ill, my precious.

420
00:41:51,936 --> 00:41:55,899
And I'm going to give you
what you need to get well.

421
00:42:08,286 --> 00:42:09,454
No.

422
00:42:10,246 --> 00:42:12,082
You want her to die then?

423
00:42:27,263 --> 00:42:28,974
That's it. Yes.

424
00:42:43,154 --> 00:42:44,322
Stop!

425
00:42:46,783 --> 00:42:48,159
Stop!

426
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,828
Enough!

427
00:43:29,368 --> 00:43:30,870
I want some more.

428
00:43:31,037 --> 00:43:33,539
Of course you want more.

429
00:44:03,235 --> 00:44:05,071
<i>Gently, chrie.</i>

430
00:44:06,072 --> 00:44:08,074
They're so innocent.

431
00:44:09,408 --> 00:44:11,578
They must not be made to suffer.

432
00:44:12,871 --> 00:44:14,081
Good.

433
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:17,542
Yes.

434
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:19,211
All right, now.

435
00:44:19,378 --> 00:44:20,545
Stop.

436
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:25,092
<i>That's enough, chrie.</i>

437
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:28,053
You must stop before the heart stops.

438
00:44:29,346 --> 00:44:30,555
I want more.

439
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:31,974
I know.

440
00:44:32,265 --> 00:44:34,434
But it's best in the beginning...

441
00:44:34,601 --> 00:44:37,396
...lest the Death takes you down with it.

442
00:44:38,397 --> 00:44:40,607
You've done very well. Look at you.

443
00:44:40,899 --> 00:44:43,235
Not a drop spilt. Very good.

444
00:44:45,946 --> 00:44:47,447
Where is Mama?

445
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:52,744
Mama's gone...

446
00:44:53,078 --> 00:44:56,415
<i>...to Heaven, chrie, like that sweet lady...
right there.</i>

447
00:44:57,749 --> 00:44:59,418
They all go to Heaven.

448
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,461
All but us.

449
00:45:02,629 --> 00:45:04,965
Do you want to frighten our daughter?

450
00:45:05,132 --> 00:45:06,717
I'm not your daughter.

451
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,427
Oh, yes, you are.

452
00:45:08,969 --> 00:45:11,221
You're my and Louis' daughter now.

453
00:45:11,596 --> 00:45:14,308
You see, Louis was going to leave us.

454
00:45:15,434 --> 00:45:17,269
He was going to go away.

455
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,771
But now he's not.

456
00:45:20,772 --> 00:45:22,483
Now he's going to stay...

457
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,485
...and make you happy.

458
00:45:26,821 --> 00:45:27,947
Louis.

459
00:45:33,828 --> 00:45:35,496
You fiend.

460
00:45:35,747 --> 00:45:37,582
One happy family.

461
00:45:47,508 --> 00:45:49,594
He did it to make you stay with him?

462
00:45:49,677 --> 00:45:51,137
Perhaps.

463
00:45:51,304 --> 00:45:55,516
He knew me. He knew I would love
her more than the waking world.

464
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:59,312
<i>But there was more to it.</i>

465
00:45:59,812 --> 00:46:03,358
<i>He lavished affection on her,
there is no doubt about that.</i>

466
00:46:04,484 --> 00:46:08,696
<i>Perhaps, in the end,
he did it because he was lonely too.</i>

467
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:11,783
- I need more light.
- She needs more light.

468
00:46:11,866 --> 00:46:14,577
- I'll go blind without another lamp.
- She'll go blind.

469
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:17,121
Or let me fit this child during the day.

470
00:46:17,205 --> 00:46:21,000
<i>Well, I am afraid, madame,
that my days are sacrosanct.</i>

471
00:46:22,377 --> 00:46:24,545
<i>A little child, she was.</i>

472
00:46:24,712 --> 00:46:26,673
<i>But also a fierce killer...</i>

473
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:31,719
<i>... now capable of the ruthless pursuit
of blood with all a child's demanding.</i>

474
00:46:33,389 --> 00:46:35,182
Let me kiss it better.

475
00:46:49,071 --> 00:46:50,197
Now...

476
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:54,410
...who will we get to finish your dress?
Be practical!

477
00:46:54,576 --> 00:46:56,870
Remember, never in our home!

478
00:46:57,746 --> 00:47:00,541
<i>She slept in my coffin at first...</i>

479
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:03,585
<i>... curling her little fingers around my hair...</i>

480
00:47:03,752 --> 00:47:06,505
<i>... till the day when she
wanted her own coffin.</i>

481
00:47:14,096 --> 00:47:16,557
<i>But still, whenever she awoke...</i>

482
00:47:16,765 --> 00:47:18,726
<i>... she would crawl into mine.</i>

483
00:47:29,778 --> 00:47:33,699
<i>They died fast in those days, before,
she learned to play with them...</i>

484
00:47:33,782 --> 00:47:37,202
<i>... to delay the moment till
she had taken what she wanted.</i>

485
00:47:50,967 --> 00:47:53,219
Why are you crying, child?

486
00:47:53,386 --> 00:47:55,055
Are you lost, my love?

487
00:47:55,388 --> 00:47:56,806
Mama!

488
00:47:57,974 --> 00:47:59,893
Hush, now, don't cry.

489
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,728
We'll find her.

490
00:48:08,568 --> 00:48:12,322
Mind the thumb, girl. Mind the thumb.
That little digit.

491
00:48:26,586 --> 00:48:29,172
They're expensive, my dear.

492
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:34,010
Maybe too expensive for
a young girl like you.

493
00:48:47,774 --> 00:48:49,943
Claudia! What have we told you!

494
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,445
Never in the house.

495
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,199
Give me some room.

496
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:59,287
<i>To me, she was a child.</i>

497
00:48:59,453 --> 00:49:01,872
<i>But to Lestat, a pupil...</i>

498
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:05,543
<i>... an infant prodigy with
a lust for killing like his own.</i>

499
00:49:06,127 --> 00:49:09,213
<i>Together, they finished off whole families.</i>

500
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,972
Wonderful, wonderful.

501
00:49:18,222 --> 00:49:20,975
Now try something
on a more somber note.

502
00:49:34,655 --> 00:49:37,742
<i>Time can pass quickly for
mortals when they're happy.</i>

503
00:49:37,825 --> 00:49:39,910
<i>With us, it was the same.</i>

504
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:43,414
<i>The years flew by like minutes.
The city grew.</i>

505
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:45,750
<i>Sailboats gave way to steamships...</i>

506
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:49,754
<i>... disgorging an endless menu
of magnificent strangers.</i>

507
00:49:50,671 --> 00:49:52,923
<i>A new world had sprung up around us.</i>

508
00:49:53,007 --> 00:49:55,343
<i>And we were all Americans now.</i>

509
00:50:03,517 --> 00:50:05,519
This filthy modern tide!

510
00:50:05,853 --> 00:50:10,275
What I wouldn't give for a drop
of old-fashioned Creole blood!

511
00:50:10,442 --> 00:50:12,778
Yankees are not to your taste?

512
00:50:13,028 --> 00:50:16,531
Their Democratic flavor
doesn't suit my palate, Louis.

513
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:37,135
Now that is pure Creole.

514
00:50:40,472 --> 00:50:43,141
Trust Claudia to have found her.

515
00:50:45,852 --> 00:50:46,895
What?

516
00:50:47,646 --> 00:50:49,147
Don't you want her?

517
00:50:49,564 --> 00:50:51,358
I want to be her.

518
00:50:53,902 --> 00:50:54,903
Can I?

519
00:50:55,153 --> 00:50:56,655
Be like her one day?

520
00:51:00,993 --> 00:51:04,579
More melancholy nonsense.
You grow more like Louis daily!

521
00:51:04,746 --> 00:51:06,581
Soon you'll be eating rats.

522
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:11,003
Rats? When did you eat rats, Louis?

523
00:51:11,878 --> 00:51:13,880
It was a long, long time ago.

524
00:51:14,006 --> 00:51:15,590
Before you were born.

525
00:51:16,883 --> 00:51:18,760
And I don't recommend them.

526
00:51:21,514 --> 00:51:26,102
<i>Thirty years had passed, yet her body
remained that of an eternal child.</i>

527
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,524
<i>Her eyes alone told the story of her age,
staring from under her curls...</i>

528
00:51:31,691 --> 00:51:33,109
<i>... with a questioning...</i>

529
00:51:33,192 --> 00:51:35,695
<i>... that would one day need an answer.</i>

530
00:51:45,622 --> 00:51:46,956
Another doll.

531
00:51:47,123 --> 00:51:49,292
I have dozens, you realize.

532
00:51:50,209 --> 00:51:52,420
I thought you could use one more.

533
00:51:53,212 --> 00:51:55,298
Why always on this night?

534
00:51:56,466 --> 00:51:57,967
What do you mean?

535
00:51:58,134 --> 00:52:01,304
You always give me a doll on
the same night of the year.

536
00:52:03,056 --> 00:52:04,724
I didn't realize.

537
00:52:04,932 --> 00:52:06,726
Is this my birthday?

538
00:52:11,147 --> 00:52:13,149
You dress me like a doll.

539
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:15,568
You make my hair like a doll.

540
00:52:15,652 --> 00:52:16,653
Why?

541
00:52:17,236 --> 00:52:20,448
Some of these, Claudia, are so old...

542
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:22,241
...tattered.

543
00:52:23,451 --> 00:52:26,329
- You should throw them away.
- I will, then!

544
00:52:39,593 --> 00:52:41,178
What have you done?

545
00:52:41,345 --> 00:52:43,347
What you told me to do!

546
00:52:43,514 --> 00:52:46,475
- You leave a corpse here to rot?
- I wanted her!

547
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,978
- I wanted to be her!
- She's mad!

548
00:52:49,103 --> 00:52:51,772
She pollutes the very house we live in!

549
00:52:52,773 --> 00:52:55,693
Do you want me to be a doll forever?

550
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,028
Don't!

551
00:52:58,195 --> 00:53:00,364
Why not? Can't I change...

552
00:53:00,531 --> 00:53:02,157
...like everyone else?

553
00:53:28,392 --> 00:53:30,311
Which one of you did it?

554
00:53:30,894 --> 00:53:32,896
Which one of you did it?

555
00:53:33,063 --> 00:53:35,733
Which one of you made me the way I am?

556
00:53:35,899 --> 00:53:37,318
What you are?

557
00:53:37,526 --> 00:53:40,904
A vampire gone insane,
that pollutes its own bed!

558
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:42,907
And if I cut my hair again?

559
00:53:43,033 --> 00:53:44,909
It will grow back again.

560
00:53:45,076 --> 00:53:46,745
But it wasn't always so!

561
00:53:46,828 --> 00:53:49,581
I had a mother once.
And Louis, he had a wife.

562
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,916
He was mortal, same as she.

563
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:53,918
And so was I!

564
00:53:54,169 --> 00:53:55,837
You made us what we are!

565
00:53:56,087 --> 00:53:57,422
Stop her.

566
00:53:57,547 --> 00:53:59,132
Did you do it to me?

567
00:54:06,181 --> 00:54:07,599
How did you do it?

568
00:54:07,766 --> 00:54:09,934
And why should I tell you?

569
00:54:10,602 --> 00:54:12,562
It's in my power.

570
00:54:13,188 --> 00:54:14,939
Why yours alone?

571
00:54:15,106 --> 00:54:16,858
Tell me how it was done!

572
00:54:17,192 --> 00:54:18,443
Be glad...

573
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:20,695
...I made you what you are.

574
00:54:22,072 --> 00:54:24,115
You'd be dead now if I hadn't.

575
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:27,118
Like that damned corpse!
Now get rid of it!

576
00:54:27,452 --> 00:54:29,287
You get rid of it.

577
00:54:40,465 --> 00:54:41,967
Louis, why?

578
00:54:42,217 --> 00:54:44,219
You've got to tell me.

579
00:54:50,642 --> 00:54:52,394
You see the old woman?

580
00:54:53,478 --> 00:54:55,481
That will never happen to you.

581
00:54:56,482 --> 00:54:58,317
You will never grow old.

582
00:54:58,985 --> 00:55:00,736
And you will never die.

583
00:55:02,321 --> 00:55:05,908
And it means something else too,
doesn't it?

584
00:55:09,495 --> 00:55:11,914
I shall never, ever grow up.

585
00:55:16,919 --> 00:55:18,337
I hate him.

586
00:55:20,673 --> 00:55:24,135
Tell me how it came to be that I am this...

587
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,137
...thing.

588
00:55:32,184 --> 00:55:35,187
<i>For thirty years I'd avoided that place.</i>

589
00:55:36,689 --> 00:55:39,191
<i>Yet I found my way back there...</i>

590
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:42,153
<i>... with hardly an upward glance.</i>

591
00:55:57,793 --> 00:55:59,045
You...

592
00:55:59,211 --> 00:56:00,880
...fed on me?

593
00:56:01,297 --> 00:56:02,465
Yes.

594
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,219
And he found me with you.

595
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,725
Then he cut his wrist
and fed you from him...

596
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:14,186
...and you were a vampire then...

597
00:56:14,394 --> 00:56:16,897
...and have been every night thereafter.

598
00:56:20,233 --> 00:56:21,985
You both did it.

599
00:56:22,694 --> 00:56:24,404
I took your life.

600
00:56:26,907 --> 00:56:28,825
He gave you another one.

601
00:56:30,577 --> 00:56:32,412
And here it is.

602
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:34,331
I hate you both.

603
00:56:46,927 --> 00:56:48,762
<i>I walked all night.</i>

604
00:56:50,013 --> 00:56:52,349
<i>I walked as I walked years before...</i>

605
00:56:52,516 --> 00:56:55,852
<i>... when my mind swam with guilt
at the thought of killing.</i>

606
00:56:57,104 --> 00:57:01,358
<i>I thought of all the things
I'd done and couldn't undo.</i>

607
00:57:02,442 --> 00:57:04,861
<i>And I longed for one second's peace.</i>

608
00:57:14,287 --> 00:57:16,624
Locked together in hatred.

609
00:57:21,379 --> 00:57:23,548
But I can't hate you, Louis.

610
00:57:29,971 --> 00:57:31,889
Louis, my love.

611
00:57:33,766 --> 00:57:35,810
I was mortal till you...

612
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:39,647
...gave me your immortal kiss.

613
00:57:41,316 --> 00:57:44,485
You became my mother and my father.

614
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:48,406
And so I'm yours forever.

615
00:57:50,575 --> 00:57:53,161
But now it's time to end it, Louis.

616
00:57:54,662 --> 00:57:56,998
Now it's time to leave him.

617
00:58:00,793 --> 00:58:02,837
He will never let us go.

618
00:58:14,682 --> 00:58:15,850
Really?

619
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:30,866
What is it now? You irritate me.
Your very presence...

620
00:58:30,949 --> 00:58:32,117
...irritates me!

621
00:58:32,201 --> 00:58:33,619
Does it?

622
00:58:33,827 --> 00:58:37,122
I found someone who'll be a
vampire better than you both!

623
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:39,416
Is that supposed to frighten me?

624
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:43,462
You're spoiled,
because you're an only child.

625
00:58:44,046 --> 00:58:45,547
You need a brother.

626
00:58:46,382 --> 00:58:47,633
Or I do.

627
00:58:48,342 --> 00:58:50,135
I'm weary of you both.

628
00:58:50,844 --> 00:58:53,806
I suppose we could people
the world with vampires...

629
00:58:53,889 --> 00:58:55,557
...the three of us.

630
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,893
Oh, not you...

631
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,853
...my little Claudia.

632
00:59:00,354 --> 00:59:01,897
You're a liar.

633
00:59:02,856 --> 00:59:04,900
But you upset my plans.

634
00:59:05,985 --> 00:59:07,861
What plans?

635
00:59:08,737 --> 00:59:10,739
I came to make peace with you.

636
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,909
Even though you're the father of lies...

637
00:59:14,576 --> 00:59:16,996
...I want things to be as they were.

638
00:59:18,163 --> 00:59:19,915
Stop pestering me then.

639
00:59:23,502 --> 00:59:25,754
I must do more than that.

640
00:59:26,755 --> 00:59:28,799
I've brought a present for you.

641
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,761
Then I hope it's...

642
00:59:32,928 --> 00:59:34,638
...a beautiful woman...

643
00:59:35,097 --> 00:59:38,183
...with endowments you'll never possess.

644
00:59:41,604 --> 00:59:43,523
Why do you say such things?

645
00:59:52,449 --> 00:59:54,409
You haven't fed enough.

646
00:59:55,118 --> 00:59:57,037
I can tell by your color.

647
01:00:03,543 --> 01:00:05,045
Come and see.

648
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:23,730
Don't be angry with me.

649
01:00:23,855 --> 01:00:26,524
When I saw them,
I knew they were for you.

650
01:00:27,942 --> 01:00:29,110
Drunk...

651
01:00:29,944 --> 01:00:32,530
...on brandywine. A thimbleful.

652
01:00:41,373 --> 01:00:43,041
You certainly have...

653
01:00:43,249 --> 01:00:44,751
...outdone yourself.

654
01:00:46,544 --> 01:00:49,130
I promise I'll get rid of the bodies.

655
01:01:02,895 --> 01:01:04,772
We forgive each other then?

656
01:01:06,273 --> 01:01:07,483
Yes.

657
01:01:22,999 --> 01:01:24,292
Absinthe?

658
01:01:27,003 --> 01:01:28,921
You've given them absinthe?

659
01:01:29,297 --> 01:01:30,298
No.

660
01:01:30,673 --> 01:01:31,799
Laudanum.

661
01:01:33,301 --> 01:01:34,385
Laudanum.

662
01:01:34,593 --> 01:01:35,594
Yes.

663
01:01:36,178 --> 01:01:38,347
It killed them, unfortunately.

664
01:01:39,015 --> 01:01:41,100
But it keeps the blood warm.

665
01:01:45,354 --> 01:01:46,856
You let me drink...

666
01:01:48,816 --> 01:01:50,443
...dead blood?

667
01:01:50,943 --> 01:01:52,695
You let me...

668
01:01:52,862 --> 01:01:54,071
...drink...

669
01:01:55,114 --> 01:01:57,325
One lesson you taught me...

670
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,410
...never drink from the dead.

671
01:02:02,331 --> 01:02:04,207
Put me in my coffin.

672
01:02:04,541 --> 01:02:06,043
Put me in my coffin.

673
01:02:06,126 --> 01:02:08,045
I'll put you in your coffin!

674
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:14,134
My God!

675
01:02:31,652 --> 01:02:33,153
Lift me up!

676
01:02:47,918 --> 01:02:49,753
Good night, sweet prince.

677
01:02:51,505 --> 01:02:55,175
May flights of devils wing you to your rest.

678
01:02:56,885 --> 01:02:58,595
Should we burn him?

679
01:02:58,762 --> 01:03:00,013
Bury him?

680
01:03:00,263 --> 01:03:02,099
What would he have liked?

681
01:03:06,103 --> 01:03:07,270
The swamp?

682
01:03:30,712 --> 01:03:32,714
He belongs with those reptiles.

683
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:37,051
He deserved to die.

684
01:03:38,136 --> 01:03:41,055
Then perhaps so do we,
every night of our lives.

685
01:03:44,475 --> 01:03:46,311
He was my maker.

686
01:03:47,312 --> 01:03:48,980
He gave me this life...

687
01:03:49,147 --> 01:03:50,732
...whatever it is.

688
01:03:53,818 --> 01:03:56,070
It shouldn't have been this way.

689
01:03:56,321 --> 01:03:57,697
I did it for us.

690
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,159
So we could be free.

691
01:04:07,498 --> 01:04:08,833
You missed him?

692
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:12,086
He was all I knew.

693
01:04:12,253 --> 01:04:13,963
It's as simple as that.

694
01:04:15,006 --> 01:04:17,842
We were like two orphans
learning to live again.

695
01:04:20,094 --> 01:04:22,096
We booked a passage to Europe.

696
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:25,684
<i>Over the weeks,
while waiting for the boat...</i>

697
01:04:25,768 --> 01:04:29,355
<i>... she studied the myths and
legends of the Old World...</i>

698
01:04:29,521 --> 01:04:32,858
<i>... obsessed with the search of
what she called "our kind."</i>

699
01:04:47,373 --> 01:04:49,124
Look who we forgot.

700
01:04:53,504 --> 01:04:55,214
Let's set them free.

701
01:04:56,507 --> 01:04:57,716
- Yes.
- Yes.

702
01:05:03,138 --> 01:05:04,807
It's the carriage.

703
01:05:51,354 --> 01:05:53,064
Listen, Louis...

704
01:05:54,858 --> 01:05:56,443
...there's life...

705
01:05:56,609 --> 01:05:58,778
...in these old hands still.

706
01:06:01,614 --> 01:06:03,867
<i>Not quite furioso.</i>

707
01:06:06,619 --> 01:06:07,954
<i>Moderato...</i>

708
01:06:09,205 --> 01:06:10,874
<i>...cantabile, perhaps.</i>

709
01:06:11,374 --> 01:06:13,126
How could it be?

710
01:06:13,376 --> 01:06:15,211
Ask the alligator.

711
01:06:15,962 --> 01:06:17,797
His blood helped.

712
01:06:20,133 --> 01:06:23,887
Then, on a diet of the blood of snakes...

713
01:06:24,638 --> 01:06:25,805
...toads...

714
01:06:27,974 --> 01:06:30,393
...and all the putrid life...

715
01:06:30,644 --> 01:06:32,395
...of the Mississippi...

716
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:35,106
...slowly...

717
01:06:36,316 --> 01:06:38,735
...Lestat became something...

718
01:06:38,985 --> 01:06:40,820
...like himself again.

719
01:06:45,742 --> 01:06:47,243
You've been...

720
01:06:47,827 --> 01:06:49,413
...a very...

721
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:51,123
...very...

722
01:06:51,248 --> 01:06:52,958
...naughty little girl.

723
01:07:55,229 --> 01:07:57,398
The ship is sailing without us!

724
01:08:17,002 --> 01:08:19,212
<i>Though the fire seemed to spread...</i>

725
01:08:19,755 --> 01:08:23,717
<i>... I stood on that deck,
fearful, he would come out again...</i>

726
01:08:23,842 --> 01:08:26,845
<i>... from the river like some monster,
to destroy us.</i>

727
01:08:28,013 --> 01:08:30,098
<i>And all the while I thought...</i>

728
01:08:30,599 --> 01:08:31,725
<i>"Lestat...</i>

729
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:34,019
<i>"...we deserve your vengeance.</i>

730
01:08:34,936 --> 01:08:37,022
<i>"You gave me the 'dark gift'...</i>

731
01:08:37,522 --> 01:08:41,735
<i>"...and I delivered you into the
hands of Death for the second time. "</i>

732
01:08:58,669 --> 01:09:02,172
<i>Though the ship was
blessedly free of rats...</i>

733
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:06,176
<i>... a strange plague nonetheless
struck its passengers.</i>

734
01:09:07,594 --> 01:09:10,097
<i>Claudia and I alone seemed immune.</i>

735
01:09:11,683 --> 01:09:13,768
<i>We kept to ourselves...</i>

736
01:09:13,935 --> 01:09:16,521
<i>... pondering the mystery of each other.</i>

737
01:09:19,273 --> 01:09:21,025
We reached the Mediterranean.

738
01:09:21,109 --> 01:09:25,113
I wanted those waters to be blue...
but they were black...

739
01:09:25,446 --> 01:09:27,031
<i>... night-time waters.</i>

740
01:09:27,115 --> 01:09:29,117
<i>And how I suffered then...</i>

741
01:09:29,534 --> 01:09:33,454
<i>... straining to recall the color
that in my youth I took for granted.</i>

742
01:09:39,794 --> 01:09:42,046
<i>We searched village after village...</i>

743
01:09:42,213 --> 01:09:43,715
<i>... ruin after ruin...</i>

744
01:09:43,798 --> 01:09:45,633
<i>... country after country.</i>

745
01:09:45,967 --> 01:09:48,052
<i>And always we found nothing.</i>

746
01:09:50,471 --> 01:09:53,975
I began to believe we were the only ones.

747
01:09:55,393 --> 01:09:58,229
There was a strange
comfort in that thought.

748
01:09:58,563 --> 01:10:02,317
For what could the damned really
have to say to the damned?

749
01:10:04,152 --> 01:10:05,570
You found nothing?

750
01:10:05,653 --> 01:10:07,071
Peasant rumors...

751
01:10:07,572 --> 01:10:09,657
...superstitions about garlic...

752
01:10:09,824 --> 01:10:11,075
...crosses...

753
01:10:11,242 --> 01:10:13,411
...the old stake in the heart.

754
01:10:14,495 --> 01:10:16,414
But one of our kind?

755
01:10:16,581 --> 01:10:17,915
Not a whisper.

756
01:10:19,751 --> 01:10:23,922
There are no vampires in Transylvania?
No Count Dracula?

757
01:10:24,089 --> 01:10:25,633
Fictions, my friend.

758
01:10:25,841 --> 01:10:28,218
The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman.

759
01:10:29,762 --> 01:10:30,763
<i>Paris...</i>

760
01:10:30,929 --> 01:10:32,598
<i>... September, 1870.</i>

761
01:10:33,682 --> 01:10:35,851
<i>The city I'd always dreamed of.</i>

762
01:10:36,435 --> 01:10:40,606
<i>I was Creole, after all,
and Paris was the mother of New Orleans.</i>

763
01:10:41,273 --> 01:10:44,693
<i>A universe whole and entire unto herself.</i>

764
01:11:19,561 --> 01:11:21,563
<i>We were alive again.</i>

765
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:23,399
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

766
01:11:23,565 --> 01:11:27,903
<i>And so euphoric was I
that I yielded to her every desire.</i>

767
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,002
<i>So it was...</i>

768
01:11:42,168 --> 01:11:45,171
<i>... when I'd given up the
search for vampires...</i>

769
01:11:45,338 --> 01:11:47,674
<i>... that a vampire found me.</i>

770
01:13:17,348 --> 01:13:18,766
Buffoon!

771
01:13:20,351 --> 01:13:21,602
Santiago!

772
01:13:29,443 --> 01:13:34,031
I've searched the world for an
immortal and this is what I find!

773
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:52,550
<i>Bring the petite beauty with you.</i>

774
01:13:53,884 --> 01:13:55,469
No one will harm you.

775
01:13:55,553 --> 01:13:56,972
I won't allow it.

776
01:13:59,725 --> 01:14:00,976
And...

777
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:03,061
...remember my name:

778
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,231
Armand.

779
01:14:14,323 --> 01:14:16,158
<i>Remember what I told you.</i>

780
01:14:16,325 --> 01:14:20,245
<i>They have different powers.
They'll read your thoughts.</i>

781
01:14:33,008 --> 01:14:35,177
He's the one, that's the vampire.

782
01:14:36,762 --> 01:14:38,263
Two lovers...

783
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:41,516
...wandering down their violet way...

784
01:14:42,351 --> 01:14:45,520
...whose passionate embraces,
each to each...

785
01:14:45,854 --> 01:14:49,274
...permit no meditations on decay...

786
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,278
...until they find themselves...

787
01:14:53,362 --> 01:14:54,946
...within my reach!

788
01:15:01,453 --> 01:15:05,123
Vampires who pretend to be humans
pretending to be vampires.

789
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,875
How avant-garde.

790
01:15:07,042 --> 01:15:10,463
The monk whose soul with
Heaven doth commune...

791
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:13,049
...and spends his days...

792
01:15:13,132 --> 01:15:15,635
...in pious contemplation...

793
01:15:18,054 --> 01:15:21,891
...finds he will meet his Maker all too soon.

794
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:26,312
For all his prayers gets no remuneration.

795
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:33,319
The lesson endeth here...

796
01:15:33,736 --> 01:15:35,488
...and it is this:

797
01:15:36,322 --> 01:15:40,076
Each one of you,
my clammy hands must touch.

798
01:15:41,661 --> 01:15:45,164
Each one must bend his
forehead to my kiss.

799
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,918
But, hark!

800
01:15:49,502 --> 01:15:51,754
Methinks a mortal doth approach!

801
01:15:55,008 --> 01:15:56,926
What have we here?

802
01:15:57,677 --> 01:15:59,762
What beauty by my side?

803
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:03,766
A rose in bloom, a shrinking violet?

804
01:16:05,518 --> 01:16:08,271
Perhaps she has a mind to be my bride.

805
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:11,357
Perhaps my lesson has not ended yet!

806
01:16:13,693 --> 01:16:15,445
I don't want to die!

807
01:16:15,611 --> 01:16:18,197
But Death we are and have always been.

808
01:16:18,364 --> 01:16:19,783
Someone help me!

809
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:21,618
Please!

810
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:33,631
- What have I done?
- We all die!

811
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:35,132
But I'm young!

812
01:16:35,215 --> 01:16:39,637
Death is no respecter of age!
It can come any time, any place.

813
01:16:53,233 --> 01:16:56,070
Just as this flesh is pink now...

814
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:59,490
...so it will turn gray and wrinkle with age.

815
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:01,492
Let me live! I don't care!

816
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:04,244
Then why should you care if you die now?

817
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:08,332
And suppose Death had a heart
to love and to release you?

818
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:11,001
To whom would he turn his passion?

819
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:14,004
Would you choose a person
from the crowd there?

820
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,006
A person to suffer as you do?

821
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:17,925
<i>Monsieur Vampire, take me!</i>

822
01:17:18,092 --> 01:17:20,010
I adore you!

823
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,930
You wait your turn!

824
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:25,349
Well...

825
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:30,104
Do you know what it means
to be loved by Death?

826
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:34,359
To become our bride?

827
01:18:34,252 --> 01:18:35,754
No pain.

828
01:18:40,342 --> 01:18:41,843
No pain.

829
01:18:54,607 --> 01:18:56,025
Monstrous.

830
01:19:45,574 --> 01:19:47,326
We live beneath.

831
01:19:47,827 --> 01:19:49,412
Let me show you.

832
01:19:55,419 --> 01:19:57,004
Monstrous.

833
01:19:57,921 --> 01:19:59,339
Yes.

834
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:02,259
But very beautiful.

835
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:25,532
Welcome to my home.

836
01:20:40,547 --> 01:20:41,965
Try him.

837
01:21:04,655 --> 01:21:06,407
Two vampires...

838
01:21:07,408 --> 01:21:09,327
...from the New World...

839
01:21:10,161 --> 01:21:12,830
...come to guide us into the new era...

840
01:21:13,331 --> 01:21:15,500
...as all we love slowly rots...

841
01:21:16,834 --> 01:21:18,586
...and fades away.

842
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:21,923
Are you the leader of this group?

843
01:21:22,423 --> 01:21:24,342
If there were a leader...

844
01:21:24,842 --> 01:21:26,511
...I would be the one.

845
01:21:26,594 --> 01:21:29,472
- So you have the answers?
- So you have questions?

846
01:21:32,183 --> 01:21:33,601
What are we?

847
01:21:35,645 --> 01:21:36,980
Nothing...

848
01:21:37,605 --> 01:21:39,524
...if not vampires.

849
01:21:42,944 --> 01:21:44,862
Who made us what we are?

850
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:47,532
Surely you know the one who made you?

851
01:21:47,615 --> 01:21:49,701
Yes, but the one who made him?

852
01:21:50,368 --> 01:21:51,619
The source...

853
01:21:51,703 --> 01:21:53,121
...of all this...

854
01:21:54,038 --> 01:21:55,123
...evil.

855
01:21:57,291 --> 01:21:58,543
I understand.

856
01:22:00,211 --> 01:22:02,213
I saw you in the theater.

857
01:22:03,798 --> 01:22:05,717
Your suffering...

858
01:22:07,468 --> 01:22:09,554
...your sympathy for that girl.

859
01:22:11,389 --> 01:22:12,724
You die...

860
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:14,559
...when you kill.

861
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:19,315
You feel you deserve to die
and you stint on nothing.

862
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:23,068
But does that make you evil?

863
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:27,990
Since you comprehend what you call
goodness, doesn't that make you...

864
01:22:28,073 --> 01:22:29,158
...good?

865
01:22:29,825 --> 01:22:31,577
Then there is nothing?

866
01:22:31,994 --> 01:22:33,662
Perhaps.

867
01:22:35,331 --> 01:22:36,999
But perhaps...

868
01:22:38,751 --> 01:22:40,252
...this...

869
01:22:40,669 --> 01:22:43,172
...is the only real evil left.

870
01:22:44,423 --> 01:22:46,759
Then God does not exist?

871
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:49,386
I know nothing of God.

872
01:22:50,387 --> 01:22:51,722
Or the Devil.

873
01:22:52,222 --> 01:22:56,226
I have never seen a vision,
nor learned a secret...

874
01:22:56,393 --> 01:22:59,396
...that would damn or save my soul.

875
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:02,733
As far as I know...

876
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,069
...after 400 years...

877
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:07,571
...I am the oldest...

878
01:23:07,863 --> 01:23:09,740
...living vampire...

879
01:23:09,907 --> 01:23:11,367
...in the world.

880
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:15,371
Then it's as I always feared.

881
01:23:24,046 --> 01:23:25,923
You fear too much.

882
01:23:28,259 --> 01:23:30,261
So much you make me fear...

883
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,560
The one who made you...

884
01:23:38,103 --> 01:23:40,105
...should have told you this.

885
01:23:41,398 --> 01:23:44,234
The one who left the Old
World for the New...

886
01:23:44,401 --> 01:23:45,860
He knew nothing.

887
01:23:45,944 --> 01:23:47,612
Nor did he care.

888
01:23:47,779 --> 01:23:48,780
Knew?

889
01:23:48,947 --> 01:23:50,281
Come, beloved.

890
01:23:51,282 --> 01:23:53,410
It's time we were on our way.

891
01:23:53,493 --> 01:23:54,577
I'm hungry...

892
01:23:54,661 --> 01:23:55,745
...and the city awaits.

893
01:23:57,789 --> 01:24:00,417
<i>The place was empty as we left.</i>

894
01:24:00,625 --> 01:24:02,419
<i>Silent as the grave.</i>

895
01:24:02,585 --> 01:24:06,089
<i>And as we blundered through it,
again came the thought:</i>

896
01:24:06,256 --> 01:24:08,425
<i>"I have wronged Lestat.</i>

897
01:24:08,591 --> 01:24:10,844
<i>"I have hated him for the wrong reasons."</i>

898
01:24:10,927 --> 01:24:12,554
How did you wrong him?

899
01:24:14,764 --> 01:24:16,141
You said a name.

900
01:24:16,433 --> 01:24:18,977
Yes, a name I don't care to say again.

901
01:24:19,269 --> 01:24:21,146
There is but one crime...

902
01:24:21,313 --> 01:24:23,273
...among us vampires here.

903
01:24:24,482 --> 01:24:27,986
It is the crime that means
death to any vampire:

904
01:24:29,654 --> 01:24:31,614
To kill your own kind.

905
01:24:35,785 --> 01:24:38,997
- Do you think I'd let them harm you?
- No, you would not.

906
01:24:39,164 --> 01:24:40,833
Danger holds you to me.

907
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,543
Love holds you to me.

908
01:24:42,626 --> 01:24:44,170
- Love?
- Love.

909
01:24:44,337 --> 01:24:47,465
You would leave me for Armand
if he beckoned you.

910
01:24:48,174 --> 01:24:49,342
Never.

911
01:24:49,508 --> 01:24:52,970
He wants you as you want him.
He's been waiting for you.

912
01:24:53,137 --> 01:24:55,473
He wants you as a companion.

913
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:57,516
He bides his time there.

914
01:24:57,850 --> 01:25:00,478
He finds it as dull and lifeless as we do.

915
01:25:00,645 --> 01:25:01,687
Perhaps.

916
01:25:02,021 --> 01:25:06,025
Do you know what his soul said to me
without saying a word?

917
01:25:07,193 --> 01:25:09,153
"Let him go," he said.

918
01:25:09,695 --> 01:25:11,322
"Let him go."

919
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,493
Is that what I should do?

920
01:25:16,661 --> 01:25:18,329
Let you go?

921
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:20,706
My father...

922
01:25:20,873 --> 01:25:22,333
...my Louis...

923
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,043
...who made me?

924
01:25:25,878 --> 01:25:27,713
It will be all right.

925
01:25:28,881 --> 01:25:30,841
You really believe that?

926
01:25:38,849 --> 01:25:39,976
The soldier...

927
01:25:40,059 --> 01:25:42,228
...on returning from the war...

928
01:25:42,395 --> 01:25:46,065
...thinks victory has enured
him against sorrow...

929
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:48,359
...till Death comes by...

930
01:25:48,734 --> 01:25:50,820
...and chops him from his horse.

931
01:25:57,035 --> 01:25:58,870
I was waiting for you.

932
01:26:01,373 --> 01:26:02,749
Listen to me.

933
01:26:05,252 --> 01:26:07,713
Claudia is very dear to me.

934
01:26:08,046 --> 01:26:09,297
She's my daughter.

935
01:26:09,381 --> 01:26:10,882
Your lover.

936
01:26:11,717 --> 01:26:13,093
No, my beloved.

937
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:14,720
My child.

938
01:26:16,221 --> 01:26:18,265
You say so. You're innocent.

939
01:26:19,391 --> 01:26:21,393
She's in danger, isn't she?

940
01:26:21,601 --> 01:26:22,853
- She is.
- Why?

941
01:26:25,731 --> 01:26:28,066
<i>I could give you reasons.</i>

942
01:26:29,234 --> 01:26:31,111
<i>Her silence.</i>

943
01:26:31,945 --> 01:26:33,405
<i>Her youth.</i>

944
01:26:34,906 --> 01:26:37,576
<i>It's forbidden to make one so young...</i>

945
01:26:38,076 --> 01:26:39,953
<i>... so helpless...</i>

946
01:26:40,287 --> 01:26:42,581
<i>... that cannot survive on its own.</i>

947
01:26:42,748 --> 01:26:44,541
<i>Then blame the one who made her.</i>

948
01:26:44,624 --> 01:26:46,835
Did you kill this vampire
who made you both?

949
01:26:46,918 --> 01:26:48,545
Is that why you won't say his name?

950
01:26:48,628 --> 01:26:50,339
Santiago thinks you did.

951
01:26:50,422 --> 01:26:53,342
- We want no quarrel with him.
- It's already begun.

952
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,511
If you want to save her...

953
01:26:56,595 --> 01:26:59,097
...send her away!
- Then I leave too.

954
01:27:05,813 --> 01:27:07,315
So soon?

955
01:27:09,651 --> 01:27:12,987
Without any of those answers
you so longed for?

956
01:27:13,321 --> 01:27:14,530
You said there are none.

957
01:27:14,614 --> 01:27:16,824
But you asked the wrong questions.

958
01:27:32,632 --> 01:27:33,966
Do you know...

959
01:27:34,676 --> 01:27:36,678
...how few vampires...

960
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:40,348
...have the stamina for immortality?

961
01:27:42,308 --> 01:27:44,894
How quickly they perish of their own will.

962
01:27:49,023 --> 01:27:50,650
The world...

963
01:27:51,317 --> 01:27:52,819
...changes.

964
01:27:54,821 --> 01:27:56,364
We do not.

965
01:27:57,991 --> 01:27:59,993
Therein lies the irony...

966
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:02,203
...that finally kills us.

967
01:28:02,704 --> 01:28:06,165
I need you to make contact with this age.

968
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:07,834
Me?

969
01:28:08,668 --> 01:28:10,336
Don't you see?

970
01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:13,673
I'm not the spirit of any age.

971
01:28:14,508 --> 01:28:16,510
I'm at odds with everything.

972
01:28:16,677 --> 01:28:18,512
I always have been.

973
01:28:20,014 --> 01:28:22,891
That is the very spirit of your age.

974
01:28:24,226 --> 01:28:25,728
The heart of it.

975
01:28:27,396 --> 01:28:29,189
Your fall...

976
01:28:29,356 --> 01:28:31,191
...from grace...

977
01:28:31,358 --> 01:28:34,069
...has been the fall of a century.

978
01:28:35,195 --> 01:28:37,239
But the vampires in the theater?

979
01:28:39,074 --> 01:28:40,534
<i>Decadent...</i>

980
01:28:41,201 --> 01:28:42,703
<i>... useless.</i>

981
01:28:44,204 --> 01:28:46,415
They can't reflect anything.

982
01:28:47,082 --> 01:28:48,083
But...

983
01:28:48,542 --> 01:28:49,877
...you do.

984
01:28:52,087 --> 01:28:53,297
You reflect...

985
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:55,049
...its broken heart.

986
01:29:07,603 --> 01:29:09,396
A vampire...

987
01:29:10,773 --> 01:29:12,733
...with a human soul.

988
01:29:13,942 --> 01:29:16,904
An immortal with a mortal's passion.

989
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:20,407
You...

990
01:29:20,949 --> 01:29:22,284
...are...

991
01:29:23,786 --> 01:29:25,789
...beautiful, my friend.

992
01:29:28,124 --> 01:29:31,294
Lestat must have wept when he made you.

993
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,132
You knew Lestat?

994
01:29:38,927 --> 01:29:40,261
Yes.

995
01:29:41,471 --> 01:29:42,931
I knew him.

996
01:29:44,766 --> 01:29:48,103
Knew him well enough
not to mourn his passing.

997
01:29:50,814 --> 01:29:53,441
<i>I felt a kind of peace at last.</i>

998
01:29:53,984 --> 01:29:58,488
<i>I had found the teacher which Lestat
could never, I knew now, have been.</i>

999
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,325
<i>I knew knowledge would
never be withheld by Armand.</i>

1000
01:30:02,617 --> 01:30:06,121
<i>It would pass through him
as through a pane of glass.</i>

1001
01:30:21,011 --> 01:30:22,345
Madeleine...

1002
01:30:23,263 --> 01:30:24,931
...Louis is shy.

1003
01:30:40,614 --> 01:30:41,866
Drink.

1004
01:30:43,451 --> 01:30:44,702
Do it.

1005
01:30:44,869 --> 01:30:47,955
Because I cannot do it.
I haven't the strength.

1006
01:30:48,122 --> 01:30:52,460
- You saw to that when you made me.
- You don't know what you ask!

1007
01:30:54,712 --> 01:30:55,546
I have.

1008
01:30:55,629 --> 01:30:58,966
You have found your new companion!
You will make me mine!

1009
01:30:59,884 --> 01:31:01,552
How do we seem to you?

1010
01:31:02,470 --> 01:31:04,221
Do you find us beautiful?

1011
01:31:04,722 --> 01:31:06,057
Magical?

1012
01:31:06,724 --> 01:31:11,562
Our white skin, our fierce eyes?
Do you know the thing you will become?

1013
01:31:11,979 --> 01:31:14,482
Your evil is that you cannot be evil!

1014
01:31:14,649 --> 01:31:17,318
And I shall suffer for it no longer!

1015
01:31:17,652 --> 01:31:20,071
Don't make me do this! I cannot!

1016
01:31:20,488 --> 01:31:22,323
Yet, you could do it to me.

1017
01:31:22,657 --> 01:31:27,578
Snatching me from my mother's hands,
like two monsters in a fairy tale.

1018
01:31:28,245 --> 01:31:30,081
And now you weep!

1019
01:31:30,247 --> 01:31:33,167
I haven't tears enough
for what you've done to me!

1020
01:31:33,417 --> 01:31:35,503
You give her to me, Louis!

1021
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:38,172
Do this before you leave me!

1022
01:31:40,508 --> 01:31:41,592
Oh, God!

1023
01:31:42,343 --> 01:31:44,011
I love you still!

1024
01:31:44,679 --> 01:31:46,847
That's the torment of it!

1025
01:31:47,848 --> 01:31:49,851
Who'll care for me, my love...

1026
01:31:50,435 --> 01:31:53,355
...my dark angel, when you are gone?

1027
01:32:00,112 --> 01:32:02,698
What do you think she is, Madeleine?

1028
01:32:04,282 --> 01:32:05,701
A doll?

1029
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:10,539
A child who cannot die.

1030
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:13,792
And the child who did die?

1031
01:32:15,711 --> 01:32:17,212
My daughter.

1032
01:33:14,103 --> 01:33:15,688
What's happening to her?

1033
01:33:15,772 --> 01:33:17,273
She's dying.

1034
01:33:18,191 --> 01:33:20,193
It happened to you too...

1035
01:33:20,526 --> 01:33:23,196
...only you were too young to remember.

1036
01:33:25,114 --> 01:33:26,949
But if she dies?

1037
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:30,119
It's only mortal death.

1038
01:33:33,706 --> 01:33:36,125
Bear me no ill will, my love.

1039
01:33:38,961 --> 01:33:40,880
We are now even.

1040
01:33:42,048 --> 01:33:43,633
What do you mean?

1041
01:33:45,051 --> 01:33:48,388
What died in that room
was not that woman.

1042
01:33:52,058 --> 01:33:53,893
What has died is the...

1043
01:33:55,311 --> 01:33:57,313
...last breath in me...

1044
01:33:58,231 --> 01:34:00,066
...that was human.

1045
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,072
Yes, Father.

1046
01:34:07,073 --> 01:34:08,992
At last we are even.

1047
01:34:14,498 --> 01:34:17,418
It's time for justice, little one.

1048
01:34:34,184 --> 01:34:37,396
Get me Armand.
He wouldn't stand for this.

1049
01:34:37,563 --> 01:34:39,356
Death for the others.

1050
01:34:40,024 --> 01:34:41,358
For you...

1051
01:34:41,567 --> 01:34:43,861
...eternity in a box.

1052
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:46,905
Walled in a dungeon.

1053
01:34:47,072 --> 01:34:49,533
Your only company will be your screams.

1054
01:34:50,576 --> 01:34:52,870
Perhaps it will take centuries.

1055
01:34:54,538 --> 01:34:55,664
Take them!

1056
01:36:10,782 --> 01:36:12,659
Pleasant dreams.

1057
01:36:14,953 --> 01:36:16,871
No! No!

1058
01:36:17,956 --> 01:36:19,374
Help!

1059
01:36:55,202 --> 01:36:56,412
Wake up!

1060
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:04,856
Where's Claudia?

1061
01:38:05,607 --> 01:38:08,235
Claudia. I cannot help her.

1062
01:38:08,735 --> 01:38:11,238
- Where's Claudia?
- I can't save her!

1063
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:15,283
I will only risk losing you!

1064
01:38:17,494 --> 01:38:18,745
Don't!

1065
01:40:06,521 --> 01:40:07,855
Come, Louis.

1066
01:40:09,233 --> 01:40:10,609
Not here.

1067
01:40:19,118 --> 01:40:21,412
So a vampire can cry?

1068
01:40:23,622 --> 01:40:24,790
Once...

1069
01:40:25,124 --> 01:40:27,042
...maybe twice, in eternity.

1070
01:40:29,086 --> 01:40:32,798
And maybe it was to quench those tears
forever that I took such revenge.

1071
01:41:29,856 --> 01:41:32,484
Stop him! It's burning!

1072
01:41:32,651 --> 01:41:34,194
Get him! Stop him!

1073
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:42,114
You didn't even warn them, did you?

1074
01:43:44,117 --> 01:43:45,160
No.

1075
01:43:47,329 --> 01:43:49,623
And you knew what I would do.

1076
01:43:50,832 --> 01:43:52,167
I knew.

1077
01:43:52,626 --> 01:43:54,628
I rescued you, didn't I?

1078
01:43:54,795 --> 01:43:56,672
From the terrible dawn.

1079
01:44:01,009 --> 01:44:03,679
You were their leader. They trusted you.

1080
01:44:03,845 --> 01:44:04,846
No.

1081
01:44:05,972 --> 01:44:08,475
You made me see their failings, Louis.

1082
01:44:09,977 --> 01:44:11,311
They were...

1083
01:44:11,395 --> 01:44:14,231
...doomed, stuck in their decadent time.

1084
01:44:15,148 --> 01:44:17,693
They had forgotten the first lesson...

1085
01:44:17,985 --> 01:44:20,028
...that we must be powerful...

1086
01:44:20,195 --> 01:44:21,488
...beautiful...

1087
01:44:21,655 --> 01:44:23,365
...and without regret.

1088
01:44:24,324 --> 01:44:25,951
You can teach me this?

1089
01:44:26,034 --> 01:44:27,494
Yes.

1090
01:44:27,703 --> 01:44:29,705
To be without regret?

1091
01:44:31,873 --> 01:44:34,167
Then, what a pair we could make.

1092
01:44:36,878 --> 01:44:40,048
But what if it's a lesson
I don't care to learn?

1093
01:44:41,675 --> 01:44:42,676
What?

1094
01:44:43,051 --> 01:44:45,721
What if all I have is my suffering?

1095
01:44:46,013 --> 01:44:47,848
My regret?

1096
01:44:49,516 --> 01:44:51,393
Don't you want to lose it?

1097
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,562
So you can have that too?

1098
01:44:54,397 --> 01:44:56,524
The heart that mourns her...

1099
01:44:57,025 --> 01:44:59,193
...whom you burnt to a cinder?

1100
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:00,903
I swear I didn't...

1101
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:02,697
But I know you did.

1102
01:45:03,573 --> 01:45:04,866
I know...

1103
01:45:06,367 --> 01:45:07,535
...you...

1104
01:45:08,202 --> 01:45:09,912
...regret nothing.

1105
01:45:11,873 --> 01:45:13,416
You feel...

1106
01:45:14,042 --> 01:45:15,209
...nothing.

1107
01:45:17,211 --> 01:45:19,756
If that's all I have left to learn...

1108
01:45:21,382 --> 01:45:23,384
...I can do that on my own.

1109
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:35,104
I will die.

1110
01:45:35,271 --> 01:45:36,022
No.

1111
01:45:36,105 --> 01:45:37,565
You are dead.

1112
01:45:37,732 --> 01:45:40,443
And you want me to quicken you
once more.

1113
01:45:42,779 --> 01:45:46,407
And as much as your invitation
might appeal to me...

1114
01:45:47,784 --> 01:45:49,619
...I must regretfully...

1115
01:45:49,952 --> 01:45:51,120
...decline.

1116
01:46:03,966 --> 01:46:06,095
<i>For years I wandered:</i>

1117
01:46:06,261 --> 01:46:07,971
<i>Italy, Greece...</i>

1118
01:46:08,597 --> 01:46:10,641
<i>... all the ancient lands.</i>

1119
01:46:10,974 --> 01:46:13,435
<i>But the world was a tomb to me...</i>

1120
01:46:13,602 --> 01:46:16,271
<i>... a graveyard full of broken statues.</i>

1121
01:46:16,981 --> 01:46:20,567
<i>And each of those statues
resembled her face.</i>

1122
01:46:26,490 --> 01:46:28,242
<i>Then, out of curiosity...</i>

1123
01:46:28,409 --> 01:46:30,369
<i>... boredom, who knows what...</i>

1124
01:46:30,577 --> 01:46:32,162
<i>... I left the Old World...</i>

1125
01:46:32,246 --> 01:46:34,498
<i>... and came back to my America.</i>

1126
01:46:37,668 --> 01:46:41,922
<i>And there a mechanical wonder
allowed me to see the sunrise...</i>

1127
01:46:42,089 --> 01:46:43,924
<i>... for the first time...</i>

1128
01:46:44,091 --> 01:46:45,926
<i>... in 200 years.</i>

1129
01:46:47,177 --> 01:46:48,929
<i>And what sunrises!</i>

1130
01:46:49,596 --> 01:46:52,516
<i>Seen as the human eye
could never see them.</i>

1131
01:46:53,350 --> 01:46:55,102
<i>Silver at first...</i>

1132
01:46:55,853 --> 01:46:59,023
<i>... then, as the years progressed,
in tones of purple...</i>

1133
01:46:59,106 --> 01:47:00,274
<i>... red...</i>

1134
01:47:00,441 --> 01:47:02,860
<i>... and my long-lost blue.</i>

1135
01:47:07,531 --> 01:47:10,868
<i>In the spring of 1988,
I returned to New Orleans.</i>

1136
01:47:11,785 --> 01:47:15,372
<i>And as soon as I smelled the air,
I knew I was home.</i>

1137
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:17,876
<i>It was rich...</i>

1138
01:47:18,043 --> 01:47:19,711
<i>... almost sweet...</i>

1139
01:47:19,878 --> 01:47:24,049
<i>... like the fragrance of jasmine
and roses around our old courtyard.</i>

1140
01:47:25,383 --> 01:47:29,888
<i>I walked the streets savoring
that long-lost perfume.</i>

1141
01:47:35,226 --> 01:47:37,312
<i>And then on Prytania Street...</i>

1142
01:47:37,479 --> 01:47:40,565
<i>... only blocks from the
Lafayette cemetery...</i>

1143
01:47:40,732 --> 01:47:42,901
<i>... I caught the scent of death.</i>

1144
01:47:43,485 --> 01:47:45,987
<i>And it wasn't coming from the graves.</i>

1145
01:47:47,572 --> 01:47:50,325
<i>The scent grew stronger as I walked.</i>

1146
01:47:50,492 --> 01:47:52,077
<i>Old death.</i>

1147
01:47:52,410 --> 01:47:55,080
<i>A scent too faint for mortals to detect.</i>

1148
01:49:27,214 --> 01:49:29,467
I'm so glad you are here!

1149
01:49:30,134 --> 01:49:31,719
I've dreamed...

1150
01:49:32,553 --> 01:49:34,388
...of this moment.

1151
01:49:35,973 --> 01:49:38,392
She never should have been one of...

1152
01:49:38,976 --> 01:49:40,395
...us.

1153
01:49:40,729 --> 01:49:42,731
That's all past, Lestat.

1154
01:49:47,319 --> 01:49:48,820
Past.

1155
01:50:12,177 --> 01:50:14,346
Still beautiful, Louis.

1156
01:50:17,015 --> 01:50:19,518
You always were the strong one.

1157
01:50:23,689 --> 01:50:25,357
Don't be frightened.

1158
01:50:29,444 --> 01:50:31,363
I mean you no harm.

1159
01:50:35,033 --> 01:50:37,119
You've come home to me then?

1160
01:50:41,623 --> 01:50:44,042
You remember how I was?

1161
01:50:46,044 --> 01:50:47,713
The vampire...

1162
01:50:47,879 --> 01:50:49,715
...that I was?

1163
01:50:50,799 --> 01:50:52,468
Yes, I remember.

1164
01:50:58,891 --> 01:51:00,059
No one...

1165
01:51:00,226 --> 01:51:01,978
...could refuse me...

1166
01:51:03,479 --> 01:51:04,897
...not even you.

1167
01:51:06,482 --> 01:51:07,900
I tried.

1168
01:51:08,568 --> 01:51:10,403
Yes, you tried.

1169
01:51:11,738 --> 01:51:13,740
And the more you tried...

1170
01:51:17,910 --> 01:51:19,829
...the more I wanted you.

1171
01:51:30,173 --> 01:51:31,924
I can't bear it.

1172
01:51:34,344 --> 01:51:35,762
Such lights...

1173
01:51:37,347 --> 01:51:39,015
...and that noise!

1174
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:43,603
They make the night brighter than the day.

1175
01:51:51,944 --> 01:51:53,863
It's false light.

1176
01:51:54,113 --> 01:51:55,865
It can't harm you.

1177
01:52:07,127 --> 01:52:09,713
If you stay with me, Louis...

1178
01:52:11,131 --> 01:52:13,092
...I could venture out again.

1179
01:52:16,053 --> 01:52:18,138
Become the old Lestat.

1180
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:21,475
I must leave now.

1181
01:52:49,586 --> 01:52:52,256
Whatever happened to Lestat,
I do not know.

1182
01:52:53,590 --> 01:52:55,009
I go on...

1183
01:52:55,175 --> 01:52:56,927
...night after night.

1184
01:52:57,094 --> 01:52:59,596
I feed on those who cross my path.

1185
01:53:02,266 --> 01:53:05,519
But all my passion went
with her golden hair.

1186
01:53:08,605 --> 01:53:11,608
I'm a spirit of preternatural flesh.

1187
01:53:12,776 --> 01:53:14,446
Detached.

1188
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:16,614
Unchangeable.

1189
01:53:19,534 --> 01:53:20,785
Empty.

1190
01:53:21,870 --> 01:53:23,038
Empty?

1191
01:53:23,538 --> 01:53:24,706
That's it?

1192
01:53:26,958 --> 01:53:28,877
No, it can't end like that.

1193
01:53:30,462 --> 01:53:31,963
But it has.

1194
01:53:32,130 --> 01:53:33,882
There's no more to tell.

1195
01:53:34,799 --> 01:53:39,554
There must be more to tell. You don't
understand yourself. You're not empty.

1196
01:53:40,221 --> 01:53:43,475
What I wouldn't give to be like you,
to have your power...

1197
01:53:43,558 --> 01:53:45,977
...to have seen the things you have seen.

1198
01:53:46,061 --> 01:53:47,479
You haven't been listening.

1199
01:53:47,562 --> 01:53:50,398
I have been listening.
Your story is incredible.

1200
01:53:50,482 --> 01:53:52,525
- It's amazing.
- Do what you want with it.

1201
01:53:52,609 --> 01:53:55,028
Give it to others. Learn what you can.

1202
01:53:55,403 --> 01:53:59,074
There's only one way I'll truly learn
and you know it.

1203
01:53:59,324 --> 01:54:01,910
You brought me here for a reason.

1204
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:03,244
Didn't you?

1205
01:54:03,328 --> 01:54:05,080
What reason would that be?

1206
01:54:05,246 --> 01:54:09,250
You want a companion. You want a link
to the outside world. That's me.

1207
01:54:09,417 --> 01:54:11,795
Take me. That's what I want.

1208
01:54:11,878 --> 01:54:15,215
- I refuse to let it end like this.
- God, I've failed again.

1209
01:54:15,674 --> 01:54:18,677
You haven't failed.
God has nothing to do with it.

1210
01:54:21,763 --> 01:54:23,181
Do you like this?

1211
01:54:24,015 --> 01:54:26,936
Do you like being food for the immortals?

1212
01:54:27,687 --> 01:54:29,021
Do you like dying?

1213
01:54:29,105 --> 01:54:30,189
Stop!

1214
01:55:37,924 --> 01:55:40,510
<i>1791 was the year it happened.</i>

1215
01:55:40,677 --> 01:55:43,930
<i>I was 24. Younger than you are now.</i>

1216
01:55:44,765 --> 01:55:47,851
<i>But times were different then.
I was a man at that age.</i>

1217
01:55:47,934 --> 01:55:51,521
<i>The master of a large plantation,
just south of New Orleans.</i>

1218
01:55:52,773 --> 01:55:55,359
<i>I had lost my wife in childbirth.</i>

1219
01:55:55,525 --> 01:55:57,277
Someone change my shorts.

1220
01:55:57,361 --> 01:56:00,447
<i>She and the infant had been
buried less than half a year.</i>

1221
01:56:00,530 --> 01:56:01,281
It's good stuff.

1222
01:56:01,365 --> 01:56:02,783
<i>I would've been happy to join them.</i>

1223
01:56:02,866 --> 01:56:04,618
Good stuff.

1224
01:56:08,121 --> 01:56:10,374
I assume I need no introduction.

1225
01:56:24,888 --> 01:56:26,890
I feel better already.

1226
01:56:31,144 --> 01:56:33,981
<i>Most of all, I longed for death.</i>

1227
01:56:34,564 --> 01:56:36,149
<i>I invited it.</i>

1228
01:56:37,234 --> 01:56:39,820
<i>A release from the pain of living.</i>

1229
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:44,992
Still whining.

1230
01:56:47,661 --> 01:56:49,163
Heard enough?

1231
01:56:49,497 --> 01:56:52,041
I've had to listen to that for centuries.

1232
01:56:54,669 --> 01:56:56,045
Don't be afraid.

1233
01:56:58,506 --> 01:57:00,925
I'm going to give you the choice...

1234
01:57:01,843 --> 01:57:03,594
...I never had.

1235
02:02:10,238 --> 02:02:13,367
