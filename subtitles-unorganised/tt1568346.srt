1
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:33,399
- What kind is it?
- I dont know. - White?

2
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:37,282
- And the frame?
- Dark.

3
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:40,372
- Postmark?
- Same as last time.

4
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:44,253
- No note.
- No.

5
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:47,681
Im so sorry, Henrik.

00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:13,594

7
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:16,605
THE GIRL WITH
THE DRAGON TATTOO

8
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:27,469
What is this?
The media event of the year?

9
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:29,786
Dont try to play it down, Mikael,
it wont work.

10
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:31,823
Dont try to play it up,
that wont either.

11
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,589
<i>Will you appeal?</i>

12
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:39,923
Yes, Ill appeal to  you , Viggo.

13
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,765
<i>Up until today,
Mr. Blomkvist was able to play the victim.</i>

14
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,160
<i>"The great journalist
stood up against the lion."</i>

15
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,240
<i>If you call a guy 'Criminal',
and nothing to back it up.</i>

16
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,860
<i>Mr.Blomkvist likes publicity.</i>

17
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:02,250
Can I get the sandwich.

18
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:05,114
And a black coffee.

19
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:11,138
<i>Blomkvist claimed Wennerstrom -
founder and president of The Wennerstrom Group - </i>

20
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:12,440
<i>used State funds</i>

21
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:14,915
<i> intended for industrial development
in Poland </i>

22
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,245
<i>in an arms deal</i>

23
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:18,350
<i>- with the right-wing Ustashe in Croatia.
- Thank you.</i>

24
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:21,317
<i>I have nothing against Mr.Blomkvist.
Hes a fine journalist.</i>

25
00:04:21,352 --> 00:04:23,163
<i>who I dont believe is guided by malice.  </i>

26
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:25,746
<i>But what he wrote was
inaccurate, </i>

27
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:28,256
<i>and inaccuracies cant go
unanswered. </i>

28
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:32,048
<i>All journalists -
have to accept like the rest of us, </i>

29
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,665
<i>actions have consequences.</i>

30
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:39,456
<i>Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600
thousand SKE in damages </i>

31
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:42,564
<i>- and all court costs,
which could be significantly more.</i>

32
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:44,355
And a lighter.

33
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:26,693
- Where you been?
- Walking.

34
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:28,265
-   Thinking.
- Smoking?

35
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,698
- Just one.

36
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:37,431
TV4 called.

37
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:40,625
I told them no  statement until
weve read the judgment in its entirety.

38
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:42,972
I have.
Anyone else?

39
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:44,762
Everyone whos ever wanted
to see you humiliated.

40
00:05:44,798 --> 00:05:46,327
Youve been on the phone all morning.

41
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:48,171
- Im as much to blame for this as you.
- You are?

42
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:49,821
-   You wrote it?
- I read it.  I ran it.

43
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:51,135
Not the same.

44
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:53,239
- Our credibility isnt dead, yet.
- Mine is.

45
00:05:57,092 --> 00:05:58,394
Im tired.

46
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:02,033
I'm gonna go home,
crawl under the duvet for a week.

47
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:09,400
I already called Greger and tell him
I'm not coming home.

48
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,773
Thank you.

49
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,201
Its possible we could wait forever.

50
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,703
You called her and spoke to her.
Didn't you?

51
00:06:18,738 --> 00:06:20,792
Im afraid that doesnt mean much.

52
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:26,386
No one here particularly likes her.

53
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:30,532
I find its much better
if she works from home.

54
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,267
But you told her
I wanted to meet her.

55
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:35,839
But Ive told her many more times I
prefer her not to meet clients.

56
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:39,000
- But you  like her.
- Very much.

57
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:41,049
Shes one of the best investigators I have.

58
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:43,261
-  As you saw from her report -
- But....

59
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:46,089
Im concerned you  wont like her.

60
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:49,897
- Shes different.
- In what way?

61
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:52,052
In every way.

62
00:06:57,657 --> 00:06:59,023
Ms. Salanders here.

63
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:09,006
Lisbeth,
Mr. Dirch Frode.

64
00:07:09,757 --> 00:07:11,149
How do you do?

65
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:26,242
- Something wrong with the report?
- No.It was quite thorough.

66
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:29,025
But Im also interested in
whats not in it.

67
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,635
- Theres nothing not in it.
- Your opinion of him isnt.

68
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:34,405
Im not paid to give my opinion.

69
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,261
So you dont have one?

70
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,641
Hes clean.
In my opinion.

71
00:07:41,676 --> 00:07:43,720
You mean, he is hygenic?

72
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:46,580
Hes who he presents
himself to be.

73
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:48,320
In his business,
thats an asset.

74
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:51,831
Theres less in his asset column
after his conviction today.

75
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:54,813
True.  He made a fool of himself.
If it happened that way.

76
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:57,352
Are you saying he was set up?

77
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:00,445
That wasnt part of my assignment.

78
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:01,929
Youre quite right...

79
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,892
he made a fool of himself..
professionally.

80
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:07,793
How much of a fool can
he make of himself financially?

81
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:10,801
The judgement will just about
empty his savings.

82
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:12,911
- May I go?
- A moment.

83
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:15,829
Your report is light
in another area.

84
00:08:15,864 --> 00:08:20,053
His personal life.
Anything you chose not to disclose?

85
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:24,666
- Nothing that warranted inclusion.
- Does that means "yes" or  "no"?

86
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:26,674
I think what Ms. Salander means, and

87
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,544
I agree, is that everyone has a right
to a certain amount of privacy,

88
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:33,205
- even if theyre being investigated.
- Not in this case.

89
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,112
I need to know if theres anything about him
I might find unsavory -

90
00:08:37,147 --> 00:08:39,157
even if she doesnt.

91
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:46,079
Hes had a long sexual relationship
with his co-editor of the megazine.

92
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:48,432
It wrecked his marriage,
but not hers.

93
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:50,854
Sometimes he performs Cunnilingus.

94
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:53,343
Not often enough,
In my opinion.

95
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:56,431
You were right not to include that.

96
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:58,189
I know.

97
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:56,522
You needed a better attorney.
You needed your sister.

98
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:57,524
She offered.

99
00:09:57,825 --> 00:09:59,134
- He declined.
- As she hoped.

100
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:01,430
Never a good idea mixing
family and business.

101
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:02,806
And I still would have lost, anyway.

102
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:04,263
It wasnt even about Mikael.

103
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:06,452
It   was Wennerstrom sending
a message to the press

104
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:08,857
- and the FSA saying:
Dont ask questions.

105
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,411
Cheer up.

106
00:10:15,463 --> 00:10:17,548
- Dad.
- Nilla.

107
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,009
You dont have to
worry about me.

108
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:20,965
- Moms worried.
- About me?

109
00:10:21,857 --> 00:10:23,394
About the money.

110
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:35,705
Nilla?  What are you doing?

111
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,478
- Nothing.
- Is it serious?

112
00:11:38,513 --> 00:11:41,387
I dont want to talk about it since
I know you wont approve.

113
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:44,440
Of -
Nilla...

114
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:46,655
- Light of Life.
- Light of- what?

115
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:57,703
- Hello.
- Mr. Blomkvist?

116
00:11:57,738 --> 00:11:59,623
Forgive me for intruding on your
Christmas.

117
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:02,108
My name is Dirch Frode.
Im an attorney.

118
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:04,988
I represent Henrik
Vanger.  Perhaps youve heard of him?

119
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:06,290
Yes, yes. Of course.

120
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,018
Hed like to speak to you
about a private matter.

121
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:12,590
This is..uh..
an awkward moment---

122
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,397
Im sorry.  Im about to sit down to
Christmas dinner myself.

123
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:17,290
No, thats not exactly what I mean.

124
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:20,063
Youre referring to your recent
legal problems.

125
00:12:20,098 --> 00:12:22,468
That has  provided us with much ammusement.

126
00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:26,155
Herr Vanger has little love
for Wennerstrom either.

127
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:27,457
Have him call me.

128
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,658
But, hed like to meet in person,

129
00:12:29,693 --> 00:12:32,256
If possible.
Up north.  In Hedestad.

130
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:33,571
That's not gonna be possible.

131
00:12:33,606 --> 00:12:36,336
Herr Vanger is far too old to make a trip to
Stockholm,

132
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:39,383
Please.
If youd be so kind as to consider.

133
00:12:39,418 --> 00:12:41,198
Hedestad is lovely in winter.

134
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:45,821
I'll call you back on this number.
Okay?

135
00:12:59,835 --> 00:13:02,421
Usually when I wake up in a cold
bed, its at home.

136
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:04,373
- I'm Sorry.
- What are you doing?

137
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,209
Writing the press release.

138
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,776
Saying...

139
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:12,581
Youre taking over as publisher.

140
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:15,216
Youre sorry for any nuisance
Wennerstrom was caused.

141
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:16,956
I cant be
reached for comment.

142
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:20,486
- Are you giving up?
- Just stepping aside.

143
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:22,836
This makes me sick.

144
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:01,306
- FRODE: First time in Hedestad?
- And the last.

145
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,696
Oh, don't say that.
Its lovely in the spring.

146
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:05,693
You said it was lovely
in winter.

147
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:08,324
Well, this is unseasonable.

148
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,303
Ill be on the 4:30 train back to
Stockholm.

149
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:14,682
Unless we get snowed in ...
Im joking.

150
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:17,997
Youll be home tonight,
if thats what you wish.

151
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:00,448
Welcome.  Come inside.

152
00:15:01,037 --> 00:15:02,955
Its warm.

153
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,519
How do you do?

154
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:12,018
So...

155
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:14,972
What do you know about me?

156
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,504
That you used to run one of the
biggest industrial firms in the country.

157
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:21,686
- Used to.  Thats correct.
- Right, I didn't mean to...

158
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:29,162
My grandfather forged the tracks
the 4:30 train will take you home.

159
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:33,037
We stitched this country together.
We made the steel--

160
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:36,781
and milled the lumber that built
modern Sweden.

161
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:40,104
And what our most profitable
product now is?

162
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,581
Fertilizer.

163
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:44,415
Im not obsessed with the declining
health of the company,

164
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,605
but I am with
the settling of accounts -

165
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:49,732
and the clock is ticking.
I need your help.

166
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:51,453
Doing..doing what?

167
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:53,614
Officially, assisting me with my memoirs.

168
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,895
But what youd really be doing..

169
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,545
is solving a mystery.  And
by doing what you do so well -

170
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,564
Your recent legal mishap of
yours notwithstanding.

171
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:10,201
Youd be investigating
thieves, misers, bullies,

172
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:14,973
- the most detestable collection
of people youll ever meet ...

173
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:17,641
my family.

174
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:27,969
Would you like to sit?  I could
possibly clear a place if necessary.

175
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:30,267
- Did you make it?
- Have you something for me?

176
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:36,621
Im on welfare;
I dont administer it.

177
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:38,271
This isnt enough.

178
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,851
No thank you?

179
00:16:53,868 --> 00:16:59,208
This is Harriet.  The grandaughter
of my brother Richard.

180
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:03,451
Richard, was a
Nazi of the first order -

181
00:17:03,486 --> 00:17:07,141
joining the
- Nationalist Socialist Freedom League

182
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:08,851
when he was 17.

183
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:12,980
Isnt it interesting how fascists
always steal the word freedom "freedom".

184
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:18,692
The 4:30.  Yes.
Okay...

185
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:23,247
Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi
cause -

186
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:27,409
in 1940, missed all  the real
excitement -

187
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:31,765
but not the opportunity
to regularly beat his wife Margareta..

188
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,744
and their son, Gottfried.

189
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:37,171
Now, Gottfried - Harriets father -
was what people used to call

190
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:39,665
-  a Good-Time-Charlie.
- Theyre still called that.

191
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,119
Are they?  Okay.

192
00:17:41,154 --> 00:17:43,852
He was a charmer, a ladies man,
a drunk.

193
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:46,814
In other words, a born salesman -
which is what he did for the company -

194
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:49,828
traveling around, taking clients
out to dinner and so forth.

195
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:52,240
- Well, Somebody has to do it.
- Thats right.

196
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:55,498
Anyway, he died in 1965.

197
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,679
Drowned.  Drunk.
Here on theisland.

198
00:17:57,714 --> 00:18:02,329
His wife Isabella - who was pretty
much useless as a parent before  -

199
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:04,678
became even more so after his death -

200
00:18:04,713 --> 00:18:07,635
which is when I began looking after
their children -

201
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,805
Martin - who runs Vanger Industries
now that Im retired -

202
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,439
- I've been with him.
- and Harriet.

203
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,428
She was bright and curious,

204
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:22,169
a  winning combination in any person.

205
00:18:22,923 --> 00:18:25,258
- And beautiful.
- Yeah.

206
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:29,024
Something happened to her?

207
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:31,378
Someone in the family
murdered Harriet.

208
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:36,676
And for the last forty years
has been trying to drive me insane.

209
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,102
It was September 24th, 1966.
A Saturday.

210
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:45,938
Harriet was 16.

211
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:49,974
My brothers - along with their
wives, children and grandchildren -

212
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,376
had gathered here

213
00:18:51,411 --> 00:18:54,805
for our loathsome
annual board meeting and dinner.

214
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,972
It was also the day the Yacht Club held
its Autumn parade.

215
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:02,239
Harriet and a couple of school
friends had gone into town to see it.

216
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,709
She returned a
little after two oclock.

217
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:09,077
She came to the parlor.
She asked if she could talk to me.

218
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:12,088
I honestly
dont remember what I was doing

219
00:19:12,123 --> 00:19:16,595
that I thought was more important, but I
told her to give me a few minutes.

220
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:22,319
It was during those few minutes,
that something else occurred.

221
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,352
The accident had
nothing to do with Harriet -

222
00:19:29,387 --> 00:19:31,467
and yet, everything.

223
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:35,031
It was chaos as everyone put down
what they were doing.

224
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:37,406
Police, an ambulance,
fire brigade,

225
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:40,824
reporter, photographer and onlookers
quickly arrived from town,

226
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:45,965
just as those of us on the island - the family -
hurried to the bridge from our side.

227
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,083
The driver of the car -
a man named Aronsson -

228
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:52,172
was pinned and severely injured.

229
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:57,477
We tried desperately to pry him out
with our hands - since metal tools could spark.

230
00:19:58,676 --> 00:20:02,820
It was an hour after the crash,
Harriet was in the kitchen.

231
00:20:02,855 --> 00:20:05,427
Anna herself saw her.

232
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,039
We finally got poor
Aronsson out of his car

233
00:20:13,074 --> 00:20:14,484
and off to the hospital,

234
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:19,808
Just us we from our side
slowly drifted back to the house.

235
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,428
The sun was down,
the excitement over,

236
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:27,291
we sat down to dinner.

237
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:31,700
It was then, that
I noticed Harriet wasnt there.

238
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:37,160
And she wasnt there the next
morning.  Or the next.

239
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,539
Or the next forty years.

240
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:45,527
What was she going to tell me?  Why
didnt I make time for her?

241
00:20:45,562 --> 00:20:47,135
Why didnt I listen?

242
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:50,906
- And she couldnt have run away?
- Not without being seen.

243
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:53,648
Firemen stayed
on the bridge all night

244
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:55,024
pumping out the gasoline.

245
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:57,271
And no one swam across,
or took a row boat.

246
00:20:57,306 --> 00:21:00,379
All of them were still tied up
on this side Sunday.

247
00:21:00,954 --> 00:21:03,613
Believe me,
I checked.

248
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:07,387
She couldnt have just
fallen and drowned?

249
00:21:07,422 --> 00:21:09,227
Oh, no. The currents
arent strong here.

250
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:12,104
Anything that falls into the water
turns up nearby.

251
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,178
Like her father.

252
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:16,548
His body didnt drift more
than ten meters

253
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,370
when he drowned
the year before.

254
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:21,836
No. No. Someone killed her,

255
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:25,442
Someone on the island
that day.

256
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:29,816
Someone close enough to know
what she used to give me each year

257
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:31,980
on my birthday.

258
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:35,339
Those were from her.

259
00:21:36,814 --> 00:21:39,557
The rest...from her killer.

260
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,971
- Who knows about these?
- Just me, the police, the killer...

261
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,958
and now you.

262
00:22:08,591 --> 00:22:10,904
After, the police investigation evaporated,

263
00:22:10,939 --> 00:22:14,408
I kept at it -
studying all the information there was,

264
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:18,409
Ive spent half my life
examining the events of a single day.

265
00:22:18,444 --> 00:22:20,745
I understand your frustration, But...

266
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,702
what youre asking me to do is
a waste of money

267
00:22:23,703 --> 00:22:25,316
We havent discussed your fee.

268
00:22:25,317 --> 00:22:26,618
We dont need to.

269
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:27,996
Thank you.

270
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,187
I cant find something you havent
been able to  in forty years.

271
00:22:32,222 --> 00:22:33,675
You dont know that.

272
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,965
You have a
very keen investigative mind.

273
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,354
Heres what I propose:

274
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:43,362
You come stay on the island. I have a nice little
cottage by the water you can use.

275
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,268
You study the material I give you.
You find something Ive missed- or you dont.

276
00:22:48,303 --> 00:22:51,221
What you're asking me to do
is set aside my life and career....

277
00:22:51,256 --> 00:22:53,601
Think of it as a well
deserved holiday.

278
00:22:53,636 --> 00:22:58,120
A way of avoiding all the
people you want to avoid right now.

279
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:02,994
As for compensation, Ill pay you double
your salary for as many months as it takes.

280
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:05,205
Ill quadruple it if
you solve the mystery.

281
00:23:05,206 --> 00:23:06,573
- Herr Vanger.
- Im not done.

282
00:23:06,574 --> 00:23:08,027
Ill throw in one  more thing -

283
00:23:08,062 --> 00:23:10,227
even though youre a
terrible negotiator.

284
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:15,504
Its something you want more than anything else
and it cant be bought at any price.

285
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:20,918
So, let me give it to you ...
Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.

286
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,883
He began his career working for me.

287
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:27,366
And Ive followed it with interest,
shall we say, ever since.

288
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,355
You were right about him.

289
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,864
You just couldnt prove it.

290
00:24:05,886 --> 00:24:08,772
Were in the middle of our worst crisis ever
and youre writing a memoir?

291
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:10,637
You fired me;
I need something to do.

292
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:12,265
You fired you;

293
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:17,143
I need you here,
not the North Pole.

294
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:18,849
Mikael, You know what this
is going to look like.

295
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:22,112
Like Ive been gutted.  Like Im
running away.  I am.

296
00:24:22,147 --> 00:24:24,892
Wennerstrm wants to see me waving
a white flag, not a red one.

297
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:27,855
The more it looks like theres a problem
between you and me, the more itll satisfy him.

298
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,474
There is a problem between us.  He
wont be satisfied until he shuts us down,

299
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:34,659
Youre leaving me to fight him alone?

300
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,249
Its four hours by train.

301
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:44,002
Its not the North Pole.

302
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,677
Hey, hey.

303
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:28,138
<i>The network is busy,
please try again later.</i>

304
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:41,866
<i>The network is busy,
please try again later.</i>

305
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,921
What?

306
00:26:50,674 --> 00:26:52,053
Want some Milk?

307
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,550
<i>The network is busy,
please try again later.</i>

308
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:57,699
You are Palmgren's daughter?

309
00:27:57,734 --> 00:27:59,543
His ward,
He doesn't have a daughter.

310
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:02,994
Please.

311
00:28:04,631 --> 00:28:06,952
He's had a severe
cerebral hemorrhaging.

312
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,306
Either from the fall itself,
or a stroke that led to the fall.

313
00:28:11,213 --> 00:28:13,113
His blood pressure is too high.

314
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:15,921
Im hopeful hell regain consciousness,
but thats not assured.

315
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:18,772
And its possible, even if he does,

316
00:28:18,807 --> 00:28:21,193
there will be
neurological damage.

317
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:52,112
Hi, Im Gunner.

318
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:53,980
The caretaker.

319
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:55,524
Oh, hey, Gunnar.

320
00:29:11,996 --> 00:29:13,713
Youre an author?

321
00:29:13,748 --> 00:29:16,894
Well, I'm doing a biography
on Herr Vanger.

322
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:22,066
- I saw you on television.
- Thats unfortunate.

323
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,481
Bit of trouble, I guess.

324
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:27,906
No jail time, though.
Thats good.

325
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:30,938
Cost you a lot of money though, yeah?

326
00:29:33,603 --> 00:29:34,905
There.

327
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:35,907
It's good.

328
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:41,986
The entire island is
owned by my family.

329
00:29:44,195 --> 00:29:49,049
Your closest neighbor is
my brother

330
00:29:49,084 --> 00:29:53,954
Harald, another Nazi if you can believe.
Two  in the family.

331
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:58,229
Oh, yes. Hes quite detestable
to put it nicely,

332
00:29:58,851 --> 00:30:01,826
but youll probably never see him.
Hes a recluse.

333
00:30:02,477 --> 00:30:04,653
- He was there that day?
- Indeed, he was.

334
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:08,227
His daughter, Cecilia,
lives over there.

335
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:10,751
They dont speak.

336
00:30:10,786 --> 00:30:13,039
Does anyone speak to
anyone on this island?

337
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:17,797
Isabella, Harriets mother
- who lives there - she speaks to Harald -

338
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:20,333
which is one of reasons
I dont speak to her

339
00:30:21,682 --> 00:30:25,244
Cecilias brother Birger
lives there.

340
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,867
- Who doesnt he speak to?
- You, probably.

341
00:30:27,902 --> 00:30:31,984
Not that youd want him to.
He can be as unpleasant as Harald.

342
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:33,788
Im quickly losing
track of whos who, here.

343
00:30:34,643 --> 00:30:36,419
Oh, how youll wish
it were always so.

344
00:30:36,454 --> 00:30:40,714
Soon youll know us all only too
well - with my apologies.

345
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:46,683
Out there is my nephew Martins
house; Harriets brother.

346
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:49,100
- Who speaks to him?
- I speak to him.

347
00:30:49,135 --> 00:30:51,899
He runs the company
now, as I think I told you.

348
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:57,492
Someone shooting their dinner.
Gunner probably.

349
00:30:57,493 --> 00:30:58,795
Oh yes, I met him earlier.

350
00:30:58,796 --> 00:31:01,603
He was 19 when
Harriet disappeared.

351
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,096
He lives over there.

352
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:08,779
- And you live there?
- Sorry?

353
00:31:08,814 --> 00:31:10,115
Your house.

354
00:31:11,758 --> 00:31:13,824
Oh, yes!

355
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,902
Yes, youre right.

356
00:31:16,937 --> 00:31:21,676
The man who  hires the detective should
always bekept on the suspects list.

357
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:26,659
<font color="#3399FF">DET. MORELL:</font> The fact that
I never found a body  was not surprising.

358
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:28,894
You cant dig  up an entire island.

359
00:33:30,836 --> 00:33:36,015
But neither could I find the motive.
Was it spontaneous? Was it calculated?

360
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,419
Did she know something someone
wished she didnt?

361
00:33:38,454 --> 00:33:41,901
-  Was it about business?
- Business?  But she was sixteen.

362
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,478
And very bright.

363
00:33:44,131 --> 00:33:49,327
Henrik told me he could easily see her
running the business one day,

364
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:52,046
She was with some friends that day.
At a parade.

365
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:55,473
She told them she was  feeling unwell.
She left early

366
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:59,794
But they also told me
she kept secrets from them, too.

367
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:03,251
The main thing I learned was that
teenage girls are complicated.

368
00:34:03,286 --> 00:34:05,438
- I have one.
- Then, you know.

369
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:07,496
I wanted to...

370
00:34:09,224 --> 00:34:10,848
Ask you about this.

371
00:34:13,906 --> 00:34:16,756
She received that from Henrik,
the Christmas before.

372
00:34:18,982 --> 00:34:21,775
I studied it more times
than I can say.

373
00:34:23,338 --> 00:34:26,294
-  I know every page of it.
- The last page Im curious about.

374
00:34:26,295 --> 00:34:27,609
As was I.

375
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,922
List of Names, Numbers and..
Must have some significance.

376
00:34:30,957 --> 00:34:33,124
Theyre local phone numbers.

377
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,654
The first belonged to a woman
called Margot,

378
00:34:35,689 --> 00:34:38,450
whose mother was Magda,
who denied she didnt know Harriet.

379
00:34:38,485 --> 00:34:41,748
The fourth, R.L., belonged to
Rosemarie Larsson,

380
00:34:41,783 --> 00:34:44,649
an elderly woman who died
some years before.

381
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:49,491
The other three were not connected
in any way that I could find.

382
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:53,551
Ive reminded you of things youd
rather forget.  Im sorry.

383
00:34:54,197 --> 00:34:55,585
I cant forget it.

384
00:34:57,272 --> 00:34:59,050
Its my "Rebecka Case".

385
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:01,979
I don't know what that is.

386
00:35:02,014 --> 00:35:06,486
Every policeman has at least
one unsolved case to obsess over.

387
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:10,044
Back then we had an Officer,
Torstensson.

388
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,250
Year after year he kept
going back to his "Rebecka Case".

389
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:16,251
taking out the files -
studying them over and over.

390
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:19,141
We were young, we laughed at him.

391
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:21,143
That was also a missing girl case?

392
00:35:21,178 --> 00:35:23,426
No, no, no. Thats not why I mention it.

393
00:35:24,073 --> 00:35:26,649
I'm talking about the soul
of a policeman.

394
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,104
Poor old Torstensson never solved it,

395
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:32,394
and he never let it go.

396
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,863
Hows Mr. Palmgren doing?

397
00:35:42,616 --> 00:35:44,547
I heard he had a stroke of some kind?

398
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,062
That's Terrible.

399
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:50,136
What exactly do you do at this
security company?

400
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,817
Make coffee and sort mail.

401
00:35:52,852 --> 00:35:54,238
But not full-time.

402
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:56,837
Not even part-time consistently.

403
00:35:56,872 --> 00:35:59,734
They somehow got
along without coffee or mail

404
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:01,179
in July and August?

405
00:36:06,628 --> 00:36:08,693
- How much did you made there?
- Enough.

406
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,828
- How much is your rent?
- I pay my rent.

407
00:36:16,939 --> 00:36:18,701
And when was the last time you were late?

408
00:36:18,736 --> 00:36:20,118
Never.

409
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:23,820
Do you think that ring in your eyelid
makes you attractive?

410
00:36:26,942 --> 00:36:28,243
Heres the problem.

411
00:36:29,727 --> 00:36:32,137
There a discrepancy..

412
00:36:32,172 --> 00:36:34,908
between the obligation of
Mr. Palmgrens guardianship

413
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,714
and the management of your finances.

414
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:38,482
There's no discrepancy or a problem.

415
00:36:38,517 --> 00:36:41,007
It was clear to him
I could manage myown finances.

416
00:36:41,008 --> 00:36:42,446
- But thats not clear to me.
- Im not a child.

417
00:36:42,448 --> 00:36:44,277
No.  Youre not.
But you were.

418
00:36:44,312 --> 00:36:48,240
And between then and now -
you're committed to a ward at  St. Stephens,

419
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:50,786
where you continued to display
a violent aggression -

420
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:55,335
And you failed to adapt to four foster homes

421
00:36:55,371 --> 00:36:58,631
arrested twice for intoxication,
twice for narcotics

422
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:02,560
again for an assault: smashing
a bottle smashed into a mans face.

423
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,520
And that's not even that long ago.

424
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:08,763
You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into
thinking youve changed, but

425
00:37:09,835 --> 00:37:11,865
looking at this...

426
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,860
- not to mention how youre looking
at me now -

427
00:37:15,491 --> 00:37:17,512
I don't think you have.

428
00:37:18,341 --> 00:37:21,098
So the Good
-Old-Mr-Palmgren-Days are over.

429
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:26,668
Starting now, youll be given a monthly allowance.
Youll provide me with receipts for your expenses.

430
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:30,189
If the numbers dont balance, Ill
have to assume the difference is going to drugs.

431
00:37:30,224 --> 00:37:32,091
Ive been on myself
since I was ten.

432
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:33,855
The State- has taken care of you.

433
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,697
Ms. Salander?  Please look at me.
Because this is important.

434
00:37:36,732 --> 00:37:39,725
Since, behavior youre displaying
right now is elaborately documented here -

435
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,689
- so it would come as a shock to no
one if I chose an alternative to

436
00:37:42,724 --> 00:37:45,702
very lenient arrangement
I've just outlined.

437
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,467
Would you prefer
institutionalization?

438
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:15,125
- Mikael?
- Yes.

439
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,946
- I'm Liv.
- Hi.

440
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:18,483
Were going to the same place.
Hop in.

441
00:38:18,518 --> 00:38:19,965
Okay, thank you.

442
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:31,884
I found him at deaths door
halfway up the hill.

443
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:33,327
Im afraid Im a bit out of shape.

444
00:38:33,362 --> 00:38:35,590
No, its a climb for anyone.
I shouldve warned you.

445
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:36,936
- Come on in.
- Thank you, Martin.

446
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:38,354
Henrik says great things about you.

447
00:38:44,176 --> 00:38:46,656
What a place,
look at that view!

448
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:50,099
I used to work in the companys
petrochemical division in Goteborg.

449
00:38:50,617 --> 00:38:52,454
When it was sold, I went with it.

450
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:53,790
A dark day.

451
00:38:54,305 --> 00:38:57,033
I live in Hong Kong now, but come
back to Stockholm for family events,

452
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,015
and when I do, I drive up to spend a
couple days with Martin.

453
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:03,012
- She comes for the moose steak.
- You can't blame her, it's wonderful.

454
00:39:05,987 --> 00:39:07,309
Something let's open.

455
00:39:08,175 --> 00:39:10,064
Would you like to try something
else?

456
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:11,722
No, no, no.
It's fine.

457
00:39:17,634 --> 00:39:19,004
Youre writing a book now,
What is it?

458
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:20,956
- Henriks biography.
- I love Henrik.

459
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,279
Hes fascinating.
Martin, too.

460
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:26,473
Together theyre the
Old Sweden and the New.

461
00:39:26,963 --> 00:39:28,325
They are.

462
00:39:30,223 --> 00:39:31,900
You know about Harriet, right?

463
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,763
- You dont?
- Yes, I do.

464
00:39:36,314 --> 00:39:37,984
The family doesnt like
to talk about it,

465
00:39:37,985 --> 00:39:40,419
but it cant just be
swept under the rug.

466
00:39:40,454 --> 00:39:41,951
- What cant.
- Harriet.

467
00:39:42,526 --> 00:39:44,403
- We can talk about that  later.
- No.

468
00:39:45,145 --> 00:39:46,447
We can talk about it now.

469
00:39:47,148 --> 00:39:49,281
Liv knows everything about
my crazyfamily.

470
00:39:49,316 --> 00:39:51,977
-  Which is why shell never marry me.
- Thats one reason...

471
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:53,814
I don't wanna read about that
in the book.

472
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,758
Everything else is fine,
Harriet certainly.

473
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,341
Everything changed after that.

474
00:40:00,844 --> 00:40:03,030
Not just the family,
but the company as well.

475
00:40:03,065 --> 00:40:05,242
- How so?
- Were not Nordea or Ericsson,

476
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:08,584
but were still the largest family-owned
company in the country.

477
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,736
At the height, we had 40,000 employees.
We have about half that now,

478
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:14,124
and that downward slide -

479
00:40:14,984 --> 00:40:16,914
began after my sisters death.

480
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:22,781
It broke Henriks entrepreneurial spirit,

481
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,650
and his heart.

482
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:27,749
You were here that day?

483
00:40:27,784 --> 00:40:31,312
I came in a little late, after the accident
on the bridge. The 4:30 train.

484
00:40:31,756 --> 00:40:33,058
I know it well.

485
00:40:33,093 --> 00:40:34,763
It was a terrible day.

486
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:38,518
And the days after -

487
00:40:38,553 --> 00:40:40,984
searching and not finding her

488
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:42,620
- were even worse.

489
00:40:43,824 --> 00:40:47,693
This event, Mikael, has to be a
big part of your book.

490
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,370
I got a call from social welfare.

491
00:41:13,544 --> 00:41:15,598
Ive been on to find a new guardian.

492
00:42:19,077 --> 00:42:20,378
- Hi.
- Hello.

493
00:42:20,411 --> 00:42:22,244
I thought Id come over
and say hello.

494
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,924
-   Im Cecilia.
- Oh, yeah. Please, come in.

495
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:31,652
Some coffee?

496
00:42:32,325 --> 00:42:33,674
No, Thank you.

497
00:42:43,883 --> 00:42:48,738
Were all uncomfortable with the
idea of a chronicle of our family.

498
00:42:48,773 --> 00:42:51,218
Its not about the family.
Its about Henrik and the company.

499
00:42:52,054 --> 00:42:53,462
Like I said...

500
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:57,198
Its not my intention to present a
malicious portrait of anyone.

501
00:42:57,233 --> 00:42:59,346
Unlike the one
that landed you in court.?

502
00:42:59,381 --> 00:43:01,812
Unlike that one. Yes.

503
00:43:02,835 --> 00:43:05,940
So, what youre saying is, youre not really here
to look into what happened to Harriet?

504
00:43:05,975 --> 00:43:08,094
I cant ignore such
a dramatic event,

505
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:10,248
but no, thats not
by any means my focus.

506
00:43:10,284 --> 00:43:13,742
All those boxes Gunner carted  down here
- which are where? - in the closet now?

507
00:43:13,777 --> 00:43:15,941
- those werent Henriks
private investigation?

508
00:43:17,243 --> 00:43:19,090
I wonder sometimes whos crazier -

509
00:43:19,879 --> 00:43:22,526
my Nazi father
or my obsessed uncle.

510
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:27,690
Since were talking about it,
since you brought it up, what was she like?

511
00:43:28,124 --> 00:43:29,763
Im sure Henrik has told you.

512
00:43:29,764 --> 00:43:32,246
He was my age back then, he couldnt know
what was going on

513
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:34,293
with a teenager,
anymore than I can with my own daughter.

514
00:43:34,294 --> 00:43:37,819
-  You were the same age.
- Actually, my sister Anita was closer to her in age.

515
00:43:37,854 --> 00:43:40,219
She knew Harriet better than anyone -
You should talk to her.

516
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,522
Id love to, where is she?

517
00:43:41,523 --> 00:43:43,852
If I had to guess -
London.

518
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:47,466
- You dont know where your own sister lives?
- I havent seen her in years.

519
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:50,322
- We never really got along.
- Im getting used to that comment.

520
00:43:50,357 --> 00:43:52,451
She hates this place
even more than  I do.

521
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:55,323
She left, moved to London,
That was it.

522
00:43:56,202 --> 00:43:59,065
You couldnt pay her to send a Christmas card,
much less visit.

523
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,464
Ill try to track and help you.

524
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:04,052
If you do,
and try talking to her about us,

525
00:44:04,606 --> 00:44:07,112
dont be surprised
if she tells you to fuck off.

526
00:44:09,178 --> 00:44:11,054
<font color="#3399FF">Subtitle by d3xt3r</font>

527
00:44:14,122 --> 00:44:15,520
You backed up?

528
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:21,731
- Hard drives at home, yeah.
- Thats good. B'cos this one is gone.

529
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,366
Have you ever had an STD?

530
00:44:34,127 --> 00:44:36,909
Whens the last time
you were tested for HIV?

531
00:44:40,271 --> 00:44:42,443
How many partners have you had
in thelast month?

532
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,713
How many of those were men?

533
00:44:49,877 --> 00:44:51,889
It's regulation,
I have to ask you these things.

534
00:44:51,924 --> 00:44:54,063
- Its a matter of health.
- Write what you want.

535
00:44:54,498 --> 00:44:56,730
Why do you need
such an expensive computer?

536
00:44:56,765 --> 00:44:58,972
- For work.
- Making coffee and sorting mail ?

537
00:44:58,973 --> 00:45:01,324
I shouldnt even have to ask.
I should have control of my money.

538
00:45:01,325 --> 00:45:03,902
And you will.
Once you learn to be sociable.

539
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:06,349
Get along with people.
Can you do that?

540
00:45:09,513 --> 00:45:12,108
Why don't we start with that?

541
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:18,546
Why don't we start with me?

542
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:28,553
You do something for me,
I do something for you.

543
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:32,036
Thats how normal people do.

544
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,022
I want you to have that computer.

545
00:46:06,528 --> 00:46:09,688
You feel that?
Thats gaberdine.

546
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:18,346
Unzip it.

547
00:46:27,681 --> 00:46:29,032
And ...

548
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,169
And ...

549
00:46:45,897 --> 00:46:47,292
I like the reticence.

550
00:46:49,518 --> 00:46:51,273
Its almost convincing.

551
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:28,574
- Anita Vanger?
- Through there.

552
00:48:28,609 --> 00:48:29,910
Thank  you.

553
00:48:32,753 --> 00:48:34,069
Excuse me.

554
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:36,062
I probably should have made an appointment.

555
00:48:36,934 --> 00:48:38,518
No, Its fine.

556
00:48:38,988 --> 00:48:41,252
-   Please.  Have a seat.
- Thank you.

557
00:48:41,287 --> 00:48:44,815
- Mikael.
- Mikael.  How do you do?

558
00:48:44,851 --> 00:48:46,160
How do you do.

559
00:48:46,195 --> 00:48:48,995
So, are you looking
for investment counseling?

560
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,349
Well, I would
if had any money

561
00:48:51,384 --> 00:48:53,055
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

562
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:56,098
Im writing a biography
of your  uncle Henrik.

563
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:58,021
Thats why Im here.

564
00:48:59,461 --> 00:49:01,749
I haven't seen him in over 20 years.

565
00:49:01,784 --> 00:49:04,100
Actually, it's more than that.

566
00:49:04,135 --> 00:49:07,297
Haven't seen my sister.
Haven't seen anyone...

567
00:49:07,332 --> 00:49:09,992
Most of what I'm writing about
predates that,

568
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:12,485
so your recollections are valid.

569
00:49:13,507 --> 00:49:15,799
Where to start,
if that was a question.

570
00:49:15,834 --> 00:49:19,154
Well than, let me narrow it down
I've gotten up to 1960

571
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:22,648
To the event that changed
everything in Henrik's life.

572
00:49:22,683 --> 00:49:24,165
Harriet...

573
00:49:26,868 --> 00:49:29,930
Everything I knew about
that I told to

574
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,248
- - whatever his name was -
- Morell.

575
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:34,598
My recollections then were a lot
better than they are now.

576
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:37,378
I'm not speaking of the event itself.

577
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:40,461
I'm trying to get a clearer sense of
what Harriet was like.

578
00:49:42,391 --> 00:49:44,775
She was messed up.

579
00:49:47,524 --> 00:49:50,251
Like all us Vanger kids.

580
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:52,411
Crazy mother.

581
00:49:53,144 --> 00:49:56,983
Drunken father.
At least hers wasn't a Nazi.

582
00:49:57,018 --> 00:49:58,391
- Was he abusive?
- Mine?

583
00:49:58,426 --> 00:50:01,392
- No, her's.
- Not that I ever saw.

584
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:04,504
but you could
tell something was going on.

585
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:09,801
Somedays, she'd be very withdrawn.

586
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:16,408
The next minute, she'd be putting on makeup
and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school.

587
00:50:17,288 --> 00:50:20,433
And then, she'd be studying
a Bible like a nun -

588
00:50:21,415 --> 00:50:24,163
no Vanger was ever religious -
can you imagine?

589
00:50:24,198 --> 00:50:26,731
She was obviously,
very unhappy.

590
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:30,205
What do you think happened to her?

591
00:50:30,206 --> 00:50:31,612
Everyone knows what.

592
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,678
You don't have any thoughts about who?
Why?

593
00:50:35,713 --> 00:50:39,414
All I know is that
I always felt really sorry for her.

594
00:50:40,086 --> 00:50:43,088
I got away when I was 18 and
never went back.

595
00:50:43,717 --> 00:50:45,112
She would have done the same..

596
00:50:46,629 --> 00:50:48,462
but she never made it to 18.

597
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:51,280
<i>Mr. Bjurman, please.
Its Lisbeth Salander.</i>

598
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:53,183
<i>Wait for a moment, please.</i>

599
00:50:55,891 --> 00:50:57,928
Im fine.  Im sorry I missed
our appointment.

600
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,230
I had a lot of work.

601
00:50:59,231 --> 00:51:02,642
- Is something the matter?
- ... no, nothing to be concerned about

602
00:51:03,442 --> 00:51:05,739
Actually, I need another
advance on my allowance.

603
00:51:06,762 --> 00:51:08,444
Can I come to your office
tonight?

604
00:51:11,721 --> 00:51:14,340
Why don't you come to my house?
Do you have a pen?

605
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:16,524
... I dont need a pen,
whats the address??

606
00:51:34,673 --> 00:51:36,300
- Yes?
- It's me.

607
00:51:45,826 --> 00:51:48,214
Lisbeth, come on in.

608
00:51:58,331 --> 00:52:00,327
- You Like it?
- It's nice.

609
00:52:00,362 --> 00:52:01,892
So.

610
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,252
- So, what do you need money for this time?
- Food.

611
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:11,884
How are you?

612
00:52:18,122 --> 00:52:20,376
I'm so glad that you've decided
to come an visit.

613
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:23,303
I just want my money.

614
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:25,068
Well, lets see if I can help
you out with that.

615
00:52:37,077 --> 00:52:38,378
Wait.

616
00:52:38,994 --> 00:52:42,721
- Is there a problem?
- I just want to know...

617
00:52:43,876 --> 00:52:46,818
am I going to have to do this
every time I need money to eat?

618
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:48,959
You're so cute when are surly.

619
00:54:33,642 --> 00:54:35,200
I fogot to ask you...

620
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,583
Do you like anal sex?

621
00:55:33,549 --> 00:55:39,300
<i>Faith is the assurance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things not seen.</i>

622
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:44,406
<i>  Through faith we understand that
the world was created by the word of God - </i>

623
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,199
- Ill drive you home.
- I can get home on my own.

624
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:37,528
Are you sure?

625
00:57:44,074 --> 00:57:47,051
- Is it any warmer inside?
- No.

626
00:57:48,168 --> 00:57:50,991
I apologize if youre having
financial problems

627
00:57:51,026 --> 00:57:53,350
at the magazine
during Mikaels absence.

628
00:57:53,385 --> 00:57:56,269
- Well work through them.
- Are you sure?

629
00:57:56,304 --> 00:57:59,924
How long do you think you can hang on?
Six months or so?

630
00:58:01,057 --> 00:58:04,427
- That sounds about right.
- You know, I used to be in
the newspaper business.

631
00:58:04,462 --> 00:58:06,684
We owned six dailies
back in the 50s.

632
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,638
We still own one.
The Courier, here in town.

633
00:58:08,673 --> 00:58:12,125
Which, I let my nephew Birger run it since
he cant run anything else.

634
00:58:13,435 --> 00:58:15,645
So what do you say to
taking on a partner?

635
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:19,752
Well, Weve never
had to considered it before.

636
00:58:21,553 --> 00:58:23,292
We value our independence very much.

637
00:58:23,327 --> 00:58:26,183
Independence is publishing
is dependant on advertisers -

638
00:58:26,218 --> 00:58:28,419
However much you have, youd retain.

639
00:58:28,454 --> 00:58:32,659
-  We dont care about content.
- Excuse me.  Did I miss something?

640
00:58:32,694 --> 00:58:34,628
Were talking about an
investment in the magazine.

641
00:58:34,663 --> 00:58:36,376
I gather that.
Why would you want to do that?

642
00:58:36,411 --> 00:58:38,061
Well, not out of greed,
thats for sure.

643
00:58:38,096 --> 00:58:43,153
I feel badly that Ive taken Mikael
away from you at the worst possible time.

644
00:58:43,188 --> 00:58:48,268
Now i'm convinced that this is
the right thing to do.  The moral thing..

645
00:58:48,912 --> 00:58:50,641
Thats one reason.
And.

646
00:58:52,417 --> 00:58:54,155
And....

647
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:57,259
<i>The enemies of my friends
are my enemies.</i>

648
00:58:57,744 --> 00:58:59,627
How long have you
been discussing this with them?

649
00:58:59,662 --> 00:59:02,263
I havent been. They called yesterday
and asked me to come.

650
00:59:02,264 --> 00:59:03,242
Why didnt you tell me?

651
00:59:03,243 --> 00:59:04,769
Why would I.
You live in the wood?

652
00:59:04,804 --> 00:59:07,020
And so, I deserve
to be treated like an idiot?

653
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:08,811
I just wanted to hear
what they had to say?

654
00:59:10,352 --> 00:59:12,187
You wouldve said 'no'
before they could.

655
00:59:12,222 --> 00:59:13,919
Im saying it now.
Its a bad idea.

656
00:59:14,452 --> 00:59:16,467
You heard me tell them we could
had six months.

657
00:59:16,933 --> 00:59:19,746
I lied. Without their money well be out of
business in three.

658
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:22,582
You dont know this family.
Like I do. Theyre crazy.

659
00:59:22,984 --> 00:59:26,425
- Were not marrying into it.
- If we do this. Thats exactly what were doing.

660
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:29,361
You want to say no?
Lets say no.

661
00:59:30,071 --> 00:59:33,330
Instead of 50 percent of something,
lets own 100 percent of nothing.

662
00:59:39,245 --> 00:59:40,904
- Mikael?
- What?

663
00:59:40,939 --> 00:59:43,803
- Im leaving this God-forsaken
island in the morning.

664
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:45,751
- So?
- So, are you coming to bed or not.

665
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,268
How much do one of those cost?

666
00:59:56,865 --> 00:59:58,233
Around three thousand.

667
01:00:00,618 --> 01:00:02,565
This is really gonna hurt.

668
01:00:05,523 --> 01:00:06,824
Your call.

669
01:00:10,498 --> 01:00:15,290
<i>Petrochemical manufacturer Vanger Industries
has taken a controlling interest in Millennium magazine.</i>

670
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:17,730
<i>which according to analysts
has been in financial trouble....</i>

671
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:19,228
Millennium is an excellent magazine.

672
01:00:19,263 --> 01:00:22,702
We also think its undervalued right now,
which is good business for us.

673
01:00:22,737 --> 01:00:25,318
Theres another reason.
I dont like bullies.

674
01:00:25,353 --> 01:00:27,196
Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom?

675
01:00:27,231 --> 01:00:29,475
Im referring to anyone who tries
to sue --

676
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:31,388
their enemies into submission.

677
01:00:31,423 --> 01:00:34,179
If Mr. Wennerstrom would
like to try it again,

678
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:37,543
hell find himself fighting
a company that can afford to fight back.

679
01:00:37,578 --> 01:00:41,563
<i>Ive always admired Henrik Vanger.
Hes a titan - and a gentleman.  </i>

680
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,387
<i>But hes also quite old now -
which may explain..</i>

681
01:00:44,422 --> 01:00:46,978
<i> how he could be taken in
by a convicted liar.</i>

682
01:01:06,655 --> 01:01:07,956
Shit.

683
01:02:49,597 --> 01:02:51,362
<i><font color="#3399FF">PHOTO EDITOR:</font>
The current archive is on CDs, </i>

684
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:56,746
<i> The older stuff, still negatives.
What general period are you interested in?</i>

685
01:02:56,781 --> 01:02:58,584
September, 1966.

686
01:03:01,449 --> 01:03:02,750
Thank you.

687
01:03:08,858 --> 01:03:10,846
Is this about Harriet Vanger?

688
01:03:10,881 --> 01:03:12,570
Youre too young
to know about that.

689
01:03:12,605 --> 01:03:14,683
Everyone here grows up
knowing about her.

690
01:03:17,248 --> 01:03:19,099
Its how were taught
about strangers.

691
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:29,062
- Lisbeth?
- I need to pay my rent.

692
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:32,153
I need some money.

693
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,543
Oh, come in.

694
01:03:41,895 --> 01:03:45,491
I feel..a bit..badly,
how we left it last night.

695
01:03:45,526 --> 01:03:46,827
- Me, too.

696
01:04:34,463 --> 01:04:35,765
Good...

697
01:04:36,229 --> 01:04:37,545
Youre alive.

698
01:04:40,403 --> 01:04:41,704
You recognize this?

699
01:04:41,739 --> 01:04:43,955
I had it with me last time.
I set it here.  Remember?

700
01:04:44,794 --> 01:04:46,167
And the snap,
you see it?

701
01:04:46,202 --> 01:04:49,004
Its not a snap.
Its a wide-angle micro-lens.

702
01:05:08,891 --> 01:05:10,870
I thought it was gonna be
just another blow-job.

703
01:05:10,905 --> 01:05:12,358
Which is disgusting enough.

704
01:05:13,448 --> 01:05:15,712
I misjudged,
just how sick you are.

705
01:05:26,567 --> 01:05:29,119
Okay, this is whats going to happen.

706
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:53,513
Pay attention.

707
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,777
Look at me.

708
01:05:57,842 --> 01:05:59,221
Once you can sit again,

709
01:05:59,924 --> 01:06:01,375
which could be a while, I admit.

710
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:05,073
were going to my bank and tell them that
I alone have access to money.

711
01:06:05,108 --> 01:06:06,590
Nod.

712
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:08,934
After that,
youll never contact me again.

713
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:13,475
Each month youll prepare a report
of a meeting we will never have.

714
01:06:14,329 --> 01:06:16,435
In it, youll describe
how well Im doing,

715
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:18,106
how 'sociable' Im becoming.

716
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:20,679
Then, you will negotiate
with the court--

717
01:06:20,714 --> 01:06:23,222
to have my
declaration of incompetence lifted.

718
01:06:23,257 --> 01:06:24,569
If you fail,

719
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:27,345
this video will spread
across the Internet like a virus.

720
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:28,682
Nod.

721
01:06:30,139 --> 01:06:31,888
And, If something happens to me

722
01:06:31,923 --> 01:06:35,846
..if I get hit by a car -
if you run me over with a car -

723
01:06:35,881 --> 01:06:37,708
This will upload automatically.

724
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:39,717
Nod that you understand.

725
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:44,683
Oh, Gabardina.

726
01:06:45,705 --> 01:06:47,774
Im taking the keys to this apartment.

727
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:49,421
Because, Ill  be checking on you.

728
01:06:49,456 --> 01:06:51,387
And If I find a girl in here with you,

729
01:06:51,422 --> 01:06:53,528
whether she came of her own
free will or not -

730
01:06:56,664 --> 01:06:58,075
No.  Not the video.

731
01:07:06,993 --> 01:07:08,294
I will kill you.

732
01:07:10,468 --> 01:07:12,195
Do you doubt anything Ive said?

733
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:16,699
Do you doubt in the
reports that've followed me all my life?

734
01:07:16,734 --> 01:07:18,035
What do they say?

735
01:07:18,616 --> 01:07:19,941
If you had to sum it up?

736
01:07:20,848 --> 01:07:22,394
They say Im insane.

737
01:07:23,453 --> 01:07:26,120
No, it okay. You can nod
because its true.

738
01:07:27,578 --> 01:07:29,141
I am insane.

739
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:32,242
Nod!

740
01:07:34,774 --> 01:07:37,181
I know itll be hard for you
to abide by my rules.

741
01:07:37,986 --> 01:07:40,117
The abstinence part,
most of all.

742
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:44,183
So, Im going to make it
easier for you.

743
01:07:56,912 --> 01:07:59,656
Lie still.  Ive never
done this before.

744
01:08:00,272 --> 01:08:02,085
And, There will be some blood.

745
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:29,269
- Hi.
- Hi.

746
01:09:30,219 --> 01:09:32,421
- What are you doing here?
- On my way to Skelleftea.

747
01:09:32,422 --> 01:09:34,008
I can only
stay for four hours.

748
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:38,162
Whats in Skelleftea?

749
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:41,030
Bible Camp.

750
01:09:43,191 --> 01:09:44,174
Oh, yeah.

751
01:10:04,538 --> 01:10:06,844
- I'm not dangerous.
- Its fine, Nilla.

752
01:10:07,874 --> 01:10:09,840
Whatever you want to do is fine.

753
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:13,282
-  Everybody needssomething.
- Just so long as its not God.

754
01:10:13,318 --> 01:10:14,731
I didnt say that.

755
01:10:19,123 --> 01:10:22,379
Ive never been around enough to know
everything thats going on with you,

756
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:26,496
and I apologize for that.

757
01:10:27,676 --> 01:10:29,276
But Id never want
you to not tell me something,

758
01:10:29,311 --> 01:10:31,516
B'cos you think
I might not want to hear it.

759
01:10:32,638 --> 01:10:33,977
Thats what Im doing.

760
01:10:35,936 --> 01:10:38,152
It really should have been me visiting you.
Im sorry.

761
01:10:38,188 --> 01:10:40,879
Its okay.
It was nice seeing you.

762
01:10:42,085 --> 01:10:43,387
Bye bye.

763
01:10:43,743 --> 01:10:45,180
- See you.
- Yeah.

764
01:10:49,753 --> 01:10:51,563
Dont go too hard on the Catholics.

765
01:10:51,564 --> 01:10:52,892
What?

766
01:10:52,893 --> 01:10:54,469
The article youre writing.

767
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:56,245
I'm not writing an article
about Catholics.

768
01:10:56,246 --> 01:10:58,129
The Bible quotes on your desk...

769
01:11:38,374 --> 01:11:43,249
<i>A woman who is a medium
or a sorcerer; shall be put to death, by stoning.</i>

770
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:46,957
<i>If a dove is the sinners offering, </i>

771
01:11:46,992 --> 01:11:49,092
<i>the priest shall wring off its head, </i>

772
01:11:49,127 --> 01:11:52,347
<i> cleave its wings, and burn it upon the altar.</i>

773
01:11:55,554 --> 01:11:56,855
Hello.

774
01:11:56,856 --> 01:11:58,569
Detective Morell,
its Mikael Blomkvist.

775
01:11:58,604 --> 01:12:00,212
Yes, Hello.
How are you?

776
01:12:00,247 --> 01:12:03,009
Not still freezing in Hedestad,
I hope for your sake.

777
01:12:03,044 --> 01:12:06,054
You know, The Rebecka Case
that you mentioned.

778
01:12:06,089 --> 01:12:07,872
Would you recall the last name?

779
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:10,510
Of course I do, but what would it
have to do with anything?

780
01:12:10,545 --> 01:12:14,841
- Nothing probably.
- Jocobsson. Rebecka Jocobsson.

781
01:12:16,437 --> 01:12:17,964
How was she killed?

782
01:12:17,999 --> 01:12:22,515
She was decapitated.
Her arms were cut off and she was burned.

783
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:25,479
But all this happened in the 1940s -

784
01:12:27,282 --> 01:12:28,583
What have you found?

785
01:12:28,618 --> 01:12:31,437
- Im gonna have to call you back.
- Why?

786
01:12:44,034 --> 01:12:45,713
- Is it Henrik?
- We were talking.

787
01:12:45,748 --> 01:12:47,744
He started rubbing at his arm
an then collapsed.

788
01:12:47,745 --> 01:12:49,046
Is he gonna be okay?

789
01:12:49,047 --> 01:12:50,832
I cant talk, Mikael,
I honestly don't know -

790
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,134
- You gotta go.
- I'm sorry.

791
01:12:52,135 --> 01:12:53,580
I'll talk to you later.

792
01:13:04,644 --> 01:13:05,945
Good evening.

793
01:13:07,989 --> 01:13:09,625
Come on up,
How is he?

794
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:13,069
Well, The good news is he survived.

795
01:13:13,104 --> 01:13:14,766
How  he does now,
we have to see.

796
01:13:15,342 --> 01:13:17,399
-  Hes in Intensive Care.
- Right.

797
01:13:20,394 --> 01:13:22,045
-  Can I have one of those?
- You want a sandwich?

798
01:13:22,748 --> 01:13:24,955
- A small Scotch.
- Sure thing.

799
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:31,006
Thank you.

800
01:13:31,041 --> 01:13:33,488
I hate to be indelicate. But...

801
01:13:33,523 --> 01:13:36,569
Henrik promised me something
when I agreed to do this.

802
01:13:36,604 --> 01:13:39,111
- Yeah, Wennerstrm.
- I need to know what he has on him.

803
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:42,462
- Now.  In case.
- In case he dies?

804
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:45,602
-  That is indelicate.
- And I apologize.

805
01:13:45,638 --> 01:13:48,450
Well, I dont know what he has on him,
if youre asking me.

806
01:13:48,485 --> 01:13:51,118
And he cant tell you
in the condition hes in.

807
01:13:53,517 --> 01:13:55,975
We also didn't discussed
who Id report

808
01:13:56,011 --> 01:13:59,739
- to if something happened to him.
- Who else, You'd report to me.

809
01:14:00,306 --> 01:14:03,128
We both know nothings going
to come of this, don't we?

810
01:14:04,379 --> 01:14:06,890
No, we don't know that.

811
01:14:06,925 --> 01:14:08,226
What do you mean?

812
01:14:09,088 --> 01:14:11,378
- I may have found something.
- You're joking?

813
01:14:12,221 --> 01:14:13,522
What have you found?

814
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:17,859
The last time I reported on something
without being absolutely sure,

815
01:14:17,894 --> 01:14:19,658
I lost me my life savings.

816
01:14:20,296 --> 01:14:22,965
I need a research assistant.
Can you authorize that?

817
01:14:22,966 --> 01:14:24,283
Yes.

818
01:14:24,284 --> 01:14:27,235
- Do you have one in mind?
- I can find someone.

819
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:30,528
I know a excellent one.  She did the
background check on you.

820
01:14:30,563 --> 01:14:32,000
The what?

821
01:14:32,035 --> 01:14:36,178
You don't think we can hire just anyone
without doing background check?

822
01:14:37,407 --> 01:14:39,034
I want to read it.

823
01:14:39,456 --> 01:14:42,093
Herr Frode was kind enough to share
your report with me.

824
01:14:42,128 --> 01:14:44,979
The investigators name...
That is her name, yes?

825
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:49,974
I can find no record of her, and
Im pretty good at that kind of thing.

826
01:14:50,579 --> 01:14:52,239
Would it really matter?

827
01:14:52,274 --> 01:14:53,816
But It would if I wanted
to speak to her, Yes.

828
01:14:53,817 --> 01:14:55,147
It's against policy.

829
01:14:55,182 --> 01:14:57,858
- You sure?
- Just like your sources. You understand.

830
01:14:57,893 --> 01:14:59,195
Okay.

831
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,853
Here's a name for you.

832
01:15:02,825 --> 01:15:05,359
My sister,
she's also my lawyer.

833
01:15:05,395 --> 01:15:07,242
She'll be contacting you.

834
01:15:07,277 --> 01:15:10,087
Theres information in here that
could only have come from one place.

835
01:15:14,384 --> 01:15:16,817
The reason you can find no record
of her is because

836
01:15:16,852 --> 01:15:18,561
her records have been sealed.

837
01:15:18,596 --> 01:15:20,984
-  Shes a ward of the State.
- What does that have to do with anything?

838
01:15:23,029 --> 01:15:24,837
Shes had a rough life.

839
01:15:25,635 --> 01:15:28,804
Can we please,
not make it rougher on her?

840
01:16:40,045 --> 01:16:41,346
Who is it?

841
01:16:41,919 --> 01:16:43,220
Mikael Blomkvist.

842
01:16:47,972 --> 01:16:51,116
- Actually Im not really up (yet) -
- May I come in? Please.

843
01:16:58,259 --> 01:16:59,561
Hi.

844
01:16:59,562 --> 01:17:01,658
You and I need to talk.
I got us some break...

845
01:17:02,477 --> 01:17:04,254
I'm sorry, I need...

846
01:17:04,884 --> 01:17:06,185
Who do you think you are?

847
01:17:07,116 --> 01:17:09,984
Im the guy you know
better than my closest friends do.

848
01:17:12,055 --> 01:17:14,794
Why don't you put some
clothes  on and get rid of your girlfriend.

849
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:17,150
We need to talk.

850
01:17:26,864 --> 01:17:29,077
I'm sorry,
You have to go.

851
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:30,588
Okay.

852
01:17:45,835 --> 01:17:47,214
Do you need me to stay?

853
01:17:48,996 --> 01:17:50,298
No.

854
01:17:56,588 --> 01:17:58,311
- Bye.
- Bye.

855
01:18:05,853 --> 01:18:07,154
Bye.

856
01:18:07,155 --> 01:18:08,767
- Sorry.
- Bye.

857
01:18:14,669 --> 01:18:17,160
I guess I alarmed you
turning up like that.

858
01:18:17,195 --> 01:18:19,298
If you touch me,
Ill more than alarm you.

859
01:18:19,776 --> 01:18:21,272
That wont be necessary.

860
01:18:22,413 --> 01:18:24,795
Your report, very detailed.

861
01:18:25,275 --> 01:18:26,932
but for me,
It wasn't very entertaining.

862
01:18:26,933 --> 01:18:29,268
- It wasnt meant to be.
- When I write about people,

863
01:18:29,303 --> 01:18:31,342
I try to entertain the reader.

864
01:18:31,377 --> 01:18:33,292
Wennerstrm
wasnt entertained much.

865
01:18:37,555 --> 01:18:40,258
Your boss, Armansky...

866
01:18:41,007 --> 01:18:44,563
He tells me, you only work on things
that interest you.

867
01:18:44,598 --> 01:18:46,413
So, I suppose..
I should be flattered.

868
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:49,176
Are you going to sit down?

869
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:55,506
He also says that
youre the one he goes to

870
01:18:56,646 --> 01:18:58,902
When the jobs is, sensitive

871
01:18:58,937 --> 01:19:03,598
I'm gonna use,illegal, b'cos that's what it was
when you hacked into my computer.

872
01:19:03,634 --> 01:19:06,897
Im not going to do anything about
that.  I could but I wont.

873
01:19:06,932 --> 01:19:11,447
What Im going to dois tell you a story.
If it entertains  you,

874
01:19:11,482 --> 01:19:13,660
maybe youll
decide to help me research further.

875
01:19:13,695 --> 01:19:16,978
And if not, then I'll do the washing
and you'll never see me again.

876
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:22,603
What kind of research?

877
01:19:22,638 --> 01:19:24,974
Lisbeth...
Can I call you Lisbeth?

878
01:19:26,674 --> 01:19:29,243
I want you to help me
catch a killer of women.

879
01:19:30,645 --> 01:19:32,735
I've got "R. J.",
Rebecka Jacobsson.

880
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:35,982
I have absolutely no idea
who the rest of this people are -

881
01:19:36,017 --> 01:19:38,648
or how theyre connected to the death
of a 16 year old girl -

882
01:19:38,683 --> 01:19:40,409
they must be somehow.

883
01:19:40,444 --> 01:19:43,624
So, what we're gonna do is find out who
they are? What happened to them?

884
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:46,944
and what the Leviticus verses
have to do with anything?

885
01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:51,092
What are you doing?

886
01:19:51,093 --> 01:19:53,166
Getting started.  You can keep
talking if you want.

887
01:19:53,201 --> 01:19:56,752
- Don't you need to look over this?
- I got it.

888
01:20:42,874 --> 01:20:44,176
Cat!

889
01:21:14,298 --> 01:21:15,599
How did you get in?

890
01:21:25,503 --> 01:21:27,974
No ones asked me about Magda
in over 40 years.

891
01:21:29,178 --> 01:21:32,232
Why would a young lady like you want
to know about such an aweful murder?

892
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:34,884
- It interests me.
- Does it ?

893
01:21:38,265 --> 01:21:40,066
Her husband was our first suspect -

894
01:21:40,101 --> 01:21:43,397
the husband is always the first
suspect, and usually the last -

895
01:21:43,432 --> 01:21:44,802
but not this time.

896
01:21:44,837 --> 01:21:47,983
We moved on to a neighbor.
Then a vagrant -

897
01:21:49,033 --> 01:21:51,578
Once you get to strangers,
its only a matter of time...

898
01:21:51,613 --> 01:21:55,378
before you get to gypsies,
and you know youre never going to solve it.

899
01:21:55,413 --> 01:21:56,980
How exactly was she killed?

900
01:21:58,704 --> 01:22:00,169
- Miss...
- Salander.

901
01:22:00,204 --> 01:22:02,464
I'm sorry..Miss Salander, I hope,
you dont mind my asking,

902
01:22:02,465 --> 01:22:03,909
whens the last time you ate?

903
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:06,034
I have a high metabolism.
I cant put on weight.

904
01:22:06,685 --> 01:22:10,346
I'm asking because its better to look at
what Im about to show you

905
01:22:11,407 --> 01:22:12,987
on an empty stomach.

906
01:22:16,335 --> 01:22:20,893
<i>If a mans offering is a lamb, it
shall be a female without blemish.</i>

907
01:22:20,928 --> 01:22:23,930
<i>He shall lay his hand upon its head
...slaughter it... </i>

908
01:22:23,965 --> 01:22:26,707
<i>empty its blood
on the base of the altar... </i>

909
01:22:26,742 --> 01:22:28,806
<i>and he shall be forgiven.</i>

910
01:22:33,302 --> 01:22:35,351
- How is he?
- He needs surgery

911
01:22:35,386 --> 01:22:37,399
but theres no DNR in place.

912
01:22:37,434 --> 01:22:40,799
So its up to the family to decide

913
01:22:40,834 --> 01:22:42,302
whether to resuscitate or not,

914
01:22:42,979 --> 01:22:44,925
and theyre not good at decisions.

915
01:22:45,897 --> 01:22:48,165
- Howd it go with Ms. Salander?
- She said yes.

916
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,958
Do you think
I might be able to see him?

917
01:22:49,993 --> 01:22:51,762
He was asleep when I last looked,

918
01:22:51,797 --> 01:22:54,339
- but let me check.
- Thank you.

919
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:55,657
Don't check.

920
01:22:55,658 --> 01:22:58,602
- Tell him to pack his things and leave.
- Mother, please.

921
01:22:59,034 --> 01:23:00,430
Dont use that tone with me.

922
01:23:00,465 --> 01:23:03,015
Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist
works for Henrik.

923
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:05,173
- We should put this to a vote.
- Dont be an idiot, Birger.

924
01:23:05,208 --> 01:23:07,710
We all know what Henrik wants,
Can we please just do that?

925
01:23:07,745 --> 01:23:11,916
Henrik is in there fighting for his life in there.
This is the last thing he needs.

926
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:15,101
Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger,
there's nosmoke in here.

927
01:23:17,466 --> 01:23:18,963
Go back to Stockholm.

928
01:23:18,998 --> 01:23:21,517
When we need a family chronicle

929
01:23:21,552 --> 01:23:25,516
written by a libelist,
we know who to call.

930
01:23:31,533 --> 01:23:32,863
Alright, thanks.

931
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,741
This way, Miss.

932
01:23:40,501 --> 01:23:43,981
<i>If a woman approaches any beast
and dies with it.</i>

933
01:23:44,016 --> 01:23:46,490
<i>He shall kill the woman and the beast,</i>

934
01:23:46,525 --> 01:23:48,863
<i>Their blood shall be upon them.</i>

935
01:24:02,142 --> 01:24:05,419
My family is impossible.
Its why the company is such a mess.

936
01:24:07,325 --> 01:24:09,341
I apologize for my mothers behavior.

937
01:24:09,742 --> 01:24:11,043
I'm use to it.

938
01:24:11,044 --> 01:24:13,478
It has nothing to do with you.
Its between her and Henrik ...

939
01:24:14,068 --> 01:24:16,135
She lost it when my father died.

940
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:21,982
Her drinking..it got so bad
Henrik took me and my sister away from her,

941
01:24:22,934 --> 01:24:27,917
And left her excommunicated,
in our old house on the other side of the island

942
01:24:27,952 --> 01:24:29,701
She hasn't forgiven him.

943
01:24:31,782 --> 01:24:33,154
You, you must stay.

944
01:24:34,327 --> 01:24:37,339
Youre last chance that  Henrik has
at some kind of resolution.

945
01:24:38,311 --> 01:24:41,145
Put this to rest for him one way of the other,
and Ill try to keep my mother away.

946
01:24:42,033 --> 01:24:44,432
But, please, hurry.

947
01:24:44,467 --> 01:24:46,282
Of course.

948
01:24:58,172 --> 01:24:59,473

949
01:24:59,805 --> 01:25:01,296

950
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:04,107

951
01:25:04,142 --> 01:25:05,443
Fine.

952
01:25:10,443 --> 01:25:12,446
- Girlfriend or...
- Assistant.

953
01:25:13,616 --> 01:25:14,917
Thank you, so much.

954
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:17,130
- Good night.
- Good night.

955
01:25:21,962 --> 01:25:23,263
Any trouble finding the place?

956
01:25:23,264 --> 01:25:25,572
Everyone in town knows
who and where you are.

957
01:25:25,607 --> 01:25:28,593
Thats comforting.  Are you hungry?
Want a sandwich?

958
01:25:28,628 --> 01:25:29,929
No.

959

The five cases from
Harriets list.

961
01:25:37,768 --> 01:25:39,482
And five more she missed -

962
01:25:39,517 --> 01:25:40,818
three Im sure about.

963
01:25:41,171 --> 01:25:43,331
Rebecka was the first,

964
01:25:43,366 --> 01:25:45,632

and she has uncovered a fountain of blood."</i>

969
01:25:57,072 --> 01:25:59,123
She was raped and stabbed, but the
cause of death

970
01:25:59,124 --> 01:26:01,777
was suffocation with a
sanitary napkin.

971

990
01:26:53,142 --> 01:26:56,039
The killer uncaged the animals,
smashed the aquariums.

991
01:26:56,074 --> 01:26:57,870
There was a parakeet
inside her.

01:26:58,534 --> 01:27:01,609
Eva Gustavsson, 1960.

999
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:17,404
But what does i have to do
with a teenager on an island?

1000
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,002
She was looking for him, too.

Rape.  Torture.  Fire.  Animals.

-  Anything Im missing?
- The names.

1003
01:27:28,703 --> 01:27:30,004
Theyre all Biblical.

1004
01:27:30,005 --> 01:27:34,006
The first woman, the whore,
the Virgin Mary - Sara, Rakel -

all from
the Old Testament.

1006
01:27:36,721 --> 01:27:38,381
Which means theyre all Jewish.

1007
01:27:40,591 --> 01:27:43,872
If theres one thing the Vangers have
more than their share of, anti-semites.

1008
01:27:47,242 --> 01:27:49,995
There is one.

1009
01:27:53,137 --> 01:27:54,438

1016
01:28:44,714 --> 01:28:47,304
- Theyre encrypted.

1017
01:28:47,339 --> 01:28:48,704
Have some coffee.

1018
01:28:51,877 --> 01:28:55,190
Okay..And then well have a talk
about whats yours and whats mine.

1019
01:28:57,649 --> 01:29:00,133
Its amazing what you figured out
from the parade photos.

1020
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,470
Thank you.

1021
01:29:02,624 --> 01:29:05,237

1022
01:29:07,131 --> 01:29:08,432
Her.

1023
01:29:12,725 --> 01:29:14,026
Sorry.

1024
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:24,339
There's the one.
Where the fuck is that...?

1025
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:32,562
What does that say there ?

1026
01:29:33,513 --> 01:29:37,709
- N, something, R, S, J -
- Norsjo.

1027
01:29:37,744 --> 01:29:40,979
Then something, K,
something, R, I, F,

1028
01:29:41,014 --> 01:29:42,315
Carpentry.

1029
01:29:43,512 --> 01:29:45,177
Where do we go for a carpenter.

1030
01:29:48,135 --> 01:29:49,436
Fuck!

1031
01:30:43,843 --> 01:30:45,513
The carpentry shop is gone.

1032
01:30:45,548 --> 01:30:48,726
I dont know even know if he worked
there or not. But If he did, maybe he used to

1033
01:30:48,761 --> 01:30:50,942
use to come in
here to buy hardware.

1034
01:30:50,977 --> 01:30:52,862
I dont recognize him.
Sorry.

1035
01:30:54,146 --> 01:30:55,554
I had to start somewhere.

1036
01:30:56,392 --> 01:30:57,737
Im no detective, but...

1037
01:30:57,772 --> 01:31:02,272
...1966, I wouldve started at
the retirement home.

1038
01:31:08,984 --> 01:31:12,267
- This is Brannlunds kid.
- Do you know where I might find him, the son?

1039
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:14,803
Next to his father
at the cemetery.

1040
01:31:15,566 --> 01:31:19,611
He was killed in an accident on a job
site years ago.

1041
01:31:21,634 --> 01:31:27,427
But uh..she might still be alive -
His widow.

1042
01:31:28,021 --> 01:31:29,570
Do you know where I might find her?

1043
01:31:41,192 --> 01:31:45,163
In 1966, you were in Hedestad
with your husband.

1044
01:31:47,509 --> 01:31:49,890
- Who took this?
- A local photographer.

1045
01:31:50,484 --> 01:31:52,387
You were taking pictures, too.
That day and ..

1046
01:31:52,422 --> 01:31:55,559
I'd love to at them, if by some miracle
you still have them.

1047
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:58,209
It wouldnt be a miracle.  We were on
our honeymoon.

1048
01:31:58,244 --> 01:31:59,546
But why?

1049
01:32:01,715 --> 01:32:04,325
This, this girl there...I need you
to see it better in an enlargement.

1050
01:32:04,326 --> 01:32:05,628
So that's you there.
Just after this was taken...

1051
01:32:05,629 --> 01:32:08,773
After, she'd seen something
across the street,

1052
01:32:08,808 --> 01:32:10,109
She was murdered.

1053
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,122
How awful!

1054
01:32:25,151 --> 01:32:26,642
- There you are.
- Thank  you.

1055
01:32:46,006 --> 01:32:48,031
Would you mind
if I made a copy of this?

1056
01:32:48,591 --> 01:32:49,895
No.

1057
01:32:50,783 --> 01:32:54,322
<font color="#3399FF">TECH CLERK:</font>I cant give you
any of this stuff without authorization
from Mr. Armansky.

1058
01:32:54,357 --> 01:32:55,962
So call him.

1059
01:33:04,067 --> 01:33:06,092
Next time,
fill out the proper paperwork.

1060
01:33:18,405 --> 01:33:19,887
Which one are you?

1061
01:33:42,765 --> 01:33:44,180
Hows your sex life?

1062
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:48,538
I didnt care much
for your last report.

1063
01:33:48,573 --> 01:33:51,104
It's so perfunctory,
like your hearwasnt in it.

1064
01:33:51,567 --> 01:33:54,614
Lets see a little more enthusiasm
for my recovery in next months.

1065
01:33:54,649 --> 01:33:56,159
- But...
- Don't speak!

1066
01:33:56,194 --> 01:33:58,288
I dont want to hear your voice.
Just nod.

1067
01:33:58,323 --> 01:33:59,819
Start looking for a shrink
you can bribe, this way..

1068
01:33:59,854 --> 01:34:02,736
under oath, he can find
absolutely nothing wrong with me.

1069
01:34:03,811 --> 01:34:06,154
And stop visiting
tattoo removal websites,

1070
01:34:06,608 --> 01:34:07,910
or Ill do it again -

1071
01:34:09,539 --> 01:34:10,840
right here.

1072
01:36:59,879 --> 01:37:01,527
- Is that  dental floss?
- Yes.

1073
01:37:05,327 --> 01:37:06,803
you sterilize that,
Right?

1074
01:37:11,263 --> 01:37:13,213
Couldn't we just use tape
or something ?

1075
01:37:13,249 --> 01:37:14,550
No.

1076
01:37:16,237 --> 01:37:17,539
What ?

1077
01:37:21,834 --> 01:37:23,443
- Jesus!
- Drink.

1078
01:37:27,562 --> 01:37:30,568
- Just, be careful, its my eye.
- Don't move.

1079
01:37:30,603 --> 01:37:32,343
You're not a doctor.

1080
01:37:46,512 --> 01:37:47,813
Take off your wet clothes.

1081
01:37:51,064 --> 01:37:52,365
Thank you.

1082
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,869
I think it stopped bleeding.
That fucking hurts.

1083
01:38:13,673 --> 01:38:16,935
Fucking madness.

1084
01:38:25,933 --> 01:38:27,235
Jesus, That hurts.

1085
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:28,743
Fuck.

1086
01:38:34,649 --> 01:38:37,414
This is insane.
I mean this people...

1087
01:38:38,619 --> 01:38:41,792
Somebody was shooting  at me...
It wasnt an accident...

1088
01:38:41,827 --> 01:38:43,418
No ones shooting at you now.

1089
01:38:47,491 --> 01:38:49,364
You know, Im pretty sure
this is a bad idea.

1090
01:38:49,399 --> 01:38:50,732
Why?

1091
01:38:50,767 --> 01:38:53,129
Apart from the fact that Im old and
we work together.

1092
01:38:53,164 --> 01:38:55,429
You work with whats-her-name.
Thats worked out for you.

1093
01:38:55,464 --> 01:38:58,035
I have some standards,
believe it or not.

1094
01:38:59,713 --> 01:39:01,492
You need to stop talking.

1095
01:39:45,494 --> 01:39:47,024
You want me to open a window?

1096
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:17,226
- I like working with you.
- I like working with you, too.

1097
01:40:24,659 --> 01:40:26,037
It could have been a stray shot.

1098
01:40:26,072 --> 01:40:28,626
Not that Gunner. If he wanted to
shoot him, It wouldn't have been here.

1099
01:40:29,393 --> 01:40:32,630
And then, we have poachers.
They shoot at anything that moves.

1100
01:40:32,665 --> 01:40:34,836
Or hes right, Dirch.
What if he is?

1101
01:40:35,593 --> 01:40:37,755
- This has to stop.
- Do you want to stop, Mikael?

1102
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:40,086
I have police reports, photos,

1103
01:40:40,656 --> 01:40:43,202
Henriks notes, my own notes,
and Lisbeths research.

1104
01:40:43,203 --> 01:40:45,818
What I dont have is
Vanger Industries records.

1105
01:40:45,853 --> 01:40:47,769
- Thats what I want.
- Why?

1106
01:40:48,295 --> 01:40:49,596
Will you authorize it?

1107
01:40:49,597 --> 01:40:51,478
The private corporate records?

1108
01:40:51,907 --> 01:40:53,208
How far back?

1109
01:40:53,209 --> 01:40:54,996
Henrik said I have access to
everything I needed.

1110
01:40:54,997 --> 01:40:56,964
- This is what I need.
- Thats not what he meant.

1111
01:40:56,965 --> 01:40:59,308
I'll sign a nondisclosure statement,
if that would help..

1112
01:41:04,252 --> 01:41:07,064
- You think Henrik would say yes.
- Thats why he has me.

1113
01:41:07,778 --> 01:41:10,350
To protect him from himself.
This is insane.

1114
01:41:11,117 --> 01:41:14,378
- What do we have to hide?
- After a 120 years of business?

1115
01:41:14,658 --> 01:41:16,023
Probably, a lot.

1116
01:41:16,058 --> 01:41:18,770
If this is what he needs to finish,
he should have permission.

1117
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:24,600
What am I looking for?

1118
01:41:25,564 --> 01:41:27,776
Any connections between
Vanger Industries -

1119
01:41:28,181 --> 01:41:29,922
and the towns where
the women were killed...

1120
01:41:31,126 --> 01:41:32,841
and everything about Frode.

1121
01:42:25,495 --> 01:42:28,406
Your father was taking pictures
that day no one has seen.

1122
01:42:28,955 --> 01:42:30,257
I'd like to take a look at that.

1123
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:33,100
- So ask him.
- I was wondering if you could do that?

1124
01:42:33,135 --> 01:42:34,974
I dont speak to him,
as you know.

1125
01:42:35,009 --> 01:42:36,996
You couldnt make an exception
in my case.

1126
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:39,726
Are you afraid to be in
the same  room with him?

1127
01:42:39,761 --> 01:42:41,062
Im not saying you shouldnt be.

1128
01:42:42,283 --> 01:42:43,585
You wont help me?

1129
01:42:45,734 --> 01:42:47,065
Sorry.

1130
01:42:52,582 --> 01:42:53,883
Please.

1131
01:42:54,499 --> 01:42:55,800
Are you finished?

1132
01:42:55,801 --> 01:42:58,457
I need to know where all the factories,
offices and projects were

1133
01:42:58,458 --> 01:43:00,962
from 1949 to 1966.

1134
01:43:00,997 --> 01:43:03,277
- You already have everything.
- No, I dont.

1135
01:43:03,313 --> 01:43:05,029
Nothing on subsidiary corporations,

1136
01:43:05,064 --> 01:43:07,863
- partnerships, or suppliers.
- Then youll have to do without.

1137
01:43:07,898 --> 01:43:09,861
Mr. Frode said I have access
to whatever I need, and..

1138
01:43:09,896 --> 01:43:12,367
- this is what I need.
- He said you have access to this floor.

1139
01:43:12,886 --> 01:43:14,255
Call Him.

1140
01:43:51,712 --> 01:43:53,013
Thank you, for seeing me.

1141
01:43:55,532 --> 01:43:56,833
Come in.

1142
01:43:58,847 --> 01:44:00,288
- Tea?
- Please.

1143
01:44:09,176 --> 01:44:11,894
Sven Olof Lindholm.
Me.

1144
01:44:12,632 --> 01:44:13,934
Handsome.

1145
01:44:14,777 --> 01:44:17,415
Birger Furugard.
Me.

1146
01:44:18,793 --> 01:44:20,215
Per Engdahl.

1147
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:24,754
But your interest is in my more
candid photographic work.

1148
01:44:24,789 --> 01:44:26,930
Friends,
Relations, that kind of thing.

1149
01:44:27,849 --> 01:44:29,150
Please.

1150
01:44:55,363 --> 01:44:58,488
- "Blom" ou "Blum"?
- Blomkvist.

1151
01:45:00,513 --> 01:45:02,258
Im not a recluse.

1152
01:45:03,817 --> 01:45:06,760
I dont close my door to anyone.

1153
01:45:06,795 --> 01:45:08,930
They just dont
visit.

1154
01:45:12,144 --> 01:45:14,332
Perhaps if you redecorated.

1155
01:45:14,367 --> 01:45:16,715
Hide the past like they do.

1156
01:45:17,277 --> 01:45:19,585
Under a thin, shiny veneer.

1157
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:21,203
Like an Ikea table..

1158
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:23,799
Im the most honest of all of them.

1159
01:45:23,834 --> 01:45:26,639
- The family?
- Sweden.

1160
01:45:37,573 --> 01:45:42,660
Landscape?
Some nice landscapes there.

1161
01:45:42,695 --> 01:45:45,235
Who is this there?
The blurry one.

1162
01:45:46,222 --> 01:45:47,523
I can't tell.

1163
01:45:48,635 --> 01:45:51,785
- Thats Gottfrieds boy.
- Martin?

1164
01:45:51,820 --> 01:45:54,818
Handsome but useless young man,
Like his father.

1165
01:46:08,844 --> 01:46:10,154
Were closing.

1166
01:46:10,189 --> 01:46:11,657
Nowhere near finished.

1167
01:46:13,463 --> 01:46:15,117
I'm not authorized to stay late.

1168
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:16,419
I am.

1169
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:19,138
And I need access to all the
rooms, including any that are locked.

1170
01:46:22,467 --> 01:46:23,870
Call Frode.

1171
01:46:34,087 --> 01:46:35,882
Leave the keys with the guard.

1180
01:50:47,721 --> 01:50:49,088
Martin?

1181
01:54:07,088 --> 01:54:08,393
Mikael?

1182
01:54:11,606 --> 01:54:12,907
Hi there.

1183
01:54:13,897 --> 01:54:15,483
Your evening stroll?

1184
01:54:16,425 --> 01:54:18,025
That's right, I...

1185
01:54:20,849 --> 01:54:22,265
- How are you?
- Good.

1186
01:54:24,194 --> 01:54:26,466
I stopped at the hospital
on my way home.

1187
01:54:27,454 --> 01:54:29,338
Henrik asked me
to ask you something.

1188
01:54:29,670 --> 01:54:30,971
What was that?

1189
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:34,330
Come on in,
Ill make you a drink.

1190
01:55:23,246 --> 01:55:24,591
Hello, Martin.

1191
01:55:26,223 --> 01:55:28,129
Shut the door,
It's quite windy.

1192
01:55:33,795 --> 01:55:35,461
- What happened to  you?
- When?

1193
01:55:35,496 --> 01:55:36,797
Just now.

1194
01:55:38,836 --> 01:55:41,090
- I fell in the dark.
- You don't have a flashlight?

1195
01:55:41,824 --> 01:55:44,628
- I'll get you one.
- I just wasn't being careful.

1196
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:53,704
How the investigations going?

1197
01:55:54,745 --> 01:55:56,699
- Nothing New.  To report..
- No?

1198
01:55:57,623 --> 01:56:01,749
Dirch says, the girl is really clever.

1199
01:56:06,767 --> 01:56:08,086
Maybe, she'll turn something up.

1200
01:56:08,121 --> 01:56:10,216
Maybe.
Thank you.

1201
01:56:17,476 --> 01:56:19,174
- So, What did he say?
- What?

1202
01:56:19,209 --> 01:56:21,605
You said Henrik asked
you to ask me something.

1203
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:23,929
- Well, I just did.
- What?

1204
01:56:23,965 --> 01:56:25,368
How the investigations going.

1205
01:56:26,881 --> 01:56:28,183
That was his question.

1206
01:56:35,502 --> 01:56:36,803
Do You hunt?

1207
01:56:37,817 --> 01:56:40,337
- We should go hunting together sometime.
- Sure.

1208
01:56:43,954 --> 01:56:45,294
Nothing at all?

1209
01:56:46,180 --> 01:56:49,381
- New.  To report?
- No. Nothing.

1210
01:56:50,001 --> 01:56:52,202
- I can see youre anxious.
- No.

1211
01:56:52,237 --> 01:56:54,516
I mean, to get home.
After the walk.

1212
01:56:54,551 --> 01:56:56,529
Yeah, Sorry.
I suppose I am.

1213
01:56:56,564 --> 01:56:59,470
To have dinner.
With your girlfriend.

1214
01:56:59,505 --> 01:57:00,828
Assistant.

1215
01:57:04,306 --> 01:57:06,271
Well have better luck
with a gun.

1216
01:57:06,306 --> 01:57:08,370
- I'm sorry?
- When we go hunting.

1217
01:57:09,973 --> 01:57:13,165
A gun.
Rather than a knife.

1218
01:57:16,618 --> 01:57:18,011
I want to show you something.

1219
01:57:20,069 --> 01:57:23,019
Bring your drink.
Leave my knife.

1220
01:57:39,381 --> 01:57:40,683
To the right.

1221
01:57:47,015 --> 01:57:49,077
You know whats harder than
shooting someone?

1222
01:57:50,169 --> 01:57:51,158
Just missing them.

1223
01:57:51,159 --> 01:57:54,373
That was a very good shot
up at the cabin.

1224
01:57:54,543 --> 01:57:57,173
It didnt work.  Im here.

1225
01:57:57,208 --> 01:58:01,102
Mikael, it did work.
Youre here.

1226
01:58:33,623 --> 01:58:35,002
Inside.

1227
01:59:14,592 --> 01:59:15,894
You spilled your drink.

1228
01:59:27,985 --> 01:59:29,727
Why didnt you just go home?

1229
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:31,841
May I?

1230
01:59:37,335 --> 01:59:38,636
Howd you do it?

1231
01:59:40,603 --> 01:59:41,924
What did you find?

1232
01:59:45,390 --> 01:59:47,504
We can talk or
we can just get on with it.

1233
01:59:48,526 --> 01:59:52,312
I found a picture
no one had seen before.

1234
01:59:53,063 --> 01:59:54,702
- Of?
- You.

1235
01:59:54,737 --> 01:59:58,347
- In your Uppsala prep school blazer.
- What does that proof?

1236
01:59:58,382 --> 02:00:00,937
It shows that you lied about
where you were that day.

1237
02:00:00,972 --> 02:00:03,607
- Was I?
-  Or rather when.

1238
02:00:03,642 --> 02:00:06,003
So what.
People lie all the time.

1239
02:00:06,038 --> 02:00:09,847
It also said that Lena Andersson
was a schoolmate.

1240
02:00:09,882 --> 02:00:11,183
Lena...

1241
02:00:12,769 --> 02:00:14,530
That was a long time ago.

1242
02:00:16,285 --> 02:00:19,325
Wheres this photo now? Is it with all
the other crap on your desk?

1243
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:24,233
There's a cope of that on my laptop,
And there's another on a secure website.

1244
02:00:25,329 --> 02:00:26,708
Thats a lie ...

1245
02:00:28,805 --> 02:00:33,352
How much does the girl know?
I hope its as much as you.

1246
02:00:33,387 --> 02:00:37,002
Thatll make it more fun.
Where is she?

1247
02:00:37,037 --> 02:00:39,285
Stockholm.
She went this morning.

1248
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:40,764
And thats a lie.

1249
02:00:41,366 --> 02:00:44,661
Shes atour offices
looking at more old crap.

1250
02:00:44,696 --> 02:00:48,256
I got a call from our archives manager -
she's very perturbed -

1251
02:00:48,291 --> 02:00:52,896
with this girl.  Lisbeth.
I like that name.  Lisbeth.

1252
02:00:54,314 --> 02:00:56,088
So, when Lisbeth leaves

1253
02:00:56,968 --> 02:00:58,553
Ill get a call from security,
so I can be

1254
02:00:58,588 --> 02:01:01,035
at your cottage
to greet her.

1255
02:01:03,536 --> 02:01:06,383
I cant thank you enough
for bringing her to me.

1256
02:01:07,233 --> 02:01:08,534
Mikael?

1257
02:01:35,104 --> 02:01:36,641
So what would you like to know?

1258
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:42,123
Youre the journalist,
ask me questions.

1259
02:01:47,401 --> 02:01:50,971
What do I do with my girls?
That's a good question.

1260
02:01:51,651 --> 02:01:55,979
Well, before - I do what were doing. Sit down,
Relax, have a drink,

1261
02:01:56,014 --> 02:01:57,571
I like that part a lot -

1262
02:01:57,606 --> 02:02:01,006
having a chat when you both know
that one of you is going to die.

1263
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:04,935
After - I simply get rid of them.
Far out to the sea -

1264
02:02:05,790 --> 02:02:07,204
- unlike my father

1265
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:10,450
leaving them scattered all over
the place like trophies.

1266
02:02:10,485 --> 02:02:12,392
Thats not smart if you ask me.

1267
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:14,871
But he was a garish and loud man.

1268
02:02:15,545 --> 02:02:17,571
he got what he deserved.

1269
02:02:18,879 --> 02:02:20,867
You cant be a sloppy technician like that.

1270
02:02:21,372 --> 02:02:23,682
You cant drink to excess
like he did.

1271
02:02:23,717 --> 02:02:25,471
This takes discipline.

1272
02:02:26,111 --> 02:02:28,899
Its a science of a thousand details.

1273
02:02:28,934 --> 02:02:32,841
The planning. The execution.
The cleanup.

1274
02:02:33,663 --> 02:02:38,317
Im sure I dont have to tell you
youre going to make quite a mess.

1275
02:02:41,913 --> 02:02:43,754
Let me ask you something.

1276
02:02:43,789 --> 02:02:45,975
Why dont people trust their instincts?

1277
02:02:47,386 --> 02:02:50,983
They sense somethings wrong - someones
walking too close behind them -

1278
02:02:52,004 --> 02:02:54,413
You  knew something was wrong -

1279
02:02:54,449 --> 02:02:59,005
but you came back into the house.
Did I force you? Did I drag you in? No.

1280
02:03:00,327 --> 02:03:03,626
All I had to do was..
offered you a drink.

1281
02:03:04,557 --> 02:03:06,766
Youd never think the fear of offending
can be stronger

1282
02:03:06,801 --> 02:03:09,804
than the fear of pain -
but you know what?

1283
02:03:09,839 --> 02:03:11,596
It is.

1284
02:03:13,588 --> 02:03:15,856
They always come willingly.

1285
02:03:15,891 --> 02:03:18,649
And then they sit here.
They know its over like..

1286
02:03:18,684 --> 02:03:20,060
you do - But somehow..

1287
02:03:20,095 --> 02:03:22,724
they still think
they have a chance.

1288
02:03:22,759 --> 02:03:26,707
<i>Maybe if I say the right thing -
Maybe if Im polite - </i>

1289
02:03:27,142 --> 02:03:29,200
<i>or I cry and beg - "</i>

1290
02:03:29,994 --> 02:03:32,388
when I see the hope draining
from their face like it is

1291
02:03:32,423 --> 02:03:34,279
from yours right now -

1292
02:03:34,904 --> 02:03:36,208
I feel myself...

1293
02:03:37,501 --> 02:03:39,229
getting hard.

1294
02:03:40,378 --> 02:03:42,608
We are not that different,
You and I.

1295
02:03:42,643 --> 02:03:44,325
We both have urges.

1296
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:48,993
Satisfying mine,
requires more towels.

1297
02:04:11,238 --> 02:04:16,927
It might amuse you to know that while you
were upstairs having mousse with me and Liv -

1298
02:04:18,576 --> 02:04:21,686
who, by the way,
finds me very conventional -

1299
02:04:23,327 --> 02:04:25,789
I had Irina was down here
in the cage.

1300
02:04:26,380 --> 02:04:27,906
Whos Irina, you might ask?

1301
02:04:28,635 --> 02:04:30,177
Just another girl.

1302
02:04:31,225 --> 02:04:35,770
Just another immigrant whore.
Who misses them?

1303
02:04:35,805 --> 02:04:37,905
- Your sister wasnt.
- What?

1304
02:04:38,363 --> 02:04:42,359
Your sister, Harriet,
wasnt just another girl.

1305
02:04:43,356 --> 02:04:44,657
You found her?

1306
02:04:46,742 --> 02:04:48,043
What happened to her?

1307
02:04:50,736 --> 02:04:52,506
<i>You killed her. </i>

1308
02:04:57,723 --> 02:04:59,877
You useless fuckin detective.

1309
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:06,470
Is that too tight to talk?

1310
02:05:07,139 --> 02:05:09,291
Good.
Im tired of talking to you.

1311
02:05:47,133 --> 02:05:49,002
Ive never had a man in
here, before.

1312
02:05:55,397 --> 02:05:58,169
In fact, Ive never touched a man.
Except my father.

1313
02:06:00,819 --> 02:06:02,121
But it was our duty.

1314
02:06:03,914 --> 02:06:05,216
Harriets and Mine.

1315
02:06:37,705 --> 02:06:40,147
There's a gun in the television.

1316
02:06:46,954 --> 02:06:48,285
May I kill him?

1317
02:09:58,328 --> 02:10:03,421
How come a 23 years old
can be a ward of the state?

1318
02:10:07,507 --> 02:10:09,210
Im mentally incompetent

1319
02:10:09,245 --> 02:10:11,312
and cant manage daily life.

1320
02:10:14,038 --> 02:10:19,049
- Since when have they said that?
- Since I was twelve.

1321
02:10:21,282 --> 02:10:23,129
Something happened
when you were twelve?

1322
02:10:26,691 --> 02:10:29,853
I'm sorry,
That's none of my business.

1323
02:10:33,002 --> 02:10:34,683
I tried to kill my father.

1324
02:10:37,051 --> 02:10:42,604
I burned him alive.
Got about 80 percent of him.

1325
02:10:50,575 --> 02:10:51,876
I'll make some coffee.

1326
02:10:56,818 --> 02:10:58,785
- Who is it?
- It's Harriet.

1327
02:10:59,591 --> 02:11:01,169
I found it in Martin's basement.

1328
02:11:01,204 --> 02:11:03,381
Among his souverneers.

1329
02:11:04,127 --> 02:11:06,431
Martin didnt deny killing anyone.

1330
02:11:07,778 --> 02:11:10,641
But when I mentioned Harriet,
he was confused.

1331
02:11:11,264 --> 02:11:14,759
He was angry - at me - b'cos
I couldn't tell him what happened to her.

1332
02:11:15,682 --> 02:11:17,110
He didnt kill her.

1333
02:11:18,373 --> 02:11:21,471
And his father didn't do it.
He was dead the year before.

1334
02:11:23,266 --> 02:11:26,676
What if she did somehow get away?

1335
02:11:27,863 --> 02:11:29,278
And if...

1336
02:11:30,941 --> 02:11:33,117
she's still alive?

1337
02:11:34,598 --> 02:11:38,150
Theres only one person in this family
who would know where she is.

1338
02:12:06,947 --> 02:12:08,248
Fuck me, fuck me.

1339
02:12:28,575 --> 02:12:29,876
Your turn.

1340
02:12:30,533 --> 02:12:31,834
Right.

1341
02:12:32,858 --> 02:12:34,159
Yeah.

1342
02:12:51,585 --> 02:12:52,890
Hi.

1343
02:12:52,925 --> 02:12:55,245
-  I'm Sorry to bother you.
- What do you want?

1344
02:12:55,771 --> 02:12:57,751
- No ones called you?
- About?

1345
02:12:57,786 --> 02:12:59,573
Your cousin, Martin.

1346
02:13:01,083 --> 02:13:02,384
What about him?

1347
02:13:03,379 --> 02:13:06,839
He died in a car accidentlast Thursday.
There's going to be a memorial...

1348
02:13:06,874 --> 02:13:09,298
Im not interested in any memorial.

1349
02:13:10,238 --> 02:13:12,713
- I understand.
- What do you understand.?

1350
02:13:12,748 --> 02:13:15,242
That you dont care
very much of your relatives.

1351
02:13:15,277 --> 02:13:18,177
-  I just, thought you should know.
- Now, I know.

1352
02:13:28,607 --> 02:13:29,908
Howd it go?

1353
02:13:30,274 --> 02:13:33,145
- Okay.  I think.
- Shes on.

1354
02:13:41,726 --> 02:13:43,385
And she's shopping.

1355
02:13:53,629 --> 02:13:55,837
Shes playing solitaire?

1356
02:13:55,872 --> 02:13:57,592
- And she still hasnt called anyone?
- No.

1357
02:13:58,236 --> 02:13:59,780
Do we have her cell phone, too?

1358
02:14:01,924 --> 02:14:03,818
I was so shed lead us to her.

1359
02:14:04,283 --> 02:14:05,931
Put your hand back in my shirt.

1360
02:14:09,699 --> 02:14:11,646
Theres only one reason she
hasnt call Harriet.

1361
02:14:12,182 --> 02:14:14,886
She cant,
because Harriet is dead.

1362
02:14:17,403 --> 02:14:19,958
- I was just thinking.  What if -...
- Just one second.

1363
02:14:35,017 --> 02:14:36,364
What were you going to say?

1364
02:14:37,556 --> 02:14:40,351
I was just thinking, there could be
one other possibility.

1365
02:14:51,521 --> 02:14:53,899
- What is it now?
- Before he died,

1366
02:14:53,934 --> 02:14:56,031
your brother hung me
from a hook ...

1367
02:14:58,311 --> 02:14:59,749
Harriet.

1368
02:15:03,053 --> 02:15:06,147
- So you send the flowers?
- Yes.

1369
02:15:06,977 --> 02:15:10,691
We found in the Swedish General Registry,
Annita was married.

1370
02:15:11,144 --> 02:15:12,866
But the family never knew,
did they?

1371
02:15:14,070 --> 02:15:18,287
So, Im guessing she then came here
on a married name passport

1372
02:15:18,322 --> 02:15:19,668
you followed on her
maiden name passport.

1373
02:15:19,703 --> 02:15:22,574
No, Actually, it was the other way around.

1374
02:15:22,609 --> 02:15:26,700
She thought that it safer for me
to travel with Spencer myself.

1375
02:15:27,435 --> 02:15:29,055
What did he think about that?

1376
02:15:29,358 --> 02:15:31,890
Nothing.  Only that he loved her.

1377
02:15:32,957 --> 02:15:34,623
She said, If you love me, youll do

1378
02:15:34,658 --> 02:15:37,189
this and not ask why.

1379
02:15:37,224 --> 02:15:38,710
He never did.

1380
02:15:38,745 --> 02:15:40,400
And they both died twenty years ago.

1381
02:15:40,435 --> 02:15:42,006
A car accident.

1382
02:15:42,427 --> 02:15:43,851
You found that, too.

1383
02:15:49,755 --> 02:15:51,056
Is that you?

1384
02:15:58,116 --> 02:16:01,963
I was 14 the first time he raped me.

1385
02:16:01,998 --> 02:16:05,392
- Martin?
- No, my father.

1386
02:16:05,427 --> 02:16:08,610
Martin only started,
after he died.

1387
02:16:09,247 --> 02:16:10,763
Why didnt you tell someone?

1388
02:16:10,798 --> 02:16:12,770
I did.  My mother.

1389
02:16:13,265 --> 02:16:14,624
Henrik would have done something.

1390
02:16:14,659 --> 02:16:18,854
I almost   told him.  But I was afraid
because of what I've done.

1391
02:16:19,861 --> 02:16:21,162
I uh...

1392
02:16:21,163 --> 02:16:23,529
You still dont understand, Do you?

1393
02:16:24,874 --> 02:16:26,589
A year after the first time -

1394
02:16:27,498 --> 02:16:30,877
There were many times
during that year -

1395
02:16:32,796 --> 02:16:35,634
my father got drunker
than usual one night

1396
02:16:37,477 --> 02:16:38,863
and started bragging...

1397
02:16:39,859 --> 02:16:42,776
about women hed killed.

1398
02:16:43,595 --> 02:16:46,615
He quoted from the Bible
as he tore off my clothes.

1399
02:16:47,474 --> 02:16:50,325
He tiedd a belt around my neck.

1400
02:16:50,668 --> 02:16:52,032
He
wanted to kill  me.

1401
02:16:54,586 --> 02:16:55,956
I uh...

1402
02:16:55,991 --> 02:16:59,255
I made it out of the house and
I went down to the dock.

1403
02:16:59,667 --> 02:17:01,901
He came staggering
after me -

1404
02:17:04,244 --> 02:17:06,777
I could never fight him off
in a small space,

1405
02:17:06,812 --> 02:17:09,595
but out in the open..

1406
02:17:10,048 --> 02:17:12,703
I was strong enough to deal
with an old drunk.

1407
02:17:16,056 --> 02:17:18,130
When it was over...

1408
02:17:19,381 --> 02:17:24,675
I looked up, Martin was standing there -
looking at me.

1409
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:29,885
All Id accomplished was
substitute one for another.

1410
02:17:32,537 --> 02:17:37,026
A couple months later, Henrik sent
Martin to school in Uppsala.

1411
02:17:37,478 --> 02:17:42,949
And I thought maybe -
just maybe - the nightmare was finally over.

1412
02:17:44,384 --> 02:17:47,364
And then I saw him.

1413
02:17:48,259 --> 02:17:49,751
across the street -

1414
02:17:50,795 --> 02:17:54,466
And I knew..
It would never be over.

1415
02:17:55,614 --> 02:17:57,532
Howd you escaped?

1416
02:17:57,567 --> 02:17:59,017
Annita...

1417
02:18:00,373 --> 02:18:02,803
She insisted that I leave
everything behind.

1418
02:18:03,805 --> 02:18:07,891
If I took anything, the police
might've suspected that I was still alive.

1419
02:18:08,936 --> 02:18:13,946
While everyone was eating dinner,
I was alone 20 meters away from them.

1420
02:18:15,138 --> 02:18:18,745
I spend the night there,
That's when the set-up started.

1421
02:18:19,706 --> 02:18:22,132
In the morning,
she came to get me.

1422
02:18:23,458 --> 02:18:27,497
I'd grown up with that bridge
as my link to home.

1423
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:32,441
But all I could think is,
If I could just get away for a moment,

1424
02:18:33,765 --> 02:18:35,907
Just get passed the police.

1425
02:18:36,910 --> 02:18:39,636
I might be safe.

1426
02:18:42,090 --> 02:18:46,011
And I was.
Until, you showed up.

1427
02:18:47,934 --> 02:18:49,464
You're safe now.

1428
02:18:51,964 --> 02:18:53,533
How did you got away?

1429
02:18:55,389 --> 02:18:57,192
Someone saved me too.

1430
02:19:10,254 --> 02:19:11,839
- How're you feeling?
- I'm fine.

1431
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:13,141
Thank you, Anna.

1432
02:19:15,157 --> 02:19:17,315
I made you a promise.

1433
02:19:19,572 --> 02:19:22,210
Whether you found anything,
or not.

1434
02:19:26,420 --> 02:19:29,635
So, What do you have to tell me?

1435
02:20:00,042 --> 02:20:01,620
Hello, Henrik.

1436
02:20:21,432 --> 02:20:23,506
I dont even remember Wennerstrom
working here, much less

1437
02:20:23,541 --> 02:20:25,354
- being fired.
- How could you?

1438
02:20:25,389 --> 02:20:26,878
It was a long time ago.

1439
02:20:26,913 --> 02:20:31,208
Which is kind of more to the point than
the money he embezzled to start...

1440
02:20:31,243 --> 02:20:33,606
If you're referring to
the statued of limitation...

1441
02:20:33,641 --> 02:20:36,589
I had no idea, this was what
Henrik was holding out. If I had,

1442
02:20:36,624 --> 02:20:40,654
I never would have let him bring you up here.
He wasnt trying to deceive you.

1443
02:20:40,655 --> 02:20:41,655
Oh, Come on, he knows you cant try
somebody after 35 years after the event.

1444
02:20:43,569 --> 02:20:45,452
I like Henrik,
but he knows that.

1445
02:20:45,487 --> 02:20:47,679
A mans reputation used to mean
something -

1446
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:48,981
he still believes that.

1447
02:20:48,982 --> 02:20:51,921
Im sure he thought you could destroy
Wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion.

1448
02:20:51,956 --> 02:20:56,525
The court of public opinion,
now celebrates people's bad behaviour.

1449
02:20:56,560 --> 02:20:59,567
He promised me
Wennerstroms carcass on a plate.

1450
02:20:59,602 --> 02:21:02,878
This isnt even the plate.
I cant do anything with this.

1451
02:21:02,913 --> 02:21:04,605
Of course...

1452
02:21:08,552 --> 02:21:09,967
What happened with Wennerstrm?

1453
02:21:10,785 --> 02:21:12,086
How did he get you?

1454
02:21:13,102 --> 02:21:14,404
I was stupid.

1455
02:21:15,442 --> 02:21:17,884
I got something, I got it from
an anonymous source..

1456
02:21:17,919 --> 02:21:20,099
Who I'm sure, was one of
Wennerstrm's lakies

1457
02:21:22,573 --> 02:21:25,701
Which
he easily proved in court.

1458
02:21:26,923 --> 02:21:29,151
You were emphatic that the way I
looked into your life was illegal

1459
02:21:29,186 --> 02:21:30,860
and immoral.

1460
02:21:30,895 --> 02:21:32,802
Would you feel the same
about Wennerstrm?

1461
02:21:32,837 --> 02:21:34,214
Go on.

1462
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:37,089
I did some work on my own on him,
before you hired me.

1463
02:21:37,090 --> 02:21:38,637
I havent had a chance to look at it all -

1464
02:21:38,672 --> 02:21:42,024
B'cos you and Harriet-fucking-Vanger
have kept me busy ...

1465
02:21:44,024 --> 02:21:47,516
-  but I may have something.
- You may have something?

1466
02:21:49,027 --> 02:21:50,328
Maybe.

1467
02:21:50,486 --> 02:21:52,946
They launder money from arms and drug
sales, and

1468
02:21:52,981 --> 02:21:54,682
crime syndicates in Russia.

1469
02:21:54,717 --> 02:21:58,229
And that money - accounts for all
but 5-percent of his holdings -

1470
02:21:58,264 --> 02:22:00,610
the rest ends up in accounts in the
Cayman Islands.

1471
02:22:00,645 --> 02:22:02,075
How do you know this?

1472
02:22:02,078 --> 02:22:03,602
This time you dont want to know.

1473
02:22:03,603 --> 02:22:04,951
This time I do want to know.

1474
02:22:06,511 --> 02:22:08,179
I have access to his computer,

1475
02:22:08,636 --> 02:22:10,583
and
his accountants and lawyers.

1476
02:22:10,618 --> 02:22:11,940
And how do you have that?

1477
02:22:11,975 --> 02:22:13,807
I could have gotten it from a source
inside the company.

1478
02:22:13,842 --> 02:22:15,533
- But you didnt.
- But thats what youll say.

1479
02:22:15,568 --> 02:22:17,108
But what will you say to me?

1480
02:22:18,072 --> 02:22:19,704
That depends on
if you really want to know.

1481
02:22:19,739 --> 02:22:22,021
I do. Mikael,
Who gave you access?

1482
02:22:35,090 --> 02:22:37,379
<i>Financial Journalist Mikael Blomkvist -
who this time</i>

1483
02:22:37,414 --> 02:22:40,328
<i> last year was convicted of libel
in a Stockholm courtroom - </i>

1484
02:22:40,364 --> 02:22:43,611
<i>doesnt seem to have learned
from his mistakes. </i>

1485
02:22:44,041 --> 02:22:45,621
<i> Or maybe he has -</i>

1486
02:22:46,043 --> 02:22:48,268
<i>In the current issue of Millennium
magazine, </i>

1487
02:22:48,303 --> 02:22:52,417
<i>he now charges the same
company that successfully sued him - </i>

1488
02:22:52,452 --> 02:22:53,753
Before the shit hits the fan.

1489
02:22:56,168 --> 02:22:57,469
What happens now?

1490
02:22:57,986 --> 02:23:00,518
Hell say i'st a personal vendetta
but it wont work.

1491
02:23:01,308 --> 02:23:03,372
The police will investigate,
FI will investigate.

1492
02:23:03,956 --> 02:23:06,543
Maybe we'll go to court.
Maybe he'll go to prison.

1493
02:23:07,428 --> 02:23:08,729
Do you think?

1494
02:23:09,036 --> 02:23:12,372
Probably, not.
This guys never do.

1495
02:23:25,056 --> 02:23:27,195
- Whats wrong?
- Its embarrassing.

1496
02:23:27,230 --> 02:23:28,785
Tell me.

1497
02:23:28,820 --> 02:23:30,404
I need to borrow some money.

1498
02:23:31,251 --> 02:23:32,552
50,000.

1499
02:23:34,555 --> 02:23:37,447
I have a chance to make an investment.
Its a smart, safe investment.

1500
02:23:38,489 --> 02:23:40,226
I really don't think I've got 50,000.

1501
02:23:40,261 --> 02:23:41,911
Yes, you do.

1502
02:23:41,946 --> 02:23:44,094
You have 65 thousand
in your two accounts.

1503
02:23:45,408 --> 02:23:46,900
Im sorry that I know that.

1504
02:23:49,160 --> 02:23:50,928
Youll get the money back.
I promise.

1505
02:23:52,337 --> 02:23:55,289
- Okay.
- Okay.

1506
02:23:56,800 --> 02:23:58,512
You want a coffee?

1507
02:24:02,128 --> 02:24:06,700

ones from this so-called journalist - </i>

1508
02:24:06,735 --> 02:24:08,918

<i>Ill be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court again.
Im looking forward to it.</i>

1511
02:24:13,891 --> 02:24:16,005
<i>Fabricated.  All of it.</i>

<i>The Securities Fraud Office isnt

a securities investigation,</i>

<i> but an organized crime
inquiry as well.</i>

1516
02:24:28,644 --> 02:24:30,231
<i>Mr. Blomkvist names no sources.</i>

1517
02:24:30,266 --> 02:24:31,893
<i>And we cant force him to.
But we can look for them.</i>

  I'd like to transfer those accounts

Naturally, 
you have the clearingcodes.

1538
02:26:25,490 --> 02:26:26,791
Naturally.

1539

How many accounts
 will you be transferring?

1540

Thirty.

1541
02:26:32,729 --> 02:26:34,031
This will take some time.

1542
02:26:34,066 --> 02:26:36,596
For which youll receive 
a 4-percent commission.

1543

- Then it wont be a waste of it.

That looks correct.

Already?

- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1564

I quit.

1565
02:29:31,427 --> 02:29:32,729
Was it a good investment?

1566
02:29:33,422 --> 02:29:34,813
It was okay.

1567

What are you doing later?

1568

I'm seeing my daughter.

Okay.

Im sure you dont.
  Why would you?  

1575

I was always such a headache for you.

1576
02:30:24,916 --> 02:30:27,346
Never showing up with good news.  
Only problems.

1577
02:30:29,425 --> 02:30:31,898
I have some good news now. 
 Ive made a friend.

I mean one that youd 
approve of.
