1
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,392
<i>They're taking fire
from the woods.</i>

2
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:20,863
<i>They're waiting
for the tanks.</i>

3
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,891
<i>Enemy fire from
our right flank,.</i>

4
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,470
<i>I say again,
our right flank.</i>

5
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,540
<i>Princess Red 6
for Culture.</i>

6
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,409
<i>Hold fast. This is
the worst of it, boys. Over.</i>

7
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,789
<i>Sergeant Humphrey
just showed up.</i>

8
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,808
<i>Have you any
information on the right flank?</i>

9
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,549
<i>Culture,
that's a negative.</i>

10
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:44,645
<i>Move.</i>

11
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,826
<i>This is Able 2.
The 88 is in that church.</i>

12
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,884
<i>They threw one at us
when we drove by.</i>

13
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,676
Negative.
It's all over!

14
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,408
<i>Come in, come in.</i>

15
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:19,119
<i>Do you read me?
Do you read me?</i>

16
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,313
Son of a bitch!

17
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,718
Did you get that fucker?

18
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,231
Knocked him off.

19
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,413
Gordo, stop.
Leave him rest.

20
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,079
Uh-uh.

21
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,944
Gordo, he's dead.

22
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,580
He's dead!
Show some respect

23
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,416
Leave him alone.

24
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,262
He's your fault!

25
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,264
God damn it.
Ain't you done yet?

26
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,701
You got no right to be
fucking sore with me.
Quit fucking riding me.

27
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,634
I ain't riding you.
If I was riding you,
you'd know it.

28
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,270
More where he came from.

29
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,771
Hey, fuck you, Don!
It's your fucking
fault we here.

30
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,110
Are you still talking?
Let's get out of here.

31
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,304
Aah! Fuck! What the fuck
you do that for?

32
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,380
- I'm trying to fix it!
- You know why.

33
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,973
You want to
fucking whup me?

34
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,642
It ain't gonna
fucking help anything!

35
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,848
Probate, Fox 6.

36
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,289
I say, why you
always whupping on me?

37
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,224
'Cause you're an animal,
a dog.

38
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,886
All you understand
is the fist and boot.

39
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,861
Don, I'm telling you right now,
don't fucking call me that.

40
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,833
I ain't a fucking animal.
I ain't a fucking dog.

41
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,029
Hey, you want
to talk Mexican,

42
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,195
join another tank,
a Mexican tank.

43
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,466
This is an American tank,
we talk American.

44
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,838
Who put the fucking
nickel in you, top?

45
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,501
You talk Kraut!

46
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,409
You talk German!
I can't talk Spanish?

47
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,037
Bible, what country we in?
Germany.

48
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,877
Germany, they speak German.

49
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,876
Could you explain to him
it's a tool of war?

50
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,420
It's a tool
of war, Gordo.

51
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,489
Here's my tool of war.

52
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,746
Top.

53
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,156
You knew German before
we got in this fucking war!

54
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,888
Don't play stupid
with me.

55
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,763
I expect all of you to
pull your shit together.

56
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,925
I wish you'd stop
ragging on everyone.

57
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,770
You didn't kill Red,
Germans did.

58
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,532
That is true, but
I didn't save him, either.

59
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,038
His number came up,
that's all.

60
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,906
We've been lucky till now.

61
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,034
We've been lucky?

62
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,101
Yes, sir.

63
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,170
We're all alive.
We're in here.

64
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,715
God's grace?

65
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,293
Rain's coming.

66
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,076
Coon-Ass, anytime,
sweetheart.

67
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,944
I'm your sweetheart, right?

68
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,380
Okay. Gordo,
crank her up.

69
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,648
Choke her up. She's cold.

70
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,062
There's condensation
on the plugs.

71
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,380
Fuckers!

72
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,789
All right, move out.
Get us out of here.

73
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:38,759
Bible, gun front.

74
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,231
Roger.

75
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,517
Come on, move it!

76
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,579
Get those cases
out of here!

77
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,696
I thought you were dead.

78
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,702
Devil watches over
his own. Binkowski.

79
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,398
Good to see you.

80
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,203
Don, glad you
made it back.

81
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,771
Crew still together?
Nate? Lindburgh?

82
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:00,901
Doing well.

83
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,542
Good.

84
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,883
- Grab his arm.
- Here you go.

85
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,217
Okay.

86
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,822
Lay him down.
Lay him down.

87
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,718
Move.

88
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,658
Set him down soft.

89
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,563
Sergeant.

90
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,238
Sergeant.

91
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,064
Lift.

92
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,281
Where's the rest
of Third Platoon?

93
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,585
We're it.

94
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,990
Hey, Boyd?

95
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:52,529
Hey, Boyd, they... They
gonna send him home, right?

96
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,621
I don't know
that, Grady.

97
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:59,198
Red's got us all a little sad right
now, but we got a job to do.

98
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,836
Grady, restock ammo and rations.
Gordo, water and gas.

99
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,836
Boyd, get some chow and do what you
can about the mechanical issues.

100
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:11,279
We can't do shit about mechanical issues.
Where you going?

101
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,664
First Sergeant Collier?

102
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,666
Maybe.
What the fuck are you?

103
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,757
Private Ellison.

104
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:07,703
I was told to report to you.
I'm your new assistant driver.

105
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,401
No, you are not.

106
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,679
Yes, yes, I am.
God damn it.

107
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:17,938
Who told you this?

108
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,573
Master Sergeant
with the clipboard.

109
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,015
Bullshit!
Right there. He's...

110
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,182
What's your name?

111
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:28,755
Norman.

112
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,394
How long you
been in the Army?

113
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,093
Eight weeks.

114
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,267
That's home.

115
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,704
Do as you're told.

116
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,708
Don't get too close
to anyone.

117

Hi. Hi. I'm Norman.

124
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,248
Which...
Which way is the front?

125
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,014
"Which way is the front?"

126
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,684
Hmm.

127
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,692
All around us, kid,
'cause this is Germany.

128
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:37,863
We're surrounded by Krauts.

129
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:39,955
Ain't that right, Grady?

130
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,588
That's right.

131
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,335
Can I please
have my book back?

132
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,276
Where
are the cigarettes?

133
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,872
I don't smoke.

134
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,676
You're a bastard.

135
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:58,842
You go to tank school?

136
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,178
Tank school? No.

137
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,713
I've never even seen
the inside of a tank.

138
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,181
I'm a clerk typist.

139
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,780
Was heading
to Fifth Corps HQ,

140
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,382
they pulled me
off the truck.

141
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:09,960
They sent me here.

142
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,061
It's got to be a mistake.

143
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,222
Mistake?

144
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,858
Army don't make mistakes.

145
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,367
It wouldn't do.

146
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,131
You from Missouri?

147
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,628
No.

148
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,799
Are you from Chicago?

149
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,399
You from Arkansas,
ain't you?

150
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:26,909
No, I'm from Pittsburgh...
Hey, hush up, man.

151
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,001
Nobody gives a fuck where you from.

152
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,847
Are you a praying man?

153
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,016
I go to church.

154
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,049
Which denomination are you?

155
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,145
Episcopalian?

156
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,106
Yeah, you are. You're a
Mainliner, ain't you?

157
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,727
Yeah. l am.

158
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,889
Are you saved?

159
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,689
I'm baptised.

160
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:49,835
That ain't
what I asked you.

161
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,028
That ain't what
he asked you.

162
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,864
Gordo, what'd I ask him?
See, you got to listen.

163
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,525
- Say it again.
- Are you saved?

164
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,336
Wait until you see it.

165
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,573
See what?

166
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,608
What a man can do
to another man.

167
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,015
Before you find Jesus,

168
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,414
why don't you come
take a look at your seat?

169
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,389
That's where
you're gonna be.

170
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:18,088
Get a bucket of hot water from the kitchen.
Get that shit clean.

171
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,302
Oh, fuck.

172
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:35,795
Fuck.

173
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,504
Weren't supposed to
be no more Tigers, Don.

174
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,011
Tell my platoon that.

175
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,461
You send five tanks out.

176
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,775
One comes back.

177
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,684
It's hard to believe
we're winning the war.

178
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,116
Stop talking about
yesterday's fight.

179
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,128
Think about today's.

180
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,094
Straighten out!

181
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,749
Hey!
What's an SS doing here?

182
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,235
Hey, why are you bringing
him through here?

183
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,568
Why isn't
he sleeping?

184
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,540
G2 wants a prisoner
to question.

185
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,339
Oh, I'll question him.

186
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,740
What's your favourite colour?

187
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:49,938
Are you a good dancer?

188
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,344
Do you like fat girls?

189
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,164
- Get back!
- Beat his ass!

190
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,617
Stop! Stop it!

191
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,911
- Fucker!
- Fuck him up, Don!

192
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,455
Motherfucker!

193
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,582
Get the fuck...
Get back!

194
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,359
Go!
Fucking tankers.

195
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,756
It's me, it's me.

196
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,421
You got MPs everywhere.
You got to stop now.

197
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,320
Just stop. DAVIS: I spilled
my fucking coffee.

198
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,196
Cocksuckers.
Come on, Grady.

199
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,059
Fucking SS.

200
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,363
You good, top?

201
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,134
Bring him
through this camp...

202
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,743
You see that?

203
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:20,869
He's an SS.

204
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,208
You kill every last one you can.
They're real assholes.

205
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,215
Fuck every last one.
They started it.

206
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:26,881
- We finishing it.
- That's it.

207
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,111
Done much killing?

208
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,809
No.

209
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:30,979
You will.

210
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,114
Boys, take him through that gun.
Roger.

211
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,092
Wh-What do I do with this?
"Wh-What..." Shut up.

212
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,252
Take a look at it.

213
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,453
See that cover?
Yeah.

214
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,551
Open it.

215
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,058
And now you killing.

216
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,393
Close it up.

217
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,129
Now you ain't.

218
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,794
Main unit's punching east.

219
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:51,136
We are going north on
a flank guard mission.

220
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,177
We'll tie up with Baker
Company from the 41st.

221
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,473
Sergeant Collier's
with us now.

222
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,310
He'll be acting
platoon sergeant.

223
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,439
Fine by me.

224
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,449
Good to have you, Don.

225
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,590
We're meeting
Baker Company here.

226
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,821
Then, together
we'll take this town.

227
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,664
After that, we're working
for Captain Waggoner.

228
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,324
Any questions?

229
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,594
I got one question.

230
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,266
Peterson?

231
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,138
I'm Binkowski, sir.

232
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,200
Uh...

233
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,138
You start shaving
your face?

234
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,178
First Platoon,
mount up!

235
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,271
Move out!

236
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,713
War's not
going anywhere, sir.

237
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,521
You heard him.
Mount up!

238
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,212
Hey!

239
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,877
Go fuck yourself, Wardaddy!

240
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,045
Coffee's too hot.

241
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,713
Still owe me 40 bucks!

242
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,585
What'd he say?

243
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,720
Mount up!
Let's go, gents.

244
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:17,886
Move front!

245
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,394
Motherfucker.

246
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,324
Okay, guns ready.

247
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,834
Good luck, gentlemen!

248
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,887
All right, there might be a
wolf hiding in the sheep.

249
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,017
Kid, you're up.
Cast an eyeball on them.

250
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,591
<i>Anything that makes a
move, you cut them right in half.</i>

251
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:52,958
People are in the way,
that's their problem.

252
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,554
You do what you
got to do, copy?

253
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:57,296
Copy.
You copy?

254
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,064
<i>I copy-</i>

255
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,596
Gordo, talk him
through that gun again.

256
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:03,867
Roger.

257
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,142
Hey, gun's ready.
Just pull the trigger.

258
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:07,772
Every five rounds
is a tracer

259
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,227
so you can see
what you're hitting.

260
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,906
And remember,
short bursts.

261
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:14,281
That way you harvest
more meat per bullet.

262
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,220
The Americans are over there

263
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,425
Keep moving

264
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,896
Keep your hands up

265
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,156
She'll let you fuck her
for a chocolate bar.

266
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,267
That's not true.

267
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,525
It's not true?

268
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:06,793
No.

269
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,337
Okay. It's not true.

270
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,298
It's completely
fucking true.

271
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,869
<i>Or just
give her some smokes.</i>

272
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,966
You ain't got to fuck around and
give her a whole pack, neither.

273
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,808
Norman, ignore him.
Fucking four will do it.

274
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:17,142
Don't disappoint
Christ, now.

275
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,183
Don't let them
lead you astray.

276
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,765
You see, we can kill them,
but we can't fuck them,

277
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,151
<i>'cause it says so
in the Bible.</i>

278
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,682
Stop, all right?

279
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,154
I'm done trying to
convert you heathens.

280
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:28,283
You mind if I continue
invading Germany?

281
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,688
Boyd, do you think
Jesus loves Hitler?

282
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,785
Do I think
Jesus loves Hitler?

283
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,522
I'd assume so.

284
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,364
If Hitler accepted
Jesus into his heart

285
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,866
and got baptised,
he'd be saved.

286
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,637
It ain't gonna save him
from man's justice.

287
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,296
What about your regular-issue
Nazi line trooper?

288
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,339
No, I'm not gonna do this with you.
Is he going to Heaven?

289
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,237
We've been talking about the
same dumb shit for three years.

290
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:47,208
You know how I stand on it.
You trying to rile me up now.

291
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,802
Hey, what about me, huh? You
think you could save me?

292
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,041
<i>Sing me a hymn?</i>

293
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,480
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>
Sing <i>Old Rugged Cross.</i>

294
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,540
I like the way your mouth
moves when you sing.

295
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,675
Don't.
I like it.

296
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:56,879
I'll sing it
if you don't do that

297
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:57,977
Let me just
touch your moustache.

298
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,681
Don't touch me. Stop! I just
wanna touch your moustache.

299
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,588
Why does that bother you so much
when I touch your moustache?

300
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,421
I'll shoot you, I swear!
All right, knock it off.

301
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,892
Knock off the horseplay.

302
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,596
Boyd, do you think Hitler'd fuck
one of us for a chocolate bar?

303
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,694
I hope so.

304
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,748
Ambush! Right!

305
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,149
Right side, ambush!

306
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,083
Fuck! Grady!

307
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,389
You watch that tree line!
We're ripe for an ambush!

308
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:13,958
Grady, cover right!

309
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,062
Father!

310
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,200
What'd you see, Boyd?

311
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,274
Just go out and
blast them little fuckers!

312
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,780
What'd you see?

313
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,146
I didn't see nothing.

314
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,698
Norman!

315
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,138
You cocksucker.
Why didn't you take the shot?

316
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,771
He was just a kid.
I'm sorry.

317
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,612
I'm really sorry, Sergeant.

318
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,682
You see
what a kid can do?

319
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,613
Look!

320
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,847
That's your fault.

321
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,690
That's your fucking fault.

322
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,299
Next German you see
with a weapon,

323
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,627
you rake the dog shit
out of him.

324
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,628
I don't care if it's a baby
with a butter knife in one hand

325
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:19,719
and mama's titty
in the other.

326
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:20,991
You chop him up!
Yes, Sergeant!

327
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:26,692
Bible?
Yeah?

328
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,311
All tanks, Wardaddy.

329
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:43,180
Looks like I'm it.

330
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,984
I'll lead the column. Let's
get us where we're going.

331
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,501
We have this thing
setup and on the way.

332
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,337
I sent over a couple men
to keep contact,

333
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,104
and the officers have been briefed.

334
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,714
Stop right here, Gordo.

335
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,253
Baker Company?
Yes, sir!

336
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,743
I'm not a sir.

337
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,011
Me, neither.

338
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:20,998
- Where's your boss?
- Dead.

339
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:24,593
Who's in charge
of this column?

340
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:25,888
I am.

341
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,021
Good. I'm talking to
the right man.

342
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,395
Park it over there.
Old Man's waiting.

343
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,317
Yes, thank you, sir,

344
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:51,615
don't tell me how long
my casualties can last.

345
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,087
Unless you want
to come down here,

346
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,455
stand knee-deep in their guts
and form an opinion.

347
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,719
Baker 6 out.

348
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:58,793
Pencil-pushing motherfucker.
How you doing?

349
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:00,386
Load the casualties
into a truck.

350
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,466
We're gonna drive them
back to base ourselves.

351
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:03,914
Take care of our own.
Come with me.

352
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,592
Hey, wake up!

353
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,129
All right,
how many tanks we got?

354
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,332
<i>Four.</i>

355
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,573
Four? You're shitting me.

356
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:15,836
I asked for 10.

357
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,846
Miles! Sergeant Miles!

358
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:19,972
Yes, sir?

359
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,073
Get First Platoon ready.

360
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,978
You're working for him now.

361
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,611
If they can stand,
they're in play.

362
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:25,814
Roger.

363
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:26,951
All right,
here's the deal.

364
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,353
I got a platoon
trapped in this beet field

365
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:29,482
by machine guns.

366
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,616
I sent my tracks in.

367
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,750
Jerry took them out.

368
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:36,425
So, anti-tank guns there, there,
possibly there, I don't know.

369
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,462
I need you
to rescue my guys.

370
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:39,867
Take the guns out.

371
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,494
I can do that.

372
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,671
All right, that clears
this road into town,
you push forward.

373
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,283
l'll join you there.
We'll clear it up.

374
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:48,812
Maybe they'll surrender.
Or maybe they'll fight.

375
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,136
This high ground,
you got any eyes on it?

376
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,708
I had eyes there, gone.
There, gone.

377
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,477
We're flying blind.
It's you and me.

378
00:27:58,443 --> 00:27:59,387
Krauts got sights
on this road.

379
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:00,513
I don't want to
show my flank.

380
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,023
Any objection if
I come in here?

381
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,890
You can arrive on a fucking
magic carpet, for all I care.

382
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:08,055
I know who you are. I know
you know what you're doing.

383
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:11,295
You just paste them
hard for me.

384
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,337
They murdered some good
boys out there today.

385
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,665
Why don't they just quit?

386
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,313
Would you?

387
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,310
We got a platoon pinned down
in this field by MGs.

388
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,648
Krauts got anti-tank
covering the field.

389
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,386
And once we cross
this hedgerow,

390
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,320
we will be in range and in their
line of sight, so be alert.

391
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,983
Hit anything
that fucking moves.

392
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,361
Yeah, unless
they pound us first.

393
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,682
If they do, we'll
know exactly where they are.

394
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,545
Let's get these boys out of
there and smash those guns.

395
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,429
Then we'll capture the town,
stop for the night. Clear?

396
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,445
Why are we rescuing kittens instead
of just driving down into Berlin?

397
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,574
Why are you such an asshole?
That's a great question.

398
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:56,370
March order. Fury, Old
Phyllis, Lucy Sue, Murder Inc.

399
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,003
Let's go.

400
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,013
All right,
fuck sticks.

401
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,106
Mount up! By squad!

402
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,207
All right, mount up!

403
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,753
<i>All tanks, comm check.</i>

404
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:04,842
1-4's up.

405
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,184
<i>Love 1-3 copies.</i>

406
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:09,012
- That's right, man.
- Need you to hold tight!

407
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,736
All tanks, Wardaddy.

408
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,568
When we hit open ground,
line up on me.

409
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,432
<i>Keep your
spacing, don't bunch up.</i>

410
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,100
<i>On my signal,
we'll drop the doughs</i>

411
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,735
<i>and roll up that 75.</i>

412
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,801
<i>Everyone copy?</i>

413
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,107
Love 1-5 copies. Wilco.

414
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,080
- Copy.
Love 1-3 copies.

415
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,111
<i>Gordo, halt.</i>

416
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:39,120
<i>All tanks hall.
All tanks halt.</i>

417
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,392
All right,
let's get the boys off.

418
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,653
Get them off.
Give me last man.

419
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,223
All right, ladies, you
heard the man. Button up.

420
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,325
Everybody off!

421
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:53,801
Move out! Move!
Everybody off!

422
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,565
Close your hatch.

423
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,438
All tanks, move out.
Hard right. Hard right.

424
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,529
<i>- Move them out.
- Hard right. Hard right.</i>

425
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,118
<i>Fury's going. Let's go.</i>

426
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,743
<i>Move,</i> move,
move, move, move.

427
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,349
Let's move now.
A hard stick right.

428
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,948
Everybody hold yourself.
Jiggs, hold on.

429
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,516
Form in. Form in.

430
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:18,686
<i>Catch up
with the Fury.</i>

431
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:19,785
<i>Stick</i> right.

432
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:20,852
<i>Now, catch up.</i>

433
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,590
On my line, guys,
on my line.

434
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,032
<i>More gas. More gas.</i>
Mix <i>it up.</i>

435
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,443
- Keep them low!
- Hold your line.

436
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,164
<i>We're already drifting.</i>

437
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:30,634
Binkowski, keep an eyeball
on that high ground. Right.

438
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,175
Love 1-5 copies. Wilco.

439
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,111
<i>Watch that tree
line right there.</i>

440
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,611
<i>Hold that, hold that.</i>

441
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:43,977
Ride on, ride on.
Hold tight.

442
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,402
We're gonna bust
through this shit.

443
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,816
All right,
here we go, men.

444
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,221
<i>Left stick, left stick.
What the fuck?</i>

445
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,986
<i>It looks perfect, Tim.</i>
Good?

446
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,118
Straight on, straight on.

447
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,491
<i>Doughs on the
ground, doughs on the ground.</i>

448
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:53,552
<i>Keep an eye out.</i>

449
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:55,188
Straight, straight.
Over here!

450
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,733
<i>Gordo, slow, slow, slow.</i>

451
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,302
We got bodies.

452
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,395
Stick <i>left of me.
Eyes on the floor.</i>

453
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,699
Get up.

454
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:03,874
Fall in! Fall in!

455
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,305
Straighten it out.

456
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:06,901
<i>Watch
your fucking spacing.</i>

457
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,033
<i>You gotta
left stick now.</i>

458
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,237
All right, let's hold up.

459
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,336
If I say hold back, hold back.
Hold back.

460
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,211
Left stick. Left stick. What the fuck?
Come on!

461
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:14,750
Company,
clear on the right.

462
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,993
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Clear it up and book it.

463
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:19,713
Speed up just a little bit.

464
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,052
Love 1-3, right stick!
Right stick!

465
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,421
You got troops
on the ground.

466
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:25,825
<i>Fuck, right stick!
Right stick, God damn it!</i>

467
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,861
Get your head
out of your ass!

468
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,421
They weren't fucking
paying attention.

469
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:32,829
Get in tight. Go!

470
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,538
Down! Stay down! Down!

471
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,236
What the fuck is that?
Whoa!

472
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,443
Bible, hit that machine gun.

473
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:48,613
Traverse left, 800!

474
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:50,376
Steady!

475
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:51,546
On. Fire!

476
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,714
On the way!

477
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,012
Good!
Hit them! Hit them!

478
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,423
Look forward!
Look at your periscope!

479
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,725
Bible, traverse back.
On. Periscope!

480
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,193
Clear!
Fire!

481
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,530
On the way!

482
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,701
<i>Cease fire.
Target destroyed,.</i>

<i>Roger, Ester, Wilco.</i>

484
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,599
Fire!

485
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:17,206
Fuck! Anti-tank!
H.E.! Traverse left.

486
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,442
<i>Let's go.
Traverse left.</i>

487
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:20,778
Traverse left!

488
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,549
Just a ricochet.
We're okay.

489
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,294
Bullshit! That's a Kraut high-velocity gun.
I can hear it whistling.

490
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:34,938
<i>Anti-tank!
Left front, left front!</i>

491
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,327
Got it! Down 15.

492
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:37,893
Clear!
Ready!

493
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,601
Fire!
On the way!

494
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:44,735
600.

495
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,065
Fire!

00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:48,637
Clear!
On the way!

497
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,410
Okay, cease fire, cease fire.
Target destroyed.

498
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,840
Fire!

499
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,115
There's another gun!
Who's got eyes on it?

500
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,411
Does anyone see it?

501
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,088
Eyes up, everybody.
Fire!

502
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,536
I don't see shit.

503
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,123
Where the fuck are you at?

504
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:08,356
<i>Anti-tank, H.E.</i>

505
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,660
Got it! Anti-tank, H.E.
Traverse right!

506
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,826
Anti-tank.
Left front, left front. 600.

507
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,096
<i>Right stick,
right stick.</i>

508
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,331
On! Fire!

509
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:16,962
On the way!

510
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,141
Hit 'em,
hit 'em, hit 'em.

511
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,105
Fire!

512
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,052
All tanks, start squirting
that tree line.

513
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,144
Let's light them up.
Let's go.

514
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,838
<i>Everybody squirt the fucking
tree line. Let's clean</i> it <i>up.</i>

515
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,690
Hey! Hey!
Start shooting!

516
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:44,789
Well,
what do I shoot at?

517
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,665
The Nazis,
dumb fuck!

518
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:56,566
That's it. Keep
their fucking heads down.

519
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,675
You got to reload!

520
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,219
Panzerfaust!
Hey! Get him!

521
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,270
I'm loading the gun.
I'm loading the gun.
Hit him!

522
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,651
Got him.

523
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,220
Do your job!
Do what you're here for!

524
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,321
I was loading the gun!

525
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,149
<i>Machine gun, twelve o'clock!
Gordo, run those bastards over!</i>

526
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,539
All tanks,
hold here, hold here.

527
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,509
Get your boys
in the fight!

528
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,710
Fall out!
Marching fire!

529
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:41,517
Come on!

530
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,288
Hey, squirt those
Krauts on the left.

531
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,624
Do you see them?

532
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,197
<i>Will Actual, come in.
This is Vicious.</i>

533
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,562
<i>Krauts in the woods
to your...</i>

534
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:51,793
All I see are dead bodies.

535
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,696
How do you know they're dead?
Are you a doctor?

536
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:54,832
Hit them!
But they're dead!

537
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,202
Why would I shoot them
if they're already dead?

538
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,474
So they don't stand up
and shoot us in the ass!

539
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,201
Fuck!
Get them!

540
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,266
Fuck!

541
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,704
I can't fucking be here
any-fucking-more!

542
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,943
Turn your goddamn intercom off
if you're gonna bawl like that.

543
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,313
I got it, top.

544
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:15,582
I fucking give up. I fucking give up.
I can't be here any more.

545
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:17,560
This ain't pretty,
you know.

546
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,088
This is what we do.

547
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:21,545
Boys, fight on foot.

548
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:22,623
You take it.

549
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,172
I'm okay.

550
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,845
You're all right.

551
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,986
Close your eyes, son.
Close your eyes, son.

552
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,385
Do you believe in Jesus?

553
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,050
You're all right, then.
You're all right, then.

554
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,116
I'm gonna pray with you now.

555
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:29,390
Our father, Lord in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

556
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:33,831
Thy kingdom come, thy will be
done on Earth as it is in Heaven.

557
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,371
Give us this day
our daily bread

558
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,666
and forgive us
our trespasses

559
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:39,641
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

560
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,178
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

561
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:45,874
For the kingdom, the power and the
glory, forever and ever, dear Lord.

562
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,142
Amen.

563
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,551
I had the best bow gunner in the
entire Ninth Army in that seat.

564
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,026
And now I got you.

565
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:08,436
I promised my crew a long
time ago I'd keep them alive.

566
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,600
You're getting in
the way of that.

567
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,040
I'm sorry.

568
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:18,337
Okay, l am trained to
type 60 words a minute.

569
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,578
I am not trained to
machine-gun dead bodies.

570
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:23,675
I am trying my very best.

571
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:29,082
Where'd you get that U.S. Army coat?
Where'd you get it? Huh?

572
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,249
Who'd you kill, boy?

573
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,395
Where did you
get that coat, boy?

574
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,189
Forgive me.
Let me go, please

575
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,191
Who did you kill?
What'd you do?

576
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,094
Don't shoot!

577
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,193
Let me go, please, let me go

578
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,853
- Who'd you kill, boy?
- Sergeant!

579
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:44,896
Back it up, boys!

580
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:45,963
Hold on. Hold on!

581
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,203
Back it up, boys.

582
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,404
Norman!

583
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:51,142
Get out here!

584
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,154
Norman, come here.

585
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,981
Come on, son.

586
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,127
Huh?

587
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,968
I can't hear you.
Wait.

588
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,008
Sergeant.
Call your dogs off.

589
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,809
I have a family

590
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,911
This is my wife, my children

591
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:27,579
Shut your mouth

592
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,581
Kneel

593
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,596
You are no goddamn good to me
unless you can kill Krauts.

594
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:48,098
Put a big fat hole
in his back.

595
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:52,499
Put a big fat hole
in his fucking back.

596
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,176
No.

597
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,641
Why the hell not?

598
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:00,274
It's not right.

599
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,041
"Not right"?

600
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:04,643
We're not here
for right and wrong.

601
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,119
We're here to kill them.

602
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,181
Why are you here?

603
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,518
You're here to kill him.

604
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:11,483
You know why he's here?

605
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,857
He's here to kill you.

606
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:16,557
He's here
to kill you, Norman.

607
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:17,993
He's here to rip your throat
out with a bullet.

608
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,328
Go to hell.

609
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,307
I'm trying to
teach you something.

610
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:32,205
You here to get me killed?

611
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,577
No.
You gonna get me killed?

612
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,672
No.

613
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:35,809
I need you to perform.

614
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,054
Just get it over with.
Just get it over with.

615
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,749
I can't do it.
Yes, you can.

616
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:43,882
I know you can.

617
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:46,019
He kills you,
or you kill him.

618
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,663
Simple math.

619
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,229
You or him. Pick.

620
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,561
Just kill me.
Come here.

621
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:55,832
Kill me! Kill me!
Kill me! Kill me! Please!

622
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,338
I can't do it!

623
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,348
Fucking stop!

624
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,717
Please stop.

625
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,617
Oh, no, no.
This is the easy part.

626
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,354
What the hell?

627
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:16,587
All right.
Fuck.

628
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:17,921
Please
don't make me do this.

629
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,256
Don't make me do this.

630
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:21,792
It's all right.

631
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,964
One, two...

632
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:29,868
Do it, Norman.
Do it, Norman.

633
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,269
Do it, Norman.

634
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:43,552
Do your job.

635
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,379
Waddell,
where you at?

636
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,895
- Waddell!
- Move it!

637
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,963
Move it!

638
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,104
Come on, Norman.

639
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,082
Let's go.

640
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,523
Is this supposed to
make a man out of me?

641
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,867
Is this supposed to
make a man out of me?

642
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,700
'Cause my conscience is...

643
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,000
Sit down.
It's clean.

644
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:39,666
My conscience
is clean.

645
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,308
I'm keeping it
that way.

646
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,370
Look right here.
Hot coffee.

647
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,976
Norman?

648
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:05,063
Don might be crazier than
a shithouse rat, but he's solid.

649
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:10,504
We've been together
since before Africa.

650
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,206
I won't fight
with anybody else.

651
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,042
Me, neither.

652
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,842
There ain't no crew stayed
together like we have, Norman.

653
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,308
That's 'cause of him.

654
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,656
First time we got
shot at, down in North Africa,

655
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,486
Don, he done shit his drawers full.

656
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:36,395
He stunk the tank up
real loud.

657
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:38,266
It's true.

658
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,434
We move out in 15.

659
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,407
Norman.

660
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,079
I haven't seen you
eat anything all day.

661
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:55,515
Make sure you get
something to eat.

662
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:03,014
You best go eat something.

663
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:06,886
Make sure
he sees it, too.

664
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:45,330
There you go, boys.
Keep pounding them.

665
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:30,969
They got signs
around their necks.

666
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,343
What do them signs say?

667
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:36,885
"I'm a coward and refused to
fight for the German people."

668
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,476
The SS does that.

669
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:41,021
Let them rip themselves
to pieces, huh?

670
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:42,655
Fuck them.

671
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:51,087
Baker 6. Love 1-6.

672
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:53,793
<i>I got eyes on the town. We're
ready to commence assault.</i>

673
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,361
<i>Baker 6 copies.
Initiate your attack.</i>

674
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,406
<i>Me and my boys will
hit them from the south.</i>

675
00:44:58,496 --> 00:44:59,634
<i>Over and out.</i>

676
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,534
<i>We'll split up here.
1-4, 1-3, you take left.</i>

677
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,170
<i>Binkowski, you follow me,
and stay off my ass.</i>

678
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:06,338
Check the hotel.

679
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,230
Come back.
Copy.
<i>I</i> got you, <i>Daddy.</i>

680
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:17,748
Clear the alley!

681
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,659
Keep moving, Tex.

682
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:24,689
Go.

683
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:27,232
<i>Gordo, just punch
through that wall of smoke.</i>

684
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:28,326
<i>Copy.</i>

685
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,405
Okay, hard left.
Nine o'clock, nine o'clock.

686
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,397
Move up.

687
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,797
<i>Gordo, halt, halt.</i>

688
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,015
All right, hold here.

689
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,635
Grandpa

690
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,437
Where are the German soldiers?

691
00:46:13,638 --> 00:46:15,311
Sniper!

692
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:16,441
Cover!

693
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,883
Get down!

694
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:19,210
Bible, follow my burst.

695
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:25,652
On the way!

696
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,274
Keep firing
on that window!

697
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,477
Come on!
Move up!

698
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:49,177
Go!

699
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:50,513
Keep moving.

700
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,988
Keep moving.

701
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:58,953
Come on, keep moving up.

702
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,586
Watch that doorway.
Watch that doorway.

703
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,433
<i>Halt, halt, Gordo, halt.</i>

704
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,635
Binkowski, see that Kraut stinger
in the cellar on my left?

705
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:12,003
Mind giving him what for?

706
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:14,098
I'm gonna slap him
around a little bit for you.

707
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,606
<i>Button up.</i>

708
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,274
Hit him!

709
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:23,979
Fuck you, Jerry!

710
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,284
God damn.

711
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,456
All right, Gordo, forward.

712
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:41,630
Fucking eyes up,
everywhere we go.

713
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,214
<i>Gordo, hard right,
three o'clock into the square.</i>

714
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,506
<i>Binkowski, you take the far end.
You cover our tail.</i>

715
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:49,704
Gotcha.

716
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:06,920
Anti-tank. Traverse left.

717
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,851
<i>Throw some Willy
Pete in that ground floor.</i>

718
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:11,556
Clear, Boyd.

719
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,510
Fire <i>when</i> ready.

720
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,405
No, they cooking.
Go, go.

721
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:44,396
Good shooting, kid.
Keep stacking them up.

722
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:46,732
You should've
let them burn.

723
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:55,900
All right, look inside.

724
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:58,875
Check the doorways, y'all.

725
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,942
Gordo, halt here.

726
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,753
Please stop shooting!

727
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:07,545
Come here

728
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:10,089
The soldiers want to surrender

729
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:12,819
We give up

730
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,654
The war is over

731
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,621
thank God

732
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,725
Tell them to come out

733
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,228
with their hands up

734
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:23,301
Binkowski, load an H.E.

735
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,738
and get ready to put it in that bank
if these people want to test us.

736
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,469
It's my pleasure.

737
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,693
Check the door,
check the door.

738
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:34,480
Fuck,
it's a bunch of kids.

739
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:37,913
Cut him down!
Separate them.

740
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:39,977
Come on.

741
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,522
<i>Here they come.
Keep an eye out.</i>

742
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,150
Right over there!

743
00:49:44,248 --> 00:49:45,249
Let's go!

744
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,262
Go. Go.
Fuck.

745
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,928
Why you looking so sour, Kraut?
What you got?

746
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,804
You. You.

747
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:57,931
Burgermeister.

748
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:01,170
Is he the one hanging kids?

749
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:02,300
<i>Ja.</i>

750
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:03,367
<i>Hey -</i>

751
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:04,502
Shoot that guy.

752
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:05,842
This guy?
Yeah, him.

753
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,212
The SS cocksucker
with the busted wing.

754
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:09,306
Oh-ho!

755
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:13,455
Hey, Angel.
This one's yours.

756
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,621
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, asshole.</i>

757
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:18,985
Motherfucker.

758
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,233
Whoo-wee!

759
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:41,378
Hey, you!
You're real pretty.

760
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,182
Yo,
what the fuck are you doing?

761
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,413
I'm-I'm gonna take care
of you, okay? Okay.

762
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,047
You want to
see the tank?

763
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,591
Hey, I'm gonna
marry this girl.

764
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:52,888
It's gonna be for two.
Gonna be him, then me.

765
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,485
All right,
you go on up there.

766
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:55,724
That's it. Yeah.
Give me your hand.

767
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,366
You boys
all come through okay?

768
00:50:58,656 --> 00:51:00,567
Just a walk in the park.
All right, Sergeant.

769
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:02,069
You get some
rest and relax.

770
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,399
We'll go win the war
in the morning.

771
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:04,495
Yes, sir.

772
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:20,951
Norman.

773
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,383
It wasn't nothing, right?

774
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:28,889
Come again, Sergeant?

775
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,933
Rubbing out those Heinies.
You splashed them real good.

776
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:34,366
Wasn't nothing, right?

777
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,362
Sure, Sergeant.

778
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:41,467
Yeah, it wasn't nothing.

779
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:44,535
Fact, I kind of liked it.

780
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:50,716
I want to show
you something.

781
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:19,403
They knew
we were coming.

782
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:26,179
So they got drunk as lords and
they shot themselves at sunup.

783
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:30,016
Why are you
showing me this?

784
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:36,087
Ideals are peaceful.

785
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:38,261
History is violent.

786
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,621
Do what I tell you.

787
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:09,055
You do that, you'll make
it through this thing.

788
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:18,962
Come on.

789
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:52,870
Who is inside?

790
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,201
Just me

791
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,701
Bullshit

792
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,091
Watch her.

793
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,880
Come out!

794
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,045
Right now!

795
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,051
Hey! Hey!

796
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:39,386
Come on. Calm down.

797
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,146
Stand fucking here.

798
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:43,152
Close the door
and lock it.

799
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:44,785
Lock the fucking door.

800
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,390
You said no one was here

801
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,564
You could have
gotten her killed

802
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:55,598
She's my cousin

803
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:57,594
I'm sorry

804
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:58,762
please

805
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,608
I was scared

806
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:01,836
Sit down

807
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:34,640
Bring me hot water

808
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:39,837
Go

809
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:55,622
Put the gun down.

810
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,895
Grab a seat.
You make me nervous.

811
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:03,130
Come here

812
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:41,009
What's your name, young lady?

813
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:47,106
Emma.

814
00:57:16,867 --> 00:57:17,868
<i>Ja.</i>

815
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:30,620
Mmm-hmm.

816
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,591
<i>Hey -</i>

817
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:02,822
Fuck! Aah!
Grenade!

818
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:11,430
Get away from that window before
they shoot the hell out of you.

819
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:18,302
Yeah! How was it, Gor?

820
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,069
It was good.

821
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,308
You get
your ass up there, Boyd.

822
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:24,368
I hope you get scabies.

823
00:58:24,468 --> 00:58:25,503
Shit.

824
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,711
She's a good, clean girl.

825
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,641
If you don't take her
in that bedroom, I will.

826
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:26,067
No

827
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,896
They're young

828
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:34,105
and they're alive

829
01:01:24,948 --> 01:01:27,724
Can I see your hand?
Can I see your hand?

830
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,640
I'm not gonna bite you.
This hand.

831
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:33,461
Yeah.

832
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:37,539
Now, you can tell
a lot about a person

833
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:38,867
from the lines
on their hand.

834
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:41,865
Um...

835
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:44,974
You don't know what I'm saying, do you'?

836
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,512
All right, this,
you see that?

837
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,179
That's the Ring of Solomon.

838
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:55,714
It means you help people,
you understand them.

839
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:57,485
It's really rare.

840
01:01:58,582 --> 01:01:59,822
Really rare. You see?

841
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,653
You see that, though?

842
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,489
Yeah, I got it, too.

843
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:09,159
My grandma taught me
how to do this.

844
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,928
You see this right here?

845
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,402
That is your heart line.

846
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:18,612
From the looks of this,

847
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:23,708
you are going to have
one great love in your life.

848
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:49,664
You don't have
to say a word.

849
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,031
Sit down.

850
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:21,960
Thank you.

851
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:24,394
Hmm?

852
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:25,632
What's that?

853
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:29,706
It's hot.

854
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,870
"It's hot"?
Yeah, you just...

855
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:35,413
Normie! Nor?

856
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:37,712
Norman,
where could you be?

857
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:40,643
Oh, shit.

858
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,220
<i>Pinche</i> Norman!

859
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,188
Norman?
Pinche Norman.

860
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:46,227
Time for you
to act the man!

861
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,221
We got you
fixed up good.

862
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:49,518
Now, look,
there a special gal.

863
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,427
She's down there and
she's waiting on you.

864
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:52,864
And all you got to do
is come on down.

865
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,333
She wide open
just jump on in.

866
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:57,270
Yeah, she looks a little bit
like a whore, but...

867
01:05:02,165 --> 01:05:03,337
What?

868
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,876
I think maybe
we too late, Gor.

869
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:07,510
Norman.

870
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:09,273
What did you do?

871
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,043
Norman,
you sneaky snail.

872
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:15,055
What did you do?

873
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,081
Wait a second,
did you...

874
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:20,026
Did you...

875
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:24,195
Did you take this pretty
young thing for a roll?

876
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:25,929
Yeah, you're real pretty.

877
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,195
Did you do that?
What's with your lip?

878
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:29,769
What's with your lip?
Why it quiver?

879
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:31,702
Don't worry about me,
I'm a friend.

880
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,638
He fuck you, you fuck me.
That how it works.

881
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:34,868
You got to
pass the plate.

882
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,877
Come on, make a donation
to the cause.

883
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,776
All right, don't touch her.
Don't touch her'?

884
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:40,575
Don't touch her. Don't ever
fucking tell me what to do.

885
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:43,274
You think you get some pussy and now
you can fucking act like a man?

886
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:46,217
Anyone touches the girl, they
get their teeth kicked in.

887
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,120
That's how it gonna be'?

888
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:57,224
Well, all right, then.

889
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:01,425
I guess
it's Norman Day, huh?

890
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:05,401
Mmm-hmm.

891
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:06,899
Shit, top.

892
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:11,276
It's your day, Norman.

893
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,610
You should drink that.

894
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:19,448
You best take a bite.

895
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:21,614
You a man, right?
Drink it.

896
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,953
Attaboy.
You did the nasty.

897
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:27,426
Drink it, there it is.

898
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:28,986
Your day.

899
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:30,291
There it is.

900
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,127
You like that?
Don't fucking touch me.

901
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,667
Don't touch you?
You a man, right?

902
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:35,099
Get some pussy,
you a man, right'?

903
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:36,432
Get your fucking
hands off me.

904
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,700
Fucking piece of shit.

905
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:41,173
Watch this. How about that? How
about I just kill you, huh'?

906
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:42,868
How about I fucking
kill you right here?

907
01:06:42,966 --> 01:06:44,343
Grady? Grady?
Hmm?

908
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:45,777
Fuck. Don't you
fucking speak...

909
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:47,440
Oh, God!

910
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:48,642
What the fuck is that?
Gasoline?

911
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:50,446
Taste like gasoline? Hey.

912
01:06:50,874 --> 01:06:53,445
Ow! Fucking north Georgia
right there, boy.

913
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:55,054
Fuckup.

914
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,052
Donkey.

915
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,623
Appreciate it.

916
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:05,530
Look at that.

917
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:18,173
Go have a seat.

918
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:26,143
My beverage.

919
01:07:31,915 --> 01:07:33,485
That's the girl's egg.

920
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,086
That's Gordo's egg.

921
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:36,595
That's the girl's egg.

922
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:38,166
Then where the fuck
was my egg?

923
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:45,228
You want to say grace?

924
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:47,269
This meal's for you.

925
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,241
Roger.

926
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:50,436
Ready?

927
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:51,671
Let's do it.

928
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:52,735
Our father,

929
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:55,115
thank you for preserving our
lives another day on Earth

930
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:56,547
so we may execute
your will.

931
01:07:57,607 --> 01:07:58,607
We love you, dear Lord.

932
01:07:58,675 --> 01:08:00,348
Thank you for this meal and
this wonderful company. Amen.

933
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:02,188
Amen.

934
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:09,790
Emma.

935
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:15,858
Offer the girl her plate.

936
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:20,707
There you go. Oops!

937
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:22,737
Hold on.

938
01:08:30,073 --> 01:08:32,417
Hang on, there.
I'm gonna fix that for you.

939
01:08:33,076 --> 01:08:35,556
Let me just fix this
for you real quick.

940
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,223
I didn't touch her.

941
01:08:45,922 --> 01:08:47,492
Switch with me.

942
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,241
Mmm.

943
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:05,599
Y'all were gonna eat like
kings and queens over here.

944
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,422
And we weren't invited.

945
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:11,655
I wonder why
we weren't invited.

946
01:09:11,748 --> 01:09:13,853
Guess
they too good for us.

947
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:21,995
I'm enjoying my meal, boys.

948
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:23,468
- Are you?
- Enjoying your meal?

949
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:26,837
And as much as you
want to destroy it,

950
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,209
you're not gonna
fucking stop me.

951
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:30,172
And neither will you.
No, sir.

952
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:32,041
And neither will you.

953
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:41,054
Hey, Norman.

954
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:44,121
Do you like horses?

955
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:49,955
Don likes horses.

956
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:53,164
Ain't that right, Don?

957
01:09:58,461 --> 01:09:59,906
We're eating.

958
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,843
No, we're not.
I'm done.

959
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:04,952
I'm fucking done eating.

960
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,879
Hey, in France,

961
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:20,984
we hit the beach right after D-Day.

962
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:23,524
Right?

963
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:27,891
And we had to fight through
all these fucking hedgerows.

964
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,167
Fucking pain in the <i>ass,</i>
right?

965
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,333
We finally hit open country,
and we linked up

966
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:37,173
with the British and the Canadians
and you know what we did?

967
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:39,408
You know what we did.

968
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:44,246
We trapped an entire Kraut army
pulling back into Germany.

969
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:49,855
We fucked them up.

970
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:51,414
Yeah.

971
01:10:51,514 --> 01:10:53,016
Yes, we did.

972
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:55,427
There was dead
Krauts and horses,

973
01:10:55,518 --> 01:10:59,261
busted up tanks
and cars for miles.

974
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,361
Miles.
Mmm-hmm.

975
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,933
Your eyes see it,

976
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:09,972
but your head can't
make no sense of it.

977
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:13,213
And we go in there...

978
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:19,744
And for three whole days,

979
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,757
we shoot
the wounded horses.

980
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:24,155
All day long.

981
01:11:24,247 --> 01:11:26,989
Sunup to sundown,
just shooting horses.

982
01:11:27,717 --> 01:11:30,220
And they were
some hot summer days.

983
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:34,462
I ain't never smelt
nothing like that' top.

984
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:37,633
Do you know
how you kill a horse?

985
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,263
You pet it on the...

986
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:41,399
Pet it on
the forehead, no?

987
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:44,070
And it becomes your friend,
it goes like this.

988
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:47,171
And then you shoot it
right through the spine.

989
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:50,080
And the sound of it?

990
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:53,319
Those fucking
screaming horses?

991
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:55,411
Do you remember that, Don?

992
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:00,989
All the black clouds of
flies just buzzing around.

993
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:04,764
It was like being
in a giant beehive.

994
01:12:05,955 --> 01:12:07,662
But you weren't there.

995
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,942
That was a real fine story.

996
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,209
Pleasant mealtime talk.
Thank you.

997
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:24,676
Thank you. Thank you.

998
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,211
It is what happened, Don.

999
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:32,387
What happened, happened. What's
gonna happen is gonna happen.

1000
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,620
Sitting here playing house
with a couple bitch Krauts

1001
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:35,685
ain't gonna change
a fucking thing.

1002
01:12:35,785 --> 01:12:37,287
Shut the fuck up.

1003
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,127
Why should I shut up?

1004
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:40,392
You shouldn't.

1005
01:12:58,341 --> 01:13:00,252
I'm just drunk. I'm sorry.

1006
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:16,168
Where's Love 1-6?

1007
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:17,763
Right here.

1008
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,100
The Old Man wants you.

1009
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:20,936
How come?
You got a mission.

1010
01:13:23,032 --> 01:13:24,340
Let's go.

1011
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:29,338
Where are you going?

1012
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,051
To take the next town

1013
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:34,852
And the next and the next

1014
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:37,684
until you people quit

1015
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,523
Do you have a pen?
I'll write you.

1016
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:42,062
Y'all getting married? Is that
what the fuck y'all doing?

1017
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:43,461
This a fucking wedding?

1018
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:46,560
Hurry up.
There are more of them.

1019
01:13:47,223 --> 01:13:49,134
What am I walking into?

1020
01:13:50,293 --> 01:13:54,264
A recon plane spotted a troop
concentration moving west, here.

1021
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,738
Battalion needs you to
guard these crossroads here

1022
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:00,242
in this grid on the overlay.

1023
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:03,148
How many troops did he see?

1024
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:04,411
I don't know.

1025
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:06,884
What kind of troops?

1026
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:10,251
They have tanks,
horses, artillery?

1027
01:14:11,314 --> 01:14:12,622
I wish I could help you.
He took fire,

1028
01:14:12,715 --> 01:14:14,661
he got the fuck
out of there.

1029
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:16,889
Enough to spook the Colonel.

1030
01:14:17,987 --> 01:14:19,762
All the tanks are
driving on Berlin.

1031
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:22,496
There's a couple of thousand
cooks, mechanics and doctors here.

1032
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,969
Those Krauts hit them,
it'll be a slaughter.

1033
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,401
All we got is you.

1034
01:14:30,433 --> 01:14:32,504
<i>We need you to the
crossroads fast as you can.</i>

1035
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:35,445
Secure them. Don't stop for anything.
You understand?

1036
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:37,279
Take my gas if you have to.

1037
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,751
If those troops
get past you,

1038
01:14:40,276 --> 01:14:42,017
they're gonna smash
into the supply train.

1039
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:44,920
Then the whole
division's fucked.

1040
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:48,261
All right, sir.
We're on the way.

1041
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,631
Is that gas?
Open it up.

1042
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:54,292
Yeah, it's good.
Okay.

1043
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:55,424
Incoming!

1044
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:56,663
Grady,
jump, jump, jump!

1045
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:17,180
Grady, you up?

1046
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:29,799
You good?

1047
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:31,728
<i>Boys, good?</i>

1048
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:33,107
Thank
the Krauts for that.

1049
01:15:33,129 --> 01:15:34,164
Binkowski?

1050
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:35,365
- Davis, good?
- Grady!

1051
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:36,636
Everybody up!

1052
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:38,706
You up?

1053
01:15:40,503 --> 01:15:41,811
I'm up.

1054
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:52,986
All right, let's get
an aid station right there.

1055
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,529
Check Peterson.
We're gonna mount up.
Norman!

1056
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:57,086
- Emma!
- I got him.

1057
01:15:58,554 --> 01:15:59,931
Emma!

1058
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:05,900
Fuck. Who do you
think you are, huh?

1059
01:16:05,995 --> 01:16:07,115
Jesus Christ?

1060
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,736
Fuck!

1061
01:16:09,832 --> 01:16:11,277
You gonna raise
her up, Norman?

1062
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:12,778
Get your ass back
on the fucking tank.

1063
01:16:12,835 --> 01:16:14,746
Fuck is wrong with you? What
the fuck are you doing? Huh?

1064
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,543
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What you gonna do?

1065
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:17,605
You gonna get mad?

1066
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:19,675
You don't feel anything?
You piece of shit!

1067
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:21,415
That's it, come on! Come on.
Fuck you!

1068
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,183
You feel it?
Fuck you!

1069
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:24,884
It's called war!

1070
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:26,251
You feel it?

1071
01:16:29,852 --> 01:16:32,696
Get your fucking spindly ass
back on that fucking tank!

1072
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:35,467
Where the fuck
you think you are?

1073
01:16:40,129 --> 01:16:41,870
On, God, why?

1074
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,875
Tankers, mount up!

1075
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:38,030
You see that?

1076
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:45,605
That's an entire city
on fire.

1077
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:57,109
I started this war killing Germans in
Africa, then France, then Belgium.

1078
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,777
Now I'm killing
Germans in Germany.

1079
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,655
It will end.

1080
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:04,684
Soon.

1081
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:09,622
But before it does,
a lot more people got to die.

1082
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:51,660
Fuck! Reverse hard left!
Hard left!

1083
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:52,728
Reverse!

1084
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:56,506
Fuck!
Back up, back up,
back up! Hard left!

1085
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,880
Hatches! Hatches! <i>Back up!</i>

1086
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:01,846
<i>Go, go, go!
Let's go,
let's go, let's go!</i>

1087
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,679
<i>Back up. Left stick.</i>

1088
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:06,012
<i>Go, go, go! Hard stick!</i>

1089
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:08,518
What the fuck was it?

1090
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:09,845
<i>That was an 88.</i>

1091
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:11,687
It's a goddamn tank.

1092
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:13,185
Where the fuck is it?

1093
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:18,287
Tank! 12 o'clock,
800 yards.

1094
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:19,593
I see it!
It's a goddamn Tiger!

1095
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:20,860
<i>Put some fucking
smoke in his face!</i>

1096
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,368
Let's go, Grady.
Smoke up, Grady.

1097
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,404
Smoke's up! Clear!
On the way!

1098
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:29,471
We have to get to the crossroads.
We got to get past them.

1099
01:19:29,565 --> 01:19:31,374
Don, let's get the fuck
out of here! Let's go!

1100
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:32,810
Unless he drowns himself
in a shit-filled ditch,

1101
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:34,107
he's our problem.

1102
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:35,443
Hit that son of a bitch!

1103
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:37,210
<i>Almost</i> up!
<i>Light the bastard!</i>

1104
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:38,650
Clear!
On the way!

1105
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:41,383
Shoot that fucker!

1106
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,218
<i>Fire when ready!</i>

1107
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,257
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1108
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:54,829
Driver make ready

1109
01:19:55,591 --> 01:19:57,070
Load Anti-Tank

1110
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:59,471
All right,
all tanks, move forward!

1111
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:00,596
Fuck!

1112
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,340
<i>Peterson, right flank!
Right stick.</i>

1113
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:05,412
Davis, left with me,
stay abreast.

1114
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:06,969
Let's go right at them,
let's go right at them!

1115
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:08,070
<i>Gordo, left flank.</i>

1116
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:09,912
Let's bum-rush
this cocksucker!

1117
01:20:10,072 --> 01:20:12,245
<i>Right stick.
Taking the right flank,.</i>

1118
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,679
New target

1119
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:18,151
Tank on the left

1120
01:20:19,615 --> 01:20:21,356
10 o'clock... 700 metres

1121
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:25,121
He's coming out.

1122
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:26,188
Fire!

1123
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:28,868
- Loader, A.P, A.P.
- Clear!

1124
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:30,526
- Hit 'em!
- On the way!

1125
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,495
Commence!

1126
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:33,754
All right, pump him!
Pump him!

1127
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:34,763
<i>Gyros</i> on!

1128
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,110
What do you want, top?

1129
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:39,544
<i>Loader, A.P.,
A.P., smash him.</i>

1130
01:20:39,635 --> 01:20:41,114
You're clear, Boyd!

1131
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:44,109
A.P., 500 yards.

1132
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:45,373
Fire!

1133
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:47,612
Elevate... 600 metres

1134
01:20:47,976 --> 01:20:49,785
Again!
Fuck, Grady, put it in, now.

1135
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,051
Clear!
On the way!

1136
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:57,653
Aah, God!

1137
01:20:58,153 --> 01:20:59,359
God damn it!

1138
01:20:59,722 --> 01:21:00,962
- Fuck!
- Hit 'em!

1139
01:21:01,724 --> 01:21:03,465
Clear!
On the way!

1140
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:05,861
Same target

1141
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:07,065
Fire!

1142
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:11,844
They got Peterson!

1143
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,038
<i>God damn!</i>

1144
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:24,355
It's a fucking beast.
Fuck!

1145
01:21:24,413 --> 01:21:25,915
Gordo, flank left! Left!

1146
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:27,816
Davis, cross him.

1147
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,885
Flank right! Flank right!

1148
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:31,726
Copy!
Right stick! Right stick!

1149
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:34,164
<i>Traverse left.</i>

1150
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:35,867
Davis, he's lining up!

1151
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:37,329
Fire!

1152
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:40,506
Target 11 o'clock

1153
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,676
Shoot the son of a bitch!
He's lining up on Roy!

1154
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:46,410
<i>God damn it,
I said fire!</i>

1155
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:47,674
Fire!

1156
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:55,046
God damn it.

1157
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,111
Fuck!

1158
01:21:57,346 --> 01:21:58,347
Roy's gone.

1159
01:21:58,414 --> 01:21:59,688
We're all that's left.

1160
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:01,694
<i>It's up to us now.</i>

1161
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:03,852
Driver halt!

1162
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:06,219
Gordo, get around him.
Put us on his backside.

1163
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,861
<i>If we get behind him, we can kill him.
Go! Go! Go!</i>

1164
01:22:10,526 --> 01:22:11,903
Reverse reverse!

1165
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:14,236
Don't let him behind us!

1166
01:22:14,363 --> 01:22:15,706
Faster, Gordo!

1167
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:19,637
God damn it!

1168
01:22:21,737 --> 01:22:23,045
Forward

1169
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:26,444
Target <i>2</i> o'clock!

God damn it! Fuck!

1171
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:31,489
What was that?

1172
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:32,820
- We got hit!
- I lost it.

1173
01:22:32,915 --> 01:22:33,950
Boyd,
are you all right?

1174
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:35,049
- Aw! Shit!
- Fuck!

1175
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,562
We lost power traverse.
Switching to manual.

1176
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:37,892
Boyd,
you stay in the fight!

1177
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,489
<i>Bible, hit</i> him!
<i>On the way!</i>

He's coming around!

1179

<i>Gordo, you got
to outrun that gun!</i>

1180

Oh. I got it! I got it!

1181
01:22:45,227 --> 01:22:46,228
Fire!

1182
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:49,507
<i>Gordo, put it

where the armour's thin.

1184

I know where to
fucking hit him!

<i>God damn it,
I said in the ass!</i>

1189

We're moving too fast!
It's not that fucking easy!

1190
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:04,254
Come on,
Boyd, stay on him!

1191
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,486
Gordo, when I say back up, you back up.
Left stick.

1192
01:23:06,582 --> 01:23:07,583
All right, all right.

01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:38,413
Yeah, boy.

1214

Radio check,
Love 1-6.

1215

Good fucking job, Gordo.

Radio check, Love 1-6.

1219
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,901
Radio's eighty-sixed.
We're on our own.

1220
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:10,107
Good shot.

1221
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:14,712
Oh, it wasn't me.
No, no, I'm the instrument,
not the hand.

1222
01:25:16,712 --> 01:25:18,749
God didn't call us today.

1223
01:25:18,814 --> 01:25:20,487
You hear me, boys?

1224
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:22,459
What's he
doing up there?

1225
01:25:23,385 --> 01:25:25,228
Big pair of dice?

1226
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:29,596
Everyone else came up
snake eyes but us?

1227
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,904
Lord's protection.
We got it,
don't we, Boyd?

1228
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,769
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
We got it.

1229
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:38,005
Norman mowed them fuckers
down, didn't he, too?

1230
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,340
Good job, Norman.

1231
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:40,640
Welcome
to the Army, Norm.

1232
01:25:40,769 --> 01:25:42,248
You did good.

1233
01:25:42,838 --> 01:25:44,442
Oh-ho-ho!

1234
01:25:45,841 --> 01:25:47,081
Best job
l ever had.

1235
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:48,917
Best job I ever had.

1236
01:25:49,411 --> 01:25:51,118
Best job I ever had.

1237
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,656
Best job I ever had.

1238
01:25:57,452 --> 01:25:58,624
Shit.

1239
01:26:01,123 --> 01:26:02,761
We're still open for business.

1240
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:05,304
Let's head out for
those crossroads,

1241
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,704
keep it out of Krauts' hands
like we've been told.

1242
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:11,500
There's a wave coming in. We're
the rock to break that wave.

1243
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:14,603
<i>Vamonos.</i>

1244
01:26:16,705 --> 01:26:17,979
Gordo, get us out of here.

1245
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:20,684
Fuck it.

1246
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:42,241
All right,
there's the crossroads.

1247
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,638
Gordo, take us up
on that hill.

1248
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:45,299
We can cover the whole
valley from there.

1249
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:56,151
Grady, get down!

1250
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:04,227
Shit! Not another
fucking Tiger!

1251
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:05,263
A mine.
Where's it coming from?

1252
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:07,890
Where?
Settle down. It's a mine.
We hit a mine, is all.

1253
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:08,990
Whew!

1254
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:10,695
Everybody off.
Grady?

1255
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:11,829
Yeah, I'm off.

1256
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,338
Shit.

1257
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:16,107
How bad is it?

1258
01:27:16,198 --> 01:27:19,179
It's broke as fuck.
Busted a bogie, too.

1259
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:21,012
Can you fix it?

1260
01:27:21,503 --> 01:27:23,210
Yeah, why not?

1261
01:27:31,513 --> 01:27:33,720
All right, Norman, you and
Coon-Ass check out that building.

1262
01:27:33,782 --> 01:27:34,920
Get my Thompson.

1263
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:36,086
What?

1264
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:37,288
Go get the Thompson.

1265
01:27:37,385 --> 01:27:39,092
- Gordo!
- Yeah?

1266
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:40,257
You got that rope bag?

1267
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:41,390
Right here.

1268
01:28:09,584 --> 01:28:13,259
You can put the gun down, Norman.
Ain't gonna do nothing.

1269
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:23,833
Can we go now?

1270
01:28:26,835 --> 01:28:28,906
Norman, I'm sorry. You know?

1271
01:28:30,906 --> 01:28:32,613
I think...

1272
01:28:33,909 --> 01:28:35,911
I think you're a good man.

1273
01:28:36,912 --> 01:28:38,585
It's what I think.

1274
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:44,862
I think maybe we ain't,
but I think you are.

1275
01:28:44,953 --> 01:28:48,196
See, I just...
I wanted to tell you that

1276
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:52,203
It's okay.

1277
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,704
Come on, let's go.

1278
01:29:00,535 --> 01:29:02,446
Anything?
No, nothing.

1279
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:05,478
It's an aid station.
They all dead.

1280
01:29:09,711 --> 01:29:10,849
Kid.

1281
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:16,989
Head up top of that hill, near those trees.
You got outpost guard.

1282
01:29:17,953 --> 01:29:19,796
Can I grab my canteen?

1283
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:22,664
Yeah, you can
grab your canteen.

1284
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:38,407
Norman!

1285
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:41,810
Top of the hill, then work
your way from the trees.

1286
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:15,163
Hey! Hey!

1287
01:32:17,799 --> 01:32:19,369
Good evening, Norman. Why
aren't you at your post?

1288
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:20,467
Slow down.

1289
01:32:20,502 --> 01:32:22,504
They're coming right now.
Who's coming?

1290
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:23,809
The Germans!

1291
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:24,976
How many?

1292
01:32:25,306 --> 01:32:26,386
Too many.
Too many to count.

1293
01:32:26,474 --> 01:32:27,578
How many?

1294
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:31,552
Oh, about two,
maybe 300 of them.

1295
01:32:31,646 --> 01:32:33,182
They got vehicles, too.

1296
01:32:33,248 --> 01:32:35,159
Tanks?
No, no, no, just trucks.

1297
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:37,389
Probably a bunch of bums
looking to surrender, that's all.

1298
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:39,396
No. No, no, no. They were
marching, they were singing.

1299
01:32:39,487 --> 01:32:40,591
They sounded like
they wanted a fight.

1300
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:42,395
What do you mean,
they were singing?
Where?

1301
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:44,333
I'm telling you.
Right over there.

1302
01:32:47,362 --> 01:32:49,239
Hey, you hear that?

1303
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:50,900
It's a goddamn
SS battalion.

1304
01:32:50,999 --> 01:32:52,034
Bullshit.

1305
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:53,738
Jesus Christ.

1306
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:57,113
Grady, get my gun.
Yeah.

1307
01:32:57,205 --> 01:32:58,775
You want to get the weapons?
Shit.

1308
01:32:58,873 --> 01:33:00,716
What do you want to do? Let's
just get our shit, all right?

1309
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:03,949
Look, it's about to be dark. We
just get on up out of here, huh?

1310
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:05,786
- Let 'em pass on through.
- Let's him them woods.

1311
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,884
Norman, go get
your shit. Go get your pack.

1312
01:33:09,684 --> 01:33:11,288
Let's go.

1313
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,431
We never run before,
I ain't running now.

1314
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:16,559
What was that?
We're gonna fight it out.

1315
01:33:16,624 --> 01:33:17,624
We can't.

1316
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:19,035
I'm gonna hold
this crossroad.

1317
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:21,938
What you mean, you're gonna hold...
The tank's busted!

1318
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:23,941
The tank's fucking busted, top!
Hey.

1319
01:33:24,032 --> 01:33:25,534
Yeah, you said that.
Top, what are you doing?

1320
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,874
What do you want to do?
You want to sit here?

1321
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,107
I'm gonna hold this crossroad.
You want to sit here

1322
01:33:28,203 --> 01:33:29,204
and hold off
a SS battalion...

1323
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:30,943
No, it's not what I want to do,
but it's what we're doing.

1324
01:33:31,039 --> 01:33:33,041
There's five of us... Get to your
fighting positions! Mount up!

1325
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:34,917
What you mean fucking fighting
positions when we ain't got a tank?

1326
01:33:34,976 --> 01:33:36,080
How we gonna fight?

1327
01:33:36,144 --> 01:33:37,214
We got a cannon!

1328
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:38,318
Don,
that don't make sense!

1329
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:40,882
Stop! What are you doing?

1330
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:57,500
Get out of here.
Get to that tree line.

1331
01:34:05,173 --> 01:34:08,518
Boys, take care of yourselves.
Get to that tree line.

1332
01:34:17,352 --> 01:34:18,831
It's all right.

1333
01:34:19,921 --> 01:34:20,956
Hmm.

1334
01:34:22,423 --> 01:34:24,027
It's all right.

1335
01:34:27,095 --> 01:34:28,540
It's my home.

1336
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,717
I'm staying here with you.

1337
01:34:52,387 --> 01:34:53,457
All right.

1338
01:34:53,955 --> 01:34:55,901
I'll need you to load.

1339
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:00,904
Boys, get on.
It's all right.

1340
01:35:03,298 --> 01:35:04,868
Grady, come on.

1341
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:10,915
We're gonna stay.

1342
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:12,006
Uh-huh.

1343
01:35:17,011 --> 01:35:18,684
What is your plan?

1344
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:33,501
Fuck it.

1345
01:35:37,665 --> 01:35:39,235
Get us one of
them dead Krauts.

1346
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:10,236
Light him up.

1347
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:34,263
You wanna take that
kit right there. That's it.

1348
01:36:34,322 --> 01:36:37,997
- Go and grab it. That's it.
- All right, all right.

1349
01:36:38,726 --> 01:36:39,727
Grease gun.

1350
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,637
Go on, hand it to him.
Another box.

1351
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:44,767
Go ahead and get it ready.
Listen, you do not waste one shot.

1352
01:36:44,832 --> 01:36:46,140
- You hear me?
- Gordo.

1353
01:36:46,234 --> 01:36:47,577
- Grenades.
- Ammo count.

1354
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:49,740
- Put that there.
- Make them count.

1355
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:52,284
What kind of rounds
you got up there? Norm?

1356
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:53,614
I only got two.
All right.

1357
01:36:53,675 --> 01:36:55,245
Ready?

1358
01:36:55,576 --> 01:36:56,782
That's it. Yeah.

1359
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:00,660
I'm going through
ammo like water.

1360
01:37:01,082 --> 01:37:05,497
That's four rounds of smoke, and
23 super charge and 33 solid shot.

1361
01:37:05,586 --> 01:37:07,327
What you want, top?
Load super charge.

1362
01:37:07,422 --> 01:37:08,492
Set the point delay.

1363
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:10,598
Norman, get it ready.

1364
01:37:15,763 --> 01:37:17,640
That's it.
Here we go, Boyd.

1365
01:37:21,536 --> 01:37:23,106
Gordo,
grab me that one.

1366
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:30,613
Boyd.
Thank you.

1367
01:37:30,945 --> 01:37:32,686
Give me that can.

1368
01:37:48,996 --> 01:37:50,276
Might as well
get a little tight.

1369
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:53,141
Won't be around
for the hangover.

1370
01:38:11,819 --> 01:38:13,093
Ah...

1371
01:38:13,187 --> 01:38:15,428
God' that's better than good.

1372
01:38:16,157 --> 01:38:17,158
Mmm.

1373
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:22,708
Give it here.

1374
01:38:28,202 --> 01:38:29,681
Give it here.

1375
01:38:35,009 --> 01:38:36,129
What you gonna do with that?

1376
01:38:36,177 --> 01:38:37,781
I'm gonna drink it.

1377
01:38:39,347 --> 01:38:42,351
I know you hate me
preaching. I know it.

1378
01:38:42,417 --> 01:38:44,727
But what we're doing here is
a righteous act, gentlemen.

1379
01:38:45,286 --> 01:38:46,890
You hear me, Gordo?
Mmm-hmm.

1380
01:38:52,193 --> 01:38:55,231
You know, there's a Bible verse
I think about sometimes.

1381
01:38:57,064 --> 01:38:58,441
Many times.

1382
01:38:59,367 --> 01:39:00,812
It goes...

1383
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:05,749
"Then I heard
the voice of the Lord saying,

1384
01:39:05,807 --> 01:39:09,050
"'Whom shall I send?
And who will go for us?'

1385
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:21,631
"And I said,

1386
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:24,492
“Here am I.

1387
01:39:26,461 --> 01:39:28,065
“Send me!"

1388
01:39:34,902 --> 01:39:36,404
"'Send me"

1389
01:39:38,439 --> 01:39:40,817
Book of Isaiah, Chapter Six.

1390
01:39:49,684 --> 01:39:52,028
Yeah. Yeah, Don.

1391
01:39:53,955 --> 01:39:56,435
That's exactly right.
Oh, wow.

1392
01:39:57,792 --> 01:39:58,793
You're something.

1393
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:20,386
God damn, son.

1394
01:40:21,048 --> 01:40:24,029
You a fighting, fucking,
drinking machine, ain't you?

1395
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,790
Machine, that's it,
that's his war name.

1396
01:40:27,288 --> 01:40:28,494
That's perfect.

1397
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:30,826
I christen
thee "Machine."

1398
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:33,905
Machine!
Machine!

1399
01:40:34,061 --> 01:40:35,165
Machine!

1400
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:36,640
Machine!
Yeah.

1401
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:40,042
Machine.

1402
01:40:43,704 --> 01:40:45,081
I love it in here.

1403
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:47,183
I do.

1404
01:40:48,643 --> 01:40:50,088
Best job I ever had.

1405
01:40:50,177 --> 01:40:51,588
Best fucking job.

1406
01:40:55,149 --> 01:40:56,594
Yeah.

1407
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:07,495
They're coming.

1408
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:16,180
No one makes
a move unless I say.

1409
01:41:16,871 --> 01:41:18,407
Come on, you
cocksuckers, come on in.

1410
01:41:44,699 --> 01:41:45,734
Come on in.

1411
01:41:52,406 --> 01:41:53,783
Almost.

1412
01:42:00,982 --> 01:42:02,893
Come on in. Hey, come on.

1413
01:42:18,633 --> 01:42:19,668
Now!

1414
01:42:23,237 --> 01:42:25,410
Like that, motherfuckers?

1415
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:26,850
- Clear!
- Fire!

1416
01:42:26,941 --> 01:42:28,011
On the way!

1417
01:42:30,444 --> 01:42:32,082
Clear!
On the way!

1418
01:42:47,695 --> 01:42:49,641
Fucking Nazi. Fuck!

1419
01:42:53,267 --> 01:42:54,837
They're running! They're running!
Traverse left!

1420
01:42:54,935 --> 01:42:57,006
Bow gunner, squirt those
assholes running for that mill.

1421
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:58,481
Cut those fuckers down!

1422
01:43:01,042 --> 01:43:02,680
Loader, four rounds
of Willy Pete.

1423
01:43:02,777 --> 01:43:04,620
Bible, put it in that building.
It's full of fucking Krauts.

1424
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:05,953
Clear!
Fire! Fire!

1425
01:43:06,047 --> 01:43:07,219
On the way!

1426
01:43:10,618 --> 01:43:12,029
Give me another.
That was beautiful.

1427
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:14,799
You clear!
On the way!

1428
01:43:16,457 --> 01:43:17,537
Bow gunner,
watch that left!

1429
01:43:17,625 --> 01:43:19,127
Yeah, you better fucking run.

1430
01:43:28,469 --> 01:43:29,641
Traverse right!

1431
01:43:33,374 --> 01:43:34,512
On the way!

1432
01:43:37,311 --> 01:43:39,313
Bible, stay on 'em.
15 up, 15 up. Fire!

1433
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:40,723
Clear!
On the way!

1434
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,952
Traverse right!
Doughs, two o'clock!

1435
01:43:46,987 --> 01:43:48,489
Give 'em a big
kick in the butt!

1436
01:43:49,090 --> 01:43:50,694
All right, I'm on them.

1437
01:43:50,758 --> 01:43:52,328
You're clear!
On the way!

1438
01:43:52,993 --> 01:43:54,836
Loader, give me another point delay.
Skip it on the ground.

1439
01:43:54,895 --> 01:43:55,930
Bounce those fuckers!

1440
01:43:58,099 --> 01:43:59,703
Clear!
On the way!

1441
01:44:01,168 --> 01:44:02,909
Come on!

1442
01:44:06,207 --> 01:44:07,242
Hit 'em again!

1443
01:44:07,775 --> 01:44:09,015
Go, boys! Go, boys!

1444
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:11,283
Grady, Grady, Grady,
Grady, Grady, come on, now.

1445
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:12,919
Clear!
Light 'em up!

1446
01:44:13,013 --> 01:44:14,083
On the way!

1447
01:44:15,516 --> 01:44:16,893
Down 15. Steady.

1448
01:44:17,551 --> 01:44:18,552
Traverse left!

1449
01:44:20,221 --> 01:44:21,700
- You clear!
- Fire at will!

1450
01:44:21,756 --> 01:44:22,757
On the way!

1451
01:44:24,558 --> 01:44:26,158
That's right,
burn to the fucking ground.

1452
01:44:30,564 --> 01:44:31,702
Machine, clock one!

1453
01:44:38,072 --> 01:44:39,142
I'm out!

1454
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,378
I need a new can!

1455
01:44:40,474 --> 01:44:41,544
Shoot, we out! We out!

1456
01:44:41,609 --> 01:44:44,488
Fuck. We got a case rupture.
This gun is gone.

1457
01:44:44,912 --> 01:44:46,084
We need more
boxes of ammo!

1458
01:44:46,147 --> 01:44:47,251
We got .30
on the roof.

1459
01:44:47,314 --> 01:44:48,725
All right,
we got ammo outside.

1460
01:44:49,216 --> 01:44:50,416
I'm gonna lay
down some smokes.

1461
01:44:51,218 --> 01:44:53,755
Gordo, on my signal, pop your
hatch, lay down some cover fire.

1462
01:44:53,888 --> 01:44:55,128
Okay, roger.
Machine,
you do the same.

1463
01:44:55,222 --> 01:44:56,462
Grab that grease gun.
Copy.

1464
01:44:56,557 --> 01:44:58,935
Cover right! Bible,
get ready to snatch that .30.

1465
01:44:58,993 --> 01:45:00,097
Roger.

1466
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:21,926
All right, here we go.

1467
01:45:26,453 --> 01:45:27,488
Go!

1468
01:45:37,498 --> 01:45:38,499
They're outside the tank!

1469
01:45:38,599 --> 01:45:39,600
Pick them off!

1470
01:45:44,471 --> 01:45:45,609
Come on, Boyd!

1471
01:45:47,208 --> 01:45:48,448
Take it, Grady.

1472
01:46:06,193 --> 01:46:07,194
Move up!

1473
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:08,499
Button up!

1474
01:46:28,582 --> 01:46:29,754
Quick, quick, quick!

1475
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:31,570
- Quick, quick, quick!
- Hurry up, Grady!

1476
01:46:40,828 --> 01:46:42,205
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Aah, fuck!

1477
01:46:42,263 --> 01:46:43,674
Shoot him, Bible!

1478
01:46:59,346 --> 01:47:01,087
Gord? Gordo?

1479
01:47:01,181 --> 01:47:02,854
Grady,
I need two more.

1480
01:47:03,117 --> 01:47:04,596
I got two left.

1481
01:47:04,685 --> 01:47:06,062
They're getting cocky.

1482
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:07,121
Fuckers.

1483
01:47:07,221 --> 01:47:08,359
He's hit.

1484
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:11,562
Damn sure ain't no good
leaking oil everywhere.

1485
01:47:11,692 --> 01:47:13,194
So patch me up, then.

1486
01:47:13,727 --> 01:47:15,807
Hey, take these two boxes.
Put 'em down below.

1487
01:47:16,063 --> 01:47:17,565
Hey, Grady, come on.
Keep it coming.

1488
01:47:17,631 --> 01:47:19,542
All right.
Open the other one for me.

1489
01:47:22,903 --> 01:47:26,783
If a man loves the world, the
love of the father's not in him.

1490
01:47:29,043 --> 01:47:30,920
For all that's
in the world,

1491
01:47:31,245 --> 01:47:35,387
lust of the flesh, lust of
the eyes, pride of life

1492
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:39,292
it's not of the father.
It's of the world.

1493
01:47:40,154 --> 01:47:42,065
The world and its
desires pass away.

1494
01:47:42,556 --> 01:47:44,968
But he who does God's
will is gonna live forever.

1495
01:47:45,159 --> 01:47:46,433
Forever.

1496
01:47:59,139 --> 01:48:00,516
Lift it up.

1497
01:48:05,913 --> 01:48:07,688
Swarm and kill them!

1498
01:48:08,582 --> 01:48:09,583
Make them count!

1499
01:48:10,084 --> 01:48:11,859
They're all we have

1500
01:48:33,874 --> 01:48:36,548
Save your ammo. Don't
shoot unless you see something.

1501
01:48:37,277 --> 01:48:38,847
We can be damn sure they're
working their way behind us.

1502
01:48:38,946 --> 01:48:40,653
- Anybody see anything?
- I see nothing.

1503
01:48:40,714 --> 01:48:41,852
I got nothing.
Nothing.

1504
01:48:43,450 --> 01:48:44,485
Advance, advance quickly

1505
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:50,862
Panzerfaust, four o'clock!

1506
01:48:52,459 --> 01:48:53,494
Traverse right!

1507
01:48:55,496 --> 01:48:57,373
He missed!
Hit him with the coax!

1508
01:49:05,973 --> 01:49:07,043
Fuck!

1509
01:49:16,417 --> 01:49:17,987
Grady. Hey.

1510
01:49:19,653 --> 01:49:21,496
Fuck! Fuck!

1511
01:49:22,322 --> 01:49:25,098
No. No. No.

1512
01:49:27,494 --> 01:49:29,098
No. No.

1513
01:49:30,697 --> 01:49:31,937
God.

1514
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:34,368
Hey, Grady...

1515
01:49:34,435 --> 01:49:35,436
Get up!

1516
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:36,707
We're still in this fight!

1517
01:49:38,939 --> 01:49:40,179
We're still in this fight!

1518
01:49:43,677 --> 01:49:45,679
Watch our right,
watch our right.

1519
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:51,020
Stay on the .30.
Keep hammering them.

1520
01:50:05,732 --> 01:50:07,973
Yeah, you motherfuckers!
Come on.

1521
01:50:14,541 --> 01:50:16,145
How long can we keep this up?

1522
01:50:17,644 --> 01:50:18,816
Come on, keep shooting!

1523
01:50:18,912 --> 01:50:20,050
Fuck, I'm out! I'm out!

1524
01:50:20,914 --> 01:50:21,984
I need a new can!

1525
01:50:22,249 --> 01:50:23,409
That was our last belt.

1526
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:24,551
She's out!

1527
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:27,626
That's all there is.

1528
01:50:28,555 --> 01:50:29,625
Fuck!

1529
01:50:29,723 --> 01:50:30,758
Fuck.

1530
01:50:30,824 --> 01:50:31,962
Don't get your
panties in a bunch.

1531
01:50:32,059 --> 01:50:34,005
We still got hand
weapons and the .50.

1532
01:50:38,265 --> 01:50:39,403
Who's with me?

1533
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:44,290
They're running low
on ammunition!

1534
01:50:45,072 --> 01:50:47,279
Finish them!

1535
01:50:48,242 --> 01:50:49,687
This is our land!

1536
01:50:50,077 --> 01:50:51,249
Attention!

1537
01:50:51,445 --> 01:50:52,515
Move out!

1538
01:51:03,323 --> 01:51:04,597
Gordo?

1539
01:51:06,793 --> 01:51:08,101
Machine!

1540
01:51:44,798 --> 01:51:46,175
Where the hell are they?

1541
01:51:48,368 --> 01:51:49,972
They're everywhere.

1542
01:52:16,029 --> 01:52:18,373
Fuck! Fuck, I'm out!

1543
01:52:19,499 --> 01:52:21,001
Gun's gone! I need a weapon!

1544
01:52:21,835 --> 01:52:22,905
Bible, no!

1545
01:52:56,703 --> 01:52:58,046
Grenade!

1546
01:53:22,929 --> 01:53:24,340
Go! Come on!

1547
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:33,913
What the fuck
are you doing?

1548
01:53:33,974 --> 01:53:35,351
Button up!
I'm sorry!

1549
01:53:36,576 --> 01:53:37,919
I'm sorry.

1550
01:53:40,247 --> 01:53:41,248
Smoke grenades, now!

1551
01:54:06,473 --> 01:54:09,613
We're going to skin you alive!

1552
01:54:10,277 --> 01:54:12,450
Shut up and send me
more pigs to kill!

1553
01:54:20,354 --> 01:54:21,662
Fuck you!

1554
01:54:25,459 --> 01:54:26,631
Bible, grenades!

1555
01:54:30,997 --> 01:54:32,169
Here, take...

1556
01:56:44,331 --> 01:56:46,004
I'm sorry, son.

1557
01:56:48,435 --> 01:56:49,436
Uh...

1558
01:56:50,270 --> 01:56:51,647
It's okay.

1559
01:56:53,707 --> 01:56:55,345
What can you do?

1560
01:57:09,623 --> 01:57:11,227
I did my best.

1561
01:57:12,726 --> 01:57:13,830
Yeah.

1562
01:57:14,461 --> 01:57:16,634
I know. I know.

1563
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:31,848
Sergeant Collier?

1564
01:57:33,013 --> 01:57:34,583
Yeah, son?

1565
01:57:41,855 --> 01:57:43,528
I'm scared.

1566
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:48,767
I'm scared, too.

1567
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:00,376
Oh, Jesus.

1568
01:58:01,708 --> 01:58:03,915
Oh, fuck,
I want to surrender.

1569
01:58:06,413 --> 01:58:08,017
Please don't.

1570
01:58:09,449 --> 01:58:10,894
They'll hurt
you real bad.

1571
01:58:10,951 --> 01:58:12,294
Oh, fuck.

1572
01:58:14,187 --> 01:58:16,428
And they'll kill you
real bad.

1573
01:58:18,692 --> 01:58:20,603
Fuck, what do I do?

1574
01:58:22,729 --> 01:58:24,367
There's a hatch.

1575
01:58:25,031 --> 01:58:26,635
Okay. Okay.

1576
01:58:26,967 --> 01:58:29,072
Do you see it?
I see it.

1577
01:58:29,135 --> 01:58:31,137
You know where it is?
I know where it is.

1578
01:58:42,382 --> 01:58:43,656
What the fuck?

1579
01:58:51,224 --> 01:58:52,430
Go.

1580
02:03:23,363 --> 02:03:24,706
Easy, boy.

1581
02:03:26,099 --> 02:03:27,442
Easy, now.

1582
02:03:28,334 --> 02:03:29,711
One's alive!

1583
02:03:48,221 --> 02:03:50,792
Easy. Easy, buddy.

1584
02:03:51,190 --> 02:03:52,533
Come on.

1585
02:03:52,592 --> 02:03:54,902
All right,
there we go. Okay.

1586
02:03:54,961 --> 02:03:57,771
You all right?
You hit? You hurt?

1587
02:03:57,864 --> 02:03:59,138
I'm...

1588
02:03:59,232 --> 02:04:01,212
You seem all right.
Let me take this.

1589
02:04:02,702 --> 02:04:04,704
We'll leave you with that.

1590
02:04:04,771 --> 02:04:06,876
Hey, you're a hero, buddy.

1591
02:04:08,041 --> 02:04:09,714
Do you know that'?
