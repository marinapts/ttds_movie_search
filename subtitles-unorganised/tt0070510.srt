1
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:00,371
<i>Say, it's only a paper moon</i>

2
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,374
<i>Sailing over a cardboard sea</i>

3
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,377
<i>But it wouldn't be make-believe</i>

4
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,214
<i>If you believed in me</i>

5
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,635
<i>Yes, it's only a canvas sky</i>

6
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,930
<i>Hanging over a cotton tree</i>

7
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,516
<i>But it wouldn't be make-believe</i>

8
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,936
<i>If you believed in me</i>

9
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,897
<i>Without your love</i>



10
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:29,609
<i>It's a honky-tonk parade</i>

11
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,612
<i>Without your love</i>

12
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:36,157
<i>It's a melody played in a penny arcade</i>

13
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:40,161
<i>It's a Barnum and Bailey world</i>

14
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,123
<i>Just as hollow as it can be</i>

15
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,292
<i>But it wouldn't be make-believe</i>

16
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,045
<i>If you believed in me</i>

17
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:56,427
<i>Rock of ages, cleft for me</i>

18
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:01,099
<i>Let me hide myself in thee</i>

19
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,979
<i>Let the water and the blood</i>

20
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:11,609
<i>From thy wounded side which flowed</i>

21
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:16,698
<i>Be of sin the double cure</i>

22
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:22,370
<i>Safe from wrath and make me pure</i>

23
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,165
"Judge me, oh Lord,

24
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,625
"for I have lost in mine integrity.

25
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:32,088
"I have trusted also in the Lord,

26
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,924
"therefore I shall not slide.

27
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,637
"Examine me, oh Lord, and prove me.

28
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,516
"Try my reins and my heart,

29
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,812
"for Thy loving kindness

30
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,565
"and I have walked in Thy truth.

31
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,652
"I have not sat with evil persons.

32
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,698
"Neither will I go in with dissemblers.

33
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,576
"I will wash mine hands

34
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,828
"in innocency.

35
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:08,124
"So will I compass Thine altar, O Lord,

36
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:13,046
"that I may publish
with the voice of thanksgiving

37
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,089
"and tell of all Thy wondrous works..."

38
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,633
Howdy.

39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,760
Loggins' funeral.

40
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,553
Yes, ma'am.

41
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,515
- You ain't related, are ya?
- Related, ma'am?

42
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:29,187
We're looking for the child's kin.
Thought I saw some resemblance.

43
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,899
No kin, huh?

44
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,109
None we know of,
'cept out in Missouri someplace.

45
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,570
- Missouri...
- Seems you got the child's jaw.

46
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,240
No, ma'am, just a friend of her mama's,
just passing through town.

47
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,867
If ever a child needed a friend.

48
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,662
"...will I bless the Lord.

49
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,996
"Amen."

50
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,790
Amen.

51
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,547
Amen, Essie Maye.
I just know your ass is still warm.

52
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,216
Would you like some water, Addie?

53
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,260
We'll get the child some water.

54
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,352
Bless you child, I just want to pay
my respects to your mama.

55
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,730
Well, I'm going to have to be going.
It's a long way to St. Louis.

56
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,525
- St. Louis? You mean in Missouri?
- Yes, ma'am.

57
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,193
I... I sell the good book, ma'am.

58
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,362
Just moving through the country
with the Lord's good news.

59
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,615
Addie, child, don't you have
your Aunt Billie living in St. Joseph?

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,117
St. Joseph, Missouri.

61
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,286
It's her poor mother's sister.

62
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,080
- The child's only known relative.
- That so?

63
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,792
You're driving your chariot to Missouri, sir.
You could deliver this child to her kin folk.

64
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,877
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it a chariot, Reverend.

65
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,839
- I'll write the women a letter tonight.
- Hold it, hold it.

66
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,591
I have to think upon this,
you know, uh...

67
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,969
I mean, I may have to make
a few stops along the way.

68
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,762
I never travelled with no child before.

69
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,182
- But you're going that way.
- The child's got no place to go.

70
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,059
Well...

71
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,230
The eyes of the Lord...
Expect I have no choice, do I?

72
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,899
- Hallelujah!
- God works in mysterious ways.

73
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,401
Don't he now?

74
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,361
Come on, Addie.
Better get your things together.

75
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,323
This nice man's going to take
you to your aunt.

76
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,793
- How come you're taking me?
- Huh?

77
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,503
How come you're taking me?

78
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,756
Because I'm going that way, honey.

79
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,260
Although, I do want to make just one stop
before we leave town.

80
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,847
Got a little business to take care of.

81
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:31,225
- You know my mama real good?
- Oh, pretty good.

82
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,832
You just stay out here
till I come for you.

83
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,709
Don't you say a word
unless I ask you to.

84
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,669
Mr Robertson?

85
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,588
- That's right.
- I'd like a minute of your time.

86
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,340
- Not buying today.
- Oh, not selling.

87
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,343
Just want you to meet somebody,
Mr Robertson. Only take a second.

88
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,469
So what?

89
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,012
- Tell him your name, honey.
- Addie.

90
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,639
- Addie what, honey?
- Addie Loggins.

91
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,144
You done real fine.
I'll be out in a minute.

92
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,022
Ain't she a sweet child?

93
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,982
No, she ain't a sweet child.

94
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,693
Well, maybe she don't seem sweet right now.
That's because she's sad.

95
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,070
That is with her mama being dead,

96
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,906
what with your brother getting drunk
and driving into that tree like that.

97
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,908
What are you trying to pull?
Get out of here!

98
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,494
All right, I'm going, but let me tell you
where I'm going to go.

99
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,121
I don't care where you're going to go.

100
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,914
I'm going to go see Mr J.T. Faraday.

101
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,125
Now, you know who Mr J.T. Faraday is?

102
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,085
He's one of the biggest lawyers
in Kansas.

103
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,796
And he don't favour the man with the money,
he favours the man without it.

104
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,840
And you know what's gonna happen
to your brother?

105
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,342
There's gonna be a lawsuit against him.
You know what happens then?

106
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,053
Everything's gonna be just tied up
in knots, just sitting there.

107
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,765
That's his banking money,
his house, everything he owns.

108
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,892
Including half this plant.

109
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,687
Now, don't think that poor child
ain't entitled, 'cause she is.

110
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,900
I was thinking...

111
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,735
couple a thousand dollars
would be acceptable.

112
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,737
Couple of thou? I'll give you 200.

113
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,199
$200?

114
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,325
$200.

115
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,204
It's a deal.

116
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,624
There you are.

117
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,765
That'll be, uh, $67.54.

118
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,350
You sure these tyres are new?

119
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,437
$67.54.

120
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,158
Now, we'll have you
to St. Jo in no time.

121
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,328
What time's the next train
to St. Joseph?

122
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,872
St. Joseph? Let's see here.

123
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,790
That'll be the 4:14.

124
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,586
Change trains in Kansas City,
and that'll put you into St. Jo at 9:52am.

125
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,921
I want one child's price ticket.

126
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,470
That will be $11.45.

127
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,097
I want you to send this here telegram
to Mrs Billie Roy Griggs,

128
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,724
Cosmo Road, St. Joseph.

129
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,684
Train arriving 9:52am,

130
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,145
and bringing love,
affection and $20 cash.

131
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,065
Oh, make that $25 cash.

132
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,484
And sign it just Addie Loggins.

133
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,321
Ten words, that will be 85 cents more.

134
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,949
That will be 12 and 30.

135
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,617
12 and 30, huh?

136
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,869
Uh, you better say
in that message there,

137
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,163
love, affection and $20 cash.

138
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,333
Love, affection and $20 cash.

139
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,140
Now, here's your ticket,
and here's $20 for your Aunt Billie.

140
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,105
Well, we got till 4:15.

141
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,525
I don't suppose you can wait
here by yourself, can you?

142
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,781
You hungry?

143
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,616
You want a Nehi and a Coney Island?

144
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,939
- Ain't you gonna eat it?
- I ain't hungry.

145
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,192
D'you worry about going on the train?
You'll like the train. Don't worry about it.

146
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,195
Before you know it, you'll be asleep in your
aunt's house, all your troubles will be over.

147
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,615
- So eat your Coney Island.
- She don't even know me.

148
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,700
- She's going to know you now.
- She ain't gonna want me.

149
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,952
What are you making trouble for?
She ain't even seen you, yet.

150
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,872
- She never even cared for my mama.
- Nobody didn't care for your mama.

151
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,583
- And she was her sister.
- Your mama was a fine woman.

152
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,834
Everybody said she weren't.

153
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,211
Well everybody don't know
your mama, do they?

154
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,464
How good you know my mama?

155
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,550
Good enough to know you can be real proud
of the happiness she give to people.

156
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,385
Now, eat your Coney Island.

157
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,140
You meet my mama in a bar room?

158
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,933
Where would you get
a question like that?

159
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,312
I hear Miss Ollie talking, the neighbour
lady. Says one of you's my pa.

160
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,023
Well, don't the world
have a wild imagination?

161
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,361
Eat your Coney Island.

162
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,488
You my pa?

163
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,783
Of course I ain't your pa.

164
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,534
I'll get you some relish.

165
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,330
A Coney Island ain't no good
without relish.

166
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,709
Look, I know how you feel.
I lost my ma, too. I even lost my pa.

167
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,961
I don't even know where my sister is.

168
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,632
I wish I could tell you I'm your pa,
but it just ain't like that.

169
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,761
You met her in a bar room.

170
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,889
Just because a man meets a woman
in a bar room don't mean he's your pa.

171
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,974
Eat your Coney Island.

172
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,107
Well, then, if you ain't my pa,
I want my $200.

173
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:12,983
What's that?

174
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,611
I want my $200.

175
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,738
I heard you through the door
talking to that man.

176
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,782
It's my money you got, and I want it.

177
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,034
Now, you... you just hold on a second.

178
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,954
I want my money. You took my $200!

179
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,832
- Will you quiet down, you hear?
- I want my $200!

180
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,209
Hold on, now, just hold on.

181
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,711
Let me explain something to you.

182
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,879
It ain't as if you was my pa.
That'd be different.

183
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,965
Well, I ain't your pa,
so just get that out of your head.

184
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,717
I don't care
what those neighbour ladies said.

185
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,176
- I look like that.
- You don't look nothing like me.

186
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,595
You don't look any more like me
than you do that Coney Island.

187
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,013
Eat that damn thing, you hear?

188
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,725
- We got the same jaw.
- Lots of people got the same jaw.

189
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,185
- It's possible.
- No, no, it ain't possible.

190
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,771
- Then I want my $200!
- All right!

191
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,024
All right, maybe we got the same jaw,
but same jaw don't mean same blood.

192
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,694
I know a woman looks like a bullfrog,
but that don't mean she's its mother.

193
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,239
- You met my mum in a bar room.
- For God's sakes, child!

194
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,366
You think everybody gets met
in a bar room gets a baby?

195
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,659
It's possible.

196
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,496
Anything is possible,
but possible don't make it true.

197
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,749
Then I want my money!

198
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,042
Will you quiet down?

199
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,839
You know what the trouble is with you?
You got no appreciation.

200
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,340
All right.

201
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,343
Maybe I did get a little money from that man,
and you're entitled to that,

202
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,138
but I'm entitled to my share
for getting it for you, ain't I?

203
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,098
And where do you think
you'd be without me?

204
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,477
You think them folks would spend a penny
to send you east? No, sir.

205
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,688
But who got you a ticket to St. Jo?
Who got you a Nehi and a Coney Island?

206
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,440
And threw in $20 extra,

207
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,901
not to mention 85 cents
for that telegram.

208
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,361
You wouldn't have had
any of that without me.

209
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,864
Now, I didn't have to take you,
but I took you, didn't I?

210
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,408
All right, I think that's fair enough.

211
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,786
We're both a little better off.

212
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,622
You get to St. Jo,
I get myself a little better car.

213
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,791
Fair is fair.

214
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,170
Now, drink your Nehi,
and eat your Coney Island.

215
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,383
I want my $200.

216
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:06,639
I don't have your $200 no more,
and you know it.

217
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:11,769
If you don't give me my $200,
I'm going to tell a policeman how you got it,

218
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,355
and he'll make you give it to me,
'cause it's mine.

219
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,567
But I don't have it.

220
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,654
Then get it.

221
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,535
How we doing, Angel Pie?

222
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,538
We going to have a little dessert
when we finish up our hot dog?

223
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,248
I don't know.

224
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,541
What do you say, Daddy?

225
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,919
Why don't we get Precious
a little dessert if she eats her dog?

226
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,464
Her name ain't Precious.

227
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,803
I want my money back on this here ticket,
and I want you to send this here telegram.

228
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,848
Trip delayed, but I'm coming real soon!

229
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,214
You just lie down in the seat
and be quiet.

230
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,009
Folks don't take to children
when they're doing business.

231
00:14:59,652 --> 00:15:01,045
- Yes?
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

232
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,422
- Is Mr Rudolf Morgan at home, please?
- Mr Morgan?

233
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,717
Yes, ma'am. My name is Pray, Moses Pray,

234
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,552
Kansas Bible Company. He'll know.

235
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,639
Oh, I'm sorry. Mr Morgan has passed on.

236
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,183
Oh, ma'am, I'm... I just...

237
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,392
I don't know what to say.

238
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,353
Uh, what was it you
were seeing him about?

239
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,563
- Well, he ordered this here bible from...
- Bible?

240
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,106
Rudolph ordered a bible?

241
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,442
Yeah, he ordered this here deluxe edition
with the lady's name in the corner.

242
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,027
Lady's name?

243
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,696
Oh, I expect some special gift
for a family friend.

244
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,989
But under the circumstances,

245
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,241
I'll just give you back
Mr Morgan's dollar deposit,

246
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,285
and there won't be
no further obligation.

247
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,830
Ma'am, I just don't know how to put
into words the sense of sorrow that I feel.

248
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,833
What, what...
what name is in the corner?

249
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:44,213
I don't really know what name
Mr Morgan had put in the corner, ma'am.

250
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,422
Let's see, now.

251
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,841
It's here somewhere. I've got it. Uh...

252
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,134
Here it is.

253
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,844
- Pearl...
- Pearl.

254
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,262
I'm Pearl.

255
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,641
Well, he must have got
this here good book for you, ma'am.

256
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,018
Yes. Yes, he bought it for me.

257
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,270
Of course, now,
you're not obliged to take it.

258
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,897
Of course I'll take it.

259
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,732
There's just one thing. You see, I...

260
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,859
I told him that I could sell him
a cheaper bible,

261
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,822
but no, naturally he wanted the best,
the best, of course, being the deluxe edition

262
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,324
with the lady's name printed
in child-in-the-manger gold letters.

263
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,742
Oh, he would.

264
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,829
Bringing a balance due of, uh...
$8.00? $8.00.

265
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,372
$8.00?

266
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,417
Well, that's, uh, $8.00
minus the dollar deposit,

267
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,335
making it $7.00.

268
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,837
Um, I'll go get my purse.

269
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,840
- Well, you're not obliged to take it, now.
- Of course I'm obliged!

270
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,592
He ordered the deluxe!

271
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,264
'But cold or no cold, it's good
to be back in old Manhattan.

272
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,183
'Well, tell me, Jack, you've been
in town now since Thursday.

273
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,894
- 'What have you been doing with yourself?'
- 'Oh, I've had a lot of fun, Don.

274
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,439
'I saw some shows,
went to a couple of nightclubs,

275
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,276
'and last night, I was invited over
to Fred Allen's apartment for dinner.'

276
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,112
- 'Oh, Fred Allen, eh?'
- 'Yeah, he and I are pretty good friends now.'

277
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,365
'Well, I'm glad to hear it.
Has Fred got a nice apartment?'

278
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,159
'Oh, how could I tell, Don,

279
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,849
'with all that laundry
hanging in the living room?'

280
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,208
Ain't you gonna go to sleep?

281
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,794
Don't you want to hear Jack Benny?

282
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,755
No.

283
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,840
'I don't want to sound catty...'

284
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:46,126
You're too young to smoke.
You're going to set this whole place on fire.

285
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:15,072
I now owe you $103.72.

286
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,076
Seventy-four.

287
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:23,038
<i>I always knew</i>

288
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,249
<i>Someday I'd accompany you</i>

289
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:29,419
<i>Along Flirtation Walk</i>

290
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,672
<i>A dream foretold</i>

291
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,841
<i>A story that you would unfold</i>

292
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:39,221
<i>That lives forever and never grows old</i>

293
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,348
<i>I always felt</i>

294
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,642
<i>That your little heart would melt</i>

295
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,269
<i>Along Flirtation Walk...</i>

296
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,063
Frank D. Roosevelt said
we're all feeling a lot better.

297
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,857
He did, did he?

298
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,610
Made me feel good when he said that.
Better than I've felt in a long time.

299
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,155
Bet old Frank sure does wish he was 21.

300
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,577
You don't like me, do you?

301
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,581
No, I don't like you.

302
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,797
Yes?

303
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,717
Afternoon, ma'am. I was wondering
if Mr Bates might be at home.

304
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,845
Mr Bates is dead.
He died over a week ago.

305
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,430
Oh, you mean he passed over, ma'am?

306
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,057
Why, I was just talking to him
not less than a month ago.

307
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,809
- What was it you wanted?
- Well...

308
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,312
My name is Pray, Kansas Bible Company.

309
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,439
I'm just here to deliver this bible
that Mr Bates ordered.

310
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,690
Bible?

311
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,650
Who is it? What's the trouble?

312
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,154
Something about Benjamin buying a bible.

313
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,114
Bible? What kind of bible?

314
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,117
He said he talked to Benjamin,
less than a month ago.

315
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,870
Well, I'm... I'm not exactly sure
of the dates, ma'am.

316
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,830
Well, I don't see how.

317
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,459
Benjamin didn't go nowheres near that shop
for more than a month before he died.

318
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,253
Well, I may be a little
mixed up on the dates.

319
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,422
What company you say you're from?

320
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,799
The Kansas Bible Company,
out of Wichita.

321
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,509
Kansas Bible Company?

322
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,553
I ain't never heard of
no Kansas Bible Company.

323
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,888
Daddy...

324
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,808
Can't we go now? I want to get to church
and pray for Mama.

325
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,271
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure we can, honey.

326
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,023
Daddy was just fixin' to leave.

327
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,943
This here is my little girl.
It's just the two of us now.

328
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,987
- My Mama's gone to the Lord.
- Oh, so has poor Mr Bates, honey.

329
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,073
I'll just, uh, give you back
his dollar deposit,

330
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,533
and you let us know if
there's anything we can do.

331
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,411
Hold on, there. Wait one damn minute.

332
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,707
He actually done ordered a bible, huh?

333
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,877
Uh, he sure did. Here it is, right here
in gold for somebody named "Marie".

334
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,881
- That's her. She's Marie.
- Oh, she sure did mean a lot to him.

335
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,425
He especially had me get
the deluxe edition.

336
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,552
- How much to keep this here book?
- Oh, well, that one is the...

337
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,096
It's the $12 one, Daddy.

338
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,931
- $12?
- $12?

339
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,475
Uh, yeah, well, honey, we have
to have a little goodness in our hearts,

340
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,061
- I mean, considering the circumstances.
- Never mind the circumstances.

341
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,815
And if it'll make that woman happy,
I'll take it.

342
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:11,331
You owe me $85.74.

343
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,466
'I mean, we're going
to Washington on the QT.

344
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,739
'Molly, she says we can't go on the QT,
we've got to take the Pennsylvania.

345
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,931
'Hey, I'd better get going.

346
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,725
'Hey, Molly, where's my suitcase?
Do you know?'

347
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,935
'Uh, I'm sure I don't know, McGee.
You had it last night.'

348
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,354
'Oh, I know where it is.
It's right here in the hall...'

349
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,523
He's going to open the closet!

350
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,867
Now he's going to say how he's got to
straighten the closet out!

351
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,494
'Got to straighten out that
closet one of these days.'

352
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,456
How'd you like to do
a little business with me?

353
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,125
You mean instead of paying me back?

354
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,712
Now, don't get nervous. I'll pay you back.
I'm just saying, while we're heading east,

355
00:21:57,812 --> 00:22:00,005
how'd you like to do a little business
together, that's all?

356
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,135
Well, you're looking at me
like I'm out to cheat you or something.

357
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,512
I am offering you a business proposition.
Take it or leave it.

358
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:10,891
And turn off that radio! You're like
to drive us all deaf with that radio.

359
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,604
'...in an average way, of course.'

360
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,695
OK, I want you to remember one thing:

361
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,238
I decide on the price.

362
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,367
Maybe you don't know French, but there's
something in this world called "fine-esse".

363
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,452
$12! I never sold no bible for $12.

364
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,704
That man was a law officer.
You could've had me put me in jail.

365
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,623
We got it, didn't we?

366
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,293
I don't care if we got it.
Don't you go making the decisions.

367
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:42,464
I make the decisions. All you got
to do is look like a pretty little girl.

368
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,514
You ain't got something like a ribbon
in that cigar box, do you?

369
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:54,518
I got my mum's kimono in my suitcase,
Chinamen with umbrellas.

370
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,105
That ain't quite what I had in mind.

371
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,282
You look real nice in that ribbon.

372
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,701
First off, I didn't know
was she a boy or a girl?

373
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,161
I'm a girl.

374
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,831
Well, it makes all the difference.

375
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,875
Ain't she got a sweet
little face, somehow.

376
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,795
Well, seeing how I just got paid today,
we'll take a ribbon in each colour.

377
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,171
How much that going to set me back?

378
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,340
Well, that'll be 15 cents.

379
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:29,136
Bought my grandchildren
ribbons just like this last holiday time.

380
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,555
Grandchildren? I don't believe it.

381
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,474
- You break a five?
- Well, you can believe it, all right.

382
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,726
I'm just as old as I look.

383
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,937
Well, now, here you be.

384
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:43,316
That's one, two, three, four, five.

385
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,402
This old wallet of mine
is about to bust its sides.

386
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,988
I'll give you five ones back,
you give me that $5 bill.

387
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,656
How many grandchildren
you got altogether?

388
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,326
Well, I got two little granddaughters,
a nine-year-old, a ten-year-old,

389
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,996
two grandsons near 16,

390
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,874
and I got a grandson 35 years old.

391
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,792
Come on, you're pulling my leg.

392
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:04,504
Why don't you just give me a $10 bill?
Here's the $5, and five ones, there.

393
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,339
That way I won't be so quick
to see it break apart.

394
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:10,135
- Six children, huh? My, my, my...
- I've got a daughter, 51.

395
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,137
Oh, now, I don't mean
to be handing you no line,

396
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:16,070
but that's just pretty hard to believe
you got a 51-year-old child.

397
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,559
You can believe it, all right.

398
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,979
Well, I'm afraid I'd have to see it
to believe it. Much obliged.

399
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,483
- See you again.
- Y'all come back!

400
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:42,501
That just don't seem quite right...
somehow.

401
00:24:48,724 --> 00:24:51,343
- Yes?
- I'm looking for Mr Stanley, ma'am.

402
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,886
Mr Stanley's dead.

403
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,056
Oh, well, I'm looking for
Mr Warren M. Stanley, ma'am.

404
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,141
Warren's passed on, sir.

405
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,392
Oh, that's hard to believe.

406
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,728
I was just talking to Warren
not more than two weeks back.

407
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,563
He ordered this here bible from me.

408
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,941
Warren spent money on a bible?

409
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,401
Yes, ma'am, with the name Elvira
in the corner.

410
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,946
Why would Warren spend money on a bible?

411
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,948
He took fast to the idea, ma'am.

412
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,908
Only thing is, he left a balance due of,

413
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,952
well, let's see,
not counting the dollar deposit...

414
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,454
Daddy, this one's already paid for.

415
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,959
Mr Stanley paid for the whole thing,
don't you remember?

416
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,933
Afternoon, ma'am. Mr Huff at home?

417
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,769
Mr Huff passed away,
young man, a week ago.

418
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,814
Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I was just talking to
Mr Huff not more than a month ago.

419
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,190
What was it you wanted?

420
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,527
Oh, well, my name is Pray,
Kansas Bible Company.

421
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,113
Mr Huff ordered this bible
as a gift for someone named Edna.

422
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,115
Oh, that's my name.

423
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,472
You don't have to take it
if you don't want to.

424
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:58,929
I'll just give you back
Amos's dollar deposit and then...

425
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:01,371
Of course I want to keep it.

426
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,207
He bought me a bible.

427
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,501
Yes, ma'am. Now, I told Amos
I could sell him a cheaper one,

428
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,753
but no, naturally, he wanted the best,

429
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,131
the best, of course,
being the deluxe edition

430
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,466
with the name printed
in child-in-the-manger gold letters,

431
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,177
- bringing up a balance due of...
- ...of $24!

432
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,555
$24. I'll get my purse.

433
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,307
What's your name, honey?

434
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,435
- Addie.
- Addie. What a sweet little name.

435
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,686
Addie Pray, ma'am.

436
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:28,189
Well, Addie Pray,
I'm going to give you $24,

437
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,818
and an extra $5
for just coming to my door.

438
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,654
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.

439
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,585
<i>Keep your sunny side up, up</i>

440
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,713
<i>Hide the side that gets blue...</i>

441
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,813
- Moze, let's give him some money.
- No.

442
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:12,359
Just a little bit. We got $305.16.

443
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,319
Whole 'nother business giving it away.

444
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,863
- It's bad enough you give away bibles.
- But they're poorly.

445
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,740
The whole country's poorly,
I told you before.

446
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,034
But Frank D. Roosevelt says
we got to look out for one another.

447
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,577
I don't care about Frank D. Roosevelt.

448
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,204
- But he says it.
- That so?

449
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,123
Why don't you ask Frank D. Roosevelt
what he thinks about taking care of himself?

450
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,625
You think he don't eat off silver trays?

451
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,503
He could eat off table tops like the rest
of us, but he don't. You know why?

452
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,421
Because that would make him look common.

453
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,091
And besides, Frank D. Roosevelt
ain't running this thing - I'm running it!

454
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,343
So don't you make up no rules
about what we're going to give away.

455
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,845
It's my money too, you know.
$200 belong to me,

456
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,472
- and don't you forget that.
- You want it?

457
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,100
Well, just put my share in my pocket,
and I'll take you to a train station.

458
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,143
How do you like that?

459
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,314
Get the map.
Find out where the nearest depot is.

460
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,857
Nothing but trouble, anyway.

461
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,818
First you charge too much,
then you want to give it away.

462
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,153
- Where are we now?
- We just left Plainville.

463
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,239
$12 for a bible, then it's up to $24.

464
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,616
If I stay with you,
I'll spend the rest of my life in jail.

465
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,035
There's a depot in Lincoln.
You can take me to Lincoln.

466
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,245
You bet I will!

467
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,871
- Where's Lincoln?
- Clear over there.

468
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,915
Oh, boy, you think
I'm going to take you clear over there

469
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,208
just to get you to some depot?

470
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,168
Then keep going east.
We'll hit one in Sylvan Grove.

471
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,879
- Where's Sylvan Grove?
- Right here.

472
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,464
Well, that'll take us
down through Lucas.

473
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,383
We got to go through something
to get to Sylvan Grove.

474
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,760
I'm not complaining. I'm just saying
that'll take you through Lucas.

475
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,388
You got to go through Paradox and Waldo
and Lorraine and Lucas

476
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,848
if you want to get to Sylvan Grove.

477
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,058
Those are pretty good towns in there.
We could do some business in there.

478
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,352
Well, it won't matter much.
We're near out of bibles anyway.

479
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,105
What do you mean, we're out of bibles?
Why didn't you tell me we're out of bibles?

480
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,565
You look in the box too, don't you?

481
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,317
- Well, you've got an excuse for everything.
- 'Cause you blame me for everything.

482
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,778
If we were running out of bibles,
you should have told me.

483
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,114
- We're running out of bibles!
- Well, then we got to get new ones!

484
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,658
- Then let's get new ones!
- We can pick some up in Great Bend.

485
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:47,412
- Great Bend's the other way.
- Well, we gotta have bibles, don't we?

486
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,790
Let's see, now, we can veer down to Lucas,
and we'll veer over to Wilson.

487
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,917
Veer off to Lorraine and Bushton.

488
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,503
And we could veer off to Hoisington.

489
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,798
We'll just have to keep on veering,
that's all.

490
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,345
- I'm getting hungry. You getting hungry?
- Uh-huh.

491
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,165
<i>Just one more chance</i>

492
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:36,795
<i>To prove it's you alone I care for</i>

493
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:41,365
<i>Each night I say a little prayer for...</i>

494
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,469
You sweet thing.

495
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,179
Don't you tell me that. Ooh!

496
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,390
Sometimes I just don't know,
with all the old doodly-doo.

497
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,768
Doodly-doo, doodly-doo.

498
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,064
OK, now, you go on back, now.
I'll see you another time.

499
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,942
- Don't send me back.
- Oh, you got to go on back.

500
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,194
- I'll see you another time, I promise.
- I want to go in your place.

501
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,862
No, no.

502
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:08,451
You trying to keep secrets from me?
You got diamonds and rubies in there?

503
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,411
Go on, go on.

504
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,039
Oh, Fido... Night-night, old Fido.

505
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,124
- Woof-woof.
- Woof-woof.

506
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,421
Woof-woof.

507
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,883
<i>Still I'm holding on awhile</i>

508
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:29,389
<i>You'll give me just one more word</i>

509
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,589
There it is.

510
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,302
- Much obliged.
- Thank you, sir.

511
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,016
All right, boy, you're next.

512
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,852
I ain't a boy.

513
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,525
- Aw, don't let it bother you.
- It ain't funny.

514
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,610
No reason to get that sore.

515
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,905
- He called me a boy, didn't he?
- He just got mixed up, that's all.

516
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,949
He did not.
He looked me straight in the eye.

517
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:39,579
Yeah, well, I'm looking you straight
in the eye, and I think you're beautiful.

518
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,581
- Oh, you're just saying that.
- Would I make that up?

519
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,542
You're as beautiful as your mama, and she
put all the flowers in the world to shame.

520
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,670
You know, they wouldn't even let her come
to Holland for fear she'd droop the tulips,

521
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,630
and you got all the good looks
she ever had.

522
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,674
Then how come that man called me a boy?

523
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,676
I don't know, maybe it's...

524
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,928
Maybe it's 'cause of what you got on,
or something.

525
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,264
What's wrong with what I got on?

526
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,934
Oh, nothing wrong with it, just...
don't exactly make you look feminine.

527
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,063
Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea
we get you fixed up a little bit,

528
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,149
get you a new dress,
a fancy new hat, or something.

529
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,319
Come to think of it,
it wouldn't exactly hurt business, either.

530
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,654
You really think I'm
as pretty as my mama?

531
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,406
Of course I do.

532
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,493
- How much money we got in the box?
- $405.16.

533
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,827
Give me a $20.

534
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,371
- What for?
- Give me a $20!

535
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,126
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

536
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,961
We're going to get us
some fancy new outfits

537
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,630
with this money you got
from your Aunt Helen.

538
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,257
- I don't have no Aunt Helen.
- Oh, sure you do, honey.

539
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,468
Come on, let me explain it to you.

540
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,679
Yes, sir?

541
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,641
I'd like an Ipana toothpaste
and a pack of Sen-Sen.

542
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,477
- Uh, twenty and five.
- Twenty-five.

543
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,104
- Yes, sir.
- Here you go.

544
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,237
75 makes one,

545
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,114
four makes five, and 15 makes 20.

546
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,491
Thank you very much. I don't need a bag.

547
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,546
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Bye now.

548
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,422
Hello. How much is this?

549
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,091
That'll be 35 cents.

550
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,468
65 cents makes a dollar.
Thank you very much.

551
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,761
Thank you.

552
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,096
Yes?

553
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,974
May I have a bottle
of purple toilet water, please?

554
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,394
That'll be 25 cents.

555
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,321
There you go.

556
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,413
Lady, you made a mistake.

557
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,624
Huh? I give you $4.75.

558
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,626
But I gave you a $20 bill.

559
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,628
Uh-uh. You give me a $5.

560
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,922
No, ma'am, it was a $20 bill.

561
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:59,218
You give me a $5, and I give you $4.75.

562
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,514
It was a $20 bill.

563
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,061
Got no $20s in with no $5s.

564
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,105
What's all the turmoil?
What's going on here?

565
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,858
This little girl give me a $5 bill,
and I give her change.

566
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,235
I gave her a $20 bill - I know I did.

567
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,197
It was a birthday present
from my Aunt Helen in Wichita,

568
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,490
and she wrote "Happy Birthday, Addie"
on the end of it.

569
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,659
You just go look and see.

570
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,954
That's it right there!

571
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,416
That's my $20 bill I got
from my Aunt Helen in Wichita.

572
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,002
- Give the child her $20 bill.
- I'm giving it.

573
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,922
- Give the child her $20 bill, Miss Brownwell.
- Yes, sir.

574
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,174
- And give her a piece of candy.
- Yes, sir.

575
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,844
- And pay attention to things, Miss Brownwell.
- Yes, sir.

576
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,393
Come on in, get your cotton candy.

577
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,772
Sweetheart, Cotton Candy.

578
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,234
- Five cents.
- Do you have change for this five?

579
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,069
There you are, little girl.

580
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,904
Cotton candy, get your cotton candy.

581
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,240
Mister, this purse is sure full.

582
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,200
If you give me the five back,
I'll give you five ones.

583
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,161
Cotton candy,
get your cotton candy right here.

584
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,288
Mister, if you got a ten dollar bill

585
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,666
I'll give you the five back
with the five ones you have.

586
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,542
Would you give me a ten dollar bill?

587
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:18,005
There, now don't bother me anymore,
you understand?

588
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,382
Cotton candy!

589
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,051
Step up and get your cotton candy.

590
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,220
Come and get it.

591
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,111
Get your tickets.
Only one fourth of a dollar.

592
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,363
The show goes on in five minutes.

593
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,701
Six unusual little ladies
unveiling the secrets of passion.

594
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,536
Found only a few years back

595
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,622
in the actual Egyptian
tomb of Queen Nefereti.

596
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:55,918
And featuring the luscious
Miss Trixie Delight.

597
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,714
- I had my photo took, Moze.
- You did, huh? Ain't that fine.

598
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,549
Moze, can you come have
your photo took with me?

599
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,592
- Can't right now, sweetheart.
- Only take a minute.

600
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,178
- Not now, you hear me?
- But it's almost down here tonight.

601
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,014
- It wouldn't be here after...
- I can't help that.

602
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,391
- Now excuse me, you understand?
- How many times you going to see it?

603
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,476
As many times as I like,
that's how many times.

604
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,979
- You seen it half a dozen times.
- And I might see it a half dozen more.

605
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,647
Now why don't you go play bingo
or something?

606
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,065
I don't want to play bingo.

607
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,276
Well, then why don't you go write
another love note to St. Roosevelt?

608
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,485
Maybe I will.

609
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,696
And stop standing around here
checking on me. You don't have to worry.

610
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,490
I ain't about to leave some poor little child
stranded in the middle of nowhere.

611
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,201
I got scruples, too, you know.
You know what that is, "scruples"?

612
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,703
No, I don't know what it is,

613
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,664
but if you got them, I sure bet
they belong to somebody else.

614
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,502
And his name ain't Frank, it's Franklin.

615
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,727
Hey there, my little turtle-dee.
I wondered where you got to.

616
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,853
Where's your pa?

617
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,813
- Is my picture ready?
- Sure, it's...

618
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,148
Excuse me, folks, come right back.

619
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,317
Sit back in the moon there,
I'll be right with you.

620
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,651
Let's see.

621
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,153
Here it is, here.

622
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,949
Hey, now, I thought you were
gonna sit in the moon with your pa.

623
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,826
He ain't my pa.

624
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,996
Hi, folks. Get ready.

625
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,873
Smile. Hold it.

626
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,041
Hold it.

627
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,667
Beautiful.

628
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,228
I don't want you smoking
in the car tomorrow.

629
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,732
- What?
- I didn't say nothing. I'm just listening to you.

630
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,068
Well, there are going to be
a couple extra people riding with us,

631
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,903
and this particular person
don't like cigarette smoke.

632
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,488
- What extra person?
- What?

633
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,115
I said "what extra person"?

634
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,283
A lady and her maid.
I'm giving them a ride to Topeka.

635
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,701
I didn't know we was going to Topeka.

636
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,995
Well, that's because
you don't know everything.

637
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,789
What's the lady's name?

638
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,917
Miss Delight. Miss Trixie Delight.

639
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,045
She's a real lady.
She comes from a good family.

640
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,505
I'm just giving her a ride, that's all.

641
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,925
Well, that's what you're always talking
about, ain't it? Helping other people out.

642
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,236
Now don't you drop nothing, Imogene.

643
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,071
You take care of those breakables,
understand?

644
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,531
Yes, Miss Trixie.

645
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,076
Morning. Car is right over here.

646
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,002
You better ride in the backseat a while.

647
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,228
And then I danced in Tuscaloosa.

648
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,523
And the mayor was there,
and he just said the nicest things about me.

649
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,692
The newspaper ran
a whole big photo on me.

650
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:10,362
I got a scrap book telling stories on me
from towns all over.

651
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,592
Tell him 'bout the time that man

652
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:14,259
tried to crack your head open
with the bottle, Miss Trixie.

653
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:18,162
Why, Imogene, you silly old thing.
You know that's not true.

654
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,956
That old country boy wasn't going to hit me
over the head with no bottle.

655
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,416
He was just horsing around.

656
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,461
Ask me real nice, maybe I'll tell you
about that sometime.

657
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,923
Well, tell him about the time you almost got
thrown in jail, Miss Trixie.

658
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,852
I just don't understand it, Daddy,

659
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:45,272
but this little baby has to go
winky-tinky all the time.

660
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,900
Well, don't you worry none.
We'll just plan on stopping here for dinner.

661
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,694
But we just stopped for her
to winky-tink at lunch.

662
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:53,280
That's right, and now
we're stopping for dinner.

663
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,699
- Come on.
- I ain't hungry.

664
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,254
- Want one?
- OK.

665
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,594
- How old are you?
- I don't know, 15. Why?

666
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,555
Just asking, that's all.

667
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,431
- Where are you from?
- Nowhere.

668
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,767
Well, you got to be from somewhere.

669
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,352
Down by Troy, I guess.

670
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,938
How long have you worked for her?

671
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,523
Ain't kept count.

672
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,817
A year, maybe. How old you be?

673
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,569
Nine.

674
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,988
She really do all that dancing?

675
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,532
Well, if you want to call it "dancing".

676
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,244
All she do is wag her hips
and shake her old behind a little.

677
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,705
How come she'd leave
that job back there?

678
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,000
'Cause the boss man tried to make her
put out for his friends.

679
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,460
And she don't believe
in putting out for free.

680
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,878
She put out much?

681
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,630
Just like a gum machine.

682
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,258
You drop something in
and she'll put something out.

683
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,010
How much she charge?

684
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,886
Most she can get.

685
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,097
But she always asks for $5.00.

686
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,932
She ain't putting out
for your pa, though.

687
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,894
Says she's going to wait and get all she can
before she put out for him.

688
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,896
He tell her he was my pa?

689
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,898
Well, not exactly.

690
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,818
I heard him mumbling something
like he didn't want to talk about it.

691
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,154
- Ain't he?
- I'm with him, ain't I?

692
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,032
And how do you come to be with her?

693
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,701
'Cause she promised to give me
$4.00 every week.

694
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,661
She ain't gave me nothing.

695
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,788
'Cept a nickel or dime, sometimes.

696
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,082
- Why don't you quit?
- Quit?

697
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,043
How am I going to quit?

698
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,753
And what if I do quit?

699
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,921
Ain't got no money to get home to Mum.

700
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,381
And what if I do get home?

701
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,508
They got hard times as it is.

702
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,428
My mama say,
"You go work for a white lady,

703
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,764
"she'll take good care of you."

704
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,932
- You want to know what I think?
- Yeah.

705
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,018
You know the little white speck
on top of chicken doo-doo?

706
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,144
Yeah.

707
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,647
Well, that's the kind of white
I think Miss Trixie is.

708
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:53,609
She's just like that little white speck
on top of old chicken shit.

709
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,534
Oh, I just love it, love it, love it.
All this white.

710
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,955
It is absolutely the proper thing
for my particular kind of appearance.

711
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,208
You know, it wouldn't be bad
for you to have a new dress, too.

712
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,877
The right kind of dress makes
all the difference in the face.

713
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,089
Especially since you got
the right kind of bone structure.

714
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,799
Oh...

715
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,634
Oh, my, oh, my.

716
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:23,138
Daddy, but wouldn't you look handsome sitting
behind the wheel of a thing like that?

717
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,391
'Course, you know, everything
is in the bone structure.

718
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:29,103
You know, a person can tell his whole life
on what his bone structure is.

719
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,313
I tried pushing her out
a window once in Little Rock.

720
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,816
Oh...

721
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,235
Oh, I think there's bugs all over the...

722
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,821
I just hope there's
no snakes around here.

723
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,031
You know, I think we ought to go now.

724
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,701
Thank you so much.

725
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,661
Now hurry... oh.

726
00:44:47,497 --> 00:44:49,748
Come on, hurry up.
Get those things in there, now.

727
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,709
Don't break anything, either.

728
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:57,923
Let's go.

729
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,426
Hurry up, doctor,
this baby's got to go winky-tinky.

730
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,802
Don't worry.

731
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,221
Hey!

732
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,852
Come on, we're ready.

733
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,646
- Come on, now.
- I ain't ready.

734
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,357
Well, you don't look real busy with nothing,
so you just come on down.

735
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,984
I ain't coming.

736
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:20,070
- Now you listen here, child.
- No, I won't listen here.

737
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,405
What the heck's up with you, then?

738
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,490
I want to sit in front.

739
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,534
And how come we ain't working no more?

740
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,036
'Cause we're on vacation, that's why.

741
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:31,415
And Miss Delight and me are sitting in front
because we are two grown-ups,

742
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,667
and that's where grown-ups
do the sitting.

743
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,502
And little children
do not tell grown-ups

744
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,337
what to do with their lives,
you understand that?

745
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:41,383
Well, she ain't my grown-up, and I ain't
planning no more to sit in the back.

746
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,718
Not for no cow.

747
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,344
Will you keep your voice down?

748
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,889
And Miss Delight ain't no cow.
She's a proper woman.

749
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,432
She has a high school diploma,

750
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,769
and right now she's gotta go to the bathroom,
so you just get on down to the car.

751
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,812
She always has to go to the bathroom.

752
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,356
She must have a bladder
the size of a peanut.

753
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,610
Well, I ain't getting back in that car.
Not till she gets out of it.

754
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:36,647
Hey, what's up, kiddo?
Daddy says you're wearing a sad face.

755
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,315
Ain't good to have a sad face.

756
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,276
Hey, how would you like a colouring book?
Would you like that?

757
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,861
You like Mickey the Mouse?

758
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,780
Oh, son of a bitch!

759
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,783
Ooh... oh.

760
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,162
Now come on down to the car
and let's all be friends.

761
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,040
You see me smile? Come on,
let's see you smile like Aunt Trixie.

762
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,250
Now, come on!

763
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,710
Come on down to the car
with mademoiselle.

764
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,134
Kiddo, I understand how you feel.

765
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,136
Well, you don't have to worry.

766
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,056
One of these days, you're going to be
just as pretty as mademoiselle,

767
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,933
maybe prettier.

768
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,060
You already got bone structure.

769
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,563
When I was your age,
I didn't have no bone structure.

770
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,606
Took me years to get bone structure.

771
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,442
And don't think bone structure's
not important.

772
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,112
Nobody started to call me mademoiselle
till I was 17

773
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,614
and getting a little bone structure.

774
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,867
When I was your age,
I was skinnier than a pole.

775
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,035
I never thought
I'd have nothing up here.

776
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,538
You're going to have them up there, too.

777
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,917
Look, I'll tell you what.
Want me to show you how to use cosmetics?

778
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,964
Look, I'll let you put on my earrings.
You can see how pretty you're going to be.

779
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,092
And I'll show you how to
make up your eyes.

780
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,886
And your lips.

781
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,263
And I'll see to it you get
a little bra or something.

782
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,849
But right now you're gonna
pick your little ass up,

783
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,184
you're gonna drop it in the backseat
and you're gonna cut out the crap,

784
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,769
you understand?

785
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,117
You're going to ruin it, ain't you?

786
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,495
Look, I don't want to wipe you out,

787
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,248
and I don't want you
wiping me out, you know?

788
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,459
So, I'm going to level with you, OK?

789
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,087
Now, you see, with me,
it's just a matter of time.

790
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:28,926
I don't know why, but somehow
I just don't manage to hold on real long.

791
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,846
So, if you wait it out a little,
it'll be over, you know?

792
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,266
I mean, even if I want a fella,

793
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:39,478
somehow or other
I manage to get it screwed up.

794
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:44,816
Maybe I'll get a new pair of shoes,
nice dress, a few laughs.

795
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,611
Times are hard.

796
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,531
Now, if you fool around
on the hill up here,

797
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,158
then you don't get nothing,

798
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,618
I don't get nothing,

799
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,328
he don't get nothing.

800
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,374
So how 'bout it, honey?

801
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,542
Just for a little while,

802
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,837
let old Trixie sit up front
with her big tits.

803
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,433
Hey, come on.

804
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,270
We're coming, baby doll.

805
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,107
And if you don't find me
some old gas station soon,

806
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,235
this little old snowflake's
going to wet her pantaloons.

807
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,656
Oh, my, I almost fell down.

808
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,208
Yoo-hoo! Look what we got!

809
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,252
Ain't she the sweetest little thing,

810
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,671
and don't he look
like a prince on that wheel?

811
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,965
Now, come on, Imogene.
Now, get everything in here.

812
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,092
We got more room than
the whole state of Kansas.

813
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,288
And listen to the horn.
Blow the horn, Daddy.

814
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,432
Oh, go ahead.

815
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,209
Do it again.

816
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,106
Sticks his tongue into the water,

817
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,525
and there's an alligator in the river...

818
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,530
Very funny.

819
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,868
This girl's sitting on the trolley,
and she reaches in her bag,

820
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,120
and she takes out this magazine,
and she starts to read it.

821
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,830
Well, she ain't read more than
a couple of pages.

822
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:25,083
And real slow and careful now,
she takes her stockings down

823
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,294
and takes off her shoes.

824
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,088
Now, she turns the stockings wrong side out,
and she puts them back on.

825
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,423
She puts her shoes back on.

826
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,051
Well, all the passengers are watching.
They wonder what's going on.

827
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,179
This old guy, he leans over to her,
and he asks her, he says, "What's...?

828
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:40,265
"I saw you indulge in a strange procedure,
ma'am. What were you doing?"

829
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,768
And she said, "Well, I was reading
this here magazine, you know?

830
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,062
"And I found it to be
such hot stuff that I...

831
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,725
"Well, I felt compelled
to turn the hose on myself."

832
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,403
Oh, turn the hose on!

833
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,614
When you said that, I...

834
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,043
They wouldn't have a room
with a canopy bed, would they?

835
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,463
You wouldn't have a room
with a canopy bed, would you?

836
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,424
Uh, no. But I got one with a fireplace.

837
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,384
Oh, I'd like that one, Daddy.

838
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,179
It ain't no canopy bed,

839
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:22,974
but it sure do open up
a whole new can of peas, don't it?

840
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,143
Can of peas.

841
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,687
- Ain't that cute?
- Huh? How's that?

842
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,899
Come on, Imogene.
Now, help the boy with these things.

843
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,152
Give them 234, 235, and 236.

844
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,623
They're working
on the elevator right now,

845
00:51:36,723 --> 00:51:38,704
and it's the first flight up,
if you don't mind.

846
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,867
- It's all right. Thank you.
- Thank you.

847
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:43,620
- "Can of peas". Did you hear that?
- Yeah, what was that all about?

848
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,163
Well, you know,

849
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,083
Canopy... can of pea...
They rhyme, you know?

850
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,669
- Oh, I see! Can of peas, canopy!
- Yeah.

851
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,045
I get it now.

852
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,758
I knew you'd get it
if I explained it to you.

853
00:51:56,863 --> 00:52:01,012
<i>Picture Henry Ford without a car</i>

854
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:05,016
<i>Picture heaven's firmament
without a star</i>

855
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:09,187
<i>Picture Grigsby Chrysler
without a fiddle</i>

856
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:13,191
<i>Picture poor Philadelphia
without a Biddle</i>

857
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:17,279
<i>Picture Central Park without a sailor</i>

858
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:21,366
<i>Picture Mr Lord minus his detailer</i>

859
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,703
<i>Mix 'em all together,
and what have you got?</i>

860
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,664
<i>Just a picture of me without you</i>

861
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,110
Now there's a rip in the seam
of that dress, Imogene.

862
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,737
You get it sewed up good, you hear?

863
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,239
- And wash these hose.
- Yes, Miss Trixie.

864
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,617
- Got my bath ready?
- Yes, Miss Trixie.

865
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,910
Hope the water's not too hot.

866
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,953
You've been making that water
awful hot lately, Imogene.

867
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,955
I knows you like it hot, Miss Trixie.

868
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,665
Well, not that hot.

869
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:14,002
Now, you go on, finish up all these things
and come back in an hour and dry me off.

870
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,962
Yes, Miss Trixie.

871
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,720
What you doing up there?

872
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:26,223
I got us an idea. Come on.

873
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:29,392
- What kind of idea?
- Come on in here, and I'll tell you.

874
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:31,186
Go on.

875
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,607
Imogene, what do you suppose
Miss Trixie would do

876
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,193
if somebody offered her $25 to put out?

877
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,694
Oh-wee, you crazy.

878
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:42,072
For that much money,
that woman would drop her pants down

879
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,157
- in the middle of the road.
- That's what I figured.

880
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,367
What you got in mind?

881
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,869
You want to get away
from Miss Trixie, don't you?

882
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,872
Well, if you help me, I'll give you
enough money to get home to your mama.

883
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,458
- How much money?
- $30.

884
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,877
- When do we start?
- Tomorrow morning.

885
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,341
Miss Trixie,

886
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:04,636
you know that man down at the desk
who checked us in yesterday?

887
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,346
Yeah, I know him. What about him?

888
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:10,058
Well, he tell me, he'd pay $25
just to have a good time with you.

889
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,309
What?

890
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,853
Well, that little two-bit bum
nerve of that guy.

891
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,773
$25. I bet that little John
don't make that much in a week.

892
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,191
Where would he get 25 bucks?

893
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:21,278
I don't know.
All I know is what he told me.

894
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,989
25 bucks, huh?

895
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,782
Sure have to see the money
to believe it.

896
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,171
Here you go. You come back
and see us again real soon.

897
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,344
I'll have a Juicy Fruit gum, please.

898
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,139
Here you go, my little beauty.
Want I should chew it for you?

899
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,266
Say, you know that redheaded lady

900
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,643
that comes down here
named Miss Trixie Delight?

901
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,603
Well, she thinks you're real cute.

902
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,564
Oh, yeah? Says you and who else?

903
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,442
No, honest. She says you're better looking
than Dick Powell.

904
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,111
She did, eh?
Well, the lady's got good taste, don't she?

905
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,947
- Well, just thought you'd like to know.
- Hey, just a minute.

906
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:11,953
Give these here to the lady, and tell her
they're with Floyd's compliments.

907
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,790
Oh. She'll like that.

908
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,584
Maybe you should write her a note.

909
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,086
- Yeah. What kind of a note?
- Oh, I don't know.

910
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:23,506
I thought men always wrote ladies notes
when they send them presents.

911
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,425
Maybe you should ask her for a date.

912
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,093
That will sure tickle her.

913
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,928
Yeah. Maybe I ought to.

914
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:32,140
Say, she's not married up
or anything like that, is she?

915
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:36,728
Of course not. She don't even have
a regular boyfriend.

916
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,689
That man who come in here
yesterday with her is my daddy.

917
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,858
He's her manager. She's a dancer.

918
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,276
A dancer?

919
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,653
You know, I figured
she was something like that.

920
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:46,780
Whereabouts she dance?

921
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,282
Oh, lots of big places. She's a star.

922
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,867
Well, how about that!

923
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,536
Why don't you print it?
She like men who prints.

924
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,705
Print it, huh?

925
00:55:57,145 --> 00:56:00,293
"Some sweets for the sweet. Ha, ha.

926
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,254
"Some girls say I'm a pretty
smooth dancer myself.

927
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,257
- "How about trying me out sometime?"
- You sure this is going to work?

928
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,260
I don't know, but we're sure
going to give it a try.

929
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,606
Throw this in the drawer, will you?

930
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,984
And keep your fingers crossed.

931
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,410
- Who is it?
- It's me, Addie.

932
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,245
Oh. What do you want?

933
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,996
I got a message from Moze.

934
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,666
He asked me to tell you he had
to run over to Hainesville today.

935
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,835
He won't be back until suppertime.

936
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,672
I think he had to get something
fixed on his car.

937
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:48,591
- He'll be gone all day.
- Oh.

938
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,802
Well... OK.

939
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,560
OK!

940
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,240
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

941
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,701
- What you having?
- Waffles.

942
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,703
I already ate. I had waffles, too.

943
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,955
They sure are good, ain't they?

944
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,082
They ain't bad for waffles.

945
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:25,128
Mr Moze, Miss Trixie don't feel so good.

946
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,046
She say she's going
to stay in bed today.

947
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,090
She say she'll see you
around suppertime.

948
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,176
She sick? Sick in bed?
I... I better go up there.

949
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,928
Oh, she ain't real sick.
Ain't nothing to worry about.

950
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,680
She's just having her lady's time.

951
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,017
Oh.

952
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,852
Well, you tell her
I'll see her this evening.

953
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:47,775
Well, just wanted to say good morning.

954
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,320
I think I'll go upstairs
and polish my shoes.

955
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:36,533
- Somebody at the door, Imogene.
- Yes, Miss Trixie.

956
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,834
It's something for you, Miss Trixie.

957
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,546
- Oh, what is it?
- It was outside the door.

958
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,464
What is that?

959
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,094
Imogene, let all that go now.

960
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,429
You can run along.
I'll call you when I need you.

961
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,557
Yes, Miss Trixie.

962
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,359
Well, hello, cupid.

963
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:15,196
Miss Trixie wants to see you.
She says it's real important. Room 235.

964
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,574
Oh, she does, does she? When?

965
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,159
- Right now.
- Well, I can't get off right now.

966
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,953
But she says it's real important.

967
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:25,832
Well, you tell her I'll come up later
tonight... when the moon is full.

968
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,458
But you can't come tonight.

969
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,836
She won't even be here after tonight.

970
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,714
Matter of fact,
she won't even be here after today.

971
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,258
She won't, huh? Well...

972
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,844
You won't be sorry.

973
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:41,514
I guess I could go up for a few minutes.

974
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,849
What's that room number again?

975
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,852
Room 235. She's waiting for ya.

976
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:49,272
OK. You tell her
I'm on my way up, sweetheart.

977
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,822
He's coming! He's coming!

978
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:13,338
- Who is it?
- Sheik of Araby.

979
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:18,009
Well, then, don't you look pretty?

980
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,927
Well, come on in, honey.

981
01:00:23,895 --> 01:00:25,892
Come on.

982
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:30,146
...you don't give a girl much time.

983
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,981
Oh, I manage to get around.

984
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:34,692
Say, you're not one of these fellows
goes around babbling, are you, honey?

985
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:35,818
What do you mean?

986
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,528
Well, you know,
now most of the time I don't mind,

987
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,947
but it's important to me right now
not to get talked about.

988
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,533
Hey, now do I look like
that kind of fellow?

989
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,620
Say... oh, say you are a wild one,
aren't you?

990
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,623
Hold it, hold it! Now, wait a minute,
you're going to tear it!

991
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:50,875
Now, now, just let me slip it off.

992
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,168
Hey, there.

993
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:54,420
Well, now, ain't you a show dog?

994
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,506
Ooh... ooh!

995
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,424
I'm going.

996
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,346
The key... Give me the key!

997
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:06,683
Mr Moze's going to kill that man. He's
going to kill them both, I just knows it.

998
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,730
- Wait for me here.
- OK.

999
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,587
- Moze!
- What's the trouble?

1000
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,799
Better go up to Trixie's room
right away.

1001
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,092
Why? What? She sick?

1002
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,802
No, she's not sick.
Just do what I tell you.

1003
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:45,138
And take the elevator.

1004
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,515
Don't knock. Use the key.

1005
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,785
Your daddy going
to kill that man, I reckon.

1006
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,996
I expect he cut him up pretty bad.

1007
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,873
Moze wouldn't do a thing like that.

1008
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,500
Well, down home,
when a man come in from work,

1009
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:17,378
and hear a man inside house
in bed with his wife,

1010
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:19,547
he just walk around to the woodpile

1011
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:23,926
and get his double-blade axe, and go inside,
chop 'em both up to little pieces.

1012
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:27,138
Folks say he cut 'em up
just like kindling wood.

1013
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,111
Get your things, Addie. We're leaving.

1014
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:44,363
- Now?
- Right this minute.

1015
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,427
I swan, I don't know why that girl
did such a thing to me.

1016
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,430
I'd have done almost anything
for that girl.

1017
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,474
Just ain't fair.

1018
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:18,314
I reckon she's been...
carrying on a long time.

1019
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:20,775
- From the start.
- You mean, there were other men?

1020
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,151
Lots of 'em.

1021
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,237
Well, dadblammit,
why didn't you tell me?

1022
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,781
I just knew you wouldn't believe me.

1023
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:31,077
- I want you to promise me just one thing.
- What, Moze?

1024
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,289
When you grow up,
don't you be the kind of woman

1025
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,667
who goes around deceiving men.

1026
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,670
- Promise me that.
- I promise, Moze.

1027
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:03,860
<i>Oh, my love, let's take a walk</i>

1028
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:08,906
<i>Just a little ways away</i>

1029
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:14,829
<i>While we walk along, we'll talk</i>

1030
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:19,876
<i>Talk about our wedding day</i>

1031
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:25,631
<i>Only say that you'll be mine</i>

1032
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:30,887
<i>And in our home, we'll happy be</i>

1033
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:36,058
<i>Down beside where the waters flow</i>

1034
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:39,353
<i>Down on the banks...</i>

1035
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,856
- Moze?
- Hmm?

1036
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,316
Moze, pay attention.

1037
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,610
- What's the trouble?
- I seen something peculiar.

1038
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,820
- What's that?
- That man in there.

1039
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,490
- What man?
- Standing by the door.

1040
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,075
What's peculiar about him?

1041
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,953
He's got a roll of money
could choke us both to death.

1042
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,165
Well, I'm not up to anything right now.

1043
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,376
But he's got a black book for making
notes in, and all that money,

1044
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:05,504
and he keeps going outside
and then coming back in again.

1045
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,798
- Bootlegger.
- Bootlegger?

1046
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,300
No question about it.

1047
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,302
You think we might do
some business with him?

1048
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,929
Maybe drop a wad or something?

1049
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:15,556
We ain't done nothing in two months,
ever since Trixie.

1050
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:17,808
And we only have $212 left.

1051
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,769
Better ways of doing
business with bootleggers.

1052
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,020
What ways?

1053
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,813
Oh, heaps of ways.

1054
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,982
Look, he's going out again!

1055
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:27,693
Follow him.

1056
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:29,570
- Should I, Moze?
- I told you, didn't I?

1057
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,489
Follow him. Find out where he goes.

1058
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:35,201
<i>Thinking,
"Lord, what a deed I have done!"</i>

1059
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:39,664
<i>Killed the girl I loved, you see</i>

1060
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:45,753
<i>'Cause she would not marry me</i>

1061
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:51,884
<i>Only say that you'll be mine</i>

1062
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:56,430
<i>And in our home, we'll happy be</i>

1063
01:05:57,411 --> 01:06:02,144
<i>Down beside where the waters flow</i>

1064
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:07,441
<i>Down on the banks of the Ohio</i>

1065
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:56,115
Thank you.

1066
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:05,499
<i>Big brown eyes and curly hair...</i>

1067
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:06,792
What'd you find out?

1068
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:09,462
He's got a lot of bottles
he keeps in some kind of bin out back.

1069
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,922
- How big's the bin?
- About as big as our car trunk, maybe.

1070
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,341
- What you plan to do?
- Find out where he keeps his goods.

1071
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:17,053
Well, there was a little shack
out there, too, but he didn't go in it.

1072
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,434
Well, honey... how about a little walk
before Daddy puts you in the bed?

1073
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,580
Oh, goody.

1074
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:30,816
Our friend's name is Jess Hardin.
He's a bootlegger, all right.

1075
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,902
Wholesales pretty near
everybody in the county.

1076
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:36,655
His brother's some sort of a big shot, too,
but the girl couldn't tell me about him.

1077
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,366
Some Romeo walked up, and I had to beat it.
Now, where is it?

1078
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,869
- Right over there.
- OK, come on.

1079
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:49,418
OK, now, you watch the hotel.

1080
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:51,796
You see anybody coming, you cough real low.
I'm going inside.

1081
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,589
- It may be locked.
- Shucks, honey.

1082
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:56,759
Folks in the country never lock anything.
Don't you know that?

1083
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:28,541
<i>Come sit by my side, little darling</i>

1084
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:35,589
<i>Come lay your cool hand on my brow</i>

1085
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:42,805
<i>Promise me that you will never</i>

1086
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:46,350
<i>- Be nobody's darlin' but mine</i>
- Your name Hardin?

1087
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,769
That's right.

1088
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,312
Conrad's the name.

1089
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:53,065
Jack said I ought to look you up.

1090
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:54,775
Jack who?

1091
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,653
Oh, just Jack's good enough, I reckon.

1092
01:08:57,758 --> 01:08:59,155
Don't know no Jack.

1093
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,781
Well, maybe you ought to get acquainted.

1094
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:03,200
He's running the biggest
wholesale business in the state.

1095
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,161
- You selling?
- That's right.

1096
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:07,079
Ain't interested in no shiney.

1097
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:10,124
I ain't selling no shiney,
I only deal in bonded goods.

1098
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:11,876
- What kind?
- All kinds.

1099
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,295
I can let you have a pretty good deal
on some Three Feathers.

1100
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,671
How much?

1101
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:19,842
Well, it depends. You take 20 cases,
I'll let 'em go for $25 per.

1102
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,385
- That's too much.
- Ain't too much.

1103
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,054
You can't get it that cheap
where they sell it legal.

1104
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,764
Ain't legal here.

1105
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,892
That's all the more reason
you're getting a bargain.

1106
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,560
Give you just $20.

1107
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,146
Can't do it.
Price is set down in Wichita.

1108
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,524
How long before delivery?

1109
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,569
Oh... how's early in the morning?

1110
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,197
You got it in the county?

1111
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:43,616
That's right.

1112
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:50,456
<i>My mother is dead and in heaven...</i>

1113
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,499
Where do I pick it up?

1114
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:53,834
<i>My daddy...</i>

1115
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,589
- That'll do it.
- Did you leave some?

1116
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,591
Plenty. He'll never miss it.

1117
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:04,303
Moze?

1118
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:06,639
Moze, we better get.

1119
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,766
- Here.
- It's all filled up, I told you.

1120
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,476
Them's for me.

1121
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:13,145
Get going!

1122
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,277
Hurry.

1123
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,072
Get up there!

1124
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:25,658
Now hold on.

1125
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,660
And make sure nothing spills off.

1126
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,161
Well, you'd better go slow.

1127
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:30,829
And hurry.

1128
01:10:34,429 --> 01:10:37,878
- Easy!
- Well, I got to turn corners, don't I?

1129
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,260
Moze, ain't he going to miss his whisky?

1130
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:45,678
Oh, maybe in about a week,

1131
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,846
but by the time he's figured it out,
we'll be in Missouri

1132
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:50,599
and he can't do nothing
once we're in Missouri.

1133
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,272
Come on.

1134
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:16,292
Where is it?

1135
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:41,942
Scoot over!

1136
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:46,447
- How much you get?
- $625.

1137
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:50,316
$625, and he bought his own whisky!

1138
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:14,433
That's $625 plus the $212
we already got.

1139
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:17,186
And if we drop some wallets
and do some 20s, we'll...

1140
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:19,605
- What's that?
- Where?

1141
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,939
Behind us.

1142
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,400
I don't see nothin'.

1143
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,653
- There's something back there.
- Nothin' but pitch black.

1144
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:29,365
- I thought I seen something flicker.
- Nothin' there.

1145
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:33,786
- You put the money in the box?
- Uh-huh.

1146
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,455
I'll be glad to get out of this town,
I'll tell you that.

1147
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:41,085
There it is again.

1148
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,628
Dadblammit!

1149
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:44,713
Somethin' flickered, sure as hell.

1150
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,840
Nothin' behind us, Moze.

1151
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,762
- Uh-oh.
- I told ya!

1152
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:57,184
- Who could it be?
- Christ!

1153
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:07,277
- Don't stop, keep going!
- I can't keep going.

1154
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:09,279
The damn car's in front of me.

1155
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,990
Everything's going to be all right.
You just let me do the talking.

1156
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:23,127
- You playin' games with us, Mister?
- Oh, I... I didn't know who was back there.

1157
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:26,213
It's a risky thing to do.
Might get your tyres shot off.

1158
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:27,548
Where you headin'?

1159
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:30,175
Me and my little girl
are going to Saint Jo.

1160
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,010
- Oh. Live there?
- Nearby.

1161
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:36,473
- What's your business?
- Uh...

1162
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:39,017
Livestock, mostly...
mules and horses. Some cattle.

1163
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,938
That's funny.
I heard you was a bootlegger.

1164
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:45,649
Oh, no, sir, not me, friend.
Must be some mistake.

1165
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:49,319
Maybe... Maybe not.

1166
01:13:57,015 --> 01:13:59,121
The way I hear it...

1167
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:02,541
you just had a transaction
by the old barn.

1168
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:04,460
Where'd you hear a thing like that?

1169
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,295
Oh, a... friend of the family.

1170
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:08,797
No, I'm sorry, I...

1171
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:11,508
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm talkin' about bootleggin'.

1172
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:14,428
I'm talkin' about $625.

1173
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,013
Now, just where might that be?

1174
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,266
I don't have no $625.
I... I don't know what you're talking about.

1175
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:21,310
I don't even know where the old barn is.

1176
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,188
Well...

1177
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:28,775
I reckon we'll just have to explain
a little more thoroughly, won't we?

1178
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,320
Come on, Beau, you take a ride
with these nice people.

1179
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,822
- Love to.
- We're all goin' back to town.

1180
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,379
Damn.

1181
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,424
Just when you think you got it made...

1182
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:55,260
just ain't made, is it?

1183
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,765
- You pretty good at this little thing?
- Not too good.

1184
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:02,184
Not too good, huh?

1185
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,895
Old bootlegger's sittin' there
with his own little game,

1186
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,523
and he ain't even good at his own game.

1187
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:12,444
Yes, sir, that is some good joke.

1188
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:18,575
I found these on the front seat.

1189
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,995
Wasn't any money in the car.
Went all through it, inside and out.

1190
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:24,623
Livestock business, huh?

1191
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,292
That whisky's for a friend.

1192
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,087
Hold out your hands.

1193
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:33,173
- Huh?
- I said, hold out your hands. You heard me.

1194
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:45,602
I didn't say put 'em down, did I?

1195
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:49,565
Mighty clean hands for livestock.

1196
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,483
Them hands don't look like
they do nothin' much

1197
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:53,735
except play a little casino
every now and then.

1198
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,737
I told you, that whisky's for a friend.
I didn't see no harm...

1199
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:57,114
Didn't see no harm?

1200
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:01,577
Hear that, Beau? Big bootlegger claims
he don't know the law.

1201
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:05,831
Well, Mr Bootlegger, I don't need no
couple of bottles to make a case against you.

1202
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:09,126
Law says all I need
is just one little ol' drop.

1203
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:13,422
And... law says you use a vehicle
to transport alcoholic beverages,

1204
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:17,801
and said vehicle is confiscated
to be sold at public auctions, so...

1205
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,679
you can just kiss that pretty
little ol' car of yours goodbye.

1206
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:22,556
Hey, hold on! That seems
pretty rough just because...

1207
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:25,225
Don't lower your hands.
I didn't tell you to lower your hands.

1208
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,269
I tell you to lower your hands,
then you lower your hands.

1209
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:29,980
You don't do nothin' till I tell you to.
Understand?

1210
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,565
Answer me. You understand?

1211
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:34,735
Yes, sir.

1212
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:41,908
Ah, I already done that.

1213
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:45,495
Ain't nothin' in his clothes 'cept him.
He ain't worth five cents.

1214
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,582
No, she ain't got
nothin' on her, either.

1215
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,044
You don't know what kind
of real bad trouble you're in.

1216
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,920
You better start thinking on it.

1217
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:57,424
I've got a case against you
for possession and transportin' whisky,

1218
01:16:57,529 --> 01:17:00,469
and I reckon if I try,
I can think of a few other things.

1219
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:05,140
Better face it, you're going to be
up in these parts for quite a while,

1220
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:07,225
working on the county roads.

1221
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:09,603
Maybe you're lucky,
you get out in six months.

1222
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:13,649
Six more months, influencing a child -
maybe get six years for that.

1223
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,651
Maybe we could work something out.

1224
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,278
What's there to work out?

1225
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:21,031
'...while I rustle one up,

1226
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:22,824
'you all listen to this little goodie

1227
01:17:22,929 --> 01:17:24,284
'from a couple of years ago...'

1228
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:30,624
Ah, I sure don't like to send a man
to a road gang. Never have.

1229
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:33,293
Always felt sorry for them poor devils.

1230
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:37,381
But I can't overlook the fact
that you've been paid $625,

1231
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,133
and you ain't tellin' me where it is.

1232
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:43,011
Now, I know you're a bootlegger,
so what's there for me to work out?

1233
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:48,475
All right. Let's cut this
ring-around-the-rosy.

1234
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,520
Where's that... money?

1235
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,498
You think I'm foolin' around?

1236
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,376
I ain't foolin' around.

1237
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:24,803
Maybe you'll come around in time.

1238
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:27,514
Get a little thirsty
and get a little hungry.

1239
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:30,350
Time sure does have a way
with criminals, don't it, Beau?

1240
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:31,893
Sure do.

1241
01:18:31,998 --> 01:18:33,353
Well, it's gettin' on to 5:00.

1242
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,230
Somebody ought to be
stirring over at the café.

1243
01:18:35,335 --> 01:18:37,274
I think I'll step over there a while.

1244
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,735
See if that friend
of the family's there.

1245
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,445
I'll be on back 'fore long.

1246
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,239
I got all day, you know?
I got all the time in the world.

1247
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,285
<i>Trouble's just a bubble</i>

1248
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,871
<i>And the clouds will soon roll by</i>

1249
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:53,498
<i>So let's have another cup of coffee</i>

1250
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:55,667
<i>And let's have another piece of pie</i>

1251
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:58,044
<i>Let a smile be your umbrella</i>

1252
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,505
<i>For it's just an April shower</i>

1253
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:03,091
<i>Even John D. Rockefeller...</i>

1254
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:06,470
Sir, may I get my things, please?

1255
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:07,846
<i>Mr Herbert Hoover...</i>

1256
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:09,306
OK.

1257
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:12,768
<i>So let's have another cup of coffee</i>

1258
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:15,479
<i>And let's have another piece of pie</i>

1259
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:55,435
Daddy...

1260
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,813
I need to go to the shithouse.

1261
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:04,820
Well, uh, there's a place down the hall.

1262
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,280
Daddy, I'm scared.

1263
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:09,366
I want you to come stand by the door.

1264
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:11,660
All right if I go with her?

1265
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:24,005
Down there.

1266
01:20:32,452 --> 01:20:35,016
- Run!
- You crazy?

1267
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:36,184
Hey!

1268
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:38,937
Where are we running? Oh, my God.

1269
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:42,190
Stop them people!
Hey, there's bootleggers!

1270
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:45,861
Jesus Christ, this is the craziest...

1271
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,113
- Hurry!
- I'm hurrying!

1272
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,167
- Stop!
- Oh, Jesus!

1273
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,841
- I'm going to hit him!
- Make him jump! Don't slow down!

1274
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:12,262
I could have killed him!
They're going to have me up for murder!

1275
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,558
- They're shooting at us!
- But they're missin'! Keep going!

1276
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:27,319
- We ain't gonna make it.
- Yes, we will.

1277
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:30,488
Not in this car, we ain't. Every lawman in
Kansas is going to be looking for this car.

1278
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,616
We got to get across the river
to Missouri.

1279
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:34,034
Where's the bridge?

1280
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,202
- Oh, Jesus!
- What's the matter?

1281
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,204
- Damn bridge is the other way!
- What?

1282
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,331
Hang on.

1283
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:07,233
Ah, this ain't no good.
We're gonna make it too easy for 'em.

1284
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,569
We got to get off this road. Hang on!

1285
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:16,952
Holy smoke!

1286
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,120
Blow your horn!

1287
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:22,040
Won't do no good.
He can't pull off the road.

1288
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:24,918
Ain't we got all the luck,
selling whisky to a sheriff's brother?

1289
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:32,509
Hang onto your hat.

1290
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:34,010
- What?
- Hold on, I said.

1291
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:35,345
Oh, God!

1292
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,525
- You all right?
- Uh-huh.

1293
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:51,861
OK, we threw a hobble on 'em for a while,
but we got to get off this road,

1294
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,571
or we're going to end up
in a town for sure.

1295
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:56,574
And take that money out of there.
You like to give me heart failure.

1296
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,160
We made it, didn't we?

1297
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,758
Anybody 't home?

1298
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:04,684
Howdy.

1299
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:06,811
Need to get rid of my car here.

1300
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:12,150
I need to get rid of my car!

1301
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:15,111
Sheriff wants to take away my little girl,
put her in an orphanage.

1302
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,699
You know anybody who might want to swap?

1303
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:24,412
How about that truck over there?

1304
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:34,506
Well, we'll just let him
chew on it a while.

1305
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,638
Well, the rear tyres look new, anyway.

1306
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,614
- The radio looks OK.
- Think this thing runs?

1307
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:01,491
It better. We got to have
some way of travelling.

1308
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:03,993
- Where we going to go?
- Out of Kansas, across the river to Saint Jo.

1309
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,829
That's where.

1310
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:09,249
Here he comes.

1311
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,133
Look at 'em all.

1312
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:36,901
All I'm looking for is a swap
and three days' head start

1313
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:38,319
before you take it out on the highway.

1314
01:25:42,545 --> 01:25:44,506
It's all legal.
Got the papers right here to prove it.

1315
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:46,870
Just have to fill out that form
on the back, and you own it.

1316
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,376
Ain't gonna swap.

1317
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:55,795
Well, it's brand-new.

1318
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:58,298
That car ain't no good.

1319
01:25:58,403 --> 01:25:59,674
What's the matter with it?

1320
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,385
Can't haul nothing in it.

1321
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:04,637
Oh, well, if that's all
that's bothering you,

1322
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:06,931
you can sell the car and get two trucks
to do your hauling in.

1323
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:09,767
I ain't gonna swap.

1324
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,144
Wrassle you for it.

1325
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,355
- Are you crazy?
- If I win, we swap.

1326
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:16,065
You win, you can keep the car
and the truck both.

1327
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,275
- Moze...
- Quiet down.

1328
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,736
- What kind of wrassling?
- You name it.

1329
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:22,697
- Catch as can?
- Shoes or barefoot?

1330
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:26,826
Makes no never mind to me.

1331
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:28,453
Barefoot.

1332
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:40,298
You're gonna get killed
just to give something away.

1333
01:26:40,403 --> 01:26:42,383
I ain't got no choice.

1334
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:45,803
Get that city boy.

1335
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:47,639
Get the city boy.

1336
01:26:51,956 --> 01:26:53,311
Let's go.

1337
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:55,271
Make him say "calf rope", Leroy.

1338
01:26:59,839 --> 01:27:01,569
Come on, Leroy. Get him, Leroy.

1339
01:27:01,674 --> 01:27:03,404
Get him!

1340
01:27:07,138 --> 01:27:10,203
That ain't fair! You stop that!
You make him fight fair!

1341
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:13,122
Look out for that rake, Leroy.

1342
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,624
Watch out, Leroy.

1343
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:18,670
- Let's go in the car. Come on!
- Yee-haw!

1344
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:22,298
Woo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

1345
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:39,524
- Are you pushing?
- Of course I'm pushing!

1346
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:46,197
OK, it'll go now.
Put your foot on the brake.

1347
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:52,161
- The brake! The brake!
- It don't work!

1348
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:58,293
The brake, goddamn it! The brake!

1349
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,024
Don't you even know
where the damn brake is?

1350
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,859
It don't work.

1351
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:24,193
Oh...

1352
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,070
Well, it figures.

1353
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:29,240
Well, we're in Missouri anyway.

1354
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:31,743
What'll we do now, drop some 20s?

1355
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:37,582
- How much money we got?
- $837 and some change.

1356
01:28:37,687 --> 01:28:39,459
42 cents, I think.

1357
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:41,711
Well, we're just outside of St. Jo,
ain't we?

1358
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:44,088
- So what?
- So...

1359
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:49,010
It's a big town, ain't it?
We can do better than 20s.

1360
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:54,724
'Y'all know that one.

1361
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,393
"'Let's have another cup of coffee,
let's have another piece of pie."

1362
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:59,896
'Well, it's 10:30,
and it's Sunday morning in St. Jo,

1363
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:02,398
'and y'all get to church now, OK?

1364
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:03,649
'Here's the news:

1365
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:06,361
'In Omaha, President Roosevelt
told the nation last night...'

1366
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:07,653
- Moze?
- Yeah?

1367
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:10,490
- What if that old man don't believe ya?
- He'll believe me, all right.

1368
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:13,076
He's in the market for making a killing,
just like we are.

1369
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,869
Maybe he don't even have a silver mine.

1370
01:29:14,974 --> 01:29:17,246
I had him checked out real thorough.
Where's the money?

1371
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:20,666
And he's just what people say he is -
rich and greedy.

1372
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:24,379
'The independent candidate
for Senate this year...'

1373
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:26,631
- Pull up your socks.
- Moze...

1374
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:29,425
If we get a silver mine, we could get a house
and everything, couldn't we?

1375
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:32,220
Everything, just... everything.

1376
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:34,972
<i>Just around the corner,
there's a rainbow in the sky</i>

1377
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:36,599
<i>So let's have another cup of coffee</i>

1378
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:38,017
OK, you got it straight?

1379
01:29:38,122 --> 01:29:40,061
Corner of East Warring and Burlington,
11 o'clock.

1380
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:42,647
Just show there with tears in your eyes.
That's all.

1381
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:45,149
Moze, don't forget the money.

1382
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:48,361
Of course I won't forget the money.

1383
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:49,654
I'll see you in 30 minutes.

1384
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:52,198
Moze, could we get a piano, too?

1385
01:29:52,303 --> 01:29:55,118
A piano? We'll have a whole factory.

1386
01:29:59,018 --> 01:30:02,041
<i>Just around the corner</i>

1387
01:30:02,146 --> 01:30:04,794
<i>There's a rainbow in the sky</i>

1388
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:34,449
I guess you just didn't make
a good enough swap.

1389
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:38,119
My brother's real sore at ya.

1390
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:40,830
Seems you sold him
some of his own whisky.

1391
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,208
You can't arrest me now.
We're in Missouri.

1392
01:30:44,313 --> 01:30:46,002
And your damn brother's a bootlegger!

1393
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:50,047
You got an awful big mouth, Mister.

1394
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:54,469
Maybe I can't arrest you in Missouri,
and maybe I don't want to.

1395
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:59,056
But I sure can make sure that you ain't gonna
feel real good while you're here.

1396
01:31:06,794 --> 01:31:08,983
Let's go!

1397
01:32:50,314 --> 01:32:52,336
Addie...

1398
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,098
Addie...

1399
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:11,897
Moze.

1400
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,358
Moze...

1401
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:15,735
I sw...

1402
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,403
I swallowed my gold tooth.

1403
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:19,822
- Aw, Moze.
- They took it all.

1404
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:22,950
- Oh, Moze, you're all beat up.
- Ain't nothing left.

1405
01:33:23,055 --> 01:33:26,245
Don't worry none. I've been keeping
ten dollars for emergencies.

1406
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:28,331
What the hell we do with ten dollars?

1407
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:31,751
We could buy some bibles,
do a little widow business.

1408
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:34,629
Must be lots of good towns around here.

1409
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:37,006
Do some 20s, drop some wallets...

1410
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:39,383
before you know it,
we'll be real good again.

1411
01:33:39,488 --> 01:33:43,220
I'll bet in no time we could have
a whole new car and everything.

1412
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:55,941
You're going to take me
to Aunt Billie's now, ain't ya?

1413
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:01,238
- Aw, Moze...
- Don't start crying.

1414
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:04,116
- I won't.
- That's where we set out for, ain't it?

1415
01:34:21,113 --> 01:34:22,760
Looks nice.

1416
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:24,512
Yeah, it looks real fine.

1417
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:31,894
- That must be your uncle Daniel.
- He looks nice, too, don't he?

1418
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:33,938
Yup. Real nice.

1419
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:38,317
Maybe if Frank D. Roosevelt comes,

1420
01:34:38,422 --> 01:34:40,486
he'll tell him to take me
to the station to see him.

1421
01:34:40,591 --> 01:34:43,155
Maybe you write, ol' Frankie'll
have a place to write you back now.

1422
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:44,448
Yeah, he might, at that.

1423
01:34:44,553 --> 01:34:47,159
'Course he will.
Ain't no question but he will.

1424
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:51,247
All this talk's just wasting time.

1425
01:35:06,742 --> 01:35:09,890
Here's your...
here, your skates, your radio.

1426
01:35:09,995 --> 01:35:11,892
- Where you gonna go?
- Don't worry about me.

1427
01:35:11,997 --> 01:35:14,353
I got plans.
New ideas coming in every day.

1428
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:16,105
Get going.

1429
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:22,153
You know, if I knew for sure
you wasn't my pa...

1430
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:26,615
It's for sure I ain't your pa.

1431
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:30,578
Although sometimes I used to figure
Mr Connors could have been my pa,

1432
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:35,624
the way he touched my shoulder, get me
things from the candy counter for free.

1433
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:39,378
And Mr Pritchard,
he smiled at me once real nice.

1434
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:42,590
Except they don't have my jaw
or nothing.

1435
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:46,552
So long.

1436
01:35:46,657 --> 01:35:48,888
Ain't you coming to the door with me?

1437
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:52,892
There it is, right there.
How much closer am I supposed to bring you?

1438
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:54,769
They'll wonder how I got here.

1439
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,438
Tell 'em a family friend brung you,

1440
01:35:57,543 --> 01:36:01,275
and you had a little trouble on the way
with your car and with finances.

1441
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:03,027
Now, get going.

1442
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:46,654
Yes?

1443
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:49,615
Yes?

1444
01:36:51,096 --> 01:36:52,451
I'm Addie.

1445
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:54,703
Addie?

1446
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,163
Addie!

1447
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:59,041
I've been worried sick about you.

1448
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:01,585
Addie... come on in, child.

1449
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:13,282
I been writing letters,

1450
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:15,784
and your Uncle Daniel's been trying
to call those people down there

1451
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,453
to see where you've been.

1452
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:21,707
You're just the spitting image
of your mother, pretty as a picture.

1453
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:25,920
I don't know why I go on like this.
What you need is some ice-cold lemonade.

1454
01:38:26,025 --> 01:38:28,964
Now you just sit right there,
and I'll be right back.

1455
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:33,594
Everybody's going to be
so happy to see you.

1456
01:38:35,409 --> 01:38:37,640
We're going to get
those clothes off of you.

1457
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:40,601
You're going to get into
a nice, fresh, bath...

1458
01:38:40,706 --> 01:38:42,895
and then you're going to sleep
in your own little bed,

1459
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,105
alongside your cousin, Edna.

1460
01:38:46,795 --> 01:38:49,234
I just near give up on you, child.

1461
01:38:50,716 --> 01:38:54,949
I bet you're starving to death.
I'm going to cut you a big piece of pie.

1462
01:38:57,264 --> 01:39:00,663
We got those telegrams,
and then we never did hear from ya.

1463
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:56,677
I told you, I don't want you
riding with me no more.

1464
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:04,351
You still owe me $200.

1465
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:15,696
Moze, look!

1466
01:40:20,472 --> 01:40:21,994
Come on.

1467
01:40:24,226 --> 01:40:25,789
Hurry up.

1468
01:41:13,984 --> 01:41:16,799
<i>Keep your sunny side up</i>

1469
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:21,095
<i>Keep it up high,
the side that gets blue</i>

1470
01:41:21,825 --> 01:41:25,390
<i>If you have nine sons in a row</i>

1471
01:41:25,496 --> 01:41:29,728
<i>Start a baseball team,
they make money, you know</i>

1472
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:33,732
<i>Keep your funny side up, don't let up</i>

1473
01:41:33,837 --> 01:41:37,736
<i>Let your laughter come through,
doodley-doo</i>

1474
01:41:37,841 --> 01:41:39,696
<i>Stand up on your legs</i>

1475
01:41:39,802 --> 01:41:41,698
<i>Be like two fried eggs</i>

1476
01:41:41,804 --> 01:41:44,743
<i>Keep your sunny side up</i>
