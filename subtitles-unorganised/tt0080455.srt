1
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,125
The Assistant Warden wants
this one out of the block early.

2
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,123
Wants to get it over with fast.

3
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,920
Okay, let's do it.

4
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,381
Psst! Hey.

5
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,299
Come on, wake up,
it's time.

6
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,549
Wake up.
Let's go, it's time.

7
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,166
Well, this is it.

8
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,884
7474505B.

9
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:24,056
What wing?
- Maximum wing, Block 9.

10
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,478
Standard release?

11
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,026
Parole, three out of five.
Good behavior.

12
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,279
Give me a minute.

13
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,219
One Timex digital watch, broken.

14
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,097
One unused prophylactic.

15
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,239
One soiled.

16
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,758
Boots, black.
Belt, black.

17
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,101
One black suit jacket.

18
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,105
One pair black suit pants.

19
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,436
One hat. Black.

20
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,858
One pair of sunglasses.

21
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,199
$23.07.

22
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,708
Sign here.

23
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,155
What's this?

24
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,323
What?

25
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,238
This car.

26
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,240
This stupid car.

27
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,620
Where's the Cadillac?

28
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,794
The Caddy. Where's the Caddy?

29
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,121
The what?

30
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,673
The Cadillac we used to have.

31
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,466
The Bluesmobile.

32
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,964
I traded it.

33
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,879
You traded the Bluesmobile for this?

34
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,714
No, for a microphone.

35
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,219
A microphone?

36
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,927
Okay, I can see that.

37
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,520
What the hell is this?

38
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,268
This was a bargain.

39
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,647
I picked it up at the Mount Prospect
City Police Auction last spring.

40
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:42,022
It's an old Mount Prospect police car.
They were practically giving them away.

41
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,317
Well, thank you, pal.

42
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,611
The day I get out of prison,

43
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,450
my own brother picks me up in a police car.

44
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,521
You don't like it?

45
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,280
No, I don't like it.

46
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,293
Car's got a lot of pickup.

47
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,505
It's got a cop motor,
a 440 cubic-inch plant.

48
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,138
It's got cop tires,
cop suspension, cop shocks.

49
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:56,938
It was a model made before catalytic converters
so it'll run good on regular gas.

50
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,060
What do you say?

51
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,392
Is it the new Bluesmobile,
or what?

52
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,192
Fix the cigarette lighter.

53
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,690
What are we doing here?

54
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,490
You promised you'd visit the
Penguin the day you got out.

55
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,114
Yeah. So, I lied to her.

56
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,903
You can't lie to a nun.

57
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,615
We gotta go in and visit the Penguin.

58
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,625
No fucking way.

59
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,016
Who is it?

60
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,689
Jake and Elwood.

61
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,104
Come in.

62
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,956
Hello, boys.

63
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,876
Nice to see you.

64
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,091
Please, have a seat.

65
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,402
No, boys.
Come over here in front of me.

66
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,067
I want to see your faces.

67
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,756
The county took a tax assessment
of this property last month.

68
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,629
They want $5,000.

69
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,133
Doesn't the Church have to pay that?

70
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,762
They would, if they were
interested in keeping the place.

71
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,765
But they aren't.

72
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,356
The Archbishop wants to
sell this building outright

73
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,108
to the Board of Education.

74
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,196
What's gonna happen to you?

75
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:37,446
I'll be sent to the missions: Africa,

76
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,786
Latin America,

77
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,659
Korea...
- Forget it.

78
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,123
$5,000? No problem.

79
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,200
We'll have it for you in the morning.
Let's go.

80
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:50,915
No. I will not take your filthy, stolen money!

81
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,134
Well, then.

82
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,671
I guess you're really up shit creek.

83
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,183
I beg your pardon.
What did you say?

84
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,056
I offered to help you.

85
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,433
You refused to take our money.

86
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,941
Then I said, "I guess you're
really up shit creek. "

87
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,905
Ow! Christ, Jake,
take it easy, man.

88
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,947
Elwood!

89
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,952
Jesus Christ!

90
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,620
Shit! Goddamn it!

91
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,330
Son of a bitch!

92
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,289
Jesus Christ.
You son of a bitch!

93
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,328
You fat penguin!

94
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,341
Fuck this noise, man!

95
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,390
You are such a disappointing pair.

96
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,393
I prayed so hard for you.

97
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,062
It saddens and hurts me

98
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,649
that the two young men whom I raised

99
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,733
to believe in the Ten Commandments,

100
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,078
have returned to me as two thieves

101
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:08,496
with filthy mouths and bad attitudes.

102
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,834
Get out!
And don't come back

103
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,834
until you've redeemed yourselves.

104
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,220
Boys, you gotta learn
not to talk to nuns that way.

105
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,478
Jake, Elwood.

106
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,651
Curtis!
- Hey, man!

107
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,068
You look fine, man!

108
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,270
Good to see you, man!

109
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,942
Hey, buy you boys a drink?

110
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,952
Boys, things are bad.

111
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,032
They gonna sell this place
to the Board of Education

112
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,209
and I'll be out on the street.

113
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:56,963
That money's got to be in the Cook
County Assessor's Office within 11 days.

114
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,803
They wouldn't turn you out, would they?

115
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:07,054
Shit. What's one more old nigger
to the Board of Education?

116
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,939
Curtis, you and the Penguin
are the only family we got.

117
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,275
You're the only one
that was ever good to us

118
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:20,397
singing Elmore James tunes and
blowing the harp for us down here.

119
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,278
Well, the sister was right.

120
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,906
You boys could use a little churching up.

121
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,994
Slide on down to the Triple Rock
and catch Rev. Cleophus.

122
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,293
You boys listen to what he's got to say.

123
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,333
Curtis,

124
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,758
I don't want to listen
to no jive-ass preacher

125
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,211
talking to me about heaven and hell.

126
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,514
Jake, you get wise.
You get to church.

127
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:08,157
All I'm saying is we got to figure out
some way to get that money honestly.

128
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,122
That could be a problem.

129
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,199
It's like the Penguin says.

130
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,543
We've got to make that
move towards redemption.

131
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,037
We got to go to church.

132
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,913
We've got to make that move towards redemption.

133
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,418
We got to go to church.

134
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,966
Bullshit.

135
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,167
Come on.

136
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,783
And now,
this week's sermon

137
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:50,031
is from our beloved,
the Rev. Cleophus James!

138
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,408
James.

139
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,743
Come on, Reverend!
- Come on, preacher.

140
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,165
And now, people.

141
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,584
Take your time!

142
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,878
And now, people.

143
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,048
When I woke up this morning

144
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,964
I heard a disturbing sound.

145
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,557
Yeah.

146
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,593
I said, when I woke up this morning

147
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,722
I heard a disturbing sound!

148
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,018
What I heard was the jingle-jangle

149
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,562
of a thousand lost souls!

150
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,900
I'm talking about the souls
of mortal men and women

151
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,951
departed from this life!

152
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,121
Wait a minute!

153
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:38,911
Those lost, anguished souls
roaming unseen over the earth,

154
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,581
seeking the divine light

155
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:46,380
they'll not find,
because it's too late!

156
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,636
Too late! Yeah!
Too late for them to ever see again

157
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:56,435
the light they once chose
not to follow. All right!

158
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,389
Don't be lost when your time comes!

159
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,767
"For the day of the Lord cometh

160
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,103
"as a thief in the night. "

161
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,907
Amen.

162
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,818
Say Amen!

163
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,703
Can I get Amen?

164
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,919
Let Us an All go back

165
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,712
To the old Old landmark

166
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,256
Let us an all go back

167
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,924
To the old Old landmark

168
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,546
Let us all all go back

169
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,344
To the old Old landmark

170
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,093
As we stay in the service of the Lord

171
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,765
Let us kneel
Kneel in prayer

172
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,934
Gonna hold
Hold my breath

00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,981
Let us feel
Feel that prayer

176
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,648
Kneel in prayer

177
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,690
Let us preach

178
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,283
Preach the word

179
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,488
Got to preach Preach the word all the way

180
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,493
Do it, know it, feel it

181
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,631

185
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,020
Yea, Lord

Gonna preach

187
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,353

Let's go

To the old
Old landmark

196
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:52,961
Yeah

197
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,263
I know

198
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,022
Jake, are you all right?

199
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,072
Oh, Child

200
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,778
Say it loud

201
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:26,878
Hallelujah

202
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,086
The band.

203
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,009
The band.

204
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,757
Do you see the light?

205
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,929
The band!

206
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,683
Do you see the light?

207
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,513
What light?

208
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,595
Have you seen the light?

209
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:49,935
Yes! Jesus H.
Tap-Dancing Christ!

210
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,070
I have seen the light!

211
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,425
The band, Elwood,
the band!

212
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,340
The band?

213
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:21,970
The band.

214
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,893
Band.

215
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,061
The band!

216
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,683
Praise God!

217
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:30,479
And God bless the United States of America.

218
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,824
All go back

219
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,417
To the old
Old landmark

220
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,085
Let us all
All go back

221
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,912
To the old
Old landmark

222
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,714
Let us all

Do it, know ft, feel it

225
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,613
Gonna go back

226
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,235
All go back

227
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,158
Gonna go back

228
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,359
All go back

229
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,660
Gonna go back

230
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,283
All go back

231
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,206
Gonna go back

232
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,908
All go back

233
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,413
Gonna go back

234
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,244
All go back

235
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,625
Gonna go back

236
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:39,176
Stay in the service
of the Lord

237
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,981
Yea, Lord

238
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,839
We'll put the band back together,
do a few gigs.

239
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:24,172
We get some bread.
Bang. $5,000.

240
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:28,851
Yeah, getting the band back together
might not be that easy, Jake.

241
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,428
What are you talking about?

242
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:34,023
They split.
They all took straight jobs.

243
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,442
Yeah? So you know where they are.

244
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,027
You said you were keeping
in touch with them.

245
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:44,366
I got a couple of leads,
a few phone numbers.

246
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,445
But I mean, how many of them
visited or even wrote you, huh?

247
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,618
They're not the kind of
guys who write letters.

248
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,792
You were outside.
I was inside.

249
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,209
You were supposed to keep
in touch with the band.

250
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,257
I kept asking you if we
were gonna play again.

251
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,720
What was I gonna do,
take away your only hope?

252
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,425
Take away the very thing
that kept you going in there?

253
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,643
I took the liberty of bullshitting you.
Okay?

254
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,228
You lied to me.

255
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,772
It wasn't lies.
It was just bullshit.

256
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:30,992
What?

257
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,490
Rollers.
No.

258
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,241
Yeah.

259
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,864
What? What did I do?

260
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,866
You failed to stop at a red signal.

261
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,368
The light was yellow, sir.

262
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,788
May I see your license, please?

263
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:28,970
God damn it!

264
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:32,050
Man, I haven't been pulled
over in six months.

265
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,847
I bet those cops have got SCMODS.

266
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,725
SCMODS?

267
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,356
State County Municipal Offender Data System.

268
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:11,597
Elwood, we show your license
currently under suspension.

269
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,766
Step out of the car, please.

270
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:40,793
First you trade the Cadillac for a microphone.
Then you lie to me about the band.

271
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,378
Now you're gonna put me
right back in the joint.

272
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,206
They're not gonna catch us.
We're on a mission from God.

273
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,466
Elwood.

274
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:07,228
We are in high-speed pursuit
northbound on Courtland Avenue.

275
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,815
Black-and-white 1974 Dodge
sedan with Illinois plates.

276
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,657
Request assistance.

277
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,932
We'll be all right if we can
just get back on the expressway.

278
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,439
This don't look like no expressway to me!

279
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,273
Don't yell at me.

280
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,696
What do you want me to do, motorhead?

281
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,023
Try not to be so negative all the time.

282
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,700
Why don't you offer some constructive criticism?

283
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,875
You got us into this parking lot, pal.

284
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,497
Now you get us out!

285
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:08,673
You want out of this parking lot? Okay.

286
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,174
Will there be anything else?

287
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,173
Yes. Do you have a Miss Piggy?

288
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,981
There's Hanson Burgers.

289
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,317
Yeah, lots of space in this mall.

290
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,756
Disco pants and haircuts.

291
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:51,878
Yeah.

292
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,782
Baby clothes.

293
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,201
This place has got everything.

294
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,171
New Oldsmobiles are in early this year.

295
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,739
Pier 1 imports.

296
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,466
They broke my watch!

297
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,964
I'm gonna catch that sucker

298
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,842
if it's the last thing I ever do.

299
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,927
Nice place, huh?

300
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,777
Hey, Sam.

301
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,912
Hey, Lloyd.

302
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,963
Anybody call for me on the phone?

303
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,465
No. No calls.

304
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:11,970
Some guy left this card.
Cop. Said he'd be back.

305
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:25,358
This here's my brother, Jake.
He just got out of the joint.

306
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,277
He's gonna be staying
with me for a few weeks.

307
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,775
Yeah. Okay.

308
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,864
Did you get me my Cheez Whiz, boy?

309
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,514
Well, it ain't much,
but it's home.

310
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,890
How often does the train go by?
- So often you won't even notice it.

311
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,888
What are you doing?
- Making dinner. Want some?

312
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:38,716
No.

313
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,771
Tomorrow we got to get
the band back together.

314
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,557
I'm gonna quit work in the
morning, first thing.

315
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,360
And how are you going to get to work,
Mr. Lead Foot,

316
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,732
Mr. Hot Redder,

317
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,363
Mr. Motor Head?

318
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,611
Those cops took your license away.

319
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,154
They got your name,
your address.

320
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,610
No, they don't got my address.

321
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:02,410
I falsified my renewal.
I put down 1060 West Addison.

322
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,584
1060 West Addison?

323
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,919
That's Wrigley Field.

324
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,426
I gotta hit the sack.

325
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,766
Hey, you sleaze! My bed!

326
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:14,254
This, gentlemen, is the elegant
abode of one Elwood Blues.

327
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,423
Thanks for your help,
Mr. Mercer.

328
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,633
I kind of like the Wrigley Field bit.

329
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,631
Yeah, real cute.

330
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,720
All right, Sam?

331
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,901
Hi, has my friend arrived yet?

332
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,657
Failed to report in yesterday.

333
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,446
I don't want no trouble.

334
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,708
You just tell us where they are
and there'll be no trouble.

335
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,598
Stand back.

336
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,730
It's almost 9:00.
We've gotta go to work.

337
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,571
Well, Elwood,
sit down.

338
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:55,949
What's on your mind?

339
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,787
I got to quit.

340
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,374
Why is that, Elwood?

341
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,006
I'm going to become a priest.

342
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,349
Well, okay.

343
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:17,562
Listen, I'll call payroll and have
them get your severance pay ready.

344
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,563
Good luck.

345
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:27,022
God bless you, sir.
- Well, thank you.

346
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,162
What's this?

347
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,423
This is the last known address

348
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,044
of "Bones" Malone and "Blue Lou" Marini.

349
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,095
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

350
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:57,726
Yeah.

351
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,847
Mrs. Toronto?

352
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,268
Tarantino.

353
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:48,020
Ma'am, do you have a Thomas Malone
or Louis Marini living here?

354
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,944
Not anymore.
They moved out a long time ago.

355
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,281
I don't take in boarders,
not for a long time.

356
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,205
May we come in, ma'am?
- Please.

357
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,593
Did they leave a forwarding address?
A phone number?

358
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,715
No.

359
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:17,302
Did they live quietly?
What were their personal habits?

360
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,183
They were good boys

361
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:22,095
but they made a lot of racket at night.

362
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,848
Are you the police?

363
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,641
No, ma'am.
We're musicians.

364
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:30,896
Mr. Man!

365
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,480
Mr. Man!

366
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,858
Mr. Man!

367
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,651
Yes, ma'am?

368
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,238
They left this card.
Maybe it'll help you?

369
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,553
Thanks.

370
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,698
Thank you.
You're marvelous.

371
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,359
You're marvelous.
Thank you.

372
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,445
I'm Murph, and these
are the Magic Tones.

373
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,031
Steve "The Colonel" Cropper,
Donald "Duck" Dunn,

374
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:08,243
Willie "Too Big" Hall
and Tom "Bones" Malone.

375
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:13,168
We'll be back for the Armada Room's two-hour
disco swing party after this short break.

376
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,341
Till then,
don't you go changing.

377
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:24,138
So, Jake, you're out. You're free.
You're rehabilitated.

378
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,220
What's next? What's happening?
What you gonna do?

379
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:29,647
You got the money you owe us, motherfucker?

380
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,975
Look, let's just get something straight here...

381
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:34,652
The reason he got locked in
the slam in the first place

382
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,731
was for sticking up a gas
station to cover you guys.

383
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,566
You're kidding.

384
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:42,447
He pulled that job to pay for
the band's room-service tab

385
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,029
from that Kiwanis gig in Coal City.

386
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,035
You did?
That's right.

387
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:50,501
So I don't want to hear anymore
of this small-change shit.

388
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,912
We're putting the band back together.

389
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,543
Now, who here at this table

390
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:03,798
can honestly say
that they played any finer

391
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:07,972
or felt any better than they did than
when they were with the Blues Brothers?

392
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,807
You were the backbone.

393
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,561
The nerve center of a great
rhythm-and-blues band.

394
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:20,402
You can make that live,
breathe and jump again.

395
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,738
"Murph and the Magic Tones?"

396
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:27,038
Look at you in those
candy-ass monkey suits.

397
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,707
And I thought I had it bad in Joliet.

398
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,955
At least we got a change
in clothes, sucker.

399
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,958
You're wearing the same shit
you had on three years ago.

400
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,455
Jake ain't lying.

401
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:40,214
We had a band powerful enough to
turn goat piss into gasoline.

402
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:43,796
We'll never get that fat sound again.
- Not without some more horns.

403
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,677
We'll never get Mr. Fabulous.

404
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,303
Where is he?
Forget it.

405
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:50,557
Mr. Fabulous is the top
maitre d' at the Chez Paul.

406
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,058
He's pulling down six bills a week.

407
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,811
Matt Murphy got married.

408
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,649
Where is Matt "Guitar" Murphy?

409
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,853
He opened a soul food restaurant
with his old lady on Maxwell Street.

410
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,358
And he took Blue Lou with him.

411
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:04,734
You'll never get Matt and Mr. Fabulous
out of them high-paying gigs.

412
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,903
Oh, yeah?

413
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:12,666
Well, me and the Lord,
we got an understanding.

414
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,161
We're on a mission from God.

415
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,800
Mainly French cuisine.

416
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,932
No, sir. Mayor Daley no longer dines here.

417
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,264
He's dead, sir.

418
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:38,147
Private dining rooms are available.

419
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,946
Oh, no. I thought it was
supposed to be 5 years.

420
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,774
Didn't you get 5 years?
Uh, no, sir, not you.

421
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:46,776
And your name, sir?

422
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:51,285
Rizzolo, for 8 at 11:30.
Thank you.

423
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:56,373
Mr. Fabulous, how marvelous
it is to see you.

424
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:57,874
You're looking younger than ever.

425
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,546
Wait.
You guys can't come in here.

426
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:01,624
Oh, nonsense, my dear fellow.

427
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,880
My brother and I have come to dine

428
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:07,722
to celebrate my early release
from the service of the state.

429
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,264
Wait. Let's talk outside.

430
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,762
Let's have a cup of coffee outside.

431
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,309
Why, heavens, no.

432
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,058
We seek a full meal and all
the compliments of the house.

433
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,684
Come, Elwood.

434
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,142
Let us adjourn ourselves to the nearest table

435
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:22,320
and overlook this establishment's board of fare.

436
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,653
Good evening.
Chez Paul. Wait! Hey!

437
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,407
Uh, sir, do you mind calling back
in about five minutes, please?

438
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,269
I'm sure, we'll have a table
for you in just a few moments.

439
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,523
Excuse me, won't you?

440
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,276
Give us a bottle of your finest champagne,

441
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,692
five shrimp cocktails
and some bread for my brother.

442
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,953
We have a Dom Perignon, '71, at $120.

443
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,619
That'll be fine, pal.

444
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:23,210
Come on. Seriously, you guys, the
food here is really expensive.

445
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:24,882
The soup is fucking $10.

446
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:28,382
Come on. Let's go outside.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

447
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,633
We're putting the band back together.

448
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,215
Forget it. No way.

449
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,800
We're on a mission from God.

450
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,224
Hold it, hold it.
What's this?

451
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,058
Waiter? Sir?

452
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,148
Please, waiter?

453
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,312
Yes, sir?
How are your salads?

454
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,480
The salads are fine.

455
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:53,153
It's just that we'd like
to move to another table,

456
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,488
away from those two gentlemen.

457
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,825
Why? Have they been disturbing you?
- No.

458
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:04,748
It's just that, well, frankly,
they're offensive... smelling.

459
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,708
I mean, they smell bad.

460
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:13,339
Excuse me, sir. I'll see if I can
locate another table for you.

461
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,966
Thank you.

462
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,979
Wrong glass, sir.

463
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,077
How much for the little girl?

464
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:23,830
The women?
How much for the women?

465
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:24,956
What?

466
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,129
Your women,
I want to buy your women.

467
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,002
The little girl.
Your daughters.

468
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:30,458
Sell them to me.

469
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:31,793
Sell me your children.

470
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,752
Maitre d'! Maitre d'!

471
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,644
Hey, cut it out,
cut it out.

472
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,768
The owners are gonna ask me
to call the cops.

473
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,849
You wouldn't do that to me,
would you, man?

474
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,400
He just got out of Joliet.

475
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,522
He's on parole.

476
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:53,856
You can't call the cops on him, man.
We're putting the band back together.

477
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,442
I said no.
Absolutely not!

478
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,613
You! How much for your wife?

479
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,372
We're putting the band back together.

480
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:07,374
We need you, man.
We need your horn.

481
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,046
I can't. I really can't.

482
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:12,882
We got everybody except Matt "Guitar" Murphy
and Blue Lou and we're getting them next.

483
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:13,959
No way.

484
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:22,267
If you say no, Elwood and I
will come here for breakfast,

485
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,970
lunch and dinner every day of the week.

486
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,519
Okay, okay. I'll play.
You got me.

487
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,091
White men!

488
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,627
White women!

489
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:01,432
The swastika is calling you!

490
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:06,766
The sacred and ancient symbol of your race

491
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,729
since the beginning of time.

492
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:15,692
The Jew is using the black

493
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,407
as muscle against you.

494
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:24,448
And you are left there,
helpless.

495
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:26,911
Fuck you! Why don't you
go back where you belong?

496
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,243
What are you gonna do about it, Whitey?

497
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,496
Just sit there?

498
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:34,294
Go back where you came from!

499
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,916
Of course not!

500
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,218
Son of a bitch!

501
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,136
You are going to join with us,

502
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:47,262
the members of the American Socialist
White People's Party. '

503
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:51,774
an organization of decent,

504
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,856
law-abiding white folk

505
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,150
just like you.

506
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,065
Blow it out your ass,
you bastards!

507
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,075
Go to hell!

508
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,993
I pledge allegiance to Adolf Hitler.

509
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,618
I pledge allegiance to Adolf Hitler.

510
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,449
The immortal leader of our race.

511
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,167
The immortal leader of our race.

512
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,036
To the order for which he stands.

513
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,121
And to the order for which he stands.

514
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,707
One great cause.
One great cause.

515
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,543
Sacred and invincible.
Sacred and invincible.

516
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,253
Hey, what's going on?

517
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:25,766
Those bums won their court case,
so they're marching today.

518
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:26,967
What bums?

519
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,848
The fucking Nazi Party.

520
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,438
Illinois Nazis.

521
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,726
I hate Illinois Nazis.

522
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,936
Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

523
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,991
Ten hut!

524
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:02,135
Gruppenfhrer!

525
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,257
Yes, sir!

526
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:07,220
Gruppenfhrer, get that
car's license plate number.

527
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,805
We're gonna kill that son of a bitch.

528
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,283
Boom, boom, DOOITI, DOOITI

529
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,626
Come on home, babe

530
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,670
Oh, come on home

531
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:50,180
Oh, come on home,
come on home to me, babe

532
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,305
I love you
I love you

533
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:58,605
Come on
come on, come on

534
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,485
Oh, come on home

535
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,700
Come on, I love ya

536
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:07,992
Hold me

537
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,331
I know

538
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,132
I love you

539
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,802
I love you

540
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:29,931
Look out

541
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:44,647
When she walk that walk

542
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,649
And talk that talk

543
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:50,407
And whisper in my ear

544
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,910
Tell me that she love me

545
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,538
I love that talk

546
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,248
That baby talk

547
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,335
When she talk like that

548
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:05,417
I can't take it like that

549
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:08,295
Haw, haw, haw, haw

550
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,053
Hey, hey, yeah

551
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,178
Come on home,
pretty babe

552
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:17,187
Walk your walk

553
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,856
Talk your talk

554
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:22,730
Talk your talk, baby

555
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:24,774
Talk

556
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:41,707
Yeah.

557
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,646
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

558
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,691
That was Boom Boom, the song
that I wrote, back in the '50s

559
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,063
No, you didn't.

560
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:05,481
...was such a big hit.

561
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,278
No, you didn't!
No, you didn't!

562
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:10,066
I wrote Boom Boom.
I wrote Boom Boom.

563
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,623
Can I help you, boys?

564
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,170
You got any white bread?

565
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:25,293
Yes.

566
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:28,508
I'll have some toasted
white bread, please.

567
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:32,967
You want butter or jam
on that toast, honey?

568
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,423
No, ma'am. Dry.

569
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,346
Got any fried chicken?

570
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:42,731
Best damn chicken in the state.
- Bring me four fried chickens and a Coke.

571
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:48,107
You want chicken wings or chicken legs?
- Four fried chickens and a Coke.

572
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:50,196
And some dry white toast, please.

573
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,279
You all want anything to drink with that?
- No, ma'am. - A Coke.

574
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,576
Be up in a minute.

575
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,534
We got two honkies out there

576
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,581
dressed like Hasidic diamond merchants.

577
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,038
Say what?

578
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:04,495
They look like they're from
the CIA or something.

579
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:05,750
What they wanna eat?

580
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:09,584
The tall one wants white bread. Toast.

581
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,217
Dry. With nothing on it.

582
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,340
Elwood!

583
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:16,841
And the other one wants four
whole fried chickens and a Coke.

584
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:19,184
And Jake! Shit!
The Blues Brothers!

585
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:20,893
Hi, Jake.

586
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,596
Matt! How you doing?

587
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,226
How you doing?
How was Joliet?

588
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:25,432
Oh, it's bad.

589
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,768
On Thursday night they serve
a wicked pepper steak.

590
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:31,024
Can't be as bad as the cabbage rolls
at the Terre Haute Federal Pen.

591
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:34,866
Or that oatmeal at the Cook County Slammer.
They're all pretty bad.

592
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,993
Matt! Me and Elwood,

593
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:41,660
we're putting the band back together.
We need you and Blue Lou.

594
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,579
Oh, man. Don't talk that way around here.

595
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,126
My old lady,
she'll kill me.

596
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,454
Ma'am, you gotta understand.

597
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,789
This is a lot bigger
than any domestic problems

598
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,294
you might be experiencing.

599
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:53,884
Matt, what the hell is he talking about?
- Don't get riled, sugar.

600
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,800
Don't you,
"don't get riled, sugar" me!

601
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,927
Now, you not going back on the road no more.

602
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:00,634
And you ain't playing any more
two-bit, sleazy dives.

603
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:04,433
You're living with me now.
And you're not gonna go sliding around

604
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,230
with your old white hoodlum friends.

605
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:08,692
But, babes!
This is Jake and Elwood!

606
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,064
The Blues Brothers!

607
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,279
The Blues Brothers!

608
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:18,323
They still owe you money, fool!

609
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,742
Ma'am, would it make you feel
any better if you knew that

610
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,700
what we're asking Matt
here to do is a holy thing?

611
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,170
You see,
we're on a mission from God.

612
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:31,044
Don't you blaspheme in here!
Don't you blaspheme in here!

613
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:33,625
Now, this is my man,
this is my restaurant,

614
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,006
and you two are gonna just
walk right out that door,

615
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:40,057
without your dry, white toast,
without your four fried chickens

616
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,179
and without Matt "Guitar" Murphy!

617
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,353
Now, you listen to me!
I love you.

618
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,350
But I'm the man and you're the woman.

619
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,557
And I'll make the decisions
concerning my life!

620
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:50,400
You better think about what you saying.

621
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:53,020
You better think about the
consequences of your actions.

622
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,400
Oh, shut up, woman!

623
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:55,943
You better think
- Think

624
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,158
Think about what you're trying to do to me

625
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,031
Yeah, think
Think, think

626
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,329
Let your mind go
Let yourself be free

627
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:04,031
Let's go back
Let's go back

628
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,162
Let's go way on back when

629
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:07,413
I didn't even know you

630
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:09,377
You couldn't have been too much more than 10

631
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,544
Just a child

632
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,749
I ain't no psychiatrist
I ain't no doctor with degrees

633
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,964
It don't take too much high IQ
to see what you're doing to me

634
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:18,678
You better think
Think

635
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,972
Think about what you're trying to do to me

636
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,090
Think
Think, think

637
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:24,601
Let your mind go
Let yourself be free

638
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:26,470
Oh, freedom
Freedom

639
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,855
Freedom
Freedom

640
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,182
Freedom

641
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:31,892
Yeah, freedom

642
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:34,353
Right now, freedom
Freedom

643
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:36,188
Freedom
Freedom

644
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:37,693
Freedom

645
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,400
Oh, freedom right now

646
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,235
Hey, think about it

647
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,787
You, think about it

648
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:47,248
There ain't nothing you could ask
I could answer you, but I won't

649
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:50,874
But I was gonna change that, I'm not
if you keep doing things I don't

650
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:54,335
Think about what you're trying to do to me

651
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,003
Damn it
Think

652
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:58,343
Let your mind go
Let yourself be free

653
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,555
People walking around every day
playing games and taking scores

654
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,723
Tryin' to make other people lose their mind

655
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,345
Be careful you don't lose yours

656
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:06,810
Hey, think
Think

657
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:09,103
Think about what you're trying to do to me

658
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,931
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Think, think

659
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:13,312
Let your mind go
Let yourself be free

660
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,106
You need me
Need me

661
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:17,279
And I need you
Don't you know

662
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:20,654
Without each other there
ain't nothing either can do

663
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,909
Yeah, think about it, babe

664
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,327
What you trying to do to me

665
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:27,163
To the bone, man
Think about it right now

666
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,041
Oh, freedom
Freedom

667
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,790
Freedom
Freedom

668
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,542
Yeah, freedom

669
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:39,218
Freedom
Freedom

670
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:42,546
Freedom

671
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:43,676
Right now

672
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:47,092
You, think about it

673
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,429
There ain't nothing you could ask
I can answer you, but I won't

674
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:53,937
But I was gonna change my mind
if you keep doing things I don't

675
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,358
Yeah, think
Think

676
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:58,020
Think about what you're trying to do to me

677
01:04:58,353 --> 01:04:59,400
Think

678
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,649
Let your mind go
Let yourself be free

679
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,324
You need me
Need me

680
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,243
And I need you
Don't you know

681
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:08,663
Without each other there
ain't nothing either can do

682
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,285
Yeah, yeah

683
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:11,457
Think about it, baby

684
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:12,785
What you're trying
to do to me

685
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,039
To the bone, man

686
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,707
Think about it, baby

687
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:17,585
Yeah, right on
To the bone

688
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:20,295
For deepness
To the bone, for deepness

689
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:21,547
Yeah
To the bone

690
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:23,545
For deepness, think about it

691
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:25,930
To the bone, for deepness

692
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:28,554
Right now

693
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,306
Think about it,
yeah, yeah, yeah

694
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:34,890
To the bone, for deepness
To the bone, for deepness

695
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,649
Think about it
For deepness

696
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,067
Think about it

697
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,325
Don't give me the blues,
brother, hey

698
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:47,994
You had better

699
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,197
Stop and think about it
Think

700
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,372
Think

701
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:12,306
Let's boogie.

702
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,239
Well, go ahead, damn it!

703
01:07:56,072 --> 01:08:00,868
Pardon me, but we do have a strict policy
concerning the handling of the instruments.

704
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:04,957
An employee of Ray's Music
Exchange must be present.

705
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,088
Now, may I help you?

706
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,965
Ray, it's me. Joliet Jake.

707
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:13,636
I once rented some column
speakers from you for my band,

708
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:15,012
The Blues Brothers.

709
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:17,719
Hey, Ray. it's me, Murph, of
Murph and the Magic Tones.

710
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:19,520
Remember me?
I bought three Fender amps.

711
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,644
Oh, we sell a lot of amplifiers.

712
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:23,600
Not like these.
They were beautiful.

713
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:25,853
Upholstered with thick,
red shag.

714
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,154
Oh, right, right!
I remember now.

715
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:31,028
As a matter of fact, I'll buy
them all back for $350 a piece.

716
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,199
$350?

717
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,823
I paid $800 each,
not 6 months ago.

718
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:37,621
Well, you know depreciation, man.

719
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:40,287
Ray, we're here to buy stuff.

720
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:43,082
We need pianos,
amps, mikes, the works.

721
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:47,044
Now, go on! Get!

722
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:54,176
Breaks my heart,
a boy that young going bad.

723
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:58,764
Tell me a little about this
electric piano, Ray.

724
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:00,766
Oh, you have a good eye, my man.

725
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,939
That's the best in the city of Chicago.

726
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:04,061
How much?

727
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,110
$2,000 and it's yours.
You can take it home with you.

728
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,320
Matter of fact, I'll throw
in the black keys for free.

729
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,940
$2,000 for this chunk of shit?

730
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:13,616
Come on, Ray!

731
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:17,742
I mean, really, Ray.
It's used.

732
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,289
There's no action left in this keyboard.

733
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,297
Excuse me.

734
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:32,176
I don't think there's anything wrong
with the action on this piano.

735
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:42,311
Well, singing about the
fella you've been dancing with

736
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,430
All over the neighborhood

737
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,809
So, why didn't you ask me, baby

738
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:50,524
Or didn't you think I could?

739
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:54,073
Well, I know that the
boogaloo is out of sight

740
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,526
But the shingaling's the thing tonight

741
01:09:57,318 --> 01:10:00,117
But if that was you and me out there, baby

742
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,949
I would have shown you how to do it right

743
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,579
Do it right

744
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,833
Do it right

745
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:10,836
Do it right

746
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,668
Do it right

747
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:18,180
Twisting

748
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:21,510
Shake it, shake it, baby

749
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,225

Let me see you shake your tailfeather

754
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:36,779

755

01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,215
Yeah, come on, baby

Do the twist

765
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:03,093
Do the fly

766
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,183
Do the swim

767
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:09,232
And do the bird

768

Do the duck

769
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:15,109
Do the monkey

770
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,241
Watusi

771
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:20,906
And what about the frug

772
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:24,280
Do the mashed potato

773
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:26,579
What about the boogaloo

774
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:29,911
The Bony Maronie

775
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:32,914
Come on, let's do the twist

776
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:39,671
Ah, twisting

777
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:42,223
Shake it, shake it, baby

778
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:45,468

779
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,138

Shake it, shake it, baby

782
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:02,659
Okay, man.

783
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:04,783
We'll take
these axes.

784
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:08,788
Naturally. And as usual,
I gotta take an IOU.

785
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,829
You guys go inside,
get yourselves a bite.

786
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:48,823
I've got to
make a phone call.

787
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:52,043
Now, Jake, does this phone
call concern our first gig?

788
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,953
Have I ever lied to you?

789
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:03,588
What are we gonna do, man?

790
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:04,888
We don't got no gig.

791
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,511
How much money you got?

792
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,135
I got a quarter.

793
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,686
That's enough for a phone call. Come on.

794
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,026
What are you doing, Elwood?

795
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,732
You said we were gonna make a call.

796
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:24,575
I said I was gonna make a call.

797
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:26,365
Who are you gonna call, Jake?

798
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,237
Do you remember Maury Sline?

799
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,911
Sline? Booking agent?
What about him?

800
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,826
He got us some good showcases in the old days.

801
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:36,879
He got us the Morgan Park,
he got us the Tick Took.

802
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:39,090
I got him laid.
He owes me.

803
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:41,251
Give it a shot.

804
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,159
Hey, Jake.

805
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,451
There's got to be at least
$7 worth of change here.

806
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:24,085
Yeah?

807
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,552
Sir.

808
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:29,883
What did you find out?

809
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,058
Okay.

810
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,852
I called a friend at
the Motor Vehicle Department.

811
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:37,148
That license plate is like a
rash all over the computer.

812
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:40,067
The car belongs to a known traffic menace.

813
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:41,685
What's his name?

814
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:43,066
His name is Elwood Blues.

815
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,364
He's got a record a mile long.

816
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:47,366
And he's a Catholic.

817
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,911
Did you get his address?
- Of course.

818
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,705
1060 West Addison.

819
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:55,453
Let's go.

820
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,808
Anybody with that kind of record
is gonna make a mistake.

821
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:18,727
I want all party members in the tri-state
district to monitor the city, county,

822
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:20,774
and state police on their C.B's.

823
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:24,024
Mr. Blues is gonna fuck up.

824
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:26,147
And when he does,

825
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:29,905
he better pray the police
get to him before we do.

826
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,040
All right, man.

827
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:41,754
We've been in this car
for three hours now.

828
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:43,126
Where the hell is this place?

829
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:46,254
I told you it'd take
a little while to get there.

830
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,676
What's the name of the place?

831
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:51,673
Uh, the name of the place is, uh,

832
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:55,552
Bob's Country Bunker.

833
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,098
Here we are.

834
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,725
Bob's Country Bunker?

835
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:18,286
Jake,
the sign says,

836
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:19,833
"Tonight only, the Good Ole Boys. "

837
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,161
Blues Brothers!

838
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,416
It should read,
"Tonight only,

839
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:26,006
"the Blues Brothers' triumphant return. "

840
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,380
Must be some kind of mistake.

841
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:30,006
You guys unload the stuff.

842
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:31,879
Elwood, come with me.

843
01:16:54,652 --> 01:16:56,700
What can I get you boys?

844
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:59,157
You thirsty, you hungry
or just driving through?

845
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:01,875
Maybe you'd like a beer,
or something a little harder?

846
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:04,704
We happen to make the
state's best pepper steak.

847
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:06,539
No, thank you, ma'am!

848
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:09,633
We may be sucking back a few
beers a little later on.

849
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:12,461
We'll be here all night.
You see, we're the band.

850
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,598
You are?
Oh, gee, that's nice!

851
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:17,933
Hey, Bob,
this is the band!

852
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,426
All right!

853
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:23,143
What kind of music
do you usually have here?

854
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:26,309
We got both kinds.
We got country and western.

855
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,107
Jake, are you sure
this is the place?

856
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,659
Yeah! Sure!
This is the place.

857
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:43,580
Hi! You the Good Ole Boys?
That's us!

858
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,878
The rest of the band's
out in the parking lot

859
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:47,121
getting our stuff together.

860
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:49,298
Well, I'm sure glad
to have you boys here.

861
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:51,341
I'm Bob and this here is my place.

862
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:55,008
It's a beautiful place, Bob!

863
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:58,348
I guess you wanna get your
steel guitars and everything

864
01:17:58,424 --> 01:17:59,676
set up on stage,
don't you?

865
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:03,513
Claire, go and turn those stage lights on
and get these boys going up there.

866
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:10,857
Chicken wire?

867
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:13,030
What do you say we set up for sound check?

868
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:19,157
Excuse me, sonny,
I guess I'll give this to you.

869
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,488
You're the tallest one.

870
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:21,868
Okay, what is it?

871
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:27,036
Well, that there is a list of the songs
you boys will be playing tonight.

872
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:48,561
Man, I don't think we know any
of the songs on this list.

873
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:53,525
This list doesn't mean anything.
They're just requests.

874
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:55,322
Do our regular set.
First tune!

875
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,033
Give Me Some Loving.
One, two.

876
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,781
One, two, three, four.

877
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:19,138
What are those damn freak
pecker heads playing?

878
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,173
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

879
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:23,259
We're glad to be here
in Kokomo tonight.

880
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:27,851
We're the Good Old Blues
Brothers Boys Band from Chicago.

881
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,307
We sure hope you'll like our show.

882
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,392
I'm Elwood.
This is my brother Jake.

883
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:34,854
Well, my temperature's rising
and my feet on the floor

884
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:38,278
Crazy people knockin'
'Cause they wanted some more

885
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,319
Let me in, baby
I don't know what you got

886
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:44,071
You better take it easy
'Cause this place is hot

887
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:47,454
And I'm so glad you made it

888
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:51,120
That ain't no Hank Williams song!

889
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,456
Give me some loving

890
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,882
Get off the stage!

891
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:57,960
Give me some loving

892
01:19:58,544 --> 01:19:59,966
Every day

893
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,636
Why'd they turn off the lights?

894
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:04,759
Maybe they blew a fuse.

895
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:06,135
I don't think so, man.

896
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:08,141
Those lights are off on purpose.

897
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,894
We gotta figure out something
these people like, and fast!

898
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,692
I got it.
Remember the theme from Rawhide?

899
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,231
The old favorite.
Rowdy Yates.

900
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:16,938
What key?
A.

901
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:18,318
Good country key.

902
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:19,649
Rawhide in A.

903
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:29,662
Rollin ', rollin ', rollin'

904
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:32,086
Though the streams are swollen

905
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,330
Keep them dogies rollin'

906
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,713
Rawhide

907
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:41,046
The rain and wind and weather
Hellbent for leather

908
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:44,848
Wishin' my gal was by my side

909
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,348
All the things I'm missin'

910
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:50,847
Good vittles,
love and kissin'

911
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:54,434
Are waiting at the end of my ride

912
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:56,894
Move 'em on
Head 'em up

913
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:58,236
Head 'em up
Move 'em on

914
01:20:58,354 --> 01:20:59,355
Move 'em on
Head 'em up

915
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:00,860
Rawhide
Cut 'em out

916
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:02,031
Ride 'em in
Ride 'em in

917
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:03,359
Cut 'em out
Cut 'em out

918
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,199
Ride 'em in, Rawhide

919
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:30,344
Move 'em on
Head 'em up

920
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:31,599
Head 'em up
Move 'em on

921
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,812
Move 'em on
Head 'em up

922
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,390
Rawhide
Cut 'em out

923
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:35,858
Ride 'em in
Ride 'em in

924
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:37,059
Cut 'em out
Cut 'em out

925
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:40,279
Ride 'em in,
Rawhide

926
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:43,857
Yah!

927
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,363
Rawhide

928
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:58,254
Rawhide

929
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:06,594
Theme from the TV show Rawhide.
Thank you.

930
01:22:14,388 --> 01:22:16,436
We'd like to do a favorite
of the horn section.

931
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:18,104
We hope it's one of yours.

932
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:27,444
Sometimes it's hard to be a woman

933
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:33,824
Giving all your love

934
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,828
To just one man

935
01:22:39,246 --> 01:22:42,295
And if you love him

936
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:46,633
Oh, be proud of him

937
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:50,216
'Cause after all

938
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,518
He's just a man

939
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:58,270
Stand by your man

940
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:03,487
Give him two arms to cling to

941
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:07,487
And something warm to come to

942
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:11,328
When nights are cold and lonely

943
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:14,665
Stand by your man

944
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:19,704
And tell the world you love him

945
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:24,008
Keep giving all the love you can

946
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:31,974
Stand by your man

947
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:38,643
Stand by your man

948
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:43,812
And show the world you love him

949
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:48,149
Keep giving all the love you can

950
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:51,861
Baby

951
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:57,370
Stand by your man

952
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:23,521
Well, folks, it's time to call it a night.

953
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,228
But do what you feel, and
keep both feet on the wheel.

954
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:28,614
You don't have to go home
but you can't stay here.

955
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,197
So, till next time:

956
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:31,449
Move 'em on Head 'em up

957
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:32,568
Head 'em up
Move 'em on

958
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:33,740
Move 'em on
Head 'em up

959
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:34,861
Rawhide

960
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:36,071
Cut 'em out
Ride 'em in

961
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:37,243
Ride 'em in
Cut 'em out

962
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:38,365
Cut 'em out

963
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:41,452
Ride 'em in, Rawhide

964
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:45,047
Rawhide

965
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:47,545
Let's get the hell
out of here.

966
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:59,436
Shit, I wanna tell you boys that's some
of the best goddamn music we've had

967
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:01,806
at the Country Bunker in a longtime.

968
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:06,102
Sorry we couldn't remember
The Wreck of the Old 97.

969
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:07,227
Why, hell!

970
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:09,780
You guys can learn it next
time when you come back.

971
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:13,283
Bob, about our money for tonight.

972
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:14,910
That's right.

973
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,408
$200

974
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:20,866
and you boys drank $300 worth of beer.

975
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:25,621
When we first came in the bar lady
never charged us for the first round

976
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:28,215
so, like, we figured beer was
complimentary for the band.

977
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:30,084
Beer was, like, complimentary
for the band, you know.

978
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:31,919
No.

979
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:37,174
Well, I'll just go out and take up
a collection from the boys.

980
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:39,931
Well, I'll tell you,
I sure would appreciate it.

981
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:48,185
I say this trip is nowhere, man.

982
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:49,812
I say we gotta quit.

983
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,864
What? Quit?

984
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:55,192
Well, I wish you guys
would make up your mind.

985
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:57,073
Otherwise, I've gotta call Mr. Ronzini

986
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,029
at the Holiday Inn and
get our old gig back.

987
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:00,830
Back at the Armada Room?

988
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:04,792
Listen, they want us to pay
for the beer we drank.

989
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:06,332
So you guys better split.

990
01:26:06,453 --> 01:26:09,753
The next gig is
gonna be dynamite!

991
01:26:10,123 --> 01:26:11,875
Huge! You'll see.

992
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:19,929
I say we give The Blues Brothers
just one more chance.

993
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,511
Why not?
If the shit fits, wear it!

994
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,305
Scoot over, goddamn it!

995
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:33,151
Boys look a little upset.

996
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:36,988
Hey, man. Don't worry.
We got a couple of days.

997
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:38,986
We'll get the Penguin's tax money.

998
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:40,324
I mean, look.

999
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:43,244
We got an appointment
to see Mr. Sline tomorrow.

1000
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:45,246
Everything's gonna be all right.

1001
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:46,542
Let's skate.

1002
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:50,084
Goddamn it.

1003
01:26:54,584 --> 01:26:56,302
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Are you The Good Ole Boys?

1004
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:57,470
Yeah, that's right.

1005
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:58,843
I'm Tucker McElroy,
lead singer,

1006
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:00,014
driver of the Winnebago.

1007
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:02,385
I'd like to talk to you,
but we're running very late.

1008
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,390
My name is Jacob Stein,
American Federation

1009
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,312
of Musicians Union,
Local 200.

1010
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:09,516
I've been sent here to see if you
gentlemen are carrying your permits.

1011
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:10,813
Our what?

1012
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:12,102
Your union cards.

1013
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:13,732
May I see your cards, please?

1014
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,945
Suppose we ain't got no union cards
and we go in and start playing anyway.

1015
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:19,992
What you gonna do about that?

1016
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:22,321
You gonna stop us? Stein?

1017
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:26,996
You gonna look pretty funny trying to eat
corn on the cob with no fucking teeth!

1018
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,411
Listen,

1019
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:33,165
let me talk to Bob,
the owner.

1020
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:36,426
See if we can put your band
on contract waivers for tonight.

1021
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:40,722
I don't want you to move from this spot.
- Just let me handle this.

1022
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:46,474
We'll, uh...
We'll talk to Bob.

1023
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,026
Get in the car and start her up.

1024
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:59,734
You know you boys owe me a lot of money
for that beer you drank tonight!

1025
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:00,942
Goddamn it!

1026
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:03,199
Bob, we loved playing here tonight.

1027
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:06,198
My brother's writing out
an American Express traveler's cheque

1028
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:07,908
to cover the extensive bar tab.

1029
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:09,584
Well, I sure would appreciate it.

1030
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,749
I'd better check up,
see how he's doing.

1031
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:13,171
See, I have to sign it, too.

1032
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:17,376
I usually sit in the car and write it out
on the, uh, glove compartment lid.

1033
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:18,668
Okay?

1034
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:23,799
I need a pencil.

1035
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:36,228
Were them guys from the union?

1036
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,688
Union?
What the hell union?

1037
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:40,532
Those boys skipped out of here
owing me a lot of money for beer.

1038
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:43,527
What the hell are you guys
all dressed up for?

1039
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:45,112
We're The Good Ole Boys!

1040
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:47,785
You're The Good Ole Boys?

1041
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:09,682
A.F.M. Shit!

1042
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:31,283
Our Lady of Blessed Acceleration,
don't fail me now!

1043
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:46,594
I don't believe it!

1044
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:50,677
It's that shitbox Dodge again.
The bastards are ours now!

1045
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:13,458
Holy shit!

1046
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:26,555
Boys, you're in big trouble.

1047
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:31,805
Maury, you owe me.

1048
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:34,559
We'll play anywhere,
anytime, for anybody.

1049
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:35,639
Put us in, uh,
the Double Up Lounge,

1050
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:38,516
or the Morgan Park Theater,
or the Crystal.

1051
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,149
We always knocked them
dead in those joints.

1052
01:30:41,728 --> 01:30:44,402
Discos.
They're all discos.

1053
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:48,777
Singles.
Mixed singles, gay singles.

1054
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:53,035
Those people like to tumble and carry on.
They like to dance with each other.

1055
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:54,457
We are a dance band.

1056
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:57,328
I don't know, boys.
I just don't know.

1057
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:01,089
Times have changed,
you know what I mean?

1058
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:03,291
What are you guys gonna do?
The same act?

1059
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:05,214
You wear the same farchadat suits.

1060
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,341
You'll scare people away.

1061
01:31:08,254 --> 01:31:12,718
Don't you ever wear blue jeans or jumpsuits
like Wayne Cochran and the C.C. Riders?

1062
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:14,769
You gotta come through for us.

1063
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:17,647
We need $5,000, fast.

1064
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:20,688
$5,000?

1065
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:23,278
Who do you think you are?
The Beatles?

1066
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:26,990
You know the size hall you gotta
work to take in that kind of money?

1067
01:31:27,107 --> 01:31:29,610
We'll fill any hall in the country.

1068
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:34,163
You guys familiar with
the Palace Hotel ballroom?

1069
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:36,499
Never heard of it.

1070
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:38,001
Nice place up north.

1071
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:41,330
Built in the '40s on Lake Wazapamani.

1072
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:43,624
That seats 5,000.

1073
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:46,130
You guys fill that place,
you can make $5,000, easy.

1074
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:47,677
Book us for tomorrow night.

1075
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,971
Hold it!
Tomorrow night?

1076
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:52,720
A gig like that, you gotta
prepare the proper exploitation.

1077
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:55,845
I know about that stuff.
I been exploited all my life.

1078
01:31:55,969 --> 01:31:59,143
Forget it. There's no way with you guys.
Forget about it.

1079
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:04,774
Say, how's Mrs. Sline?

1080
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:07,652
I might have some information
she'd like to know.

1081
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,737
You blackmailing me?

1082
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:17,036
If you wanna put it that way.
Maury, we need this gig!

1083
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:19,000
We're on a mission from God.

1084
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:26,041
You get us the hall, and I guarantee
we'll pack them in from miles around.

1085
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,713
What do you say?

1086
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:31,388
Okay. I'll get you the Palace Hotel.

1087
01:32:32,505 --> 01:32:33,848
I'll print up showbills.
I'll make

1088
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:35,971
the place look real pretty, okay?

1089
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:38,850
I don't think you guys
are gonna gross dollar one.

1090
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:42,516
But if you do, I want a
taste of the gate, okay?

1091
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,726
Thanks, Maury.
Let's go, boys!

1092
01:32:52,317 --> 01:32:53,819
Listen,

1093
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:56,496
you boys heard me talk about Jake and Elwood.

1094
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:58,991
Well, they used to live here,
just like you.

1095
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:01,748
And I used to sing to them,
just like with you.

1096
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:02,873
Tonight,

1097
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:05,421
Jake and Elwood are
going out to sing and play

1098
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:07,499
to raise money to help you children.

1099
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:09,755
Your lazy butts are in this, too!

1100
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:12,008
So get up on that wagon.

1101
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:15,097
We're going up north
to put the word in the streets.

Rhythm and Blues Revue,

1131
01:35:02,071 --> 01:35:04,199
for your dancing pleasure.

1132
01:35:05,617 --> 01:35:08,791
And it's ladies' night tonight

1133
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:10,793
at the Palace Hotel ballroom.

1134
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:22,471
"Tonight only, the Blues Brothers,

1135
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,393
"genuine Rhythm and Blues Show and Revue.

1136
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:28,060
"Palace Hotel ballroom.
Tonight only. "

1137
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:30,897
How we doing?

1138
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:36,653
So far we covered Lake, McHenry

1139
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,733
and part of DuPage County.

1140
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:41,494
Good.
Let's get to the gig.

1141
01:35:43,696 --> 01:35:45,573
What is it?

1142
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:47,743
We're out of gas.

1143
01:35:49,994 --> 01:35:51,712
Oh, shit.

1144
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:17,363
Wow, a classic.
What a room!

1145
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:19,357
This place is gonna swing tonight.

1146
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,363
It's a fucking barn.
We'll never fill it.

1147
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:25,863
We've gotta fill this hall tonight.
A lot of young children are depending on it.

1148
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:28,075
Young children?
Why, what do you mean?

1149
01:36:28,533 --> 01:36:32,208
Jake and Elwood are donating the
band's share of the door money

1150
01:36:32,412 --> 01:36:36,383
to pay the taxes on the Saint
Helen's Orphanage in Calumet City.

1151
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:37,963
What?

1152
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:40,549
We're out of gas.
Yep.

1153
01:36:40,962 --> 01:36:42,464
Mind if we fill her up?

1154
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:45,091
Nope.
I said we're out of gas.

1155
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:48,595
Tanker truck's late.
Should have been here two hours ago.

1156
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:51,227
Uh, it's always late on Thursdays.

1157
01:36:53,766 --> 01:36:55,734
I guess we'll have to wait.

1158
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,027
Yeah.

1159
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:21,885
Excuse me, sir.

1160
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:28,267
Yes, you. Could you fill it up with premium,
please, and check under the hood?

1161
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:32,267
Sure.

1162
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:34,265
You, uh, want I should, uh,

1163
01:37:34,349 --> 01:37:36,101
wash the dead bugs off the windshield?

1164
01:37:37,143 --> 01:37:39,066
Oh, no. Don't worry.
I'm in kind of a hurry.

1165
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,123
Where in the hell are they?

1166
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:55,787
So, uh, maybe you'd like to come by
and see the show.

1167
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,372
Oh, um, I'm awfully sorry,

1168
01:37:57,455 --> 01:37:59,799
but I do have a prior dinner engagement.

1169
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:10,017
Thanks, Marvin.

1170
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:16,524
Debbie, get me Troopers Daniel and Mount.

1171
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:26,159
I don't see those Blues Brothers.

1172
01:38:26,734 --> 01:38:27,986
We'll wait.

1173
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:32,532
Okay, you're all set.

1174
01:38:32,615 --> 01:38:35,915
That'll be, uh, $94.

1175
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,003
Here's $95.
Thank you, Elwood.

1176
01:38:41,124 --> 01:38:44,344
Okay.
And that's $1 change.

1177
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:45,921
Oh, keep the change.

1178
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:47,755
Oh, thanks.

1179
01:38:49,841 --> 01:38:53,266
Uh, so, look.
Uh, if your date

1180
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,847
don't work out tonight for any reason,

1181
01:38:56,597 --> 01:39:00,272
there's a motel up on the interstate.

1182
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:04,026
Uh, maybe we could,
say, uh, meet

1183
01:39:04,647 --> 01:39:06,695
around, uh, midnight?

1184
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:10,449
I'll think about it,
Elwood, okay?

1185
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:13,948
Bye.

1186
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:30,973
Son of a bitch!

1187
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:33,051
Come on!

1188
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:08,962
We're really late.
You better step on it, man.

1189
01:40:09,045 --> 01:40:10,171
Yeah.

1190
01:40:18,471 --> 01:40:21,600
I always like to perform for angry mobs.

1191
01:40:21,933 --> 01:40:23,355
You can't quit now.

1192
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:25,186
What can they be doing?

1193
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:44,292
My head hurts.

1194
01:40:45,665 --> 01:40:47,542
That Night Train's a mean wine.

1195
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:49,548
You'd better get bright!
We got a show to do.

1196
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:52,471
Then we gotta figure out some
way to collect that gate money,

1197
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:54,641
get it to the Cook County
Assessor's office

1198
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:56,592
as soon as they open in the morning.

1199
01:41:04,433 --> 01:41:08,939
We want the show!

1200
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:19,453
Gentlemen,
I'm leaving.

1201
01:41:20,408 --> 01:41:21,830
Man, we were so close.

1202
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:24,003
Hey, you guys know Minnie The Moocher?

1203
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:26,422
I knew a hooker once named Minnie Mazola.

1204
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:28,966
No! The song Minnie the Moocher.

1205
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:30,167
Yeah. So what?

1206
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:31,423
Hit it!

1207
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:04,707
Hey folks here's a story 'bout

1208
01:42:04,785 --> 01:42:07,163
Minnie the Moocher

1209
01:42:07,496 --> 01:42:12,377
She was a low-down hoochie coocher

1210
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:16,385
She was the roughest toughest frail

1211
01:42:16,464 --> 01:42:19,138
But Minnie had a heart

1212
01:42:19,216 --> 01:42:20,968
As big as a whale

1213
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:45,502
She messed around with a bloke named Smokey

1214
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:50,005
She loved him though he was cokey

1215
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:54,840
He took her down to Chinatown

1216
01:42:55,169 --> 01:42:59,845
And he showed her how
to kick the gong around

1217
01:43:41,424 --> 01:43:45,054
She had a dream about the King of Sweden

1218
01:43:46,262 --> 01:43:50,142
He gave her things that she was needin'

1219
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:54,987
He gave her a home built of gold and steel

1220
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:59,363
A diamond car with the platinum wheels

1221
01:44:57,875 --> 01:45:00,549
This is glue.
Strong stuff.

1222
01:45:08,344 --> 01:45:10,062
What the hell
are you doing?

1223
01:45:10,346 --> 01:45:12,599
This can is from a surplus disposal run.

1224
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:14,524
Fifteen overcharged ounces

1225
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:18,230
of pure uncompounded isoproponyl
butane monosulphide.

1226
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:20,986
When combined with oxygen
and a little heat

1227
01:45:21,357 --> 01:45:23,155
it will cause a rapid expansion.

1228
01:45:50,594 --> 01:45:54,644
Poor Min, poor Min

1229
01:45:54,723 --> 01:45:56,691
Poor Min

1230
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,568
Okay, let's take them!
Wait a minute.

1231
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:42,396
I've never even heard these
boys sing, all right?

1232
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:45,115
All right.

1233
01:46:45,357 --> 01:46:47,109
They're not going no place.

1234
01:46:47,610 --> 01:46:50,739
All right, cover all exits!
Let's go! Come on! Hurry up!

1235
01:46:53,407 --> 01:46:54,750
Move it!

1236
01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:16,931
Who wants an Orange Whip?

1237
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:18,937
Orange Whip?
Orange Whip?

1238
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:21,318
Three Orange Whips.

1239
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:41,671
Excuse us.

1240
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,134
Good evening, ladies.

1241
01:48:21,286 --> 01:48:23,630
One, two. One, two, three, four.

1242
01:48:47,438 --> 01:48:48,860
Now, ladies and gentlemen

1243
01:48:48,939 --> 01:48:52,364
it is the distinct pleasure of
the management to present to you

1244
01:48:52,443 --> 01:48:55,447
the evening's star attraction.

1245
01:48:55,529 --> 01:48:59,955
Here they are, back after their
exclusive three-year tour

1246
01:49:00,034 --> 01:49:04,005
of Europe, Scandinavia and the Subcontinent.

1247
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:07,834
Won't you welcome, from
Calumet City, Illinois,

1248
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:13,089
the show band of Joliet
Jake and Elwood Blues.

1249
01:49:13,505 --> 01:49:16,054
The Blues Brothers!

1250
01:49:52,753 --> 01:49:55,006
One, two.
One, two, three, four.

1251
01:50:05,682 --> 01:50:08,606
We're so glad to see so many of
you lovely people here tonight.

1252
01:50:08,685 --> 01:50:11,359
We'd especially like to welcome
all the representatives

1253
01:50:11,438 --> 01:50:14,820
of Illinois' law enforcement community,
who have chosen to join us here

1254
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:16,868
in the Palace Hotel ballroom at this time.

1255
01:50:16,944 --> 01:50:18,946
We certainly hope you all enjoy the show.

1256
01:50:19,029 --> 01:50:21,031
And remember that no matter who you are

1257
01:50:21,115 --> 01:50:23,584
and what you do to live,
thrive and survive

1258
01:50:23,659 --> 01:50:26,458
there're still some things
that make us all the same.

1259
01:50:26,537 --> 01:50:30,713
You. Me. Them.
Everybody.

1260
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:31,792
Everybody.

1261
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:34,549
Everybody

1262
01:50:35,003 --> 01:50:37,552
Needs somebody

1263
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:39,804
Everybody

1264
01:50:39,883 --> 01:50:43,103
Needs somebody to love

1265
01:50:44,138 --> 01:50:46,641
Someone to love

1266
01:50:46,723 --> 01:50:49,272
Sweetheart to miss

1267
01:50:49,351 --> 01:50:51,479
Sugar to kiss

1268
01:50:51,562 --> 01:50:53,690
I need you
I need you

1269
01:50:53,856 --> 01:50:56,154
I need you, you, you

1270
01:50:56,525 --> 01:50:58,573
I need you, you, you

1271
01:50:58,986 --> 01:50:59,987
In the morning

1272
01:51:00,112 --> 01:51:01,159
You

1273
01:51:01,238 --> 01:51:02,410
When my soul's on fire

1274
01:51:02,531 --> 01:51:03,748
You

1275
01:51:04,992 --> 01:51:07,336
Sometimes I feel

1276
01:51:07,786 --> 01:51:09,914
I feel a little sad inside

1277
01:51:09,997 --> 01:51:11,874
When my baby mistreats me

1278
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:15,507
I never; never find a
place to hide I need you

1279
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:37,695
Sometimes I feel

1280
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:39,868
I feel a little sad inside

1281
01:51:39,943 --> 01:51:42,196
When my baby mistreats me

1282
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:46,455
I never never find a
place to hide I need you

1283
01:51:54,917 --> 01:51:57,466
People, when you do find
that special somebody,

1284
01:51:57,544 --> 01:51:59,592
you gotta hold that man,
hold that woman,

1285
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:01,639
love him, please him,
squeeze her, please her!

1286
01:52:01,715 --> 01:52:03,809
Signify your feelings
with every gentle caress

1287
01:52:03,884 --> 01:52:06,478
because it's so important
to have that special somebody

1288
01:52:06,553 --> 01:52:08,476
to hold, to kiss,
to miss,

1289
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:10,228
to squeeze and please!

1290
01:52:10,307 --> 01:52:14,653
Everybody needs somebody

1291
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:17,151
Everybody

1292
01:52:17,231 --> 01:52:20,075
Needs somebody to love

1293
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:22,573
Someone to love

1294
01:52:23,737 --> 01:52:26,081
Sweetheart to miss

1295
01:52:26,156 --> 01:52:28,409
Sugar to kiss

1296
01:52:28,492 --> 01:52:30,745
I need you

1297
01:52:38,418 --> 01:52:40,512
In the morning

1298
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:42,681
When my soul's on fire

1299
01:52:43,632 --> 01:52:47,353
When there ain't no
one around I need you

1300
01:52:48,303 --> 01:52:55,778
I need you, you, you

1301
01:53:03,527 --> 01:53:04,949
I need you

1302
01:53:19,459 --> 01:53:21,928
Thank you.
That was for Wilson Pickett.

1303
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:27,934
This is dedicated to the
late, great Magic Sam.

1304
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:31,810
One, two.
One, two, three, four.

1305
01:53:39,146 --> 01:53:43,652
Come on baby don't you wanna go

1306
01:53:46,403 --> 01:53:50,829
Come on baby don't you wanna go

1307
01:53:54,202 --> 01:53:57,001
Back to that same old place

1308
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,424
Sweet home Chicago

1309
01:54:02,753 --> 01:54:04,676
Six and three is nine

1310
01:54:04,755 --> 01:54:06,507
Nine and nine is 18

1311
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:09,844
Look there brother baby
and you'll see what I seen

1312
01:54:11,595 --> 01:54:14,599
Baby, don't you wanna go

1313
01:54:17,059 --> 01:54:19,778
Back to that same old place

1314
01:54:19,853 --> 01:54:22,572
Sweet home Chicago

1315
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:27,028
Come on

1316
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:30,159
Baby, don't you wanna go

1317
01:54:32,574 --> 01:54:34,747
Come on

1318
01:54:34,826 --> 01:54:36,999
Baby, don't you wanna go

1319
01:54:39,915 --> 01:54:42,759
Back to that same old place

1320
01:54:42,834 --> 01:54:45,713
Sweet home Chicago

1321
01:55:15,617 --> 01:55:16,664
The Mafia's after us now.

1322
01:55:16,743 --> 01:55:17,710
You guys were hot!

1323
01:55:17,786 --> 01:55:20,835
You were great! Insane.
I've got to record you.

1324
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:22,086
Bullshit.

1325
01:55:22,165 --> 01:55:23,917
Bullshit?
I don't bullshit.

1326
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,843
I'm president of Clarion Records

1327
01:55:25,919 --> 01:55:28,297
the largest recording company
on the Eastern seaboard.

1328
01:55:28,422 --> 01:55:29,423
So what?

1329
01:55:29,506 --> 01:55:30,849
Here's $10,000.

1330
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:33,768
An advance on your first recording session.

1331
01:55:36,346 --> 01:55:37,598
Is it a deal?

1332
01:55:38,432 --> 01:55:40,685
Yeah. Sure, it's a deal.

1333
01:55:40,767 --> 01:55:43,771
Yeah. Sure, it's a deal!

1334
01:55:43,854 --> 01:55:46,690
Listen, all these cops out here,
they're sort of waiting for us.

1335
01:55:46,773 --> 01:55:50,027
We gotta get out with nobody seeing us.
You know a back door out?

1336
01:55:50,110 --> 01:55:53,284
Sure. I used to be head bouncer
here back in the '70s.

1337
01:55:53,613 --> 01:55:57,122
There's an electrical service duct
right behind your drummer's riser.

1338
01:55:57,242 --> 01:55:59,165
Do us a favor.

1339
01:55:59,286 --> 01:56:00,458
Take $1,400

1340
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:03,590
and give it to Ray's Music
Exchange in Calumet City

1341
01:56:03,665 --> 01:56:05,338
and give the rest to the band.

1342
01:56:05,459 --> 01:56:07,086
You got it.
Thanks.

1343
01:56:26,438 --> 01:56:28,691
Me and Elwood are gonna make a break for it.

1344
01:56:28,815 --> 01:56:30,488
You and the band keep playing.

1345
01:56:46,833 --> 01:56:48,005
Something's wrong.

1346
01:56:49,336 --> 01:56:50,428
Where's Jake?

1347
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,934
Where'd those Blues Brothers go?

1348
01:57:09,105 --> 01:57:11,278
I sure hope this thing leads someplace.

1349
01:57:11,358 --> 01:57:13,611
Elwood,
we're gone, man.

1350
01:57:22,661 --> 01:57:25,039
Who is that girl?

1351
01:57:25,205 --> 01:57:26,957
Well, Jake.

1352
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:30,385
You look just fine down there

1353
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:32,679
slithering in the mud like vermin.

1354
01:57:33,547 --> 01:57:35,549
No problem.

1355
01:57:35,715 --> 01:57:38,309
You're not gonna get away from me this time.

1356
01:57:43,306 --> 01:57:45,058
Check that out!
Let's go!

1357
01:58:04,369 --> 01:58:06,747
It's good to see you,
sweetheart!

1358
01:58:08,164 --> 01:58:10,166
You contemptable pig.

1359
01:58:11,835 --> 01:58:14,509
I remained celibate for you.

1360
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:18,054
I stood at the back of a cathedral

1361
01:58:18,216 --> 01:58:20,639
waiting,
in celibacy, for you

1362
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:23,973
with 300 friends and relatives in attendance.

1363
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:27,813
My uncle hired the best
Romanian caterers in the state.

1364
01:58:27,892 --> 01:58:30,395
To obtain the seven limousines
for the wedding party

1365
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:33,819
my father used up his last favors
with Mad Pete Trullo.

1366
01:58:34,566 --> 01:58:37,490
So for me, for my mother,

1367
01:58:37,652 --> 01:58:39,700
my grandmother,
my father, my uncle,

1368
01:58:39,779 --> 01:58:41,201
and for the common good

1369
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:44,869
I must now kill you and your brother.

1370
01:58:58,923 --> 01:59:01,972
Oh, please don't kill us!

1371
01:59:02,052 --> 01:59:03,679
Please, please, don't kill us.

1372
01:59:03,762 --> 01:59:05,184
You know I love you, baby!

1373
01:59:05,263 --> 01:59:07,436
I wouldn't leave you!
It wasn't my fault!

1374
01:59:07,515 --> 01:59:09,358
You miserable slug!

1375
01:59:09,434 --> 01:59:11,687
You think you can talk
your way out of this?

1376
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:12,942
You betrayed me!

1377
01:59:13,355 --> 01:59:15,949
No, I didn't. Honest!

1378
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:17,946
I ran out of gas!

1379
01:59:18,026 --> 01:59:19,369
I had a flat tire!

1380
01:59:19,444 --> 01:59:21,117
I didn't have enough money for cab fare!

1381
01:59:21,237 --> 01:59:23,285
My tux didn't come
back from the cleaners.

1382
01:59:23,365 --> 01:59:25,367
And old friend came in from out of town!

1383
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:27,293
Someone stole my car!

1384
01:59:27,369 --> 01:59:29,713
There was an earthquake!
A terrible flood!

1385
01:59:29,788 --> 01:59:32,883
Locusts! It wasn't my fault,

1386
01:59:32,957 --> 01:59:35,085
I swear to God!

1387
01:59:53,895 --> 01:59:55,112
Oh, Jake...

1388
01:59:58,066 --> 01:59:59,534
Jake, honey.

1389
02:00:12,622 --> 02:00:13,794
Let's go.

1390
02:00:18,253 --> 02:00:19,630
Take it easy.

1391
02:00:34,728 --> 02:00:36,856
You're going to totally
demolish the cars.

1392
02:00:39,774 --> 02:00:43,904
You want to maybe consider going
after the Blues Brothers?

1393
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:56,424
It's 106 miles to Chicago.

1394
02:00:56,541 --> 02:00:59,340
We got a full tank of gas,
half a pack of cigarettes,

1395
02:00:59,419 --> 02:01:02,093
it's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses.

1396
02:01:02,213 --> 02:01:03,260
Hit it.

1397
02:01:47,634 --> 02:01:51,264
Shit, man. Can't this damn
thing go any faster than this?

1398
02:01:51,596 --> 02:01:53,849
Bob, I think I've got a little problem.

1399
02:01:56,309 --> 02:01:58,277
Goddamn, boy.

1400
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:52,783
Don't you say a fucking word.

1401
02:03:33,406 --> 02:03:35,329
All units,
we have a signal 10-79.

1402
02:03:35,408 --> 02:03:36,830
Officers are in pursuit:

1403
02:03:36,910 --> 02:03:40,414
a black-and-white 1974 Dodge sedan

1404
02:03:40,496 --> 02:03:42,419
southbound on 47.

1405
02:03:43,499 --> 02:03:46,002
Respond to signal 10-79.

1406
02:03:46,085 --> 02:03:49,259
Occupants of vehicle:
one Joliet Jake Blues,

1407
02:03:49,339 --> 02:03:51,387
one Elwood Blues.

1408
02:03:51,507 --> 02:03:53,635
Considered extremely dangerous.
Gruppenfhrer!

1409
02:04:03,978 --> 02:04:05,821
Hey, Jake,

1410
02:04:07,941 --> 02:04:09,614
I gotta pull over.

1411
02:04:18,493 --> 02:04:20,996
Southbound on State Highway 47.

1412
02:04:46,187 --> 02:04:48,656
Hi! Wanna hand me the mike?

1413
02:04:49,482 --> 02:04:51,109
Thanks a lot.

1414
02:04:51,526 --> 02:04:54,450
This is car...
What number are we?

1415
02:04:55,154 --> 02:04:56,781
55.

1416
02:04:56,990 --> 02:05:00,244
Car 55.
We're in a truck.

1417
02:05:07,834 --> 02:05:10,678
Signal 10-79 still engaged.

1418
02:05:10,795 --> 02:05:14,425
Vehicle traveling southbound
approaching Chicago city limits.

1419
02:05:14,507 --> 02:05:19,145
Commander advises will contact Chicago
precincts for a local intercept.

1420
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:20,688
Maintain pursuit.

1421
02:05:27,395 --> 02:05:33,535
Use of unnecessary violence in the apprehension
of the Blues Brothers has been approved.

1422
02:06:01,512 --> 02:06:04,857
Well, this is definitely Lower Wacker Drive.

1423
02:06:04,932 --> 02:06:07,685
If my estimations are correct

1424
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:09,483
we should be very close to

1425
02:06:09,562 --> 02:06:12,361
the Honorable Richard J. Daley Plaza.

1426
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:14,067
That's where they got that Picasso.

1427
02:06:14,150 --> 02:06:15,197
Yep.

1428
02:08:48,554 --> 02:08:50,522
Son of a bitch!

1429
02:08:57,813 --> 02:08:59,486
There they are.

1430
02:09:39,855 --> 02:09:41,778
Oh, no!
What the fuck was that?

1431
02:09:41,857 --> 02:09:44,280
The motor.
it's thrown a rod.

1432
02:09:44,360 --> 02:09:45,361
Is that serious?

1433
02:09:45,444 --> 02:09:46,445
Yep.

1434
02:10:15,433 --> 02:10:16,650
Faster.

1435
02:10:23,607 --> 02:10:24,984
Faster.

1436
02:11:10,363 --> 02:11:11,580
Holy shit!

1437
02:11:32,718 --> 02:11:34,345
I've always loved you.

1438
02:11:46,565 --> 02:11:47,532
There it is!

1439
02:12:31,944 --> 02:12:33,662
Come on!

1440
02:13:15,279 --> 02:13:19,204
Sir, where's the office of
the Assessor of Cook County?

1441
02:13:19,783 --> 02:13:21,501
Down the hall,
turn right.

1442
02:13:21,619 --> 02:13:23,371
Take the elevator to 1102.

1443
02:13:23,454 --> 02:13:24,797
Thank you, sir.

1444
02:15:44,803 --> 02:15:46,976
Excuse me.
Did you see two guys come in here

1445
02:15:47,056 --> 02:15:49,400
with black suits and hats,
one carrying a briefcase?

1446
02:15:49,475 --> 02:15:51,477
Yeah, I just sent them down there.

1447
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:52,777
Thank you.

1448
02:16:11,830 --> 02:16:13,798
Hold the door.

1449
02:16:42,736 --> 02:16:44,204
Let's go.

1450
02:17:53,682 --> 02:17:55,605
