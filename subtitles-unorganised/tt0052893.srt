1
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:34,598
<i>You saw nothing in Hiroshima.
Nothing.</i>

2
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:36,497
<i>I saw everything.</i>

3
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:39,895
<i>I saw the hospital-- I'm sure of it.</i>

4
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,026
<i>The hospital in Hiroshima exists.</i>

5
00:03:45,797 --> 00:03:49,988
<i>How could I not have seen it?</i>

6
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,678
<i>You didn't see the hospital
in Hiroshima.</i>

7
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,979
<i>You saw nothing in Hiroshima.</i>

8
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:26,206
<i>Four times at the museum.</i>

9
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:28,342
<i>What museum in Hiroshima?</i>

10
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:46,223
<i>Four times at the museum in Hiroshima.</i>

11
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:48,459
<i>I saw people walking around.</i>

12
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:53,555
<i>People walk around, lost in thought,
among the photographs,</i>

13
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:57,856
<i>the reconstructions,
for lack of anything else.</i>

14
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:01,258
<i>The photographs, the photographs,</i>

15
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:05,157
<i>the reconstructions,
for lack of anything else.</i>

16
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:09,787
<i>The explanations,
for lack of anything else.</i>

17
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:15,682
<i>Four times at the museum in Hiroshima.</i>

18
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:19,348
<i>I watched the people.</i>

19
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,872
<i>I myself, lost in thought,
looked at the scorched metal.</i>

20
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:27,937
<i>The twisted metal.</i>

21
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:31,469
<i>Metal made as vulnerable as flesh.</i>

22
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,410
<i>I saw the bouquet of bottle caps.</i>

23
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,567
<i>Who would have thought?</i>

24
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,540
<i>Human flesh, suspended,
as if still alive,</i>

25
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:43,796
<i>its agony still fresh.</i>

26
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:48,268
<i>Stones. Charred stones.
Shattered stones.</i>

27
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:51,032
<i>Anonymous masses of hair</i>

28
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:55,463
<i>that the women of Hiroshima,
upon waking in the morning,</i>

29
00:05:55,536 --> 00:05:57,398
<i>would find had fallen out.</i>

30
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,427
<i>I was hot in Peace Square.</i>

31
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:18,125
<i>10,000 degrees in Peace Square.</i>

32
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:20,448
<i>I know it.</i>

33
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:25,012
<i>The temperature of the sun
in Peace Square.</i>

34
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:27,177
<i>How could you not know it?</i>

35
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,353
<i>The grass. It's quite simple.</i>

36
00:06:29,553 --> 00:06:32,983
<i>You saw nothing in Hiroshima.
Nothing.</i>

37
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:46,174
<i>The reconstructions were
as authentic as possible.</i>

38
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:51,673
<i>The films were
as authentic as possible.</i>

39
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,366
<i>The illusion,
quite simply, is so perfect</i>

40
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,837
<i>that tourists weep.</i>

41
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:02,870
<i>One can always scoff,</i>

42
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:06,399
<i>but what else can a tourist do</i>

43
00:07:06,503 --> 00:07:09,331
<i>but weep?</i>

44
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:49,875
<i>I've always wept over Hiroshima's fate.</i>

45
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,146
<i>Always.</i>

46
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:53,304
<i>No.</i>

47
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:56,970
<i>What was there for you to weep over?</i>

48
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:17,498
<i>I saw the newsreels.</i>

49
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:21,427
<i>On the second day,
history tells us-- I'm not making it up--</i>

50
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,796
<i>from the second day on,</i>

51
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:28,091
<i>certain species of animals
crawled from the depths of the earth,</i>

52
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:30,424
<i>and from the ashes.</i>

53
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:37,023
<i>Dogs were captured on film for all time.
I saw them.</i>

54
00:08:37,394 --> 00:08:40,381
<i>I saw the newsreels.
I saw them.</i>

55
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:43,920
<i>Of the first day, the second day,</i>

56
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,616
<i>the third day.</i>

57
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,982
<i>You saw nothing.</i>

58
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:50,815
<i>Of the fifteenth day too.</i>

59
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:54,842
<i>Hiroshima was covered in flowers.</i>

60
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:59,476
<i>There were cornflowers
and gladioli everywhere,</i>

61
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:03,945
<i>morning glories and day lilies</i>

62
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:06,276
<i>born again from the ashes</i>

63
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:11,368
<i>with an extraordinary vitality
unheard of in flowers before then.</i>

64
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,868
<i>I didn't make any of it up.</i>

65
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:16,931
<i>You made it all up.</i>

66
00:09:17,842 --> 00:09:19,135
<i>None of it.</i>

67
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:22,297
<i>Just as the illusion exists in love,</i>

68
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,693
<i>the illusion you can never forget,</i>

69
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:30,259
<i>so I was under the illusion
I would never forget Hiroshima.</i>

70
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:33,192
<i>Just like with love.</i>

71
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,321
<i>I saw the survivors too,</i>

72
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:46,848
<i>and those who were in the wombs
of the women of Hiroshima.</i>

73
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,956
<i>I saw the patience,</i>

74
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:51,784
<i>the innocence,</i>

75
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,223
<i>the apparent meekness</i>

76
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,379
<i>with which the temporary survivors
of Hiroshima</i>

77
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:01,510
<i>adapted to a fate so unjust</i>

78
00:10:01,588 --> 00:10:04,882
<i>that the imagination,
usually so fertile,</i>

79
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:08,471
<i>is silent before it.</i>

80
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:26,171
<i>Listen. I know.</i>

81
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,535
<i>I know everything.
It went on.</i>

82
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:30,732
<i>Nothing. You know nothing.</i>

83
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:34,430
<i>Women risk giving birth
to deformed children, to monsters,</i>

84
00:10:34,872 --> 00:10:36,598
<i>but it goes on.</i>

85
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:39,767
<i>Men risk becoming sterile,</i>

86
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:41,801
<i>but it goes on.</i>

87
00:10:41,936 --> 00:10:46,299
<i>Rain causes panic, the rain
of ash on the waters of the Pacific.</i>

88
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:50,820
<i>The Pacific turns deadly,
and its fishermen die.</i>

89
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:52,953
<i>Food becomes an object of fear.</i>

90
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:56,120
<i>An entire city's food is thrown away.</i>

91
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:58,819
<i>The food of entire cities is buried.</i>

92
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:01,153
<i>An entire city rises up in anger.</i>

93
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,220
<i>Entire cities rise up in anger.</i>

94
00:11:06,257 --> 00:11:09,710
<i>But against whom
do they rise up in anger?</i>

95
00:11:10,155 --> 00:11:13,243
<i>The anger of entire cities,
whether they like it or not,</i>

96
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:15,478
<i>against the principle
of inequality advanced</i>

97
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:18,847
<i>by one people against another.</i>

98
00:11:19,152 --> 00:11:21,480
<i>The principle of inequality advanced</i>

99
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:25,310
<i>by certain races against other races.</i>

100
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:28,137
<i>The principle of inequality advanced</i>

101
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:31,642
<i>by certain classes against other classes.</i>

102
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:34,839
<i>Listen to me.</i>

103
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:37,100
<i>Like you, I know
what it is to forget.</i>

104
00:11:37,178 --> 00:11:40,504
<i>No, you don't know
what it is to forget.</i>

105
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:45,362
<i>Like you, I am endowed with memory.
I know what it is to forget.</i>

106
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:49,526
<i>No, you are not endowed with memory.</i>

107
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,726
<i>Like you, I too have struggled
with all my might</i>

108
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:56,228
<i>not to forget.</i>

109
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,626
<i>Like you, I forgot.</i>

110
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:07,454
<i>Like you, I longed
for a memory beyond consolation,</i>

111
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,253
<i>a memory of shadows and stone.</i>

112
00:12:11,427 --> 00:12:15,085
<i>For my part I struggled
every day with all my might</i>

113
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:18,083
<i>against the horror
of no longer understanding</i>

114
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:20,778
<i>the reason to remember.</i>

115
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:24,352
<i>Like you, I forgot.</i>

116
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:35,513
<i>Why deny the obvious necessity
of remembering?</i>

117
00:12:40,747 --> 00:12:43,505
<i>Listen to me.
I know something else.</i>

118
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:45,236
<i>It will begin again.</i>

119
00:12:45,312 --> 00:12:49,833
<i>200,000 dead and 80,000 wounded
in nine seconds.</i>

120
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:53,736
<i>Those are the official figures.
It will begin again.</i>

121
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:58,869
<i>It will be 10,000 degrees on the earth.
Ten thousand suns, people will say.</i>

122
00:12:58,938 --> 00:13:01,368
<i>The asphalt will burn.</i>

123
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:04,365
<i>Chaos will prevail.</i>

124
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:07,262
<i>An entire city will be lifted
off the ground,</i>

125
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,525
<i>then fall back to earth in ashes.</i>

126
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:17,653
<i>New vegetation rises
from the sands.</i>

127
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:22,020
<i>Four students await together,
like brothers,</i>

128
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,956
<i>a legendary death.</i>

129
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,753
<i>The seven branches of the delta estuary</i>

130
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:35,786
<i>of the river Ota</i>

131
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:40,284
<i>drain and fill at their usual hour,</i>

132
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:44,580
<i>precisely at their usual hour,</i>

133
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:48,478
<i>with fresh water rich with fish,
grey or blue,</i>

134
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:50,670
<i>depending on the season
and time of day.</i>

135
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,366
<i>People along the muddy banks
no longer watch</i>

136
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:58,373
<i>the tide slowly rise</i>

137
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:03,496
<i>in the seven branches
of the delta estuary of the river Ota.</i>

138
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:20,929
<i>I meet you.
I remember you.</i>

139
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,392
<i>Who are you?</i>

140
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:26,759
<i>You're destroying me.
You're good for me.</i>

141
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:31,056
<i>How could I know this city
was tailor-made for love?</i>

142
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:36,357
<i>How could I know
you fit my body like a glove?</i>

143
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,757
<i>I like you.</i>

144
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:40,755
<i>How unlikely.</i>

145
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,854
<i>I like you.</i>

146
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:45,619
<i>How slow all of a sudden.</i>

147
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:48,242
<i>How sweet.</i>

148
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:50,744
<i>You cannot know.</i>

149
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:55,075
<i>You're destroying me.
You're good for me.</i>

150
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:04,403
<i>You're destroying me.
You're good for me.</i>

151
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:07,670
<i>I have time.</i>

152
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,342
<i>Please, devour me.</i>

153
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:15,405
<i>Deform me
to the point of ugliness.</i>

154
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:17,900
<i>Why not you?</i>

155
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:23,560
<i>Why not you in this city
and in this night</i>

156
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:26,693
<i>so like other cities and other nights
you can hardly tell the difference?</i>

157
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:29,487
<i>I beg of you.</i>

158
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,355
You have such beautiful skin.

159
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:39,690
You!

160
00:15:40,455 --> 00:15:43,418
Yes, me. Surprised?

161
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:04,348
Are you completely Japanese or not?

162
00:16:04,726 --> 00:16:06,916
Completely. I am Japanese.

163
00:16:08,822 --> 00:16:11,613
Your eyes are green, aren't they?

164
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,073
Yes, I think they're green.

165
00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:17,864
You're like a thousand women in one.

166
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:21,464
That's because you don't know me.

167
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,263
That might not be the only reason.

168
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:30,058
I don't mind being
a thousand women in one for you.

169
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,484
Listen.

170
00:16:34,722 --> 00:16:36,448
It's 4:00.

171
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:38,613
Why?

172
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:40,714
I don't know who it is.

173
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,072
Every day he passes by at 4:00
and coughs.

174
00:16:58,428 --> 00:17:00,855
Were you here in Hiroshima?

175
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:03,885
Of course not.

176
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:07,746
That's right.
How foolish of me.

177
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:13,597
But my family was in Hiroshima.

178
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:18,096
I was off fighting the war.

179
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:21,165
Lucky for you, eh?

180
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:24,419
Yes.

181
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:27,286
Lucky for me too.

182
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,404
Why are you in Hiroshima?

183
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:38,904
A film.

184
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:40,634
A film?

185
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:43,138
I'm acting in a film.

186
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:48,823
Where were you
before you came to Hiroshima?

187
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:52,360
Paris.

188
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:54,952
And before Paris?

189
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,052
Before Paris I was in Nevers.

190
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,940
It's in the province of Nièvre.
You don't know it.

191
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:15,862
Why did you want to see
everything in Hiroshima?

192
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,786
It interested me.

193
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:22,212
I have my own idea about it.

194
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:26,151
For example, looking closely
at things is something

195
00:18:27,418 --> 00:18:28,781
that has to be learned.

196
00:18:28,885 --> 00:18:29,280
that has to be learned.

197
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,053
Would you like some coffee?

198
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:57,739
What were you dreaming about?

199
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:59,870
I don't remember. Why?

200
00:20:01,171 --> 00:20:02,931
I was watching your hands.

201
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,155
They move when you're sleep.

202
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:13,848
Maybe that happens
when you don't realize you're dreaming.

203
00:20:35,663 --> 00:20:38,284
You're a beautiful woman.
You know that?

204
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:40,220
- You think so?
- I think so.

205
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:42,815
A bit worn out, no?

206
00:20:44,685 --> 00:20:47,306
- A bit ugly.
- You don't mind?

207
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:49,876
That's what I noticed
last night at the café.

208
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:52,495
How ugly you were and--

209
00:20:52,574 --> 00:20:55,333
- And?
- And how bored you looked.

210
00:20:55,473 --> 00:20:56,960
Tell me more.

211
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:01,289
You were bored in a way
that makes a man want to know a woman.

212
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:08,976
You speak French well.

213
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,779
Don't I though!

214
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:14,345
I'm glad you finally noticed.

215
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:20,072
I hadn't noticed
that you don't speak Japanese.

216
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:28,054
Have you ever noticed people have
a way of noticing what they want?

217
00:21:30,295 --> 00:21:33,417
I noticed you. That's all.

218
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:52,860
To meet in Hiroshima.

219
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:56,684
That doesn't happen everyday.

220
00:21:57,028 --> 00:22:01,048
What did Hiroshima
mean to you in France?

221
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:06,117
The end of the war.

222
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:08,939
I mean completely.

223
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:12,310
Astonishment that they dared do it,

224
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,737
and astonishment
that they succeeded.

225
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,292
And the beginning
of an unknown fear for us as well.

226
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:23,393
And then indifference.

227
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,358
And fear of indifference as well.

228
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:28,419
Where were you?

229
00:22:29,756 --> 00:22:32,015
I had just left Nevers.

230
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,046
I was in Paris. In the street.

231
00:22:35,316 --> 00:22:39,108
That's a beautiful French word: Nevers.

232
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:44,566
A word like any other.
Just like the town.

233
00:22:53,827 --> 00:22:56,811
Have you met many Japanese
in Hiroshima?

234
00:22:57,955 --> 00:22:59,782
A few,

235
00:23:00,287 --> 00:23:02,247
but none like you.

236
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:05,645
Am I the first Japanese in your life?

237
00:23:05,746 --> 00:23:07,232
Yes.

238
00:23:08,044 --> 00:23:09,870
Hiroshima.

239
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,498
The whole world rejoiced,

240
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:17,219
and you rejoiced with it.

241
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,183
Was it a beautiful summer day in Paris?

242
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,552
I heard it was. Wasn't it?

243
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:28,849
Yes, it was a nice day.

244
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,842
- How old were you?
- Twenty. You?

245
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,330
- Twenty-two.
- The same age, really.

246
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,595
Just about.

247
00:23:45,031 --> 00:23:47,586
What do you do for work?

248
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:50,747
I'm an architect.

249
00:23:52,622 --> 00:23:55,049
And I'm also...

250
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:58,011
in politics.

251
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:00,673
Is that why you speak French so well?

252
00:24:00,877 --> 00:24:04,998
That's why.
To read about the French Revolution.

253
00:24:10,468 --> 00:24:13,191
What is this film you're in?

254
00:24:13,563 --> 00:24:15,356
It's a film about peace.

255
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,784
What else would you expect
in Hiroshima?

256
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:38,094
I'd like to see you again.

257
00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:44,180
At this time tomorrow

258
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:47,277
I'll be on my way back to France.

259
00:24:47,454 --> 00:24:49,938
Really? You didn't tell me.

260
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,608
It's true.

261
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,038
There was no point in telling you.

262
00:24:56,743 --> 00:25:00,194
That's why you let me
come up to your room last night.

263
00:25:00,306 --> 00:25:03,633
Because it was your last day
in Hiroshima.

264
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:08,556
Not at all.
The thought never crossed my mind.

265
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:13,280
When you speak, I wonder
whether you lie or tell the truth.

266
00:25:14,189 --> 00:25:17,208
I lie... and I tell the truth.

267
00:25:17,885 --> 00:25:20,710
But I have no reason to lie to you.

268
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:25,864
Tell me, do things like this
happen to you often?

269
00:25:27,074 --> 00:25:28,900
Not all that often.

270
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,225
But they happen.

271
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:35,152
I'm very fond of men.

272
00:25:37,793 --> 00:25:40,449
I have dubious morals, you know.

273
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:44,574
What do you call
having "dubious morals"?

274
00:25:45,217 --> 00:25:47,804
Being dubious
about other people's morals.

275
00:25:55,605 --> 00:25:58,034
I'd like to see you again.

276
00:25:58,302 --> 00:26:02,422
Even if your plane leaves tomorrow morning.
Even if you have dubious morals.

277
00:26:05,493 --> 00:26:07,014
Why?

278
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:09,577
Because.

279
00:26:24,004 --> 00:26:25,932
You don't want
to talk to me anymore?

280
00:26:29,831 --> 00:26:32,190
I'd like to see you again.

281
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:43,973
Where are you going in France?
Nevers?

282
00:26:44,112 --> 00:26:47,505
No, Paris.
I'm never going back to Nevers.

283
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:49,894
- Never?
- Never.

284
00:26:51,804 --> 00:26:54,731
I was never younger
than I was in Nevers.

285
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:57,427
Young in Nevers.

286
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,915
Young in Nevers.

287
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:05,508
And mad in Nevers too.

288
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:25,053
You see, Nevers
is the one city in the world --

289
00:27:25,661 --> 00:27:29,112
the one thing in the world --
I dream of most at night

290
00:27:30,222 --> 00:27:34,547
and at the same time
think about the least.

291
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:38,211
What was this madness
of yours in Nevers like?

292
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:43,528
Madness is like intelligence.

293
00:27:44,107 --> 00:27:47,795
You can't explain it.
Just like intelligence.

294
00:27:47,902 --> 00:27:51,419
It comes over you, consumes you,

295
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,821
and then you understand.

296
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:56,820
But when it's gone,
you no longer understand it at all.

297
00:27:57,022 --> 00:27:58,919
Were you full of hate?

298
00:27:58,987 --> 00:28:00,815
That was my madness.

299
00:28:00,953 --> 00:28:03,244
I was mad with hate.

300
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:08,171
I felt I could make a career of hating.

301
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:11,066
All I cared about was hating.

302
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,426
Do you understand?
- Yes.

303
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:19,126
It's true. I guess you must
understand that too.

304
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:21,982
Did it ever happen to you again?

305
00:28:24,656 --> 00:28:26,212
It's over.

306
00:28:26,354 --> 00:28:28,047
During the war?

307
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:29,706
Right after it.

308
00:28:30,948 --> 00:28:35,068
Was that one of the hardships
of life in France after the war?

309
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:38,164
You could say that.

310
00:28:38,374 --> 00:28:41,461
When did this madness of yours pass?

311
00:28:41,869 --> 00:28:45,193
It went away little by little,
and then when I had children, of course.

312
00:28:45,264 --> 00:28:46,887
What did you say?

313
00:28:47,028 --> 00:28:51,012
I said it went away little by little,
and then when I had children, of course.

314
00:28:55,551 --> 00:29:00,105
I'd like to spend a few days with you
somewhere sometime.

315
00:29:02,177 --> 00:29:03,504
Me too.

316
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,230
To see you again today
wouldn't really be "seeing you again."

317
00:29:06,304 --> 00:29:09,859
Such a short time doesn't count.
I really would like to.

318
00:29:19,255 --> 00:29:20,743
Very well.

319
00:29:24,251 --> 00:29:26,770
It's because
you know I'm leaving tomorrow.

320
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:29,500
That may be part of it.

321
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,096
But it's as good a reason
as any, isn't it?

322
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:38,930
The thought of never seeing you again
in just a few hours --

323
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:29,194
You were easy to find in Hiroshima.

324
00:30:37,062 --> 00:30:39,650
Is it a French film?

325
00:30:40,158 --> 00:30:43,709
No. International.
It's about peace.

326
00:30:43,985 --> 00:30:46,971
- Is it finished?
- It is for me.

327
00:30:47,383 --> 00:30:49,278
There are some crowd scenes
left to shoot.

328
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:55,129
There are lots of commercials
for soap.

329
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:57,668
Maybe by pressing the point --

330
00:30:57,769 --> 00:30:59,493
Yes, maybe.

331
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:03,559
Here in Hiroshima we don't
make fun of films about peace.

332
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,039
Are you tired?

333
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:27,595
No more than you.

334
00:31:29,265 --> 00:31:31,919
I've been thinking
about Nevers in France.

335
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:35,378
I've been thinking about you.

336
00:31:37,454 --> 00:31:39,542
Is your flight still tomorrow?

337
00:31:39,652 --> 00:31:41,945
- Yes.
- Without fail?

338
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:45,068
Yes. The picture is behind schedule.

339
00:31:45,378 --> 00:31:47,838
I was supposed to be in Paris
a month ago.

340
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:17,369
You give me
a tremendous desire to love.

341
00:32:19,902 --> 00:32:21,864
Always.

342
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,692
Short-lived affairs.

343
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:28,754
Me too.

344
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:40,005
It's not always this strong,
and you know it.

345
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,338
They say there's a storm coming
before nightfall.

346
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:07,185
IF ONE A-BOMB EQUALS
20,000 ORDINARY BOMBS,

347
00:33:14,848 --> 00:33:18,053
AND AN H-BOMB EQUALS
1,500 ATOMIC BOMBS,

348
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:28,994
HOW MUCH DO THE 40,000
A-BOMBS AND H-BOMBS

349
00:33:29,196 --> 00:33:32,433
CURRENTLY STOCKPILED
IN THE WORLD EQUAL?

350
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:37,316
THEY ARE A TRIBUTE
TO MAN'S SCIENTIFIC GENIUS.

351
00:33:38,023 --> 00:33:40,495
BUT UNFORTUNATELY
MAN'S POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE

352
00:33:40,564 --> 00:33:43,629
IS 100 TIMES LESS DEVELOPED
THAN HIS SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE,

353
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,459
AND FOR THAT REASON
HE FORFEITS OUR RESPECT.

354
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,988
STOP THERMONUCLEAR TESTING!

355
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,867
I don't like to think
about you leaving tomorrow.

356
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,175
I think I love you.

357
00:35:42,216 --> 00:35:45,691
You will come with me once more.

358
00:35:58,755 --> 00:36:00,789
Answer me.

359
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,033
Are you afraid?

360
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:16,643
*Sit down.

361
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:22,546
Are you all alone in Hiroshima?

362
00:37:23,017 --> 00:37:25,038
Where is your wife?

363
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:29,450
She's in Unzen, in the mountains.
I'm alone.

364
00:37:30,517 --> 00:37:32,608
When is she coming back?

365
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:34,648
In a few days.

366
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:48,613
What is your wife like?

367
00:37:49,752 --> 00:37:51,546
Beautiful.

368
00:37:51,851 --> 00:37:55,183
I'm a man
who's happy with his wife.

369
00:37:57,118 --> 00:37:58,813
So am I.

370
00:37:59,386 --> 00:38:01,910
I'm a woman
who's happy with her husband.

371
00:38:03,287 --> 00:38:05,275
It would have been too easy.

372
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:10,777
- Don't you work in the afternoon?
- Yes, a lot.

373
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,474
Mostly in the afternoon.

374
00:38:19,522 --> 00:38:21,680
This whole thing is ridiculous.

375
00:38:52,926 --> 00:38:55,357
Are you giving up your afternoon
because of me?

376
00:38:56,992 --> 00:38:59,254
Tell me.
What difference can it make?

377
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:12,082
The man you loved during the war--
was he French?

378
00:39:20,395 --> 00:39:22,418
He wasn't French.

379
00:39:32,229 --> 00:39:33,854
Yes.

380
00:39:34,928 --> 00:39:37,190
It was in Nevers.

381
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,659
At first we met in barns.

382
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:41,623
Then among the ruins.

383
00:40:44,302 --> 00:40:46,791
Then in rooms.

384
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:48,803
Like anywhere else.

385
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:10,367
Then he died.

386
00:41:18,173 --> 00:41:20,367
I was 18.

387
00:41:20,575 --> 00:41:22,834
He was 23.

388
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:07,933
Why speak of him and not others?

389
00:42:08,045 --> 00:42:09,975
- Why not?
- No! Why?

390
00:42:11,443 --> 00:42:13,875
Because of Nevers.

391
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:17,835
I'm only just beginning
to know you,

392
00:42:18,479 --> 00:42:23,104
and from the many thousands
of things in your life,

393
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,170
I choose Nevers.

394
00:42:25,313 --> 00:42:27,335
Just like that?

395
00:42:27,814 --> 00:42:30,439
- Yes.
- No, it wasn't by chance.

396
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,876
You have to tell me why.

397
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:38,679
I somehow understand
that it was there

398
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:43,079
that you were so young

399
00:42:43,781 --> 00:42:46,872
that you didn't yet belong
to anyone in particular,

400
00:42:47,016 --> 00:42:49,106
and I like that.

401
00:42:49,448 --> 00:42:51,471
No, that's not it.

402
00:42:55,148 --> 00:42:58,545
I somehow understand
that it was there

403
00:42:58,682 --> 00:43:01,773
that I almost lost you

404
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:06,509
and ran the risk
of never, ever meeting you.

405
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:10,781
I somehow understand
that it was there

406
00:43:10,983 --> 00:43:16,678
that you began to be
who you are today.

407
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:48,108
I want to leave this place!

408
00:43:53,188 --> 00:43:56,121
There's nothing left for us to do now

409
00:43:56,255 --> 00:44:00,311
but kill the hours until your departure.

410
00:44:00,856 --> 00:44:03,822
Sixteen hours until your flight.

411
00:44:06,089 --> 00:44:08,110
It's too much!

412
00:44:09,455 --> 00:44:11,513
You mustn't be afraid.

413
00:44:54,327 --> 00:44:59,850
Does "Nevers" have
any other meaning in French?

414
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:02,988
No.

415
00:45:03,562 --> 00:45:08,290
Would you have been cold
in that cellar in Nevers

416
00:45:08,362 --> 00:45:10,623
if we had loved each other?

417
00:45:10,963 --> 00:45:13,358
I would have been cold.

418
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:17,958
The cellars in Nevers are cold
both summer and winter.

419
00:45:19,564 --> 00:45:23,155
The city slopes down to a river
called the Loire.

420
00:45:24,162 --> 00:45:26,755
<i>I can't picture Nevers.</i>

421
00:45:26,897 --> 00:45:30,350
<i>Nevers. Population 40,000.</i>

422
00:45:30,765 --> 00:45:33,196
<i>Built like a capital.</i>

423
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:36,157
<i>A child can walk
all the way around it.</i>

424
00:45:36,398 --> 00:45:38,364
<i>I was born in Nevers.</i>

425
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,691
I grew up in Nevers.

426
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,156
I learned to read in Nevers.

427
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:00,421
That's where I turned 20.

428
00:46:06,462 --> 00:46:08,452
And the Loire?

429
00:46:10,863 --> 00:46:13,828
It's a completely unnavigable river.

430
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:16,051
It's always empty

431
00:46:16,763 --> 00:46:20,660
due to its irregular course
and sand bars.

432
00:46:23,861 --> 00:46:26,917
In France it's considered
a very beautiful river,

433
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,159
due mostly to its light.

434
00:46:34,494 --> 00:46:37,186
So very soft.

435
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,090
If you only knew.

436
00:46:47,192 --> 00:46:50,487
When you're in the cellar, am I dead?

437
00:46:50,992 --> 00:46:52,616
You're dead.

438
00:46:57,925 --> 00:46:59,891
How can anyone endure such pain?

439
00:47:04,258 --> 00:47:06,223
The cellar is small.

440
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,382
<i>Very small.</i>

441
00:47:11,156 --> 00:47:13,918
The Marseillaise passes
above my head.

442
00:47:15,257 --> 00:47:16,776
It's deafening!

443
00:47:23,855 --> 00:47:26,821
Hands become useless in a cellar.

444
00:47:28,755 --> 00:47:32,413
<i>They claw
and scrape away at the rocks</i>

445
00:47:33,554 --> 00:47:35,577
<i>until they bleed.</i>

446
00:47:38,287 --> 00:47:42,083
<i>It's all you can think of
to help yourself</i>

447
00:47:42,555 --> 00:47:45,281
<i>and to remember.</i>

448
00:47:47,488 --> 00:47:50,941
<i>I loved blood since I had tasted yours.</i>

449
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:11,140
The world passes by above my head,

450
00:48:11,751 --> 00:48:15,080
in place of the sky, of course.

451
00:48:16,316 --> 00:48:19,112
I watch that world pass by.

452
00:48:19,617 --> 00:48:22,706
Hurriedly during the week,

453
00:48:23,249 --> 00:48:26,145
<i>leisurely on Sundays.</i>

454
00:48:28,049 --> 00:48:30,879
<i>It doesn't know I'm in the cellar.</i>

455
00:48:31,548 --> 00:48:34,106
They pretend I'm dead.

456
00:48:34,182 --> 00:48:36,908
Dead, far from Nevers.

457
00:48:41,248 --> 00:48:45,043
<i>My father prefers it that way,
since I was disgraced.</i>

458
00:48:45,581 --> 00:48:47,977
<i>My father prefers...</i>

459
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:51,541
Do you scream?

460
00:48:52,148 --> 00:48:54,612
<i>Not in the beginning.</i>

461
00:48:54,747 --> 00:48:56,644
<i>I call your name softly.</i>

462
00:48:56,712 --> 00:48:59,506
<i>- But I'm dead.
- I call your name anyway.</i>

463
00:48:59,612 --> 00:49:01,442
<i>Even if you're dead.</i>

464
00:49:01,513 --> 00:49:04,499
<i>Then one day, I suddenly scream.</i>

465
00:49:04,545 --> 00:49:07,568
<i>Loud, like a deaf person.</i>

466
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,702
<i>That's when they put me in the cellar.</i>

467
00:49:10,812 --> 00:49:12,744
<i>To punish me.</i>

468
00:49:13,012 --> 00:49:17,466
<i>- What did you scream?
- Your German name. Just your name.</i>

469
00:49:18,645 --> 00:49:23,099
<i>The only memory I have left
is your name.</i>

470
00:49:26,643 --> 00:49:29,369
<i>I promise I won't scream anymore,</i>

471
00:49:29,576 --> 00:49:32,564
<i>so they take me back up to my room.</i>

472
00:49:35,378 --> 00:49:39,569
<i>I yearn for you so badly
I can't bear it anymore.</i>

473
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:42,869
<i>- Are you afraid?
- I'm afraid everywhere.</i>

474
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:44,930
<i>In the cellar. In my room.</i>

475
00:49:48,675 --> 00:49:52,628
- Of what?
- Of never seeing you again.

476
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,839
Ever.

477
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,497
I turn 20 one day in the cellar.

478
00:50:04,873 --> 00:50:07,669
My mother comes
and tells me I'm 20 years old.

479
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:11,596
My mother's crying.

480
00:50:11,672 --> 00:50:14,228
Do you spit in your mother's face?

481
00:50:15,872 --> 00:50:16,667
Yes.

482
00:50:23,172 --> 00:50:25,034
Drink.

483
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:35,031
Afterwards, I don't remember anymore.

484
00:50:37,336 --> 00:50:39,495
I don't remember anymore.

485
00:50:41,202 --> 00:50:47,896
You were saying the cellars
in Nevers are old and damp?

486
00:50:49,103 --> 00:50:52,692
<i>Yes, full of saltpeter.</i>

487
00:50:56,369 --> 00:50:59,265
Sometimes a cat comes in
to have a look around.

488
00:50:59,668 --> 00:51:01,691
It doesn't bother me.

489
00:51:03,734 --> 00:51:06,064
I don't remember anymore.

490
00:51:06,468 --> 00:51:08,523
Afterwards, I don't remember anymore.

491
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,157
How long?

492
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,522
<i>An eternity.</i>

493
00:52:07,628 --> 00:52:10,560
I was so young once!

494
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:25,449
At night my mother
takes me into the garden.

495
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,786
She looks at my head.

496
00:52:30,392 --> 00:52:34,083
Every night she looks
carefully at my head.

497
00:52:35,992 --> 00:52:39,252
She still doesn't dare come close.

498
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:43,948
At night I can see the town square.

499
00:52:44,557 --> 00:52:47,022
So I look.

500
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:50,315
It's huge.

501
00:52:52,324 --> 00:52:54,788
It curves in the middle.

502
00:52:56,555 --> 00:52:59,522
<i>Sleep comes only at dawn.</i>

503
00:53:01,556 --> 00:53:04,385
Does it ever rain?

504
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,819
Along the walls.

505
00:53:14,155 --> 00:53:16,417
I think of you,

506
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,749
but I no longer speak of it.

507
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,017
Madwoman!

508
00:53:25,053 --> 00:53:28,381
Madly in love with you.

509
00:53:32,886 --> 00:53:35,442
My hair grows back.

510
00:53:36,252 --> 00:53:39,706
I can feel it with my hands, day by day.

511
00:53:39,885 --> 00:53:42,147
I don't care.

512
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:45,640
<i>But still, it's growing back.</i>

513
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:51,711
Do you scream
before going down to the cellar?

514
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:55,241
No. I feel nothing.

515
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:56,916
They're young.

516
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,475
<i>They shave my head carefully
till they finish the job.</i>

517
00:54:00,749 --> 00:54:03,614
<i>They believe it's their duty.</i>

518
00:54:03,817 --> 00:54:06,475
<i>Are you ashamed for them, my love?</i>

519
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:10,573
<i>You are dead.</i>

520
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:14,038
<i>I'm too busy suffering.</i>

521
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:18,009
<i>Night falls.</i>

522
00:54:19,414 --> 00:54:23,346
I hear nothing but the sound
of the scissors on my head.

523
00:54:24,747 --> 00:54:30,906
It eases the pain
of your death a bit, like --

524
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:35,802
I don't know how else to say it --

525
00:54:36,046 --> 00:54:40,875
like for my nails... the walls... my anger.

526
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:46,343
What pain!

527
00:54:46,479 --> 00:54:48,773
What pain in my heart!

528
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:54,971
They sing the Marseillaise
all through the town.

529
00:54:56,478 --> 00:54:58,443
Night falls.

530
00:54:58,612 --> 00:55:01,202
My dead lover is an enemy of France.

531
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:06,168
Someone says she should be
paraded through town.

532
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:11,232
My father's pharmacy is closed
due to the disgrace.

533
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:15,206
I am alone.

534
00:55:15,841 --> 00:55:18,239
Some of them are laughing.

535
00:55:20,043 --> 00:55:22,666
I return home at night.

536
00:55:40,441 --> 00:55:45,269
And then one day, my love,
your eternity comes to an end.

537
00:55:53,572 --> 00:55:55,094
Yes.

538
00:55:57,172 --> 00:56:01,695
A long time.
They said it was a long time.

539
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:10,064
<i>The cathedral bells ring at 6:00
every evening, summer and winter.</i>

540
00:56:10,837 --> 00:56:14,199
<i>One day I hear them.</i>

541
00:56:14,603 --> 00:56:18,037
<i>I remember having heard them before.</i>

542
00:56:18,203 --> 00:56:21,224
<i>Before, when we were in love,</i>

543
00:56:21,302 --> 00:56:23,860
<i>when we were happy.</i>

544
00:56:25,401 --> 00:56:27,391
<i>I begin to see.</i>

545
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:31,231
<i>I remember having seen before,</i>

546
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:34,029
<i>when we were in love,</i>

547
00:56:34,202 --> 00:56:36,665
<i>when we were happy.</i>

548
00:56:38,001 --> 00:56:39,990
<i>I remember.</i>

549
00:56:40,268 --> 00:56:42,290
<i>I see the ink.</i>

550
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:44,695
<i>I see the daylight.</i>

551
00:56:45,334 --> 00:56:48,766
<i>I see my life. Your death.</i>

552
00:56:49,033 --> 00:56:52,623
<i>My life that goes on,
your death that goes on.</i>

553
00:56:53,365 --> 00:56:58,593
<i>I see that the shadows take longer
to reach the corners of the room</i>

554
00:57:00,298 --> 00:57:05,889
<i>and the corners of the cellar.</i>

555
00:57:07,266 --> 00:57:09,593
<i>About half past six.</i>

556
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,096
<i>Winter has ended.</i>

557
00:57:25,395 --> 00:57:27,293
It's horrible!

558
00:57:27,496 --> 00:57:30,256
I remember you
less and less clearly.

559
00:57:32,395 --> 00:57:34,622
Give me something to drink.

560
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:46,051
I begin to forget you.

561
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:50,984
I tremble at forgetting such love.

562
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,590
More.

563
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:15,713
We were to meet at noon
on the banks of the Loire.

564
00:58:17,158 --> 00:58:19,987
I was to leave with him.

565
00:58:21,325 --> 00:58:24,153
<i>When I arrived at noon
on the banks of the Loire,</i>

566
00:58:25,624 --> 00:58:27,590
<i>he wasn't quite dead yet.</i>

567
00:58:27,924 --> 00:58:30,821
<i>Someone had fired on him
from a garden.</i>

568
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:37,989
I stayed by his body all that day

569
00:58:39,689 --> 00:58:42,813
and all the following night.

570
00:58:46,288 --> 00:58:51,413
The next morning, they came
to get him and put him in a truck.

571
00:58:53,188 --> 00:58:56,550
Nevers was liberated that night.

572
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:05,580
The cathedral bells rang and rang.

573
00:59:08,652 --> 00:59:12,174
He grew cold beneath me,
little by little.

574
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,674
He took so long to die!

575
00:59:20,486 --> 00:59:22,541
When?

576
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,283
I don't know exactly.

577
00:59:25,985 --> 00:59:28,973
I was lying on top of him.

578
00:59:32,884 --> 00:59:36,281
The moment of his death
actually escaped me,

579
00:59:39,282 --> 00:59:44,077
because at that moment
and even afterwards --

580
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:48,205
yes, I can even say afterwards --

581
00:59:48,784 --> 00:59:52,271
I couldn't find
the slightest difference

582
00:59:52,382 --> 00:59:54,811
between his dead body and my own.

583
00:59:58,315 --> 01:00:01,541
His body and mine

584
01:00:02,813 --> 01:00:05,710
seemed to me to be
one and the same.

585
01:00:06,613 --> 01:00:10,545
You understand?
He was my first love!

586
01:00:28,945 --> 01:00:31,776
Then one day I screamed again,

587
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:34,769
<i>so they put me back in the cellar.</i>

588
01:00:48,542 --> 01:00:50,838
<i>It was warm.</i>

589
01:00:55,309 --> 01:00:59,106
<i>I think it was then
that my hatred left me.</i>

590
01:01:01,274 --> 01:01:03,536
I don't scream anymore.

591
01:01:03,876 --> 01:01:06,568
I become reasonable.

592
01:01:07,408 --> 01:01:11,338
They say, "She's become reasonable."

593
01:01:14,141 --> 01:01:17,162
One holiday evening

594
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,198
they let me out.

595
01:01:21,005 --> 01:01:24,233
<i>The banks of the Loire at dawn.</i>

596
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:27,397
<i>People cross the bridge,</i>

597
01:01:27,605 --> 01:01:30,071
<i>in greater or smaller numbers,
depending on the hour.</i>

598
01:01:30,139 --> 01:01:32,001
<i>From afar they're nobody.</i>

599
01:01:33,105 --> 01:01:35,299
<i>It isn't long after that</i>

600
01:01:35,406 --> 01:01:39,860
<i>that my mother tells me I must
leave for Paris during the night.</i>

601
01:01:40,772 --> 01:01:42,792
<i>She gives me some money.</i>

602
01:01:44,671 --> 01:01:48,296
<i>I take off for Paris
one night on a bicycle.</i>

603
01:01:49,738 --> 01:01:52,794
<i>It's summer, and the nights are warm.</i>

604
01:02:05,402 --> 01:02:07,561
<i>When I get to Paris two days later,</i>

605
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:11,167
<i>Hiroshima is in all the papers.</i>

606
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:15,855
<i>My hair has grown back
to a decent length.</i>

607
01:02:16,101 --> 01:02:18,932
<i>I'm among the crowds in the street.</i>

608
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,664
Fourteen years have passed.

609
01:02:58,362 --> 01:03:01,352
I don't even remember
his hands very well.

610
01:03:02,865 --> 01:03:05,522
I still remember the pain a little bit.

611
01:03:05,762 --> 01:03:07,592
Tonight?

612
01:03:08,063 --> 01:03:10,619
Yes, I remember it tonight.

613
01:03:12,162 --> 01:03:14,956
But one day
I will no longer remember it.

614
01:03:15,261 --> 01:03:17,250
At all.

615
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:20,319
Nothing.

616
01:03:23,128 --> 01:03:26,992
Tomorrow at this time

617
01:03:27,728 --> 01:03:31,284
I'll be thousands of miles from you.

618
01:03:33,494 --> 01:03:37,016
Does your husband know this story?

619
01:03:41,991 --> 01:03:44,288
So I'm the only one?

620
01:03:45,493 --> 01:03:47,354
Yes.

621
01:03:54,558 --> 01:03:57,956
I'm the only one who knows!

622
01:03:58,058 --> 01:03:59,955
Be quiet.

623
01:04:34,586 --> 01:04:37,280
It's so nice sometimes
to be with someone!

624
01:04:39,986 --> 01:04:41,611
Yes.

625
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,445
Tell me more.

626
01:04:51,618 --> 01:04:52,947
Tell me.

627
01:05:00,486 --> 01:05:03,918
In a few years,
when I have forgotten you,

628
01:05:04,784 --> 01:05:08,476
and other adventures like this one

629
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:13,677
will happen to me
from sheer force of habit,

630
01:05:15,151 --> 01:05:20,639
I'll remember you
as the symbol of love's forgetfulness.

631
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:24,945
I'll think of this story
as of the horror of forgetting.

632
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:27,208
I already know it.

633
01:05:32,049 --> 01:05:36,105
Don't things ever stop
at night in Hiroshima?

634
01:05:37,082 --> 01:05:39,876
No, they never stop.

635
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,444
I like that.

636
01:05:44,313 --> 01:05:47,905
Cities where there's always
someone awake,

637
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,502
day or night.

638
01:07:18,672 --> 01:07:23,534
Sometimes we have to avoid thinking
about the problems life presents.

639
01:07:24,638 --> 01:07:28,296
Otherwise we'd suffocate.

640
01:07:35,636 --> 01:07:38,066
Get away from me.

641
01:07:38,668 --> 01:07:41,567
The sun hasn't risen yet.

642
01:07:46,569 --> 01:07:50,500
We'll probably die
without ever seeing each other again.

643
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:54,764
Yes, probably.

644
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:59,166
Unless, perhaps, one day...

645
01:08:00,533 --> 01:08:02,295
a war...

646
01:08:04,534 --> 01:08:06,330
Yes.

647
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,029
A war.

648
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:01,180
<i>You think you know,</i>

649
01:11:02,148 --> 01:11:04,342
<i>but no.</i>

650
01:11:04,749 --> 01:11:06,612
<i>Never.</i>

651
01:11:14,548 --> 01:11:18,603
In her youth in Nevers
she had a German love.

652
01:11:21,047 --> 01:11:24,240
We'll go to Bavaria, my love,

653
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,203
and we'll get married.

654
01:11:29,046 --> 01:11:32,035
She never went to Bavaria.

655
01:11:34,744 --> 01:11:38,542
Let those who never went to Bavaria
dare speak to her of love!

656
01:11:40,246 --> 01:11:42,904
<i>You were not quite dead yet.</i>

657
01:11:43,578 --> 01:11:46,065
<i>I told our story.</i>

658
01:11:46,779 --> 01:11:50,041
<i>I cheated on you tonight
with that stranger.</i>

659
01:11:50,278 --> 01:11:52,970
<i>I told our story.</i>

660
01:11:53,145 --> 01:11:55,701
<i>You see, it was there to tell.</i>

661
01:11:55,910 --> 01:12:01,364
Fourteen years since I've tasted
an impossible love!

662
01:12:02,543 --> 01:12:04,509
Since Nevers.

663
01:12:04,711 --> 01:12:06,698
<i>Look how I'm forgetting you.</i>

664
01:12:07,009 --> 01:12:08,941
<i>Look how I've forgotten you.</i>

665
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:11,209
<i>Look at me.</i>

666
01:12:59,304 --> 01:13:01,530
<i>I'm going to stay in Hiroshima.</i>

667
01:13:02,404 --> 01:13:05,562
<i>With him. Every night.</i>

668
01:13:06,103 --> 01:13:08,535
<i>In Hiroshima.</i>

669
01:13:08,603 --> 01:13:12,092
<i>I'm going to stay here. Here.</i>

670
01:13:22,835 --> 01:13:25,801
Stay in Hiroshima.

671
01:13:27,268 --> 01:13:31,723
Of course I'll stay in Hiroshima

672
01:13:33,334 --> 01:13:35,301
with you.

673
01:13:38,667 --> 01:13:41,360
I'm so miserable!

674
01:13:42,467 --> 01:13:46,024
I wasn't expecting this at all.
You understand?

675
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,294
Go away!

676
01:14:01,898 --> 01:14:04,295
I couldn't possibly leave you.

677
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:32,618
Stay in Hiroshima with me.

678
01:14:40,128 --> 01:14:42,854
<i>He's going to walk towards me.</i>

679
01:14:43,528 --> 01:14:46,287
<i>He's going to take me by the shoulders.</i>

680
01:14:47,528 --> 01:14:49,652
<i>He's going to kiss me.</i>

681
01:14:50,628 --> 01:14:54,252
<i>He's going to kiss me and I'll be lost.</i>

682
01:15:57,754 --> 01:15:59,878
<i>I meet you.</i>

683
01:16:00,286 --> 01:16:02,775
<i>I remember you.</i>

684
01:16:03,653 --> 01:16:06,744
<i>This city was tailor-made for love.</i>

685
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:11,048
<i>You fit my body like a glove.</i>

686
01:16:11,886 --> 01:16:15,681
<i>Who are you? You're destroying me.</i>

687
01:16:16,385 --> 01:16:18,010
<i>I was hungry.</i>

688
01:16:18,085 --> 01:16:20,016
<i>Hungry for infidelity,</i>

689
01:16:20,285 --> 01:16:24,273
<i>for adultery, for lies,</i>

690
01:16:24,385 --> 01:16:26,179
<i>and for death.</i>

691
01:16:26,283 --> 01:16:28,045
<i>I always have been.</i>

692
01:16:31,017 --> 01:16:34,347
<i>I had no doubt
you'd cross my path one day.</i>

693
01:16:35,084 --> 01:16:40,380
<i>I waited for you calmly,
with boundless impatience.</i>

694
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:45,273
<i>Devour me.</i>

695
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:48,010
<i>Deform me to your likeness,</i>

696
01:16:48,115 --> 01:16:51,547
<i>so that no one after you
will ever again understand</i>

697
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:54,308
<i>the reason for so much desire.</i>

698
01:16:56,248 --> 01:16:59,269
<i>We'll be alone, my love.</i>

699
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,647
<i>Night will never end.</i>

700
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:05,438
<i>The day will never dawn again
on anyone.</i>

701
01:17:05,747 --> 01:17:08,735
<i>Never again.</i>

702
01:17:09,046 --> 01:17:10,842
<i>At last.</i>

703
01:17:19,779 --> 01:17:22,109
<i>You're still destroying me.</i>

704
01:17:22,912 --> 01:17:25,103
<i>You're good for me.</i>

705
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:31,172
<i>We'll mourn the departed day
in good conscience and with goodwill.</i>

706
01:17:31,678 --> 01:17:34,938
<i>There'll be nothing else for us to do</i>

707
01:17:35,277 --> 01:17:37,901
<i>but mourn the departed day.</i>

708
01:17:38,577 --> 01:17:42,634
<i>Time will pass. Only time.</i>

709
01:17:44,311 --> 01:17:46,706
<i>And a time will come</i>

710
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:53,334
<i>when we can no longer name
what it is that binds us.</i>

711
01:17:55,276 --> 01:17:58,729
<i>Its name will gradually
be erased from our memory</i>

712
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:02,970
<i>until it vanishes completely.</i>

713
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:39,127
Perhaps there's a chance you'll stay.

714
01:18:40,471 --> 01:18:42,232
You know very well.

715
01:18:42,304 --> 01:18:45,029
Staying is even more impossible
than leaving.

716
01:18:45,103 --> 01:18:46,865
A week.

717
01:18:49,372 --> 01:18:50,960
Three days.

718
01:18:51,069 --> 01:18:53,228
Time enough for what?

719
01:18:53,336 --> 01:18:55,800
To live from it? To die from it?

720
01:18:55,969 --> 01:18:58,231
Time enough to know which.

721
01:18:59,436 --> 01:19:01,663
There is no such thing.

722
01:19:02,068 --> 01:19:05,296
Neither time enough to live from it,
nor time enough to die from it.

723
01:19:08,167 --> 01:19:10,293
So I don't give a damn.

724
01:19:11,634 --> 01:19:16,328
I would prefer
you had died in Nevers.

725
01:19:17,533 --> 01:19:19,557
So would I.

726
01:19:20,835 --> 01:19:23,766
But I didn't die in Nevers.

727
01:20:15,828 --> 01:20:18,294
<i>Nevers, you whom I'd forgotten,</i>

728
01:20:18,494 --> 01:20:21,118
<i>tonight I'd like to see you again.</i>

729
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:25,652
<i>Night after night,
month after month, I set you afire</i>

730
01:20:26,593 --> 01:20:29,683
<i>while my body was ablaze
with his memory.</i>

731
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:10,415
<i>While my body is still ablaze
with the memory of you,</i>

732
01:21:11,389 --> 01:21:14,048
<i>I'd like to see Nevers once again.</i>

733
01:21:14,489 --> 01:21:16,454
<i>The Loire.</i>

734
01:21:17,189 --> 01:21:20,449
<i>Lovely poplar trees of Nièvre,</i>

735
01:21:21,188 --> 01:21:23,313
<i>I give you up to oblivion.</i>

736
01:21:24,989 --> 01:21:27,714
<i>Dime-store romance,</i>

737
01:21:28,187 --> 01:21:30,211
<i>I consign you to oblivion.</i>

738
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:36,642
<i>One night without you
and I waited for day to deliver me.</i>

739
01:21:37,785 --> 01:21:43,480
<i>One day without his eyes and she dies,
the young girl from Nevers,</i>

740
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:46,878
<i>shameless young girl from Nevers.</i>

741
01:21:47,318 --> 01:21:51,251
<i>One day without his hands
and she knows the pain of love.</i>

742
01:21:51,721 --> 01:21:53,708
<i>Silly little girl</i>

743
01:21:53,785 --> 01:21:56,046
<i>who died of love in Nevers.</i>

744
01:21:56,151 --> 01:21:58,241
<i>Little girl from Nevers
with shaven head,</i>

745
01:21:58,352 --> 01:22:00,977
<i>this evening
I relinquish you to oblivion.</i>

746
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:04,043
<i>Dime-store romance.</i>

747
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:10,338
<i>As it was with him,
forgetting will begin with your eyes.</i>

748
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:16,805
<i>Then, as with him,
it will swallow your voice.</i>

749
01:22:18,216 --> 01:22:22,841
<i>Then, as with him,
it will consume you entirely,</i>

750
01:22:22,916 --> 01:22:24,972
<i>little by little.</i>

751
01:22:25,514 --> 01:22:29,106
<i>You will become a song.</i>

752
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,167
Who is she?

753
01:22:47,813 --> 01:22:49,778
A Frenchwoman.

754
01:22:55,647 --> 01:22:57,736
What's the matter?

755
01:23:00,645 --> 01:23:03,235
She's leaving Japan in a little while.

756
01:23:04,878 --> 01:23:10,242
We're sad at having
to leave each other.

757
01:28:30,514 --> 01:28:33,410
I had to come.

758
01:29:05,176 --> 01:29:07,734
I'll forget you.
I'm forgetting you already!

759
01:29:07,811 --> 01:29:10,774
Look how I'm forgetting you!
Look at me!

760
01:29:33,906 --> 01:29:36,064
That's your name.

761
01:29:36,507 --> 01:29:39,132
Yes, that's my name.

762
01:29:41,439 --> 01:29:45,304
And your name is Nevers.

763
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,202
Nevers in France.

764
01:29:54,004 --> 01:29:56,992
THE END
