1
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,430
Katie!

2
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,630
Cora!

3
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,330
You love your sister?

4
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,130
You make any noise,
you know what happens.

5
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,130
Good morning, Estelle.

6
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,030
-How am i looking, Paul?
-That's better. That's better.

7
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,730
Morning, Mr. Edgecomb.

8
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,330
Some Danish?

9
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,729
No, just two pieces of
dry toast, Hector. Thanks.

10
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,330
Leftover's fine.

11
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,729
Dry and cold, same as always.

12
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:07,929
Cold is better.

13
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,430
Especially on those long walks.

14
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:14,129
Am i right?

15
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,130
Don't let Nurse Godzilla catch you.
She'll raise holy hell.

16
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:21,429
We're not supposed to
let you wander off.

17
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,630
Where do you go every day?
What do you do up in those hills?

18
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:30,730
Just walk.

19
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,830
I like to walk.

20
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:37,329
Try not to fall down, bust a hip.

21
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,429
I don't wanna be in no
damn search party.

22
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,629
You want this man in your life?
Explain the moral basis of that.

23
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:55,829
I've made mistakes.

24
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,029
Tony doesn't admit that
he's not a good father.

25
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:02,229
You can't ask nothing.
I have six kids myself.

26
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:06,029
Why do we always watch this stuff?

27
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:08,229
lt's interesting.

28
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:13,629
lnteresting?
Bunch of inbred trailer trash?

29
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:16,430
All they ever talk about is fucking.

30
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,329
Are you all right?

31
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:44,029
You look tired. You're not yourself.

32
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:46,929
No, I'm fine. I promise.

33
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:51,028
You're wearing yourself out
with those walks every day, I think.

34
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,128
Not that you asked me.

35
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:56,328
I just didn't sleep well, is all.

36
00:05:57,328 --> 00:06:00,629
I had a few bad dreams. lt happens.

37
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,528
I'll be fine.

38
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:13,629
If Madge doesn't care,
I certainly don't.

39
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:14,929
Neither do I.

40
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:17,829
Now, this here is worth a look.

41
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,528
I'm in heaven

42
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:27,728
And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak

43
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:31,129
And I seem to find

44
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:35,028
The happiness I seek

45
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,429
When we're out together

46
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:41,629
Dancing cheek to cheek

47
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:44,528
Heaven

48
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:47,528
I'm in heaven

49
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:51,129
And the cares that hung around me

50
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,128
Through the week

51
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:56,028
Seem to vanish

52
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:59,328
Like a gambler's lucky streak

53
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:04,729
Paul, what is it?

54
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:08,528
My God.

55
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:16,128
I've got to get out of here.

56
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:41,529
I guess sometimes the past
just catches up with you...

57
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,829
...whether you want it to or not.
lt's silly.

58
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:48,628
Was it the film? lt was, wasn't it?

59
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:54,229
I haven't spoken of these things
for a long time, Ellie.

60
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:55,828
Over 60 years.

61
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:58,828
Paul, I'm your friend.

62
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:07,228
I ever tell you that i was
a prison guard during the Depression?

63
00:08:07,428 --> 00:08:09,228
You've mentioned it.

64
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:12,628
Did i mention i was
in charge of death row?

65
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:15,028
That i supervised all the executions?

66
00:08:19,628 --> 00:08:24,128
Usually, death row is called
"The Last Mile."

67
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:26,929
We called ours "The Green Mile."

68
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:30,728
The floor was the color
of faded limes.

69
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:34,229
We had the electric chair.

70
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:36,428
"Old Sparky," we called it.

71
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:41,728
I've lived a lot of years, Ellie...

72
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:46,328
...but 1 935, that takes the prize.

73
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,428
That year, i had...

74
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:52,928
...the worst urinary infection
of my life.

75
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:56,028
lt was....

76
00:08:57,028 --> 00:08:59,329
lt was also the year of...

77
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:02,028
...John Coffey...

78
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:05,629
...and the two dead girls.

79
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:22,227
Put me through to E Block.

80
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:37,628
E Block.

81
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:41,127
Right.

82
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,528
Paul? Prisoner.

83
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,327
Christ, give me a minute.

84
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:13,128
You all right?

85
00:11:15,827 --> 00:11:19,727
For a man pissing razorblades, yeah.

86
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:36,627
You should've took the day off
to see the doctor.

87
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:39,527
With the new arrival?
You know better.

88
00:11:40,128 --> 00:11:41,627
Besides...

89
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:45,628
...it's not as bad as it was.
I think it's clearing up.

90
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:50,628
-Let's look alive, Dean.
-Yes, sir.

91
00:11:58,028 --> 00:11:59,228
Damn.

92
00:12:00,527 --> 00:12:02,527
They're riding on the axle.

93
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:13,527
What'd they do?

94
00:12:14,327 --> 00:12:15,527
They bust the springs?

95
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:25,827
Dead man!

96
00:12:26,627 --> 00:12:28,327
Dead man walking!

97
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:32,027
We got a dead man walking here!

98
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:35,327
Jesus please us,
what is he yelling about?

99
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:43,527
You might reconsider getting
in the cell with this guy.

100
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:45,127
He's enormous.

101
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,327
Can't be bigger than you.

102
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,127
Dead man!

103
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:01,427
Dead man walking!

104
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:03,127
Dead man!

105
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:04,827
Dead man walking!

106
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:08,027
Dead man walking here!

107
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:10,627
Dead man!

108
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,027
We got a dead man walking here!

109
00:13:17,627 --> 00:13:18,926
Dead man walking!

110
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:23,727
-We got a dead man walking here!
-Percy.

111
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:26,427
That's enough.

112
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:52,127
Am i gonna have any trouble
with you, big boy?

113
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,227
Can you talk?

114
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:07,827
Yes, sir, boss. I can talk.

115
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:17,227
Move your ass.

116
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:18,927
Let's go.

117
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:20,826
Come on.

118
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:27,126
Percy...

119
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:31,226
...they're moving house
in the infirmary.

120
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:34,727
Why don't you go see
if they could use some help?

121
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:37,127
They got all the men they need.

122
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:39,427
Why don't you just make sure?

123
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:46,026
I don't care where you go, as long as
it's not here at this moment.

124
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:51,627
All right.

125
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:06,826
God, you bust my finger.

126
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:09,427
I wiped that grin
off your face, didn't l?

127
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:11,927
Goddamn it, Percy,
get the hell off my block!

128
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:26,026
Fuck you, Percy.

129
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:29,527
We'll get that looked at, Del.
ln the meantime, stay quiet.

130
00:15:36,126 --> 00:15:38,827
I let Harry take those chains off you...

131
00:15:39,426 --> 00:15:40,626
...you gonna be nice?

132
00:15:57,827 --> 00:15:59,326
Your name is John Coffey.

133
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,326
Yes, sir, boss.

134
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:05,027
Like the drink,
only not spelt the same.

135
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:06,826
You can spell, can you?

136
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:10,427
Just my name, boss.

137
00:16:11,226 --> 00:16:13,527
J...O--

138
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:15,926
My name is Paul Edgecomb.

139
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:19,626
lf i'm not here, you can
ask for Mr. Terwilliger...

140
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:22,927
...Mr. Howell or Mr. Stanton.
These gentlemen right there.

141
00:16:25,426 --> 00:16:26,626
Questions?

142
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:29,726
Do you leave the light on
after bedtime?

143
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:35,926
Because i get a little scared
in the dark sometime...

144
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:39,226
...if it's a strange place.

145
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:48,127
lt stays pretty bright around here
all night long.

146
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:50,926
We keep a few lights burning
in the corridor.

147
00:16:52,026 --> 00:16:54,026
The corridor?

148
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:57,026
Right out there.

149
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:26,726
You can sit.

150
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:51,426
I couldn't help it, boss.

151
00:17:51,726 --> 00:17:55,026
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

152
00:18:01,226 --> 00:18:05,326
Take Delacroix to the infirmary,
see if those fingers are broken.

153
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:08,026
Of course they are.
I heard the bones crack.

154
00:18:08,326 --> 00:18:11,125
You hear what he was yelling
when we brought the dummy in?

155
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:13,225
How could i miss it?
The whole prison heard.

156
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,325
Goddamn Percy.

157
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,026
You'll have to answer
for sending him off the Mile.

158
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:22,226
I'll chew that food when i have to.

159
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:26,825
Right now i wanna hear about this
new inmate. Aside from how big he is.

160
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:29,725
Monstrous big. Damn.

161
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:31,925
He seems meek enough.

162
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,925
ls he retarded, you figure?

163
00:18:34,626 --> 00:18:37,026
Looks like they sent us
an imbecile to execute.

164
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:40,525
lmbecile or not,
he deserves to fry for what he done.

165
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:46,126
Make your blood curdle.

166
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:14,125
-What?! For God's sake, what?
-The girls! The girls are gone!

167
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:17,826
Papa! Papa, look! There's blood.

168
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,926
Oh, my God.

169
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:33,226
Goddamn it, woman! Get on that phone.
You tell them we headed west.

170
00:19:33,426 --> 00:19:36,526
You mind what i'm saying!
We headed west!

171
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:39,125
Central! Are you on the line?

172
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:43,525
Oh, God, please.
Somebody took my little girls.

173
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:56,625
Katie!

174
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,225
Cora!

175
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:31,725
Jesus.

176
00:20:32,725 --> 00:20:34,226
Jesus.

177
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:46,425
I'll kill you!

178
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:51,925
I'll kill you!

179
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:22,325
I couldn't help it.

180
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:27,025
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

181
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,825
Boy, you under arrest for murder.

182
00:21:35,825 --> 00:21:37,425
I interrupt?

183
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:41,625
Well, I'm just about done.

184
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:54,924
How's your pretty gal?

185
00:21:56,825 --> 00:21:59,024
Melinda's not so well, Paul.

186
00:21:59,825 --> 00:22:00,925
Not so well at all.

187
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:04,225
More headaches?

188
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:07,524
Got laid up with another one yesterday.

189
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,524
Worst one yet.

190
00:22:10,225 --> 00:22:14,225
I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg
next day or so for some tests.

191
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:18,024
Head x-rays and who knows what else.

192
00:22:18,225 --> 00:22:20,925
She is scared to death.

193
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:25,025
Truth to tell, so am l.

194
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:29,125
lf it's something they can see
on the x-ray...

195
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:31,524
...maybe they can fix it.

196
00:22:32,624 --> 00:22:33,824
Maybe.

197
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:40,024
This just came in.

198
00:22:40,224 --> 00:22:42,625
DOE on Bitterbuck.

199
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,125
You didn't come down here
to hand me a DOE.

200
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:53,225
I had an angry call from the
state capitol about 20 minutes ago.

201
00:22:53,724 --> 00:22:56,125
ls it true you ordered Percy Wetmore
off the block?

202
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:57,624
lt is.

203
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:02,024
Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul...

204
00:23:02,324 --> 00:23:06,124
...but like it or not, the wife
of the governor has only one nephew...

205
00:23:06,324 --> 00:23:08,124
...and his name is Percy Wetmore.

206
00:23:08,424 --> 00:23:10,324
Little Percy calls his aunt...

207
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:14,025
...and squeals like a schoolroom sissy.

208
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:19,724
He mention he assaulted a prisoner
this morning out of sheer petulance?

209
00:23:19,924 --> 00:23:22,625
Broke three fingers
on Eduard Delacroix's left hand.

210
00:23:22,924 --> 00:23:25,525
I didn't hear that.
I'm sure she didn't either.

211
00:23:25,725 --> 00:23:27,625
He is mean, careless and stupid...

212
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:30,524
...and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

213
00:23:30,825 --> 00:23:33,324
Sooner or later, he'll get
somebody hurt or worse.

214
00:23:33,524 --> 00:23:34,925
Stick with it, Paul.

215
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:36,824
lt may not be much longer.

216
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:41,525
I have it on good authority that Percy
has an application in at Briar Ridge.

217
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:44,425
Briar Ridge? The mental hospital.

218
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,924
Administration job.

219
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,625
Better pay.

220
00:23:49,224 --> 00:23:51,324
Then why is he still here?

221
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,524
He can get that application
pushed through.

222
00:23:57,824 --> 00:24:01,024
With his connections, he could have
any state job he wants.

223
00:24:01,824 --> 00:24:03,525
You know what i think?

224
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:09,124
I think he just wants to
see one cook up close.

225
00:24:12,024 --> 00:24:16,025
Well, he'll get his chance, then.
Won't he?

226
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:21,124
Maybe then he'll be satisfied
and move on. ln the meantime...

227
00:24:21,624 --> 00:24:23,024
...you'll keep the peace?

228
00:24:23,224 --> 00:24:24,524
Of course.

229
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,224
Of course.

230
00:24:28,924 --> 00:24:30,224
Thank you, Paul.

231
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:35,224
Hal...

232
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,824
...you give Melinda my love, okay?

233
00:24:39,324 --> 00:24:43,524
I'm sure that x-ray will turn out
to be nothing at all.

234
00:24:44,924 --> 00:24:46,124
You bet.

235
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,624
The music too loud?

236
00:25:20,624 --> 00:25:24,223
There's just this empty spot
in the bed where my husband sleeps.

237
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:30,423
He said to tell you he's having
a little trouble with that tonight.

238
00:25:33,924 --> 00:25:36,124
Worried about Melinda and Hal?

239
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:38,724
ls that what's got you up?

240
00:25:39,424 --> 00:25:41,424
Yeah, that...

241
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:44,223
...and things.

242
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:46,824
Things.

243
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:54,424
We got a new inmate today.

244
00:25:55,124 --> 00:25:57,024
Simple-minded fella.

245
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,624
Do i wanna know what he did?

246
00:26:01,724 --> 00:26:02,724
No.

247
00:26:04,123 --> 00:26:06,324
Things that happen in this world.

248
00:26:07,924 --> 00:26:10,124
lt's a wonder God allows it.

249
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:16,424
Why don't you come to bed?

250
00:26:17,224 --> 00:26:20,324
I think i have something
that'll help you sleep.

251
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:23,823
You can have all you want.

252
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:27,424
I still got something wrong
with my waterworks.

253
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:29,624
I don't wanna pass it on to you.

254
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:32,024
Have you seen Doc Bishop yet?

255
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,323
No.

256
00:26:35,523 --> 00:26:37,723
He'll want me to take sulfa tablets...

257
00:26:37,924 --> 00:26:40,424
...and i'll spend the week
puking in my office.

258
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:44,723
lt will run its course by itself.
Thank you very much for your concern.

259
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:49,023
Poor old guy.

260
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:21,224
The legislature loosened up the purse
strings enough to hire on a new guard.

261
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,223
Look again.

262
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,923
He's right...

263
00:27:33,223 --> 00:27:34,323
...there.

264
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:46,424
lt ain't normal for a mouse
to come up on people.

265
00:27:47,224 --> 00:27:49,524
-Maybe it's rabid.
-Oh, my Christ.

266
00:27:49,723 --> 00:27:52,524
-lt could be.
-Oh, the big mouse expert.

267
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:54,824
The Mouse Man.

268
00:27:55,624 --> 00:27:58,023
You see him foaming at the mouth,
Mouse Man?

269
00:27:58,223 --> 00:28:00,423
I don't see its mouth at all.

270
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:13,823
-Brutal, we'll be hip-deep in mice.
-I just wanna see what he'll do.

271
00:28:14,323 --> 00:28:16,423
ln the interest of science, like.

272
00:28:56,823 --> 00:28:58,923
He's in the damn restraint room.

273
00:28:59,123 --> 00:29:01,523
He's chewing the padding
out of the walls...

274
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:03,623
...making himself a nice little nest.

275
00:29:09,023 --> 00:29:10,523
All right.

276
00:29:11,123 --> 00:29:13,322
Let's go get the damn mouse.

277
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:26,123
Boss.

278
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,623
Saw me a mouse go by.

279
00:29:29,223 --> 00:29:31,023
Can't put anything over on you.

280
00:30:04,423 --> 00:30:06,223
You let him get past you.

281
00:30:06,423 --> 00:30:08,822
No, I did not.
I been here all the time.

282
00:30:09,022 --> 00:30:10,922
Then where the hell is he?

283
00:30:11,122 --> 00:30:12,623
Well, I don't know.

284
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:16,923
Three grown men...

285
00:30:17,723 --> 00:30:20,223
...outsmarted by a mouse.

286
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:27,622
Bright side is, all this commotion
probably scared him off for good.

287
00:30:30,223 --> 00:30:33,122
Yeah, that's the last
we'll see of him.

288
00:31:24,322 --> 00:31:27,223
You little son of a bitch.

289
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:30,722
Well, I'll be damned.

290
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:35,722
There he is, big as Billy-be-frigged.
I thought Brutal was pulling my leg.

291
00:31:36,722 --> 00:31:38,623
That's a goddamn mouse.

292
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:42,823
Brute said he was
in here last night...

293
00:31:43,022 --> 00:31:44,622
...begging for food.

294
00:31:45,122 --> 00:31:47,322
He come right on up to the desk.

295
00:31:48,522 --> 00:31:49,622
Give him some room.

296
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:52,022
See what he does.

297
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,522
He's a brave little bastard.
Gotta give him that.

298
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:37,522
Goddamn!

299
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,222
You little scurvy!

300
00:32:41,322 --> 00:32:44,322
Percy, are you crazy,
you little son of a bitch?!

301
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:46,622
I'm gonna kill you!

302
00:32:48,122 --> 00:32:50,322
I'm gonna take you out!

303
00:32:51,522 --> 00:32:55,022
You little vermin!
I'm gonna stomp your life out!

304
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:57,321
lt's just a little mouse, dumb merde.

305
00:32:57,522 --> 00:32:59,222
You ugly little piece of sh--

306
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:02,122
-Are you listening to me?
-Fuck!

307
00:33:03,422 --> 00:33:06,022
I'm gonna rip your diseased head off...

308
00:33:06,322 --> 00:33:07,722
...you little piece of shit!

309
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:31,022
Percy met your mouse.

310
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:37,822
lt's in here somewhere. I'm gonna
squish the little son of a bitch.

311
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:42,722
Percy, we already tried that.

312
00:33:46,222 --> 00:33:47,621
What'd you say?

313
00:33:47,822 --> 00:33:49,322
I said that we--

314
00:33:53,622 --> 00:33:56,322
I Knock yourself out.
Hope you nail the bastard.

315
00:34:11,122 --> 00:34:13,522
Gosh. He ain't in there, huh?

316
00:34:14,021 --> 00:34:16,821
Don't that beat the mousy band?

317
00:34:22,722 --> 00:34:25,022
You wanna think about
what you were doing?

318
00:34:25,221 --> 00:34:28,822
I was trying to get the mouse.
Are you blind?

319
00:34:29,022 --> 00:34:32,521
You also scared the living crap
out of me and Bill...

320
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,322
...not to mention the inmates.

321
00:34:34,621 --> 00:34:35,921
So what?

322
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:39,622
They aren't in cradle school,
case you didn't notice.

323
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:42,321
Although you treat them that way.

324
00:34:42,522 --> 00:34:45,622
We don't scare them
any more than we have to.

325
00:34:45,922 --> 00:34:47,421
They're under enough strain.

326
00:34:47,722 --> 00:34:49,822
Men under strain can snap.

327
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,521
Hurt themselves and hurt others.
That's why our job is...

328
00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:55,921
...talking...

329
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,222
...not yelling.

330
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:02,321
You'd do better to think of this place
like an intensive care ward.

331
00:35:02,822 --> 00:35:06,021
I think of it as a bucket of piss
to drown rats in.

332
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:07,922
That's all.

333
00:35:08,822 --> 00:35:11,022
Anybody doesn't like it?

334
00:35:11,221 --> 00:35:13,421
You can kiss my ass.

335
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:16,521
You try it. Go on.

336
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:20,422
Try it. You'll be on the bread lines
before the week is out.

337
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:22,221
Okay, Brutal.

338
00:35:34,621 --> 00:35:36,921
We all know who your connections are.

339
00:35:37,421 --> 00:35:41,621
You ever threaten a man on this block
again, we all gonna have a go.

340
00:35:41,921 --> 00:35:43,321
Job be damned.

341
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:47,421
You done?

342
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:54,621
Get all this shit back in the room.
You are cluttering up my Mile.

343
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:18,021
Arlen...

344
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:20,821
...your daughter and her family
are here.

345
00:36:27,221 --> 00:36:31,221
Let's move. I want at least two
rehearsals before he gets back.

346
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:36,821
Sitting down, sitting down!

347
00:36:37,022 --> 00:36:38,721
Rehearsing now! Everybody settle!

348
00:36:38,921 --> 00:36:40,821
Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

349
00:36:41,321 --> 00:36:44,621
Stepping forward, stepping forward,
stepping forward.

350
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:48,121
-ls his head properly shaved?
-lt's all dandruffy, and it smells.

351
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:49,821
I will take that as a yes.

352
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:51,321
Let's go, Arlen.

353
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:55,221
Walking the Mile, walking the Mile...

354
00:36:55,521 --> 00:36:59,221
...walking the Mile, walking the Mile,
walking the Mile...

355
00:36:59,421 --> 00:37:01,321
...walking the Mile.

356
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:04,521
I'm getting to my knees.
I'm praying, praying.

357
00:37:04,821 --> 00:37:07,520
Lord is my shepherd
and so forth and so on.

358
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:12,221
I'm sorry for all the bad shit
I've done and people i've tramped on.

359
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:14,820
And i hope they forgive me...

360
00:37:15,021 --> 00:37:17,821
...and i'll never do it again,
that's for sure.

361
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,921
We're not gonna have some
Cherokee medicine man in here...

362
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,021
...hollering and shaking his dick.

363
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,821
-Actually--
-Still praying, still praying.

364
00:37:27,021 --> 00:37:29,121
-Getting right with Jesus.
-Do it quietly!

365
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,821
You old gink!

366
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:32,221
As i was saying...

367
00:37:32,421 --> 00:37:35,121
...I don't believe they actually
shake their dicks.

368
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:38,820
Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian,
so Reverend Schuster's coming in.

369
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,521
He's good. He's fast too.
Doesn't get them all worked up.

370
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:45,621
On your feet, Toot.
You prayed enough for one day.

371
00:37:45,821 --> 00:37:48,621
Getting to my feet!
Walking the Mile...

372
00:37:48,821 --> 00:37:52,121
...walking the Mile,
walking the Green Mile.

373
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:54,221
Walking the Mile.

374
00:37:54,421 --> 00:37:56,121
Walking in the Mile.

375
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,020
Sitting down now.

376
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,120
Sitting down.
I'm taking a seat in Old Sparky.

377
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:04,521
What do i do?

378
00:38:05,621 --> 00:38:07,220
Watch and learn.

379
00:38:14,021 --> 00:38:15,620
Getting strapped.

380
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,421
Getting clamped.

381
00:38:20,121 --> 00:38:21,720
Getting wired.

382
00:38:23,621 --> 00:38:24,920
All right.

383
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,220
Getting all electrode.

384
00:38:33,921 --> 00:38:34,921
Roll on one.

385
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:38,920
"Roll on one" means i turn
the generator up full.

386
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:41,321
The lights go brighter
in half the prison.

387
00:38:41,521 --> 00:38:43,221
Arlen Bitterbuck...

388
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,120
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury...

389
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,521
...sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

390
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,520
Anything to say before
your sentence is carried out?

391
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:59,221
I want fried chicken with gravy on the
taters, and i want to shit in your hat.

392
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,920
I got to have Mae West
sit on my face...

393
00:39:02,121 --> 00:39:04,820
...because I'm one horny motherfucker.

394
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:10,521
You bastard.

395
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,120
That's a good one.

396
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,721
Quiet.

397
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,220
Quiet! Shut up!

398
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,921
-Shut up!
-Sorry, boss.

399
00:39:19,121 --> 00:39:23,321
One more remark like that, I'll
have Van Hay roll on two for real.

400
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,020
And i'll have one less
crazy old trustee.

401
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,220
lt was pretty funny.

402
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:30,920
I don't like it.
We'll be doing this for real.

403
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,520
I don't want anybody remembering
a stupid joke and getting going again.

404
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,021
Ever try not to laugh in church...

405
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,620
...when something funny gets stuck
in your head?

406
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,520
I'm sorry, Paul. You're right.

407
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,321
Let's keep going.

408
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,920
Soak the sponge.

409
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:58,220
Putting on the black hood.

410
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,720
And putting on my cap.

411
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,920
Why's he putting that sponge
on his head?

412
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,120
Conducts electricity to the brain
fast like a bullet.

413
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,320
You don't ever throw the switch
on a man without that.

414
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,120
Hush up there, Toot.

415
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:22,020
Getting screwed.

416
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,920
I'm getting the cap.

417
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,520
Arlen Bitterbuck...

418
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,120
...electricity shall be passed through
your body until you are dead...

419
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,620
...in accordance with state law.

420
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,420
God have mercy on your soul.

421
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,120
Amen.

422
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,620
Roll on two.

423
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,220
And that's that.

424
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,520
I'm frying! I'm frying!

425
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,420
I'm a done tom turkey!

426
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:06,920
This is a shocking experience!

427
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,720
One of the witnesses
showed up a day early.

428
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:20,420
Let's do it again,
and let's get it right this time.

429
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,020
Get that idiot out of the chair.

430
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,819
Do you think if a man sincerely
repents on what he done wrong...

431
00:42:28,819 --> 00:42:32,319
...that he might get to go back to
the time that was happiest for him...

432
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:34,720
...and live there forever?

433
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,119
Could that be what heaven's like?

434
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:43,120
I just about believe that very thing.

435
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,520
Had me a young wife when i was 1 8.

436
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,820
Spent our first summer in the mountains.
Made love every night.

437
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:01,619
And she'd lie there after...

438
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:04,919
...bare-breasted in the firelight.

439
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,420
And we'd talk sometimes
till the sun come up.

440
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:14,919
That was my best time.

441
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:36,620
lt'll be fine.

442
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:39,519
You'll do fine.

443
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:19,419
Arlen Bitterbuck, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

444
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:23,619
...until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

445
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:26,219
God have mercy on your soul.

446
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,119
Roll on two.

447
00:45:32,018 --> 00:45:32,819
Again.

448
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:41,418
Adios, chief.

449
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:46,319
Drop us a card from hell.
Let us know if it's hot enough.

450
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:51,119
He's paid what he owed.

451
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:53,818
He's square with the house again...

452
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:56,719
...so keep your goddamn hands off him!

453
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:18,719
What's up his ass?

454
00:46:18,918 --> 00:46:20,218
You.

455
00:46:21,218 --> 00:46:23,819
Always. You, Percy.

456
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:27,518
You gotta hate the new boy?
That the way it is around here?

457
00:46:29,518 --> 00:46:32,818
Why don't you just move on?
Take that job at Briar Ridge?

458
00:46:33,419 --> 00:46:36,218
Oh, yeah. I know all about it.

459
00:46:36,718 --> 00:46:40,018
Sounds to me like a pretty good job.

460
00:46:41,418 --> 00:46:44,819
I might just take it too,
soon as you put me out front.

461
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:47,418
Yeah, you heard me.

462
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:50,618
I want Brutal's spot
for the next execution.

463
00:46:54,018 --> 00:46:58,519
Seeing a man die, that's not enough.
You gotta smell his nuts cook.

464
00:46:58,718 --> 00:47:01,118
I just wanna be out front, is all.

465
00:47:02,418 --> 00:47:04,418
Come on. One time.

466
00:47:05,618 --> 00:47:07,118
And then you know what?

467
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:10,218
You'll be rid of me. I swear.

468
00:47:10,418 --> 00:47:12,219
And if i say no?

469
00:47:13,418 --> 00:47:16,918
Well, i might just
stick around for good.

470
00:47:17,718 --> 00:47:19,618
Make me a career of this...

471
00:47:20,918 --> 00:47:22,318
...boss.

472
00:48:15,118 --> 00:48:16,418
You won't believe this.

473
00:48:26,918 --> 00:48:28,218
Look.

474
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:32,318
I done tame me that mouse.

475
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:34,718
We see that.

476
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:39,117
Watch this. Watch what he do.

477
00:48:46,818 --> 00:48:48,818
Ain't he something now?

478
00:48:49,717 --> 00:48:52,018
He's smart, Mr. Jingles.

479
00:48:52,218 --> 00:48:54,318
-Mr. Jingles?
-That his name.

480
00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:56,917
He whispered in my ear.

481
00:48:57,418 --> 00:48:58,518
Hey, captain...

482
00:48:58,718 --> 00:49:02,418
...could i have a box for my mouse
so he can sleep in here with me?

483
00:49:02,618 --> 00:49:05,218
Your English gets better
when you want something.

484
00:49:05,417 --> 00:49:07,417
Wanna see what else he can do?

485
00:49:09,418 --> 00:49:10,418
Watch, watch.

486
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:13,618
Mr. Jingle? Mr. Jingle,
wanna play fetch?

487
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:15,418
Wanna play fetch?

488
00:49:16,218 --> 00:49:18,518
Play fetch. Watch, watch, watch.

489
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:40,618
He fetch it every time. Every time.

490
00:49:41,418 --> 00:49:46,117
That's some smart mouse, Del.
Like he a circus mouse or something.

491
00:49:48,317 --> 00:49:51,517
Correct. That just what he is too.
He's a circus mouse.

492
00:49:51,717 --> 00:49:53,717
When i get out,
he'll make me rich.

493
00:49:54,118 --> 00:49:56,418
You just watch and see
if he don't do that.

494
00:49:56,717 --> 00:49:58,917
We play fetch again?

495
00:49:59,618 --> 00:50:01,418
Well, well, well.

496
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:04,117
Looks like you found yourself
a new friend.

497
00:50:04,718 --> 00:50:06,117
Don't hurt him.

498
00:50:08,718 --> 00:50:10,118
ls that the one i chased?

499
00:50:10,517 --> 00:50:12,118
Yeah, that's the one.

500
00:50:12,617 --> 00:50:15,917
Only Del says his name is Mr. Jingles.

501
00:50:17,018 --> 00:50:18,017
ls that so?

502
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:20,917
Del's been asking for a box.

503
00:50:21,817 --> 00:50:23,518
Thinks the mouse will sleep in it.

504
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:25,618
Might keep it for a pet.

505
00:50:27,918 --> 00:50:29,217
What do you think?

506
00:50:30,517 --> 00:50:34,317
You know what?
We ought to find a cigar box...

507
00:50:34,817 --> 00:50:39,418
...and get some cotton batting
from the dispensary to line it with.

508
00:50:42,617 --> 00:50:44,817
That should do real nice.

509
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,617
Man said get a cigar box.

510
00:51:12,517 --> 00:51:14,017
Hal, you wanted to see me?

511
00:51:16,617 --> 00:51:18,217
Close the door.

512
00:51:25,517 --> 00:51:27,217
So you know...

513
00:51:28,717 --> 00:51:31,217
...you got a new prisoner
coming in here tomorrow.

514
00:51:32,317 --> 00:51:34,017
"William Wharton."

515
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,417
He's what you call...

516
00:51:36,717 --> 00:51:38,717
...a problem child.

517
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:43,218
Got "Billy the Kid" tattooed
on his left arm.

518
00:51:43,417 --> 00:51:47,517
Been rambling all over the state
last few years...

519
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:50,117
...causing all kinds of trouble.

520
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:52,817
Finally hit the big time.

521
00:51:54,217 --> 00:51:57,517
Killed three people in a holdup.

522
00:51:57,817 --> 00:51:59,917
One of them a pregnant woman.

523
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:04,417
Bad news all around.

524
00:52:18,817 --> 00:52:20,117
lt's a tumor, Paul.

525
00:52:21,717 --> 00:52:23,517
A brain tumor.

526
00:52:25,216 --> 00:52:26,417
They got...

527
00:52:27,217 --> 00:52:29,317
...x-ray pictures of it.

528
00:52:30,717 --> 00:52:33,217
lt's the size of a lemon, they said.

529
00:52:36,017 --> 00:52:37,217
And...

530
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:39,916
...way down...

531
00:52:41,817 --> 00:52:44,016
...deep inside,
where they can't operate.

532
00:52:46,017 --> 00:52:47,717
I haven't told her.

533
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,416
I can't think how.

534
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:57,317
For the life of me, Paul...

535
00:52:58,816 --> 00:53:01,816
...I can't think how to
tell my wife...

536
00:53:05,317 --> 00:53:07,317
...she's going to die.

537
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:34,016
Oh, oh, God.

538
00:54:34,717 --> 00:54:36,216
Oh, God.

539
00:54:40,117 --> 00:54:41,516
I'm going.

540
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:42,616
What?

541
00:54:42,816 --> 00:54:45,716
To see Dr. Bishop. I'm going.

542
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:47,516
Today.

543
00:54:48,016 --> 00:54:50,816
Soon as we get that new inmate
squared away.

544
00:54:51,116 --> 00:54:52,316
That bad?

545
00:54:53,016 --> 00:54:54,517
Oh, yeah.

546
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:18,717
The boy's doped to the gills.

547
00:55:21,716 --> 00:55:22,917
Hand me them clothes.

548
00:55:26,016 --> 00:55:27,916
William Wharton?

549
00:55:29,716 --> 00:55:31,516
You put on these clothes now.

550
00:55:39,616 --> 00:55:40,817
We'll have to do this.

551
00:55:43,016 --> 00:55:44,616
Hellraiser, huh?

552
00:55:44,816 --> 00:55:47,516
Look more like a limp noodle to me.

553
00:55:51,316 --> 00:55:55,116
You've been declared competent, son.
You know what that means?

554
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:57,516
You're gonna ride the lightning.

555
00:56:00,616 --> 00:56:02,216
Shut up, give us a hand.

556
00:56:03,116 --> 00:56:04,816
Hellraiser.

557
00:56:35,816 --> 00:56:37,316
You don't look so good.

558
00:56:39,216 --> 00:56:41,216
Look like you're running you a fever.

559
00:56:47,016 --> 00:56:48,616
Boss Edgecomb?

560
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,015
I needs to see you down here.

561
00:56:54,616 --> 00:56:56,916
I got things to tend to, John Coffey.

562
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:02,916
You just stay still in your cell.

563
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:15,716
E Block.

564
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:53,516
Come on, let's go.

565
00:57:54,716 --> 00:57:56,816
Come on. Look alive, big boy.

566
00:58:11,516 --> 00:58:12,715
Careful.

567
00:58:16,215 --> 00:58:17,115
Careful.

568
00:58:17,315 --> 00:58:18,215
Step up.

569
00:58:18,516 --> 00:58:19,415
Step up.

570
00:59:00,115 --> 00:59:01,415
Ain't this a party now?

571
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:03,015
-ls it or what?
-Let him go.

572
00:59:03,215 --> 00:59:04,816
-Shoot him.
-See who you hit.

573
00:59:05,015 --> 00:59:06,515
Shoot the son of a bitch.

574
00:59:06,816 --> 00:59:07,615
Shoot him!

575
00:59:07,815 --> 00:59:10,515
Hit him, Percy!
Goddamn it! Hit him.

576
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:12,216
Hit me, you limp noodle.

577
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:13,315
Hit him, Percy!

578
00:59:13,515 --> 00:59:14,615
Goddamn it, hit him!

579
00:59:14,915 --> 00:59:16,215
Come on, Percy. Hit me.

580
00:59:17,015 --> 00:59:17,815
I'm warning you.

581
00:59:18,015 --> 00:59:19,416
You warning me?

582
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:20,915
I'm warning you!

583
00:59:21,115 --> 00:59:23,115
-You're warning me?!
-Shoot him!

584
00:59:23,315 --> 00:59:24,716
Well, come on--

585
00:59:31,215 --> 00:59:32,315
You're a big fucker.

586
00:59:33,515 --> 00:59:34,915
Where'd you come from?

587
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:48,015
Come on, Dean.
Come on, boy, get up.

588
00:59:48,315 --> 00:59:49,815
All right. Let it breathe.

589
00:59:50,415 --> 00:59:52,515
That's it. Just breathe.
Just breathe.

590
00:59:54,415 --> 00:59:56,115
Breathe. Breathe, boy.

591
00:59:56,315 --> 00:59:59,315
-Didn't see it coming.
-Come on, boy, breathe.

592
00:59:59,515 --> 01:00:01,515
Come on. Just breathe.

593
01:00:04,415 --> 01:00:06,515
We thought he was doped.

594
01:00:07,815 --> 01:00:11,015
Didn't we? Didn't we, all of us,
think he was doped?

595
01:00:11,215 --> 01:00:13,014
You didn't ask?

596
01:00:14,315 --> 01:00:16,114
I guess that's not a mistake...

597
01:00:16,515 --> 01:00:19,715
...you'll be needing to make again
anytime soon, is it?

598
01:00:33,815 --> 01:00:37,415
You go get Dean and Harry looked at.
Make sure they're all right.

599
01:00:37,915 --> 01:00:41,414
Percy, you make the report
to the warden for me.

600
01:00:41,615 --> 01:00:44,215
Say the situation's under control.
lt's not a story.

601
01:00:44,414 --> 01:00:47,015
He won't appreciate you
drawing out the suspense.

602
01:00:47,215 --> 01:00:49,515
What about you?
You're about to collapse.

603
01:00:49,714 --> 01:00:53,015
I've got the Mile
till you all come back.

604
01:00:53,814 --> 01:00:55,815
Go on now. Go.

605
01:01:03,515 --> 01:01:06,614
Come on, boy.
Let's get you looked at.

606
01:01:32,215 --> 01:01:35,614
Boss, I needs to see you down here.

607
01:01:39,214 --> 01:01:42,415
This is not a good time, John Coffey...

608
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,615
...not a good time at all.

609
01:01:44,815 --> 01:01:48,915
But i needs to see you, boss.
I needs to talk to you.

610
01:02:11,015 --> 01:02:12,314
Closer.

611
01:02:12,814 --> 01:02:14,914
You know you ain't
supposed to do that.

612
01:02:16,514 --> 01:02:18,514
Mind your business, Del.

613
01:02:28,114 --> 01:02:30,114
What do you want, John Coffey?

614
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:32,314
Just to help it.

615
01:02:36,015 --> 01:02:37,414
Don't be afraid.

616
01:02:38,014 --> 01:02:39,014
Help!

617
01:02:39,814 --> 01:02:40,714
Help!

618
01:02:40,914 --> 01:02:42,614
Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

619
01:02:42,814 --> 01:02:44,314
Help!

620
01:02:44,515 --> 01:02:45,615
What are you doing?

621
01:02:50,414 --> 01:02:52,214
Boss Howell! Help!

622
01:02:52,915 --> 01:02:54,614
Boss Stanton! Somebody, come!

623
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,614
Help! Boss Howell! Boss Stanton!

624
01:03:15,814 --> 01:03:18,814
Somebody, come!
John Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

625
01:03:19,014 --> 01:03:21,614
Del, for chrissakes, shut up!

626
01:04:08,214 --> 01:04:10,414
What did you just do to me?

627
01:04:12,414 --> 01:04:14,114
I helped it.

628
01:04:15,214 --> 01:04:16,813
Didn't i help it?

629
01:04:17,913 --> 01:04:20,114
I just took it back, is all.

630
01:04:20,914 --> 01:04:23,414
Awful tired now, boss.

631
01:04:23,914 --> 01:04:25,614
Dog-tired.

632
01:04:49,814 --> 01:04:52,814
Boss, what that man do to you?

633
01:05:55,313 --> 01:05:58,014
Hey, honey. How you feeling?

634
01:05:59,813 --> 01:06:02,613
Oh, not too bad.

635
01:06:03,813 --> 01:06:05,613
What did the doctor say?

636
01:06:07,813 --> 01:06:09,614
You know doctors.

637
01:06:10,013 --> 01:06:11,913
Gobbledygook, mostly.

638
01:06:13,013 --> 01:06:14,413
Gobbledygook.

639
01:06:29,614 --> 01:06:31,213
Having stew tonight.

640
01:06:41,513 --> 01:06:43,214
What are you doing?

641
01:06:49,913 --> 01:06:51,813
What does it feel like?

642
01:06:52,713 --> 01:06:55,113
Well, I know what it feels like.

643
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,713
lt feels great.

644
01:07:37,413 --> 01:07:40,213
Not that i'm complaining...

645
01:07:41,313 --> 01:07:45,012
...but we haven't gone four times
in one night since we were 1 9.

646
01:07:45,313 --> 01:07:47,613
Yeah, we did, at your mom's.

647
01:07:49,113 --> 01:07:51,113
Wanna tell me what's going on?

648
01:07:54,913 --> 01:07:56,013
Well...

649
01:07:57,612 --> 01:07:59,613
...see, the thing is...

650
01:08:00,812 --> 01:08:04,413
...I never actually made it in
to Dr. Bishop's yesterday.

651
01:08:07,613 --> 01:08:10,413
Brutal, Paul. Listen.

652
01:08:10,613 --> 01:08:15,013
I'm thinking of taking the morning
off sick. You cover the fort for me?

653
01:08:16,113 --> 01:08:18,313
That's swell. Thanks.

654
01:08:18,512 --> 01:08:21,213
Yeah, I'm sure i'll feel better.

655
01:08:29,413 --> 01:08:31,413
You're sure you ought to do this?

656
01:08:33,013 --> 01:08:35,213
I'm not sure what i'm sure of.

657
01:08:52,012 --> 01:08:55,013
Burt, you got some company.

658
01:08:55,713 --> 01:08:57,312
Can i offer you a cold drink?

659
01:08:57,512 --> 01:09:00,612
Yes, ma'am. A cold drink
would be fine. Thank you.

660
01:09:01,013 --> 01:09:04,113
Mr. Hammersmith, your office said
I might find you at home.

661
01:09:04,313 --> 01:09:05,912
Hope i'm not troubling you.

662
01:09:06,613 --> 01:09:08,713
Well, that depends, Mr...?

663
01:09:08,912 --> 01:09:12,913
Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block supervisor
up on Cold Mountain.

664
01:09:14,212 --> 01:09:15,513
The Green Mile.

665
01:09:15,713 --> 01:09:18,813
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way.

666
01:09:19,612 --> 01:09:21,412
I'd like to ask you about one.

667
01:09:23,512 --> 01:09:25,512
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

668
01:09:30,213 --> 01:09:31,212
Which client?

669
01:09:33,513 --> 01:09:36,312
Now you got my curiosity aroused.

670
01:09:36,513 --> 01:09:37,813
John Coffey.

671
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:40,113
Coffey.

672
01:09:40,612 --> 01:09:41,813
Causing you problems?

673
01:09:42,312 --> 01:09:45,812
Can't say he is. He doesn't like
the dark and cries on occasion...

674
01:09:46,113 --> 01:09:47,912
...but other than that....

675
01:09:48,113 --> 01:09:51,413
He cries, does he?
Got a lot to cry about, I'd say.

676
01:09:51,613 --> 01:09:53,112
You know what he did.

677
01:09:53,812 --> 01:09:55,912
I read the court transcript.

678
01:09:56,813 --> 01:09:57,613
Thank you, missus.

679
01:09:57,813 --> 01:09:59,512
My pleasure.

680
01:10:00,412 --> 01:10:01,212
Kids!

681
01:10:01,412 --> 01:10:03,712
Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up.

682
01:10:03,913 --> 01:10:05,213
Coming, Mama!

683
01:10:05,412 --> 01:10:08,612
What exactly are you
trying to find out?

684
01:10:09,213 --> 01:10:11,513
I wonder if he did anything
like that before.

685
01:10:13,012 --> 01:10:14,912
Why? Has he said anything?

686
01:10:15,112 --> 01:10:18,312
No, but a man who does
a thing like that...

687
01:10:18,512 --> 01:10:22,412
...has often developed a taste for it
over time. lt occurred to me...

688
01:10:22,612 --> 01:10:26,512
...that it might be easy enough to
follow his back trail. Find out.

689
01:10:27,312 --> 01:10:31,112
A man his size, and colored to boot,
can't be that hard to trace.

690
01:10:31,313 --> 01:10:34,313
You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.

691
01:10:34,513 --> 01:10:36,613
Believe me, we tried.

692
01:10:37,513 --> 01:10:39,713
Like he'd dropped out of the sky.

693
01:10:40,512 --> 01:10:41,912
How can that be?

694
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:46,312
We're in a depression.
A third of the country's out of work.

695
01:10:46,512 --> 01:10:50,612
People are drifting by the thousands,
looking for jobs, for greener grass.

696
01:10:50,812 --> 01:10:53,912
Even a giant like Coffey
wouldn't get noticed everywhere.

697
01:10:54,712 --> 01:10:57,112
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

698
01:10:57,912 --> 01:10:59,513
He is...

699
01:10:59,812 --> 01:11:01,912
...strange, I admit.

700
01:11:02,312 --> 01:11:06,612
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

701
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:09,412
I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.

702
01:11:09,712 --> 01:11:12,512
I deal with them day in and day out.

703
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:16,012
You didn't come to ask me
whether he killed before.

704
01:11:16,212 --> 01:11:19,112
You came to see if i think
he did it at all.

705
01:11:20,512 --> 01:11:21,412
Do you?

706
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:25,612
One seldom sees a less ambiguous case.

707
01:11:25,813 --> 01:11:27,812
He was found with the victims
in his arms.

708
01:11:28,112 --> 01:11:29,912
And yet you defended him.

709
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,512
Everyone is entitled to a defense.

710
01:11:33,912 --> 01:11:35,512
Kids! Lunch!

711
01:11:35,712 --> 01:11:37,012
Y'all listen to your mama!

712
01:11:41,612 --> 01:11:43,212
I'll tell you something.

713
01:11:44,312 --> 01:11:47,912
You listen close too, because it
might be something you need to know.

714
01:11:48,112 --> 01:11:49,412
I'm listening.

715
01:11:50,912 --> 01:11:51,912
We had us a dog.

716
01:11:53,012 --> 01:11:55,012
Just a sweet mongrel.

717
01:11:55,211 --> 01:11:56,712
You know the kind.

718
01:11:58,112 --> 01:12:01,511
Well, in many ways,
a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.

719
01:12:02,412 --> 01:12:04,212
You get to know it.

720
01:12:04,412 --> 01:12:08,712
Often, you get to love it.
lt is of no particular use...

721
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:12,512
...but you keep it around
because you think it loves you.

722
01:12:14,011 --> 01:12:18,112
lf you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you
never have to find out any different.

723
01:12:19,211 --> 01:12:21,411
My wife and i were not so lucky.

724
01:12:23,312 --> 01:12:24,912
Caleb, come here for a second.

725
01:12:26,312 --> 01:12:27,512
Come here.

726
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:30,212
Please, son.

727
01:12:31,811 --> 01:12:34,312
He still has the one good eye.

728
01:12:35,612 --> 01:12:37,912
I suppose he's lucky...

729
01:12:38,111 --> 01:12:40,512
...not to be completely blind.

730
01:12:43,212 --> 01:12:46,912
We get down on our knees and thank God
for that much at least.

731
01:12:47,611 --> 01:12:49,012
Right, Caleb?

732
01:12:51,811 --> 01:12:52,811
Go on in, now.

733
01:12:56,211 --> 01:12:59,111
That dog attacked my boy
for no reason.

734
01:12:59,712 --> 01:13:01,912
Just got it in his mind one day.

735
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:04,211
The same with John Coffey.

736
01:13:04,411 --> 01:13:08,611
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that i have no doubt.

737
01:13:09,312 --> 01:13:11,212
But those little girls...

738
01:13:11,412 --> 01:13:13,811
...stayed raped and murdered.

739
01:13:14,512 --> 01:13:16,512
Maybe he'd never done it before.

740
01:13:18,211 --> 01:13:20,412
My dog never bit before.

741
01:13:22,111 --> 01:13:24,912
But i didn't concern myself with that.

742
01:13:25,912 --> 01:13:29,811
I went out with my rifle, grabbed
his collar and blew his brains out.

743
01:13:31,212 --> 01:13:32,412
ls Coffey guilty?

744
01:13:35,312 --> 01:13:37,011
Yes, he is.

745
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:39,312
Don't you doubt it.

746
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:42,211
And don't you turn your back on him.

747
01:13:43,011 --> 01:13:47,211
You may get away with it once
or even a hundred times...

748
01:13:48,012 --> 01:13:49,711
...but in the end...

749
01:13:51,711 --> 01:13:53,112
...you'll get bit.

750
01:14:05,712 --> 01:14:08,211
Oh, me! Oh, my!

751
01:14:15,112 --> 01:14:17,312
I'm smelling me some corn bread.

752
01:14:17,811 --> 01:14:19,711
lt's from my missus.

753
01:14:23,411 --> 01:14:25,712
She wanted to thank you.

754
01:14:27,111 --> 01:14:28,511
Thank me for what?

755
01:14:28,912 --> 01:14:30,211
Well, you know.

756
01:14:32,912 --> 01:14:34,311
For helping me.

757
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:36,611
Helping you with what?

758
01:14:37,312 --> 01:14:38,411
You know.

759
01:14:45,011 --> 01:14:47,011
Was your missus pleased?

760
01:14:48,812 --> 01:14:50,411
Several times.

761
01:15:06,011 --> 01:15:09,511
John, I can smell that from over here.
I surely can.

762
01:15:12,311 --> 01:15:14,611
Can i give Del and Mr. Jingles some?

763
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:18,811
Well, it's yours, John.
You can do with it as you please.

764
01:15:21,911 --> 01:15:25,311
Here. This for Del and Mr. Jingles.

765
01:15:26,111 --> 01:15:29,811
Hey! What about me?
I'm gonna get some too, ain't l?

766
01:15:31,911 --> 01:15:35,011
lt's yours, John. As you please.

767
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:38,311
I think i'll just keep the rest, then.

768
01:15:44,111 --> 01:15:46,311
Courtesy of the gentleman
across the way.

769
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,411
John, that's so very fine of you.

770
01:15:52,411 --> 01:15:56,311
I thank you. Mr. Jingle thank you.
My mama'd thank you too, but she dead.

771
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:58,211
Welcome.

772
01:15:59,511 --> 01:16:03,711
What about me? Don't you
hold out on me, you big dummy nigger.

773
01:16:07,711 --> 01:16:09,211
Here come the boss man.

774
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:12,511
You'll keep a civil tongue
on my block.

775
01:16:23,911 --> 01:16:26,011
You get that one for free.

776
01:16:27,011 --> 01:16:28,611
But that's the last one.

777
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:32,311
That's it?
Just that little itty-bitty one?

778
01:16:32,911 --> 01:16:36,211
I guess i'm gonna have to
pay you out for the rest.

779
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:51,610
Good shot, weren't it?

780
01:16:53,811 --> 01:16:56,011
The look on your face!

781
01:17:00,311 --> 01:17:01,910
You believe this?

782
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:04,411
That son of a bitch pissed on me.

783
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:07,110
Did y'all like that?

784
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:09,611
I'm cooking up some turds
to go with it.

785
01:17:09,811 --> 01:17:11,410
Nice soft ones.

786
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:14,811
Have them out to y'all tomorrow.

787
01:17:16,311 --> 01:17:20,111
We've been meaning to clean out
that room for a while, haven't we?

788
01:17:22,211 --> 01:17:24,711
Be careful with that.
That's fragile.

789
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:29,210
What's it now?
What's it now? Moving day?

790
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:31,610
Y'all wanna come in here
and dust a little?

791
01:17:32,011 --> 01:17:35,410
You can shine my knob for me
while you're at it.

792
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:51,310
You can come in here on your legs...

793
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:53,911
...but you'll go out on your backs.

794
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:57,410
Billy the Kid gonna
guarantee you that.

795
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:58,710
Come on, fuck-stick.

796
01:17:59,111 --> 01:18:03,211
No sneaking up on me this time.
We'll go man-to-man.

797
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:07,810
Piss on me?

798
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:37,110
Come on, Wild Bill.
Little walky-walky.

799
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:41,710
Don't you call me that!
Wild Bill Hickok wasn't no range rider!

800
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:43,910
He was just some
bushwhacking John Law!

801
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:47,710
Dumb son of a bitch sat with his back
to the door, killed by a drunk.

802
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:49,810
Oh, my suds and body.
A history lesson.

803
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:54,310
You never know what you'll get at work
every day on the Green Mile.

804
01:18:56,410 --> 01:18:58,110
Thank you, Wild Bill.

805
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:07,610
Not in there.

806
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:09,010
I'll be good.

807
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:11,810
Honest injun, i will. i will.

808
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:18,310
He's pitching a fit.

809
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:21,410
He'll be fine, boys.
Trust me on this one.

810
01:19:30,409 --> 01:19:31,409
Hey, fellers!

811
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:41,210
All i wanted me was a little
corn bread, you motherfuckers!

812
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:44,009
All i wanted me was
a little corn bread!

813
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:54,010
I learned my lesson.

814
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:55,810
I'll be good.

815
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:09,910
Hey, Toot.

816
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:14,110
Give you a nickel for that Moon Pie.

817
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:55,010
Little Black Sambo!

818
01:20:56,209 --> 01:21:00,010
Yes, sir, yes, sir. How do you do?

819
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:03,609
Hope your bags are packed.

820
01:21:03,909 --> 01:21:05,909
My bags are packed! I'm ready to go!

821
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:08,109
Where are we going? Let's go!

822
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:23,809
That Moon Pie thing was
pretty original.

823
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:25,609
Gotta give him that.

824
01:21:43,709 --> 01:21:47,410
Del, grab up your things. lt's
a big day for you and Mr. Jingles.

825
01:21:47,609 --> 01:21:48,909
What you talking about?

826
01:21:49,109 --> 01:21:52,809
lmportant folks heard about your mouse.
Wanna see him perform.

827
01:21:53,009 --> 01:21:54,409
Not just prison guards.

828
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:57,810
One's a politician all the way
from the state capitol.

829
01:22:00,009 --> 01:22:01,409
You fellas coming?

830
01:22:01,609 --> 01:22:05,110
No, we got other fish to fry
just now, Del.

831
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:08,709
But you knock them for a loop.

832
01:22:08,909 --> 01:22:10,709
You knock them for a loop.

833
01:22:11,109 --> 01:22:13,309
Just like Mr. Harry says.

834
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:27,309
Let's move briskly.
There's not much time.

835
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:30,509
All right, rehearsing now!

836
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:33,209
Gotta move our ass.
Ain't got much time.

837
01:22:33,609 --> 01:22:36,909
I been fixing the plumbing here
for 10 years.

838
01:22:37,109 --> 01:22:39,309
Ain't never had to wear no tie before.

839
01:22:39,509 --> 01:22:43,509
Well, you're the VlP today, Earl,
so just shut up.

840
01:22:45,209 --> 01:22:47,309
All right, everybody have a seat.

841
01:23:03,209 --> 01:23:04,809
This is great.

842
01:23:13,609 --> 01:23:18,209
Eduard Delacroix, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

843
01:23:18,409 --> 01:23:20,009
...until you are dead...

844
01:23:20,209 --> 01:23:22,509
...in accordance with state law.

845
01:23:22,909 --> 01:23:25,409
God have mercy on your soul.

846
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:35,209
Roll on two.

847
01:23:39,508 --> 01:23:40,409
That's that.

848
01:23:43,909 --> 01:23:46,908
Very good. Very professional.

849
01:23:49,409 --> 01:23:51,108
Let's do it again.

850
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:54,709
You got all the words right.
lt sounded just fine.

851
01:23:54,909 --> 01:23:55,709
Thank you.

852
01:23:55,909 --> 01:23:59,308
lt's hard to keep a straight face
when Toot's acting the goat.

853
01:23:59,609 --> 01:24:02,608
You got that chin strap tight,
because his head will buck--

854
01:24:03,109 --> 01:24:04,909
All right, break it up.

855
01:24:09,009 --> 01:24:10,209
So?

856
01:24:10,409 --> 01:24:13,209
They love Mr. Jingles.
They laugh over there.

857
01:24:13,509 --> 01:24:17,809
They cheer. They clap their hands.

858
01:24:18,009 --> 01:24:19,909
Well, that's just aces.

859
01:24:20,709 --> 01:24:22,408
lsn't that something?

860
01:24:22,608 --> 01:24:24,809
You done good, old-timer.

861
01:24:25,009 --> 01:24:26,808
We're happy for you.

862
01:24:28,309 --> 01:24:30,109
Yeah, we are.

863
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:48,009
Percy, you shit.

864
01:24:50,908 --> 01:24:51,708
Come on.

865
01:24:51,908 --> 01:24:53,008
Del, get up.

866
01:24:53,209 --> 01:24:56,809
Del, you numb-wit.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

867
01:24:57,008 --> 01:24:59,809
I was just playing. Come on, now.

868
01:25:00,008 --> 01:25:01,508
I was just having--

869
01:25:04,208 --> 01:25:05,809
Ain't you sweet?

870
01:25:06,809 --> 01:25:08,909
Soft like a girl.

871
01:25:09,109 --> 01:25:11,008
I'd rather fuck your asshole...

872
01:25:11,209 --> 01:25:13,209
...than your sister's pussy, i think.

873
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:14,808
Wharton!

874
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:24,108
I let him go. I was just playing.
I let him go.

875
01:25:24,308 --> 01:25:26,809
I'd never hurt a hair
on his pretty head.

876
01:25:27,508 --> 01:25:30,309
Your noodle ain't
limp at all, lover-boy.

877
01:25:30,508 --> 01:25:33,209
I think you sweet on
old Billy the Kid.

878
01:25:35,708 --> 01:25:37,708
But smell you.

879
01:25:44,408 --> 01:25:45,909
Look.

880
01:25:46,108 --> 01:25:47,508
He done piss his pants.

881
01:25:49,708 --> 01:25:51,508
Oh, my God.

882
01:25:53,008 --> 01:25:54,808
Look what the big man done.

883
01:25:55,008 --> 01:25:57,409
He bust other people with a stick.

884
01:26:00,509 --> 01:26:04,809
Somebody touch him, he make water
in his pants like a little baby.

885
01:26:07,708 --> 01:26:09,108
Learn when to shut up.

886
01:26:10,308 --> 01:26:12,009
All right, now.

887
01:26:13,508 --> 01:26:15,108
Don't touch me.

888
01:26:31,408 --> 01:26:34,109
You talk about this to anyone...

889
01:26:34,508 --> 01:26:36,708
...I'll get you all fired.

890
01:26:38,309 --> 01:26:40,008
I swear that to God.

891
01:26:41,608 --> 01:26:46,208
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile. Always has.

892
01:26:52,908 --> 01:26:56,808
Yeah, you keep laughing,
you French-fried faggot!

893
01:26:57,308 --> 01:26:59,508
You just keep on laughing!

894
01:27:02,308 --> 01:27:04,908
Wetmore a good name for you!

895
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:09,108
Percy Wetmore do a dance

896
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:12,208
Listen to him squishing in his pant

897
01:27:23,508 --> 01:27:26,607
Well, what about Dean?
He's got a little boy.

898
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:29,408
He'd love to have a pet mouse, I bet.

899
01:27:32,108 --> 01:27:34,907
How could a boy be trusted
with Mr. Jingle?

900
01:27:35,308 --> 01:27:37,708
Maybe forget to feed him.

901
01:27:38,107 --> 01:27:41,908
How he keep up with his training?
He just a boy, n'est-ce pas?

902
01:27:51,908 --> 01:27:54,208
All right. I'll take him, then.

903
01:27:54,907 --> 01:27:56,007
Me.

904
01:27:57,308 --> 01:27:59,808
Merci beaucoup.
Thank you kindly, but...

905
01:28:01,207 --> 01:28:03,508
...you live out in the woods.

906
01:28:04,008 --> 01:28:05,407
Mr. Jingle, he be...

907
01:28:06,108 --> 01:28:09,308
...he be scared to live
out in the big woods.

908
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:15,907
How about Mouseville?

909
01:28:17,108 --> 01:28:18,107
Mouseville?

910
01:28:18,308 --> 01:28:20,708
Tourist attraction down in Florida.

911
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:23,207
Tallahassee, I think.

912
01:28:23,608 --> 01:28:26,008
ls that right, Paul? Tallahassee?

913
01:28:26,207 --> 01:28:27,407
Tallahassee.

914
01:28:27,608 --> 01:28:31,208
lt's just down the road a piece
from the dog university.

915
01:28:33,507 --> 01:28:37,408
You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?

916
01:28:38,308 --> 01:28:39,907
You think he's got the stuff?

917
01:28:40,208 --> 01:28:42,107
I mean, he is pretty smart.

918
01:28:43,408 --> 01:28:45,007
What is Mouseville?

919
01:28:45,307 --> 01:28:47,307
Tourist attraction, I said.

920
01:28:47,608 --> 01:28:49,307
They got this big tent.

921
01:28:49,507 --> 01:28:52,607
-You have to pay?
-Are you shitting me? Course you pay.

922
01:28:53,008 --> 01:28:53,908
Dime apiece.

923
01:28:54,308 --> 01:28:56,607
-Two cents for the kids.
-For the kids.

924
01:28:56,807 --> 01:28:59,007
lnside the tent they got this...

925
01:29:00,107 --> 01:29:01,107
...mouse city...

926
01:29:01,907 --> 01:29:03,408
...made out of...

927
01:29:03,608 --> 01:29:08,307
...old boxes and toilet paper rolls,
little windows so you can look in.

928
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:13,108
Plus, they got
the Mouseville All-Star Circus.

929
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:17,308
Yeah, there's mice
that swing on trapeze.

930
01:29:17,507 --> 01:29:21,007
Mice that roll barrels.
Mice that stack coins.

931
01:29:25,107 --> 01:29:26,107
Yeah, that's it.

932
01:29:27,907 --> 01:29:29,708
That's the place for Mr. Jingles.

933
01:29:34,707 --> 01:29:37,707
You gonna be a circus mouse after all.

934
01:29:38,208 --> 01:29:42,107
You're gonna live in a mouse city
down in Florida.

935
01:29:45,608 --> 01:29:46,407
There he goes.

936
01:29:54,908 --> 01:29:57,008
Mr. Jingles!

937
01:30:06,608 --> 01:30:08,708
I knew i'd get him sooner or later.

938
01:30:09,407 --> 01:30:11,808
lt was just a matter of time, really.

939
01:30:12,007 --> 01:30:15,107
You fucking cruel bastard!

940
01:30:23,707 --> 01:30:25,207
Give him to me.

941
01:30:25,907 --> 01:30:28,508
Give him to me. Might still be time.

942
01:30:41,207 --> 01:30:42,707
What are you doing?

943
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:48,007
What the hell--?

944
01:30:48,207 --> 01:30:50,007
Please, John.

945
01:30:51,107 --> 01:30:52,407
Help him.

946
01:30:53,807 --> 01:30:55,806
Please, Johnny, help him.

947
01:30:59,707 --> 01:31:02,307
Oh, dear Jesus.

948
01:31:02,507 --> 01:31:03,907
The tail.

949
01:31:04,607 --> 01:31:05,707
Look at the tail.

950
01:32:36,207 --> 01:32:37,307
What'd you do?

951
01:32:37,907 --> 01:32:40,606
I helped Del's mouse...

952
01:32:41,007 --> 01:32:42,407
...his circus mouse.

953
01:32:43,006 --> 01:32:45,307
Gonna live in a mouse city...

954
01:32:45,507 --> 01:32:47,006
...down in....

955
01:32:49,006 --> 01:32:50,206
Florida.

956
01:32:53,306 --> 01:32:55,206
Boss Percy bad.

957
01:32:55,506 --> 01:32:59,506
He mean. He step on Del's mouse.

958
01:33:00,506 --> 01:33:02,307
I took it back, though.

959
01:33:09,707 --> 01:33:11,006
Brute...

960
01:33:11,707 --> 01:33:13,707
...you come along with me.

961
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:17,206
You fellas go on back
to your cribbage game.

962
01:33:41,206 --> 01:33:43,706
Now, don't start in on me.

963
01:33:44,007 --> 01:33:46,006
lt was just a mouse.

964
01:33:46,307 --> 01:33:48,606
Never belonged here
in the first place.

965
01:33:48,806 --> 01:33:50,606
The mouse is fine.

966
01:33:51,706 --> 01:33:52,507
Just fine.

967
01:33:52,706 --> 01:33:55,306
You're no better at mouse-killing
than you are...

968
01:33:55,806 --> 01:33:57,707
...at anything else around here.

969
01:33:59,907 --> 01:34:02,306
Yeah, you expect me to believe that?

970
01:34:04,107 --> 01:34:06,706
I heard the goddamn thing crunch.

971
01:34:06,906 --> 01:34:09,206
Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay?

972
01:34:10,307 --> 01:34:12,606
After all those talks we had about...

973
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:14,906
...keeping the prisoners calm?

974
01:34:15,607 --> 01:34:18,506
-Aren't you relieved?
-What kind of game is this?

975
01:34:18,707 --> 01:34:20,206
lt's no game.

976
01:34:20,506 --> 01:34:21,907
See for yourself.

977
01:34:25,007 --> 01:34:26,306
Go on.

978
01:34:39,606 --> 01:34:42,506
Don't let nothing
happen to Mr. Jingle.

979
01:34:46,606 --> 01:34:50,006
You switched them. You switched them
somehow, you bastards.

980
01:34:50,706 --> 01:34:54,906
I always keep a spare mouse in
my wallet for occasions such as this.

981
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:57,806
Yeah, you playing with me.
Both of you.

982
01:34:58,006 --> 01:35:00,406
Just who the hell you think you are?

983
01:35:03,306 --> 01:35:05,106
We're the people you work with.

984
01:35:05,606 --> 01:35:07,206
But not for long.

985
01:35:08,306 --> 01:35:10,205
Percy, I want your word.

986
01:35:10,806 --> 01:35:11,706
My word?

987
01:35:12,305 --> 01:35:15,006
I put you out front for Del...

988
01:35:15,906 --> 01:35:19,106
...you put in your transfer
to Briar Ridge the next day.

989
01:35:21,606 --> 01:35:26,106
What if i just call up certain people
and tell them you're harassing me?

990
01:35:26,406 --> 01:35:28,606
-Bullying me.
-Go ahead.

991
01:35:29,506 --> 01:35:32,406
I promise you'll leave your share
of blood on the floor.

992
01:35:32,606 --> 01:35:33,806
Over a mouse?

993
01:35:34,006 --> 01:35:35,206
No.

994
01:35:36,006 --> 01:35:40,406
But four men will swear you stood by
while Wild Bill tried to strangle Dean.

995
01:35:40,605 --> 01:35:44,606
About that, people will care.
Even your uncle the governor.

996
01:35:44,805 --> 01:35:47,306
Thing like that goes
on your work record.

997
01:35:47,805 --> 01:35:52,105
Work record can follow a man around
for a long, long time.

998
01:35:52,406 --> 01:35:54,205
I put you out front...

999
01:35:54,606 --> 01:35:56,906
...you put in for that transfer.

1000
01:35:58,405 --> 01:35:59,806
That's the deal.

1001
01:36:04,106 --> 01:36:05,306
All right.

1002
01:36:15,005 --> 01:36:17,506
You make a promise to a man,
you shake his hand.

1003
01:37:19,806 --> 01:37:21,606
Hey, boys.

1004
01:37:22,906 --> 01:37:26,205
No, now, say hey, Mr Jingles.

1005
01:37:28,305 --> 01:37:30,905
Eduard Delacroix,
will you step forward?

1006
01:37:45,505 --> 01:37:46,805
Boss Edgecomb.

1007
01:37:47,505 --> 01:37:49,006
Yes, Del?

1008
01:37:49,205 --> 01:37:51,805
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle, okay?

1009
01:37:53,306 --> 01:37:56,105
Here. You take him.

1010
01:38:04,806 --> 01:38:07,906
I can't have a mouse
on my shoulder while...

1011
01:38:09,405 --> 01:38:10,405
...you know.

1012
01:38:12,505 --> 01:38:14,305
I'll take him, boss.

1013
01:38:14,905 --> 01:38:17,406
Just for now, if Del don't mind.

1014
01:38:22,305 --> 01:38:26,705
You take him, John. You take him
till this foolishment be done.

1015
01:38:47,804 --> 01:38:49,705
You gonna take him to Mouseville?

1016
01:38:50,605 --> 01:38:52,905
We'll do it together, most likely.

1017
01:38:54,005 --> 01:38:56,405
Maybe take a little vacation time.

1018
01:38:57,705 --> 01:39:00,505
People pay a dime apiece to see him.

1019
01:39:00,905 --> 01:39:03,705
Two cents for the kids.
Ain't that right, Boss Howell?

1020
01:39:03,805 --> 01:39:04,604
That's right, Del.

1021
01:39:07,805 --> 01:39:09,405
You're a good man, Boss Howell.

1022
01:39:13,105 --> 01:39:14,505
You too, Boss Edgecomb.

1023
01:39:18,805 --> 01:39:21,805
I sure wish i could've
met you guys somewheres else.

1024
01:40:01,005 --> 01:40:03,005
Hope he's good and scared.

1025
01:40:03,204 --> 01:40:08,005
Hope he knows the fires are stoked
and that Satan's imps are waiting.

1026
01:40:17,205 --> 01:40:19,004
Del, it's all right.

1027
01:41:01,804 --> 01:41:03,004
Roll on one.

1028
01:41:14,804 --> 01:41:17,604
You be still, Mr. Jingles.

1029
01:41:19,004 --> 01:41:22,405
You be so quiet and so still.

1030
01:41:26,104 --> 01:41:27,605
Eduard Delacroix...

1031
01:41:28,004 --> 01:41:31,404
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers.

1032
01:41:31,604 --> 01:41:35,404
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1033
01:41:35,804 --> 01:41:38,704
You have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1034
01:41:47,204 --> 01:41:49,304
I sorry for what i--

1035
01:41:56,404 --> 01:41:58,704
l sorry for what i do.

1036
01:41:59,104 --> 01:42:01,504
I give anything to take it back.

1037
01:42:02,504 --> 01:42:04,204
But i can't.

1038
01:42:05,404 --> 01:42:07,605
God have mercy on me.

1039
01:42:08,304 --> 01:42:10,404
Ainsi soit-il. Amen.

1040
01:42:19,004 --> 01:42:20,704
Don't forget about Mouseville.

1041
01:42:25,804 --> 01:42:27,304
There's no such place.

1042
01:42:28,204 --> 01:42:31,904
That's just a fairy tale these guys
told you to keep you quiet.

1043
01:42:34,504 --> 01:42:36,904
Just thought you should know, faggot.

1044
01:43:39,104 --> 01:43:40,204
Eduard Delacroix...

1045
01:43:41,103 --> 01:43:44,604
...electricity shall now be passed
through your body until you are dead...

1046
01:43:45,203 --> 01:43:47,403
...in accordance with state law.

1047
01:43:48,504 --> 01:43:51,104
God have mercy on your soul.

1048
01:44:30,303 --> 01:44:31,403
Roll on two!

1049
01:44:48,203 --> 01:44:49,403
The sponge is dry.

1050
01:44:49,604 --> 01:44:50,504
What?

1051
01:44:57,104 --> 01:44:59,803
-The goddamn sponge is dry!
-Well, don't you stop him!

1052
01:45:00,004 --> 01:45:02,703
Don't you do it!
lt's too late for that.

1053
01:45:17,804 --> 01:45:19,303
ls this normal?

1054
01:45:19,503 --> 01:45:22,204
God, the smell.

1055
01:45:23,403 --> 01:45:25,903
He's cooking now!
They cooking him good!

1056
01:45:26,404 --> 01:45:28,003
They're about done, i reckon!

1057
01:45:32,903 --> 01:45:35,403
We're gonna have a hoedown!

1058
01:45:40,403 --> 01:45:42,203
He's cooking now!

1059
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:44,603
He's cooking now!

1060
01:45:44,803 --> 01:45:47,103
We gonna have a hoedown!

1061

01:45:52,703 --> 01:45:54,704
I'm smelling gumbo! I'm smelling--

01:45:56,103 --> 01:45:58,103
I said give me some!

1065
01:46:01,703 --> 01:46:03,703
I smell it!

1066
01:46:05,803 --> 01:46:06,703
Smell it!

1067
01:46:14,503 --> 01:46:15,603
Should i kill the juice?

1068
01:46:15,803 --> 01:46:17,303
No! Roll, for chrisssake, roll!

1069
01:46:40,903 --> 01:46:42,403
He's frying now!

1070
01:46:42,603 --> 01:46:44,203
He's frying now!

1071
01:46:47,102 --> 01:46:48,503
Why don't you shut it down?

1072
01:46:48,703 --> 01:46:52,103
He's still alive. You want me to
shut down while he's still alive?

1073
01:46:58,303 --> 01:47:01,103
You watch, you son of a bitch!

1074
01:47:02,503 --> 01:47:05,203
lt's all right, folks!
lt's all under control!

1075
01:47:05,703 --> 01:47:08,603
Everybody stay calm!
Please, stay calm.

1076
01:47:14,502 --> 01:47:15,402
Kill it!

1077
01:47:22,503 --> 01:47:23,403
You do it!

1078
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:25,603
You're running this show, ain't you?

1079
01:47:53,503 --> 01:47:56,103
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1080
01:47:58,602 --> 01:47:59,703
Brutal!

1081
01:47:59,903 --> 01:48:00,903
Brutal, no!

1082
01:48:01,702 --> 01:48:02,802
What do you mean, no?

1083
01:48:03,003 --> 01:48:04,802
You saw what he did!

1084
01:48:05,003 --> 01:48:08,002
Delacroix's dead!
Percy is not worth it!

1085
01:48:08,203 --> 01:48:10,703
So he just gets away with it!
ls that how it works?

1086
01:48:19,202 --> 01:48:22,402
What in the blue fuck was that?

1087
01:48:23,402 --> 01:48:24,802
Jesus Christ.

1088
01:48:25,003 --> 01:48:27,902
There's puke
all over the floor up there.

1089
01:48:28,103 --> 01:48:29,902
And the smell.

1090
01:48:30,503 --> 01:48:34,403
I got Van Hay to open both doors, but
that smell won't go out for 5 years.

1091
01:48:34,603 --> 01:48:36,302
That's what i'm betting.

1092
01:48:37,202 --> 01:48:40,602
And that asshole Wharton
is singing about it!

1093
01:48:41,103 --> 01:48:42,502
You can hear him up there!

1094
01:48:43,103 --> 01:48:45,602
Can he carry a tune, Hal?

1095
01:48:56,302 --> 01:48:58,603
Okay, boys, okay.

1096
01:48:59,102 --> 01:49:02,102
Now, what in the hell happened?

1097
01:49:02,302 --> 01:49:03,903
An execution.

1098
01:49:04,202 --> 01:49:05,302
A successful one.

1099
01:49:05,702 --> 01:49:09,802
How in the name of Christ
can you call that a success?

1100
01:49:10,602 --> 01:49:13,102
Eduard Delacroix is dead.

1101
01:49:14,902 --> 01:49:15,702
lsn't he?

1102
01:49:22,803 --> 01:49:24,003
Something to say?

1103
01:49:28,003 --> 01:49:30,402
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1104
01:49:31,802 --> 01:49:34,403
How many years you spend
pissing on the toilet seat...

1105
01:49:34,602 --> 01:49:36,802
...before someone told you
to put it up?

1106
01:49:37,002 --> 01:49:38,802
Percy fucked up, Hal.

1107
01:49:39,002 --> 01:49:40,603
Pure and simple.

1108
01:49:41,202 --> 01:49:43,002
That's your official position?

1109
01:49:43,202 --> 01:49:45,102
Don't you think it should be?

1110
01:49:45,502 --> 01:49:49,602
He's putting in for a transfer request
to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

1111
01:49:49,802 --> 01:49:52,302
Moving on to bigger and better things.

1112
01:49:52,602 --> 01:49:54,002
lsn't that right, Percy?

1113
01:49:57,202 --> 01:49:58,902
Barbecue

1114
01:49:59,102 --> 01:50:02,502
Me and you
Stinky, pinky

1115
01:50:03,602 --> 01:50:06,602
Weren't Billy, Jilly, Hilly or Pa

1116
01:50:06,802 --> 01:50:09,802
It was a French-fried Cajun
Named Delacroix

1117
01:50:11,802 --> 01:50:12,702
Barbecue

1118
01:50:13,502 --> 01:50:14,802
Me and you

1119
01:50:15,002 --> 01:50:16,602
Stinky, pinky

1120
01:50:18,602 --> 01:50:20,102
Weren't Billy, Jilly--

1121
01:50:21,302 --> 01:50:25,302
You're 1 0 seconds away from spending the
rest of your life in the padded room.

1122
01:50:43,701 --> 01:50:44,802
Poor old Del.

1123
01:50:48,702 --> 01:50:50,402
Poor old Del.

1124
01:50:56,502 --> 01:50:57,802
You okay?

1125
01:50:59,102 --> 01:51:01,302
I could feel it from here.

1126
01:51:01,902 --> 01:51:03,402
What do you mean?

1127
01:51:04,302 --> 01:51:05,902
You could hear it.

1128
01:51:06,102 --> 01:51:08,402
ls that what you mean?
You could hear it.

1129
01:51:08,602 --> 01:51:10,502
He out of it now, though.

1130
01:51:11,402 --> 01:51:13,202
He the lucky one.

1131
01:51:13,802 --> 01:51:17,502
No matter how it happened,
Del the lucky one.

1132
01:51:24,202 --> 01:51:25,902
Where's Mr. Jingles?

1133
01:51:27,002 --> 01:51:29,502
He run away under that door.

1134
01:51:31,102 --> 01:51:33,202
Don't think he'll be back.

1135
01:51:34,702 --> 01:51:37,201
He felt it too, through me.

1136
01:51:38,902 --> 01:51:41,002
Didn't mean to hurt him none.

1137
01:51:41,501 --> 01:51:44,501
All that hurt just spill out.

1138
01:51:51,202 --> 01:51:53,602
Awful tired now, boss.

1139
01:51:55,402 --> 01:51:57,101
Dog-tired.

1140
01:52:03,002 --> 01:52:04,601
Me too, John.

1141
01:52:07,301 --> 01:52:08,501
Me too.

1142
01:53:08,401 --> 01:53:10,101
I hate this.

1143
01:53:10,902 --> 01:53:12,201
I know.

1144
01:53:33,901 --> 01:53:35,601
I am so happy to see you.

1145
01:53:37,501 --> 01:53:39,302
Look at you.

1146
01:53:40,302 --> 01:53:42,301
We missed you at church.

1147
01:53:46,101 --> 01:53:48,501
My hair--

1148
01:53:48,702 --> 01:53:51,601
-You look fine.
-I'm just a mess.

1149
01:53:56,901 --> 01:53:59,202
She's having one of her good days.

1150
01:53:59,801 --> 01:54:01,701
I thank God for that.

1151
01:54:04,201 --> 01:54:05,901
What's a bad day?

1152
01:54:09,301 --> 01:54:11,201
Sometimes she's...

1153
01:54:12,701 --> 01:54:14,001
...she's not herself anymore.

1154
01:54:14,801 --> 01:54:16,201
She swears.

1155
01:54:16,401 --> 01:54:17,901
She swears?

1156
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:19,701
lt just pops out.

1157
01:54:20,301 --> 01:54:23,001
Most awful language you can imagine.

1158
01:54:23,201 --> 01:54:25,500
She doesn't even know she's doing it.

1159
01:54:26,801 --> 01:54:29,700
I didn't know she'd ever heard
words like that.

1160
01:54:29,901 --> 01:54:33,101
To hear her say them
in her sweet voice....

1161
01:54:37,301 --> 01:54:39,801
I'm glad she's having a good day.

1162
01:54:40,901 --> 01:54:43,300
I'm glad for you and Jan.

1163
01:54:59,401 --> 01:55:00,601
Honey...

1164
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:03,701
...if you don't tell me
what's on your mind...

1165
01:55:04,300 --> 01:55:07,500
...I'm afraid i'll have to
smother you with a pillow.

1166
01:55:16,401 --> 01:55:18,501
I'm thinking i love you.

1167
01:55:20,401 --> 01:55:23,901
I'm thinking i don't know
what i would do if you were gone.

1168
01:55:30,201 --> 01:55:33,600
I'm also thinking i'm gonna
have the boys over tomorrow.

1169
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:40,100
Well, you sure do know
how to cook chicken.

1170
01:55:40,501 --> 01:55:41,801
Well, thank you.

1171
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:44,901
This is one delicious treat, ma'am,
before i go to work.

1172
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:46,501
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

1173
01:55:47,001 --> 01:55:49,200
Brutal, you gonna hog all them taters?

1174
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:52,001
Yes, i am.
Harry, you want some potatoes?

1175
01:55:52,201 --> 01:55:53,301
Come on, now.

1176
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:57,401
Soon we'll just see your feet
sticking out of there, Brutus.

1177
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:00,000
You all saw what he did to the mouse.

1178
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:05,200
I could've gone the rest of the day
without you bringing that up.

1179
01:56:05,401 --> 01:56:07,200
I could've gone
the rest of the year.

1180
01:56:07,601 --> 01:56:09,500
He did the same thing to me.

1181
01:56:09,801 --> 01:56:11,901
He put his hands on me.

1182
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:14,800
He took my bladder infection away.

1183
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:20,700
lt's true.

1184
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:23,200
When he came home that day, he was...

1185
01:56:24,701 --> 01:56:26,100
...all better.

1186
01:56:27,701 --> 01:56:30,601
Now, wait.
You're talking about...

1187
01:56:30,801 --> 01:56:32,400
...an authentic healing?

1188
01:56:33,801 --> 01:56:35,200
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1189
01:56:35,901 --> 01:56:37,101
I am.

1190
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:42,700
Well, if you say it, I accept it.

1191
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:45,601
What's it got to do with us?

1192
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,501
You're thinking about Melinda.

1193
01:56:47,701 --> 01:56:49,100
Melinda?

1194
01:56:49,701 --> 01:56:50,500
Melinda Moores?

1195
01:56:50,900 --> 01:56:54,600
So, Paul, you really think
you can help her?

1196
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:59,400
lt's not a bladder infection
or even a busted mouse...

1197
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:03,301
-...but there might be a chance.
-Hold on now.

1198
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:08,300
You're talking about our jobs.
Sneak a sick woman into a cellblock?

1199
01:57:08,501 --> 01:57:10,701
No, Hal would never stand for that.

1200
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,600
You know him. He wouldn't believe
anything, even if it fell on him.

1201
01:57:13,801 --> 01:57:15,400
So you're talking about...

1202
01:57:16,001 --> 01:57:18,001
...taking John Coffey to her.

1203
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,600
That's more than just our jobs, Paul.

1204
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:28,100
That's prison time,
we get caught.

1205
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:31,300
-Dang right it is.
-No, not for you, Dean.

1206
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:34,600
The way i figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1207
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:36,500
That way, you can deny everything.

1208
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:38,800
Why do i have to stay behind?

1209
01:57:40,900 --> 01:57:42,900
Our boy's grown up...

1210
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:44,400
...gone off to school.

1211
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:47,100
Harry's girls,
they're all married now.

1212
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:48,800
Brutal's a single man.

1213
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,400
You're the only one here with
two children, another on the way.

1214
01:57:52,700 --> 01:57:55,800
Let's not discuss this as if
we're thinking of doing it.

1215
01:57:58,100 --> 01:58:00,700
Brutal, help me out here.

1216
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:03,900
I'm sure she's a fine woman.

1217
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:05,600
The finest.

1218
01:58:05,900 --> 01:58:08,000
What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1219
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:10,700
...to the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1220
01:58:10,900 --> 01:58:12,700
I have no doubt.

1221
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,100
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do.

1222
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:19,400
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1223
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:22,700
Now, what if he escapes?

1224
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:26,100
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison...

1225
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:29,600
...but i'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1226
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:31,600
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1227
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:34,599
ln fact...

1228
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:39,100
...I don't think he did it at all.

1229
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:46,000
I do not see God putting
a gift like that...

1230
01:58:46,199 --> 01:58:48,299
...in the hands of a man
who'd kill a child.

1231
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:53,000
That's a very tender notion, but
the man is on death row for the crime.

1232
01:58:54,700 --> 01:58:55,800
And plus...

1233
01:58:56,300 --> 01:58:58,100
...he's huge.

1234
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:03,400
lf he tried to get away, it'd take
a lot of bullets to stop him.

1235
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:07,600
We'd all have shotguns,
in addition to side arms.

1236
01:59:07,999 --> 01:59:09,299
I'd insist on that.

1237
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:13,299
lf he tried anything,
anything at all...

1238
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,900
...we'd have to take him down.

1239
01:59:16,499 --> 01:59:17,499
You understand?

1240
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:30,700
So...

1241
01:59:31,399 --> 01:59:33,299
...tell us what you had in mind.

1242
01:59:40,499 --> 01:59:41,599
There it is.

1243
01:59:41,799 --> 01:59:43,200
I see it.

1244
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:55,900
You think this is enough?

1245
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:58,699
I don't know.

1246
02:00:35,399 --> 02:00:36,999
You fellas thirsty?

1247
02:00:37,399 --> 02:00:38,900
Fresh out of the icebox.

1248
02:00:39,099 --> 02:00:40,800
You bet. That's swell, Brutal.

1249
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,799
-Thanks.
-Oh, yeah.

1250
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Hot in here.

1251
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,200
Boy, howdy.

1252
02:00:45,399 --> 02:00:48,599
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
get some too, ain't l?

1253
02:00:48,799 --> 02:00:52,299
-My ass, you get some too.
-What makes you think you deserve any?

1254
02:00:52,899 --> 02:00:54,999
Because i got a big pecker.

1255
02:00:55,299 --> 02:00:57,999
Well, the day report says
he's been okay.

1256
02:00:58,499 --> 02:01:01,099
Hell, yeah, I been behaved.
Come on, now.

1257
02:01:01,499 --> 02:01:02,900
Don't be stingy hogs.

1258
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:07,599
Come on.

1259
02:01:08,699 --> 02:01:10,799
Come on now, fellers.

1260
02:01:11,899 --> 02:01:13,099
Come on, boss.

1261
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:15,199
I been good all day.

1262
02:01:18,399 --> 02:01:20,099
lt's hot in here.

1263
02:01:20,399 --> 02:01:23,900
lt's hot in this cell, and i'm
dogged to drink. I'm thirsty.

1264
02:01:24,099 --> 02:01:26,000
Why don't you give me some?

1265
02:01:32,699 --> 02:01:33,999
Come on.

1266
02:01:39,099 --> 02:01:40,899
You gonna stay behaved?

1267
02:01:41,299 --> 02:01:42,699
Come on, you clunk, give me that.

1268
02:01:42,899 --> 02:01:44,599
You promise me...

1269
02:01:44,999 --> 02:01:47,199
...or i'll drink this myself
right here.

1270
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:50,099
Come on, now. Don't be that way.

1271
02:01:50,599 --> 02:01:52,099
I'll be good.

1272
02:02:16,999 --> 02:02:17,999
Cup.

1273
02:03:08,798 --> 02:03:11,299
Anybody wants out, now's the time.

1274
02:03:12,098 --> 02:03:13,899
After this, there's no turning back.

1275
02:03:15,399 --> 02:03:16,599
So?

1276
02:03:17,398 --> 02:03:18,599
We gonna do this?

1277
02:03:19,099 --> 02:03:22,099
Sure. That'd be just fine.

1278
02:03:22,298 --> 02:03:24,598
I'd like to take a ride.

1279
02:03:29,798 --> 02:03:31,798
Guess we're all in.

1280
02:03:42,899 --> 02:03:44,199
What is this?

1281
02:03:46,698 --> 02:03:47,598
Payback.

1282
02:03:47,798 --> 02:03:49,399
That's right.

1283
02:03:54,098 --> 02:03:56,998
-No, you let me go! Let go of me!
-Settle down.

1284
02:03:57,198 --> 02:03:58,098
-Let go!
-Settle down.

1285
02:03:58,298 --> 02:03:59,599
What are you doing?

1286
02:03:59,799 --> 02:04:00,799
Settle down.

1287
02:04:08,898 --> 02:04:10,798
"Miss Lotta Leadpipe."

1288
02:04:11,898 --> 02:04:15,098
-What would your mother say?
-You let go of me, you ignoramus.

1289
02:04:15,399 --> 02:04:18,098
I know people. Big people!

1290
02:04:18,499 --> 02:04:21,599
Percy, stick out your arms
like a good lad.

1291
02:04:21,799 --> 02:04:23,799
No, I won't do it.
You can't make me.

1292
02:04:23,999 --> 02:04:26,598
You're dead wrong about that, you know.

1293
02:04:32,299 --> 02:04:34,598
You gonna put your arms up?

1294
02:04:35,399 --> 02:04:38,599
A big man is ripping your ears off.
I'd do as he says.

1295
02:04:40,699 --> 02:04:42,398
There you go.

1296
02:04:50,598 --> 02:04:51,998
Please, Paul.

1297
02:04:52,199 --> 02:04:55,998
Please don't put me in with Wild Bill.
Please don't.

1298
02:04:57,299 --> 02:04:59,198
You would think that.

1299
02:05:00,798 --> 02:05:03,298
No, no, you can't do this to me.

1300
02:05:03,498 --> 02:05:05,898
You can't do this to me. You can't.

1301
02:05:06,098 --> 02:05:08,498
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

1302
02:05:08,698 --> 02:05:11,898
We can and we are.

1303
02:05:18,598 --> 02:05:23,198
We'll give you a few hours of quiet time
to reflect on what you did to Del.

1304
02:05:23,498 --> 02:05:27,098
And if you get lonely,
just think about Miss Leadpipe.

1305
02:05:35,998 --> 02:05:38,098
All right, let's go over it
one more time.

1306
02:05:38,398 --> 02:05:40,498
What do you say if somebody stops by?

1307
02:05:42,298 --> 02:05:44,098
Coffey got upset after lights out...

1308
02:05:44,398 --> 02:05:47,598
...so we put the coat on him,
locked him in the restraint room.

1309
02:05:47,798 --> 02:05:49,698
They hear kicking,
they'll think it's him.

1310
02:05:49,898 --> 02:05:50,897
What about me?

1311
02:05:51,098 --> 02:05:53,698
You're in Admin pulling Del's file,
going over the witnesses...

1312
02:05:53,998 --> 02:05:57,098
...on account of how big a screw-up
the execution was.

1313
02:05:59,398 --> 02:06:01,098
We going for the ride now?

1314
02:06:01,298 --> 02:06:03,998
That's right. We going for the ride.

1315
02:06:06,098 --> 02:06:07,498
What about us, Dean?

1316
02:06:07,697 --> 02:06:11,598
You, Harry, Percy, all down
in the laundry doing your wash.

1317
02:06:11,798 --> 02:06:14,398
Probably take a few hours
before you're back.

1318
02:06:17,698 --> 02:06:19,898
Where you think you going?

1319
02:06:26,497 --> 02:06:27,798
You a bad man.

1320
02:06:27,998 --> 02:06:30,398
That's right, nigger.
Bad as you'd want.

1321
02:06:38,197 --> 02:06:40,097
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1322
02:06:40,398 --> 02:06:41,798
What's wrong?

1323
02:07:05,698 --> 02:07:08,898
Whole room, whole room's spinning.

1324
02:07:09,098 --> 02:07:11,398
lt's like i'm shitty-ass drunk.

1325
02:07:11,597 --> 02:07:13,998
Had me some shine or...

1326
02:07:14,697 --> 02:07:15,997
...or what?

1327
02:07:18,298 --> 02:07:20,997
Niggers ought to have
their own electric chair.

1328
02:07:21,197 --> 02:07:22,898
White man...

1329
02:07:23,097 --> 02:07:27,698
...ought not to sit in no nigger
electric chair. No, sir.

1330
02:07:34,797 --> 02:07:37,498
He a bad man.

1331
02:07:57,198 --> 02:07:58,298
Look, boss.

1332
02:08:02,797 --> 02:08:05,498
lt's Cassie, the lady
in the rocking chair.

1333
02:08:06,197 --> 02:08:07,997
John, we have to be quiet now.

1334
02:08:08,598 --> 02:08:10,998
You see her? You see the lady?

1335
02:08:11,197 --> 02:08:13,297
Yeah, we see her, John. Come on.

1336
02:08:24,698 --> 02:08:26,598
Let's go. Go, go!

1337
02:08:30,997 --> 02:08:32,197
Now!

1338
02:09:08,197 --> 02:09:10,297
All right, big boy.
Let's get moving. Come on.

1339
02:09:44,897 --> 02:09:46,297
Upsy-daisy.

1340
02:09:56,097 --> 02:09:58,297
Do you know where we're taking you?

1341
02:10:01,597 --> 02:10:02,797
Help a lady?

1342
02:10:04,797 --> 02:10:06,296
That's right.

1343
02:10:07,097 --> 02:10:08,297
How do you know?

1344
02:10:10,097 --> 02:10:11,496
Don't know.

1345
02:10:13,397 --> 02:10:17,997
Tell the truth, boss,
I don't know much of anything.

1346
02:10:19,197 --> 02:10:20,497
I never have.

1347
02:10:55,797 --> 02:10:57,796
We can still turn back.

1348
02:10:59,696 --> 02:11:00,796
Boss, look.

1349
02:11:01,197 --> 02:11:02,996
Someone's up.

1350
02:11:04,497 --> 02:11:06,297
This was a mistake.

1351
02:11:06,697 --> 02:11:08,497
Christ, what were we thinking?

1352
02:11:08,697 --> 02:11:11,997
lt's too late now. John, you stay.

1353
02:11:16,496 --> 02:11:19,496
Harry, you keep John here
till we call you.

1354
02:11:29,697 --> 02:11:32,396
Who the hell goes there at 2:30
in the goddamn morning?

1355
02:11:32,597 --> 02:11:34,897
lt's us. lt's Paul and Brutal.

1356
02:11:35,097 --> 02:11:36,496
-lt's us.
-Jesus.

1357
02:11:36,696 --> 02:11:38,897
lt isn't a lockdown, is it?
Or a riot?

1358
02:11:39,097 --> 02:11:42,596
No. Hal, for God's sakes,
just take your finger off the trigger.

1359
02:11:42,796 --> 02:11:43,896
Are you hostages?

1360
02:11:45,197 --> 02:11:46,497
Who's out there?

1361
02:11:46,896 --> 02:11:48,896
-Who's by that truck?
-Harry, the lights!

1362
02:11:53,296 --> 02:11:55,196
John Coffey.

1363
02:11:55,697 --> 02:11:56,696
Halt!

1364
02:11:56,897 --> 02:11:59,197
-Stay where you are!
-Take it easy, now.

1365
02:11:59,596 --> 02:12:01,496
-Don't you move!
-Wait!

1366
02:12:01,696 --> 02:12:02,996
I'm warning you.

1367
02:12:03,197 --> 02:12:04,696
Halt or i'll shoot!

1368
02:12:04,996 --> 02:12:06,896
-I said halt!
-Hal, put the gun down!

1369
02:12:12,597 --> 02:12:15,096
Who are you talking to down there?

1370
02:12:15,396 --> 02:12:16,396
Goddamn it!

1371
02:12:16,596 --> 02:12:20,997
Now, nobody is hurt.
And we are here to help.

1372
02:12:21,197 --> 02:12:24,396
Help what? I don't understand.

1373
02:12:24,596 --> 02:12:27,497
You're just gonna have to trust me.

1374
02:12:44,097 --> 02:12:45,596
What do you want?

1375
02:12:48,196 --> 02:12:50,196
Make them go away!

1376
02:12:51,096 --> 02:12:54,896
I don't want no salesmen...

1377
02:12:55,096 --> 02:12:56,896
...in the middle of the night.

1378
02:12:57,496 --> 02:13:01,196
Tell them to take a flying fuck
at a rolling....

1379
02:13:01,396 --> 02:13:02,796
Just to help.

1380
02:13:03,496 --> 02:13:06,296
Just to help, boss. That's all.

1381
02:13:06,996 --> 02:13:10,196
You can't. No one can.

1382
02:13:21,596 --> 02:13:23,997
-Stay out of here!
-Don't you go in there!

1383
02:13:24,296 --> 02:13:27,196
-Whoever you are, just stay out!
-Don't you do it!

1384
02:13:27,796 --> 02:13:30,396
I'm not dressed for visitors.

1385
02:13:32,096 --> 02:13:34,596
You stop now. You hear me?

1386
02:13:35,296 --> 02:13:37,996
-Paul, I don't want him up there.
-Boss...

1387
02:13:38,296 --> 02:13:40,396
...you just be quiet now.

1388
02:14:28,196 --> 02:14:30,596
lt's all right, Hal. lt's all right.

1389
02:14:30,796 --> 02:14:33,295
Hal, watch. Just watch him.

1390
02:14:39,495 --> 02:14:42,096
Don't come near me, pig-fucker.

1391
02:14:55,996 --> 02:14:58,295
Why do you have so many scars?

1392
02:15:01,096 --> 02:15:03,396
Who hurt you so badly?

1393
02:15:04,996 --> 02:15:07,296
Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

1394
02:15:09,795 --> 02:15:11,596
What's your name?

1395
02:15:12,195 --> 02:15:15,396
John Coffey, ma'am.
Like the drink...

1396
02:15:15,696 --> 02:15:18,095
...only not spelt the same.

1397
02:15:24,695 --> 02:15:25,795
Ma'am?

1398
02:15:33,795 --> 02:15:35,796
Yes, John Coffey?

1399
02:15:37,496 --> 02:15:39,095
I see it.

1400
02:15:39,696 --> 02:15:40,896
I see it.

1401
02:15:48,096 --> 02:15:50,695
What's happening?

1402
02:15:51,995 --> 02:15:56,195
You be still now.
You be so quiet and so still.

1403
02:17:22,895 --> 02:17:25,395
Come on, John. Sick it up.

1404
02:17:25,695 --> 02:17:27,895
Come on. Cough it out
like you done before.

1405
02:17:29,495 --> 02:17:33,295
He's choking. Whatever he sucked out
of her, he's choking on it.

1406
02:17:36,495 --> 02:17:39,095
I'll be fine. Just let me be.

1407
02:17:52,895 --> 02:17:54,094
How did i get here?

1408
02:17:58,595 --> 02:18:01,595
We were going to the hospital
in Vicksburg.

1409
02:18:01,895 --> 02:18:03,195
Remember?

1410
02:18:04,494 --> 02:18:05,795
Melly...

1411
02:18:06,295 --> 02:18:08,095
...it doesn't matter.

1412
02:18:08,895 --> 02:18:10,395
lt doesn't matter anymore.

1413
02:18:10,595 --> 02:18:13,195
Did i have the x-ray?

1414
02:18:13,894 --> 02:18:15,395
Did l?

1415
02:18:18,094 --> 02:18:19,294
Yes.

1416
02:18:20,194 --> 02:18:24,195
Yes. lt was clear.
There was no tumor.

1417
02:18:41,895 --> 02:18:43,194
Can you stand up?

1418
02:18:43,394 --> 02:18:45,394
Can you turn around and see this lady?

1419
02:18:57,894 --> 02:18:59,495
What's your name?

1420
02:19:00,795 --> 02:19:02,995
John Coffey, ma'am.

1421
02:19:04,394 --> 02:19:06,095
Like the drink.

1422
02:19:07,494 --> 02:19:09,594
Only not spelt the same.

1423
02:19:09,995 --> 02:19:13,694
No, ma'am, not spelt the same at all.

1424
02:19:18,495 --> 02:19:19,994
No, you can't.

1425
02:19:44,595 --> 02:19:46,695
I dreamed of you.

1426
02:19:49,494 --> 02:19:52,394
I dreamed you were wandering
in the dark.

1427
02:19:53,894 --> 02:19:55,794
And so was l.

1428
02:19:57,694 --> 02:19:59,794
And we found each other.

1429
02:20:00,794 --> 02:20:03,394
We found each other in the dark.

1430
02:20:22,894 --> 02:20:24,595
Take it, John. lt's a present.

1431
02:20:24,994 --> 02:20:27,094
lt's St. Christopher.

1432
02:20:28,394 --> 02:20:30,594
I want you to have it, Mr. Coffey.

1433
02:20:31,394 --> 02:20:33,894
And wear it. He'll keep you safe.

1434
02:20:34,294 --> 02:20:35,794
Please.

1435
02:20:36,195 --> 02:20:37,894
Wear it for me.

1436
02:20:52,394 --> 02:20:54,194
Thank you, ma'am.

1437
02:20:56,294 --> 02:20:58,194
Thank you, John.

1438
02:21:04,794 --> 02:21:09,695
Christ, he goes down, it'll take three
mules and a crane to pick him up again.

1439
02:21:09,894 --> 02:21:13,694
Take it easy, John.
You gotta stay on your feet.

1440
02:21:29,394 --> 02:21:32,394
He'll never sit in Old Sparky.
You know that, don't you?

1441
02:21:32,793 --> 02:21:34,893
He swallowed that stuff for a reason.

1442
02:21:35,794 --> 02:21:37,894
I give him a few days.

1443
02:21:38,194 --> 02:21:41,694
One of us will do a cell check,
and he'll be dead on his bunk.

1444
02:21:41,894 --> 02:21:44,594
Well, if that's his choice,
he's earned it.

1445
02:21:44,794 --> 02:21:46,994
Let's just get him back on the Mile.

1446
02:22:00,894 --> 02:22:03,394
Am i happy to see you.
You were gone so long.

1447
02:22:03,694 --> 02:22:05,694
Wild Bill's making noise
like he's waking up.

1448
02:22:05,994 --> 02:22:06,994
What happened to him?

1449
02:22:07,393 --> 02:22:10,493
He's hurting, Dean. He's hurting bad.

1450
02:22:13,894 --> 02:22:15,494
Okay, John.

1451
02:22:17,294 --> 02:22:20,993
We're gonna set you down
on your bed now. Here we go.

1452
02:22:38,993 --> 02:22:40,094
Well?

1453
02:22:41,993 --> 02:22:43,893
What about Mrs. Moores?

1454
02:22:45,894 --> 02:22:47,894
Was it like the mouse?

1455
02:22:49,193 --> 02:22:50,293
Was it...

1456
02:22:52,293 --> 02:22:55,294
...you know, a miracle?

1457
02:22:57,994 --> 02:23:00,194
Yes, it was.

1458
02:23:00,693 --> 02:23:01,793
Damn!

1459
02:23:17,593 --> 02:23:18,793
Now...

1460
02:23:19,394 --> 02:23:22,093
...I want to talk, not shout.

1461
02:23:22,294 --> 02:23:25,594
I take that tape off,
you gonna be calm?

1462
02:23:27,794 --> 02:23:30,993
My mama always said you do it fast,
it won't hurt so much.

1463
02:23:34,693 --> 02:23:36,493
Guess she was wrong.

1464
02:23:39,693 --> 02:23:41,294
Let me out of this nut-coat.

1465
02:23:41,493 --> 02:23:42,793
-ln a minute.
-Now!

1466
02:23:43,093 --> 02:23:44,793
Right now! I want out now!

1467
02:23:49,293 --> 02:23:51,293
Shut up and listen.

1468
02:23:52,093 --> 02:23:55,994
You deserved to be punished for what
you did to Del. Accept it like a man.

1469
02:23:56,693 --> 02:23:59,194
Or else we'll make you sorry
you were ever born.

1470
02:23:59,693 --> 02:24:04,194
We'll tell people how you
sabotaged Del's execution...

1471
02:24:04,394 --> 02:24:08,594
...and pissed yourself like a frightened
little girl. Yes, we will talk.

1472
02:24:09,694 --> 02:24:11,193
But, Percy...

1473
02:24:11,893 --> 02:24:13,893
...you mind me now.

1474
02:24:14,393 --> 02:24:18,393
We'll also see you beaten
within an inch of your life.

1475
02:24:19,893 --> 02:24:21,194
We know people too.

1476
02:24:22,693 --> 02:24:24,993
Are you so foolish,
you don't realize that?

1477
02:24:27,493 --> 02:24:30,594
Let bygones be bygones.

1478
02:24:31,594 --> 02:24:34,293
Nothing's hurt so far but your pride.

1479
02:24:34,694 --> 02:24:38,894
No one ever need know about that,
except the people in this little room.

1480
02:24:39,293 --> 02:24:42,793
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile.

1481
02:24:43,793 --> 02:24:45,194
Always has.

1482
02:24:54,393 --> 02:24:56,893
May i be let out of this coat now?

1483
02:25:16,793 --> 02:25:17,993
My things?

1484
02:25:21,093 --> 02:25:23,093
Think it over, Percy.

1485
02:25:23,893 --> 02:25:25,793
I intend to.

1486
02:25:26,693 --> 02:25:29,693
I intend to think it over very hard.

1487
02:25:31,493 --> 02:25:32,993
Starting right now.

1488
02:25:42,993 --> 02:25:46,393
He'll talk. Sooner or later.

1489
02:26:00,792 --> 02:26:02,993
-Hey, let him go!
-John, let go!

1490
02:26:03,193 --> 02:26:04,193
Let go, John!

1491
02:26:04,493 --> 02:26:06,293
John, goddamn it! Let him go!

1492
02:26:06,493 --> 02:26:07,393
Let go, John! No!

1493
02:26:09,293 --> 02:26:10,292
Back off!

1494
02:26:11,092 --> 02:26:12,693
John, stop it!

1495
02:26:13,392 --> 02:26:14,793
Let him go! Back off!

1496
02:26:14,993 --> 02:26:15,993
John, let him go!

1497
02:26:31,993 --> 02:26:33,593
Oh, my God!

1498
02:27:16,993 --> 02:27:19,793
Easy, now. Easy.

1499
02:27:20,993 --> 02:27:22,392
Easy.

1500
02:27:32,992 --> 02:27:34,493
Are you all right?

1501
02:28:07,193 --> 02:28:09,293
Boy, what you looking at?

1502
02:28:17,192 --> 02:28:20,892
What you looking at? You limp noodle.

1503
02:28:21,192 --> 02:28:25,392
You wanna kiss my ass?
You wanna suck my dick?

1504
02:28:46,792 --> 02:28:48,992
Grab the gun! Grab the gun!

1505
02:29:51,392 --> 02:29:53,892
I punished them bad men.

1506
02:29:54,492 --> 02:29:56,191
I punished them both.

1507
02:29:56,392 --> 02:29:57,692
Why?

1508
02:29:58,592 --> 02:29:59,892
Why Wild Bill?

1509
02:30:01,192 --> 02:30:05,492
I saw in his heart
when he grabbed my arm.

1510
02:30:06,392 --> 02:30:08,292
I saw what Wild Billy'd done.

1511
02:30:08,891 --> 02:30:11,292
Saw it plain as day.

1512
02:30:12,392 --> 02:30:15,292
You can't hide what's in your heart.

1513
02:30:15,592 --> 02:30:16,792
What?

1514
02:30:18,592 --> 02:30:19,792
You saw what?

1515
02:30:23,692 --> 02:30:25,792
Take my hand, boss.

1516
02:30:28,891 --> 02:30:30,691
You see for yourself.

1517
02:30:34,392 --> 02:30:35,492
No.

1518
02:30:39,492 --> 02:30:40,892
Please.

1519
02:30:49,292 --> 02:30:50,992
No, no.

1520
02:30:51,891 --> 02:30:52,791
Please.

1521
02:30:52,991 --> 02:30:57,592
I gots to, boss. I gots to
give you a little bit of myself.

1522
02:30:59,392 --> 02:31:00,792
A gift.

1523
02:31:02,191 --> 02:31:06,391
A gift of what's inside of me
so you can see for yourself.

1524
02:32:04,191 --> 02:32:05,591
Suppertime!

1525
02:32:05,991 --> 02:32:07,792
Bring the girls!

1526
02:32:11,291 --> 02:32:14,192
Girls! You heard your mama!

1527
02:32:15,092 --> 02:32:17,791
Yes, Papa! We're coming!

1528
02:32:36,192 --> 02:32:39,691
Come on, Billy.
I worked you enough for one day.

1529
02:32:40,091 --> 02:32:41,791
Come get you some supper.

1530
02:32:44,791 --> 02:32:48,991
God is great, God is good,
and we thank You....

1531
02:33:13,391 --> 02:33:18,090
You love your sister? You make
any noise, you know what happens?

1532
02:33:18,291 --> 02:33:20,391
I'm gonna kill her instead of you.

1533
02:33:20,591 --> 02:33:24,091
You make any noise,
I'm gonna kill her. You understand?

1534
02:33:24,291 --> 02:33:25,991
You understand?

1535
02:33:44,491 --> 02:33:48,490
He killed them with they love,
they love for each other.

1536
02:33:49,690 --> 02:33:52,091
Now you see how it is.

1537
02:33:53,391 --> 02:33:56,291
That's the way it is every day.

1538
02:33:56,491 --> 02:34:00,691
That's the way it is all over the world.

1539
02:34:10,891 --> 02:34:11,891
Percy.

1540
02:34:12,091 --> 02:34:13,391
Percy Wetmore.

1541
02:34:14,291 --> 02:34:15,291
Son?

1542
02:34:18,391 --> 02:34:19,691
Son?

1543
02:34:20,391 --> 02:34:23,290
-Son, can you hear me?
-Speak up if you can hear us.

1544
02:34:24,391 --> 02:34:27,390
I think this boy's cheese
slid off his cracker.

1545
02:34:29,191 --> 02:34:32,091
Percy, i got to ask you
a few questions.

1546
02:34:32,390 --> 02:34:35,590
One minute, he was fine,
and the next, blammo!

1547
02:34:35,890 --> 02:34:38,291
Dirty bastard grabbed him
through the bars.

1548
02:34:38,491 --> 02:34:40,691
Scared the boy so bad, he wet hisself.

1549
02:34:41,990 --> 02:34:44,891
See, we didn't even see it happen.

1550
02:34:48,891 --> 02:34:52,191
I'll cover for you as much as i can...

1551
02:34:52,390 --> 02:34:54,690
...even if it means my job.

1552
02:34:55,390 --> 02:34:57,191
But i have to know...

1553
02:34:57,590 --> 02:35:00,790
...does this have anything to do
with what happened at my house?

1554
02:35:03,691 --> 02:35:05,290
Does it, Paul?

1555
02:35:07,190 --> 02:35:08,390
No.

1556
02:36:35,890 --> 02:36:39,690
Does Hal know?
That Coffey's innocent, I mean.

1557
02:36:40,890 --> 02:36:42,690
Well, can he help?

1558
02:36:43,190 --> 02:36:45,990
Does he have the influence to do
something about this?

1559
02:36:46,190 --> 02:36:47,790
Stop the execution?

1560
02:36:47,990 --> 02:36:48,990
No.

1561
02:36:52,190 --> 02:36:53,690
Then don't tell him.

1562
02:36:54,290 --> 02:36:56,590
lf it can't help, don't tell him.

1563
02:36:56,890 --> 02:36:58,190
Ever.

1564
02:37:00,490 --> 02:37:01,990
I won't.

1565
02:37:13,690 --> 02:37:16,090
There's no way out of this for you,
is there?

1566
02:37:17,590 --> 02:37:18,890
No.

1567
02:37:19,990 --> 02:37:22,490
And i've been thinking about it,
believe me.

1568
02:37:22,690 --> 02:37:26,089
I've been running it through my head
any number of ways.

1569
02:37:28,490 --> 02:37:30,590
I'll tell you the truth, honey.

1570
02:37:32,090 --> 02:37:36,990
I've done some things in my life
that i am not proud of...

1571
02:37:37,589 --> 02:37:42,390
...but this is the first time i've
ever felt real danger of hell.

1572
02:37:43,390 --> 02:37:44,790
Hell?

1573
02:37:50,690 --> 02:37:52,289
Talk to him.

1574
02:37:53,489 --> 02:37:55,290
Talk to John.

1575
02:37:57,090 --> 02:37:59,090
Find out what he wants.

1576
02:38:15,990 --> 02:38:17,290
Hello, boss.

1577
02:38:18,290 --> 02:38:19,589
Hello, John.

1578
02:38:20,990 --> 02:38:23,390
I guess you know we're
coming down to it now.

1579
02:38:24,190 --> 02:38:25,889
Another couple of days.

1580
02:38:39,489 --> 02:38:42,290
ls there anything special
you wanna eat that night?

1581
02:38:42,689 --> 02:38:44,989
We can rustle you up most anything.

1582
02:38:55,289 --> 02:38:59,990
Meat loaf be nice.
Mashed taters, gravy.

1583
02:39:00,190 --> 02:39:01,589
Okra.

1584
02:39:02,689 --> 02:39:05,589
Maybe some of that fine corn bread
your missus make...

1585
02:39:06,390 --> 02:39:08,490
...if she don't mind.

1586
02:39:10,789 --> 02:39:12,189
Now...

1587
02:39:12,690 --> 02:39:17,589
...what about a preacher?
Somebody to say a little prayer with.

1588
02:39:17,790 --> 02:39:19,990
Don't want no preacher.

1589
02:39:20,990 --> 02:39:23,489
You can say a prayer, if you like.

1590
02:39:24,190 --> 02:39:25,290
Me?

1591
02:39:28,290 --> 02:39:31,189
Suppose i could, if it came to that.

1592
02:39:39,389 --> 02:39:42,189
I have to ask you something
very important now.

1593
02:39:43,789 --> 02:39:45,989
I know what you gonna say.

1594
02:39:46,489 --> 02:39:47,989
You don't have to say it.

1595
02:39:48,390 --> 02:39:51,689
No, I do. I do.
I have to say it.

1596
02:39:55,590 --> 02:39:57,989
Tell me what you want me to do.

1597
02:39:58,889 --> 02:40:00,890
You want me to take you out of here?

1598
02:40:02,089 --> 02:40:06,090
Just let you run away?
See how far you could get?

1599
02:40:07,589 --> 02:40:10,290
Why would you do such a foolish thing?

1600
02:40:12,289 --> 02:40:14,389
On the day of my judgment...

1601
02:40:15,189 --> 02:40:17,389
...when I stand before God...

1602
02:40:17,590 --> 02:40:21,389
...and He asks me why did l...

1603
02:40:21,589 --> 02:40:24,289
...did i kill one of His true...

1604
02:40:25,189 --> 02:40:26,689
...miracles...

1605
02:40:27,889 --> 02:40:30,089
...what am i going to say?

1606
02:40:30,989 --> 02:40:32,689
That it was my job?

1607
02:40:34,889 --> 02:40:36,889
lt's my job.

1608
02:40:37,189 --> 02:40:41,789
You tell God the Father
it was a kindness you done.

1609
02:40:44,989 --> 02:40:47,589
I know you're hurting and worrying.

1610
02:40:48,189 --> 02:40:51,889
I can feel it on you.
But you ought to quit on it now.

1611
02:40:53,089 --> 02:40:56,089
I want it to be over and done with.

1612
02:40:56,789 --> 02:40:58,189
I do.

1613
02:41:02,689 --> 02:41:04,689
I'm tired, boss.

1614
02:41:06,089 --> 02:41:10,489
Tired of being on the road,
lonely as a sparrow in the rain.

1615
02:41:11,689 --> 02:41:14,389
I'm tired of never having me
a buddy to be with...

1616
02:41:14,989 --> 02:41:19,588
...to tell me where we's going to,
coming from, or why.

1617
02:41:20,389 --> 02:41:24,688
Mostly, I'm tired of people
being ugly to each other.

1618
02:41:25,788 --> 02:41:29,689
I'm tired of all the pain
I feel and hear in the world...

1619
02:41:29,988 --> 02:41:31,589
...every day.

1620
02:41:31,989 --> 02:41:33,989
There's too much of it.

1621
02:41:34,288 --> 02:41:38,089
lt's like pieces of glass
in my head...

1622
02:41:38,288 --> 02:41:40,588
...all the time.

1623
02:41:42,089 --> 02:41:44,189
Can you understand?

1624
02:41:47,089 --> 02:41:50,088
Yes, John, I think i can.

1625
02:41:52,489 --> 02:41:55,889
Well, there must be something
we can do for you, John.

1626
02:41:57,989 --> 02:42:00,089
There must be something that you want.

1627
02:42:09,489 --> 02:42:13,988
I ain't never seen me a flicker show.

1628
02:42:14,489 --> 02:42:16,589
Heaven

1629
02:42:16,789 --> 02:42:18,989
I'm in heaven

1630
02:42:19,889 --> 02:42:24,688
And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak

1631
02:42:26,588 --> 02:42:31,389
And I seem to find
The happiness I seek

1632
02:42:32,988 --> 02:42:37,789
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek

1633
02:43:39,888 --> 02:43:42,288
Why, they's angels.

1634
02:43:43,288 --> 02:43:45,889
Angels, just like up in heaven.

1635
02:44:46,588 --> 02:44:48,588
I'll be all right, fellas.

1636
02:44:49,988 --> 02:44:52,188
This here's the hard part.

1637
02:44:53,588 --> 02:44:55,087
I'll be all right in a while.

1638
02:44:57,888 --> 02:45:00,788
I should have this just for now.

1639
02:45:04,788 --> 02:45:07,188
I'll give it back after.

1640
02:45:10,288 --> 02:45:14,888
You know, i fell asleep this afternoon
and had me a dream.

1641
02:45:16,087 --> 02:45:18,187
l dreamed about Del's mouse.

1642
02:45:19,287 --> 02:45:20,588
Did you, John?

1643
02:45:21,287 --> 02:45:25,788
l dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to
that place Boss Howell talked about.

1644
02:45:25,988 --> 02:45:28,288
That Mouseville place.

1645
02:45:28,488 --> 02:45:30,888
I dreamed there's kids.

1646
02:45:31,388 --> 02:45:34,887
And how they laughed
at his tricks. My!

1647
02:45:37,388 --> 02:45:41,187
I dreamed that those two little
blonde-headed girls was there.

1648
02:45:41,388 --> 02:45:43,187
They's laughing too.

1649
02:45:43,387 --> 02:45:46,387
I put my arms around them
and set them on my knees.

1650
02:45:46,587 --> 02:45:50,587
And they was no blood coming out
of they hair, and they's just fine.

1651
02:45:50,888 --> 02:45:54,188
We all watched Mr. Jingles
roll that spool.

1652
02:45:55,688 --> 02:45:59,187
How we did laugh.
Fit to bust, we was!

1653
02:46:17,388 --> 02:46:21,488
They's lots of folks here
that hate me. Lots!

1654
02:46:23,387 --> 02:46:25,487
I can feel it.

1655
02:46:25,688 --> 02:46:27,387
lt's like bees stinging me.

1656
02:46:27,688 --> 02:46:30,088
Well, feel how we feel, then.

1657
02:46:31,387 --> 02:46:32,587
We don't hate you.

1658
02:46:33,988 --> 02:46:35,587
Can you feel that?

1659
02:46:37,787 --> 02:46:39,987
Kill him twice, you boys!

1660
02:46:40,787 --> 02:46:44,788
You go on and kill that raping
babykiller twice!

1661
02:46:44,987 --> 02:46:46,788
That'd be fine!

1662
02:47:03,488 --> 02:47:05,987
Wipe your face before
you stand up, Dean.

1663
02:47:06,187 --> 02:47:07,487
Yes, sir.

1664
02:47:19,687 --> 02:47:20,787
Roll on one.

1665
02:47:28,788 --> 02:47:32,287
Does it hurt yet? I hope it does.

1666
02:47:33,087 --> 02:47:35,387
I hope it hurts like hell.

1667
02:47:37,387 --> 02:47:39,887
John Coffey, you've been condemned
to die in the electric chair...

1668
02:47:40,188 --> 02:47:41,388
...by a jury of your peers.

1669
02:47:41,687 --> 02:47:45,087
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1670
02:47:45,488 --> 02:47:48,787
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1671
02:47:50,487 --> 02:47:52,987
I'm sorry for what i am.

1672
02:48:04,987 --> 02:48:06,787
Please, boss...

1673
02:48:08,187 --> 02:48:10,887
...don't put that thing over my face.

1674
02:48:12,087 --> 02:48:14,387
Don't put me in the dark.

1675
02:48:15,187 --> 02:48:17,487
I's afraid of the dark.

1676
02:48:27,187 --> 02:48:28,887
All right, John.

1677
02:48:49,087 --> 02:48:52,087
Heaven, I'm in heaven

1678
02:48:52,287 --> 02:48:55,087
Heaven, heaven

1679
02:48:55,287 --> 02:48:57,187
I'm in heaven

1680
02:48:57,687 --> 02:49:00,287
Heaven, heaven

1681
02:49:00,587 --> 02:49:02,287
I'm in heaven

1682
02:49:23,187 --> 02:49:24,787
John Coffey...

1683
02:49:25,787 --> 02:49:28,987
...electricity shall pass through
your body until you are dead...

1684
02:49:29,187 --> 02:49:31,287
...in accordance with state law.

1685
02:49:33,687 --> 02:49:37,387
May God have mercy on your soul.

1686
02:50:16,087 --> 02:50:18,087
You have to say it.

1687
02:50:19,686 --> 02:50:21,986
You have to give the order.

1688
02:50:40,087 --> 02:50:42,387
He killed them with they love.

1689
02:50:42,586 --> 02:50:47,387
That's how it is every day
all over the world.

1690
02:51:01,187 --> 02:51:02,586
Roll on two.

1691
02:52:47,286 --> 02:52:50,686
It was the last execution
I ever took part in.

1692
02:52:50,986 --> 02:52:54,686
I just couldn't do it anymore
after that. Brutal either.

1693
02:52:55,886 --> 02:53:00,586
We both transferred out,
took jobs with Boys' Correctional.

1694
02:53:00,786 --> 02:53:02,586
lt was all right.

1695
02:53:03,186 --> 02:53:06,086
"Catch them young" became my motto.

1696
02:53:09,386 --> 02:53:10,486
You don't believe me.

1697
02:53:11,386 --> 02:53:13,886
I don't imagine you'd lie to me, Paul.

1698
02:53:14,686 --> 02:53:16,886
-lt's just that--
-lt's quite a story.

1699
02:53:17,086 --> 02:53:19,286
lt's quite a story.

1700
02:53:19,685 --> 02:53:22,086
One thing i don't understand.

1701
02:53:22,286 --> 02:53:24,086
You said you and Jan...

1702
02:53:24,286 --> 02:53:27,885
...had a grown son in 1 935.

1703
02:53:28,186 --> 02:53:29,686
ls that right?

1704
02:53:29,985 --> 02:53:31,986
The math doesn't work, does it?

1705
02:53:37,686 --> 02:53:40,286
Do you feel up to taking a walk?

1706
02:54:00,886 --> 02:54:02,385
Watch your step.

1707
02:54:02,886 --> 02:54:05,186
Now let your eyes adjust.

1708
02:54:17,085 --> 02:54:18,085
There.

1709
02:54:21,886 --> 02:54:23,585
Wake up, old fella.

1710
02:54:23,886 --> 02:54:25,186
Wake up.

1711
02:54:28,685 --> 02:54:32,586
Paul, it isn't. lt can't be.

1712
02:54:36,786 --> 02:54:38,085
Come over here, boy.

1713
02:54:38,586 --> 02:54:40,986
Come on over here and see this lady.

1714
02:54:43,886 --> 02:54:46,885
That can't be Mr. Jingles.

1715
02:55:09,585 --> 02:55:12,186
Go on, you can do it.

1716
02:55:19,285 --> 02:55:23,786
This isn't exactly the Mouseville
we had in mind, is it?

1717
02:55:24,585 --> 02:55:28,485
But we make do. Don't we, old fella?

1718
02:55:34,985 --> 02:55:38,586
I think Mr. Jingles
happened by accident.

1719
02:55:39,085 --> 02:55:43,885
I think when we electrocuted Del,
and it all went so badly...

1720
02:55:44,085 --> 02:55:46,485
...well, John could feel that,
you know.

1721
02:55:46,685 --> 02:55:50,086
And i think a part of...

1722
02:55:50,385 --> 02:55:52,985
...whatever magic was inside of him...

1723
02:55:53,285 --> 02:55:56,585
...just leapt into my tiny friend here.

1724
02:55:57,785 --> 02:55:59,785
As for me...

1725
02:56:00,985 --> 02:56:03,485
...John had to give me
a part of himself...

1726
02:56:03,785 --> 02:56:05,985
...a gift, the way he saw it...

1727
02:56:06,285 --> 02:56:09,785
...so that i could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.

1728
02:56:12,185 --> 02:56:14,385
When John did that...

1729
02:56:15,785 --> 02:56:18,185
...when he took my hand...

1730
02:56:19,185 --> 02:56:23,085
...a part of the power
that worked through him...

1731
02:56:23,985 --> 02:56:25,885
...spilled into me.

1732
02:56:26,185 --> 02:56:28,085
He...what?

1733
02:56:28,485 --> 02:56:31,984
He infected you with life?

1734
02:56:33,585 --> 02:56:35,985
lt's as good a word as any.

1735
02:56:37,485 --> 02:56:40,384
He infected us both,
didn't he, Mr. Jingles?

1736
02:56:40,585 --> 02:56:41,985
With life.

1737
02:56:46,085 --> 02:56:49,185
I'm 1 08 years old, Elaine.

1738
02:56:49,385 --> 02:56:53,785
I was 44 the year that John Coffey
walked the Green Mile.

1739
02:56:56,685 --> 02:57:00,485
You mustn't blame John.
He couldn't help what happened.

1740
02:57:00,685 --> 02:57:05,285
He was just a force of nature.

1741
02:57:05,684 --> 02:57:09,884
I've lived to see
some amazing things, Ellie.

1742
02:57:10,985 --> 02:57:13,884
Another century come to pass.

1743
02:57:16,685 --> 02:57:21,085
But i've had to see my friends and
loved ones die off through the years.

1744
02:57:21,485 --> 02:57:23,585
Hal and Melinda...

1745
02:57:23,985 --> 02:57:25,384
...Brutus Howell...

1746
02:57:25,584 --> 02:57:28,285
...my wife, my boy.

1747
02:57:31,185 --> 02:57:33,085
And you, Elaine.

1748
02:57:34,084 --> 02:57:35,884
You'll die too.

1749
02:57:37,385 --> 02:57:41,785
And my curse is knowing
that i'll be there to see it.

1750
02:57:43,284 --> 02:57:45,685
lt's my atonement, you see.

1751
02:57:46,284 --> 02:57:47,985
lt's my punishment...

1752
02:57:48,185 --> 02:57:50,784
...for letting John Coffey
ride the lightning.

1753
02:57:52,485 --> 02:57:55,285
For killing a miracle of God.

1754
02:57:56,784 --> 02:57:59,585
Almighty, everlasting God...

1755
02:57:59,885 --> 02:58:02,284
...the source of all being and life.

1756
02:58:02,485 --> 02:58:06,785
You'll be gone like all the others.
I'll have to stay.

1757
02:58:08,785 --> 02:58:12,985
I'll die eventually.
Of that I'm sure.

1758
02:58:13,784 --> 02:58:17,784
I have no illusions of immortality.

1759
02:58:18,184 --> 02:58:20,585
But I will have wished for death...

1760
02:58:21,385 --> 02:58:23,585
...long before death finds me.

1761
02:58:24,685 --> 02:58:28,484
In truth, I wish for it already.

1762
02:58:40,585 --> 02:58:42,585
Mr. Jingles?

1763
02:58:51,584 --> 02:58:53,684
Where you been?

1764
02:58:54,185 --> 02:58:57,385
Been worried about you, boy.
You hungry?

1765
02:58:58,285 --> 02:59:00,684
Let's see if we can find you
something to eat.

1766
02:59:01,784 --> 02:59:05,585
A few crumbs anyway.
I know you'd like that.

1767
02:59:06,984 --> 02:59:08,284
Look at you.

1768
02:59:09,985 --> 02:59:13,884
I lie in bed most nights
thinking about it.

1769
02:59:14,085 --> 02:59:16,185
And I wait.

1770
02:59:17,084 --> 02:59:19,784
I think about all the people
I've loved...

1771
02:59:19,984 --> 02:59:22,184
...now long gone.

1772
02:59:22,884 --> 02:59:25,384
I think about my beautiful Jan...

1773
02:59:25,585 --> 02:59:28,584
...how I lost her so many years ago.

1774
02:59:29,984 --> 02:59:34,584
And I think about all of us walking
our own Green Mile...

1775
02:59:34,784 --> 02:59:37,484
...each in our own time.

1776
02:59:38,484 --> 02:59:41,684
But one thought
more than any other...

1777
02:59:41,884 --> 02:59:44,584
...keeps me awake most nights:

1778
02:59:45,684 --> 02:59:49,685
If he could make a mouse
live so long...

1779
02:59:50,184 --> 02:59:53,284
...how much longer do I have?

1780
02:59:56,584 --> 02:59:59,384
We each owe a death.

1781
02:59:59,584 --> 03:00:02,084
There are no exceptions.

1782
03:00:02,784 --> 03:00:04,784
But, oh, God...

1783
03:00:05,684 --> 03:00:07,484
...sometimes...

1784
03:00:08,084 --> 03:00:11,684
...the Green Mile seems so long.

1785
03:00:11,685 --> 03:00:20,685
