1
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:26,610
Well, my dear...

2
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:29,837
So how are you adapting
to the world outside?

3
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:31,107
Very well, I think.

4
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:36,083
I've advised her to watch and learn
and be quiet except when spoken to.

5
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,153
We must see what we can devise
for your amusement.

6
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,401
Valmont is here.

7
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,934
You receive him, do you?

8
00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:58,409
Yes.

9
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:00,011
So do you.

10
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:06,247
Monsieur le Vicomte, my child...

11
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:08,609
...whom you very probably
don't remember...

12
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:11,118
...except that he is
conspicuously charming...

13
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:15,453
...never opens his mouth without first
calculating what damage he can do.

14
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:17,957
Then why do you receive him, maman?

15
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:20,189
Everyone receives him.

16
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:38,916
Madame.

17
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,540
What a pleasant surprise.

18
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:44,084
Madame de Volanges.
How delightful to see you.

19
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:47,987
You remember my daughter, Cecile?

20
00:05:48,193 --> 00:05:51,788
Well, indeed, but who could have
foretold she would flower so gracefully?

21
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:56,929
I wanted to call on you
before leaving the city.

22
00:05:57,335 --> 00:05:58,233
Oh...

23
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,132
I'm not sure we can allow that.
Why should you want to leave?

24
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:03,306
Paris in August, you know...

25
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:05,568
...and is time I paid a visit
on my aunt.

26
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:07,771
I've neglected her disgracefully.

27
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,412
Madame de Rosemonde
has been good enough...

28
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:12,015
...to invite us to stay at the chteau.

29
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:14,811
Won't you please give her
our warmest regards?

30
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:16,750
I shall make a point of it, Madame.

31
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:20,752
I think is time we took you home.

32
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:24,859
I'm used to being in bed
by nine at the convent.

33
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,654
So I should hope.

34
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:46,708
Your aunt?

35
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:48,112
Thas correct.

36
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:52,345
I thought she'd already made
arrangements to leave you all her money.

37
00:06:57,028 --> 00:06:59,223
Do you know why I summoned you
here this evening?

38
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:01,989
I'd hoped it might be for
the pleasure of my company.

39
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:03,801
I need you...

40
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:06,334
...to carry out an heroic enterprise.

41
00:07:08,406 --> 00:07:10,567
You remember when Bastide left me?

42
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:11,568
Yes.

43
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:14,771
And went off with that fat mistress
of yours whose name escapes me.

44
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,039
Yes.

45
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:19,139
No one has ever done that to me before.
Or to you, I suspect.

46
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,876
I was quite relieved
to be rid of her, frankly.

47
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:23,079
No, you weren't.

48
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:29,925
For some years now,
Bastide has been searching for a wife.

49
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:34,657
He was always unshakably prejudiced
in favour of convent education.

50
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:37,257
And now he's found the ideal candidate.

51
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:41,063
Cecile Volanges.

52
00:07:41,272 --> 00:07:42,705
Very good.

53
00:07:45,844 --> 00:07:47,675
And her 60,000 a year.

54
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:51,512
That must have played some small part
in Bastide's calculations.

55
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,642
None whatsoever.

56
00:07:53,952 --> 00:07:56,443
Bastide's priority, you see...

57
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:59,079
...is a guaranteed virtue.

58
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:04,685
I wonder if I'm beginning to guess
what it is you're intending to propose.

59
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:10,630
Bastide is with his regiment in Corsica
for the rest of the year.

60
00:08:10,702 --> 00:08:12,761
That should give you plenty of time.

61
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:16,965
You mean to?

62
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:21,044
- She's a rosebud.
- You think so?

63
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:22,973
And he'd get back from his honeymoon...

64
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:25,448
...to find himself the laughing stock
of Paris.

65
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,744
- Well...
- Yes.

66
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:31,812
Love and revenge.
Two of your favourites.

67
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,620
No, I can't.

68
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:38,723
What?

69
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:40,458
Oh really, I can't.

70
00:08:40,632 --> 00:08:42,930
- Why not?
- Oh, is too easy.

71
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,637
It is.

72
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:48,102
She's seen nothing.

73
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:51,174
She knows nothing.
She's bound to be curious.

74
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:52,341
She'd be on her back...

75
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,174
...before he'd unwrapped
the first bunch of flowers.

76
00:08:56,781 --> 00:08:59,579
Any one of a dozen men could manage it.

77
00:08:59,684 --> 00:09:02,278
I have my reputation to think of.

78
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:13,625
I can see I'm going to have
to tell you everything.

79
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:15,129
Of course you are.

80
00:09:16,234 --> 00:09:19,431
My aunt is not on her own
just at the moment.

81
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:21,334
She has a young friend staying with her.

82
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,441
Madame de Tourvel.

83
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,407
You can't mean it.

84
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:35,008
To seduce a woman famous
for strict morals...

85
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:38,155
...religious fervour and the happiness
of her marriage...

86
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,220
What could possibly
be more prestigious?

87
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:45,184
I think there's something degrading
about having a husband for a rival.

88
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:49,294
Is humiliating if you fail,
and commonplace if you succeed.

89
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:52,161
Where is Monsieur de Tourvel anyway?

90
00:09:52,303 --> 00:09:54,828
Presiding over some
endless case in Burgundy.

91
00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:57,132
I don't think you can hope
for any actual pleasure.

92
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,334
Oh, yes.

93
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:03,175
You see, I have no intention of
breaking down her prejudices.

94
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:07,148
I want her to believe in God and virtue
and the sanctity of marriage...

95
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:09,584
...and still not be able
to stop herself.

96
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:14,586
I want the excitement of watching her...

97
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:17,685
...betray everything thas
most important to her.

98
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:19,854
Surely you understand that.

99
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:21,863
I thought "betrayal"
was your favourite word.

100
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:23,593
No, no...

101
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:26,035
..."cruelty."

102
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:30,232
I always think that has
a nobler ring to it.

103
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,211
- How is Belleroche?
- I'm very pleased with him.

104
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:43,651
And is he your only lover?

105
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,982
Yes.

106
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:49,359
I think you should take another.

107
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:51,895
I think it most unhealthy,
this exclusivity.

108
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:53,223
You're not jealous, are you?

109
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:55,764
Of course I am.
Belleroche is completely undeserving.

110
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:57,765
I thought he was one of
your closest friends.

111
00:10:57,835 --> 00:11:00,531
Exactly, so I know
what I'm talking about.

112
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:07,843
No, I think you should organize
an infidelity.

113
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:10,140
With me, for example.

114
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:17,285
You refuse me a simple favour...

115
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:19,184
...then you expect to be indulged?

116
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:22,724
Is only because it is so simple.
It wouldn't feel like a conquest.

117
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:25,826
I have to follow my destiny.

118
00:11:26,064 --> 00:11:27,588
I have to be true...

119
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:30,091
...to my profession.

120
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:37,501
All right then.

121
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:42,008
Come back when you've succeeded
with Madame de Tourvel.

122
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:43,878
Yes.

123
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:46,312
And I will offer you...

124
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:48,550
...a reward.

125
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:50,148
My love.

126
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:53,017
But I shall require proof.

127
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:54,456
Certainly.

128
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,784
Written proof.

129
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:01,725
Not negotiable.

130
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:12,808
I don't suppose there's
any possibility of an advance?

131
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:18,709
Good night, Vicomte.

132
00:12:39,737 --> 00:12:41,500
Where have you been?

133
00:12:45,076 --> 00:12:47,408
Time has no logic when I'm not with you.

134
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:49,609
An hour is like a century.

135
00:12:50,548 --> 00:12:53,745
I've told you before,
we shall get on a great deal better...

136
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:58,352
...if you make a concerted effort
not to sound like the latest novel.

137
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:59,581
Is such a beautiful day,
I believe we'll walk.

138
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:05,786
You didn't take the sacrament today.

139
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:07,087
No.

140
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,350
May I ask why?

141
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:15,021
I have this appalling reputation,
as you may know.

142
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:17,192
Yes, I have been warned about you.

143
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:19,269
You have? By whom?

144
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:22,429
A friend.

145
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:29,879
The fact is I've spent my life
surrounded by immoral people.

146
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:32,345
I've allowed myself
to be influenced by them...

147
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:35,648
...and sometimes even taken pride
in outshining them.

148
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,618
- And now?
- Now...

149
00:14:37,955 --> 00:14:41,186
...what I most often feel
is unworthiness.

150
00:14:41,592 --> 00:14:45,892
But it is precisely at such moments
that you start to become worthy.

151
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:56,068
I certainly believe one should
constantly strive to improve oneself.

152
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:12,882
Chevalier...

153
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:16,745
...I don't believe you know my cousin,
Madame de Volanges.

154
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:18,613
This is Chevalier Danceny.

155
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:21,122
And Madame's daughter, Cecile.

156
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:24,425
Tell us what we should think
of the opera.

157
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,322
Is sublime, don't you find?

158
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,691
Monsieur Danceny is one
of those rare eccentrics...

159
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:34,329
...who come here to listen to the music.

160
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:40,070
I do look forward to our next meeting.

161
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,354
Charming young man...

162
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:53,249
...penniless, regrettably.

163
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:57,453
He's one of the finest
music teachers in the city.

164
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,492
Perhaps you should employ him.

165
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,075
How are you getting on
with Madame de Tourvel's maid?

166
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:49,702
Julie, to tell you the truth, sir,
is been a bit boring.

167
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,873
If I wasn't so anxious to keep
Your Lordship abreast...

168
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:53,473
...I think I'd have
only bothered the once.

169
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:56,543
Still, what else is there
to do in the country?

170
00:17:56,854 --> 00:18:00,813
It wasn't so much the details
of your intimacy I was after...

171
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:04,554
...is whether or not she's agreed
to bring me Madame de Tourvel's letters.

172
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,757
She won't steal the letters, sir.

173
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:07,556
She won't?

174
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:08,824
You know better than me, sir.

175
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:11,094
Is easy enough making them do
what they want to do.

176
00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:12,726
Is trying to get them to do what
you want them to do...

177
00:18:12,803 --> 00:18:13,667
...that gives you a headache.

178
00:18:13,904 --> 00:18:15,531
And them, as often as not.

179
00:18:15,673 --> 00:18:17,573
I need to know who's
writing to her about me.

180
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:19,870
I shouldn't worry if I was you, sir.

181
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:23,836
She told Julie she didn't believe
you went hunting in the mornings.

182
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:26,178
She said she was going
to have you followed.

183
00:18:26,951 --> 00:18:29,215
So I'd say it was only a matter of time.

184
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:42,559
That is a terrible noise he's making.

185
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:44,830
He should get the news back
to her twice as quickly.

186
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:47,632
I don't think we should make it
too easy for him.

187
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:07,684
What exactly do you think you're doing?

188
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:10,160
I am impounding these effects, sir.

189
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:13,821
Has it not been explained to you?
Monsieur Armand is not well.

190
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:16,933
I don't make the laws, sir.
I just do what I'm told.

191
00:19:17,268 --> 00:19:18,758
Everybody has to pay his taxes.

192
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:20,393
How much does he owe?

193
00:19:21,405 --> 00:19:22,531
How much?

194
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:24,099
Fifty-six livres.

195
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,937
- Pay him.
- Yes, my lord.

196
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:35,611
Monsieur Armand...

197
00:19:36,821 --> 00:19:38,550
Excuse me, you don't know me.

198
00:19:38,622 --> 00:19:41,022
Of course I do, Monsieur le Vicomte.

199
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:42,214
Please, don't get up.

200
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:45,453
- I have to. They're taking the bed.
- No, not at all.

201
00:19:46,464 --> 00:19:48,022
No one's taking anything.

202
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:11,648
Just to tide you over. I insist.

203
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:15,225
Me, sir...

204
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,926
Fifty-six livres to save
an entire family from ruin.

205
00:20:18,996 --> 00:20:20,657
That seems a genuine bargain.

206
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:22,699
These days, my lord, you can find
half a dozen like that...

207
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:23,859
...in any village in the country.

208
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:25,833
Really?

209
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:27,768
I must say the family was
very well chosen.

210
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:29,395
Solidly respectable...

211
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,340
...gratifyingly tearful, no suspiciously
pretty girls. Well done.

212
00:20:33,544 --> 00:20:34,875
I do my best for you, sir.

213
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:37,344
And all that humble gratitude.
It was most affecting.

214
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:38,914
Certainly brought a tear to my eye.

215
00:20:39,517 --> 00:20:41,075
Thas from her husband.

216
00:20:45,956 --> 00:20:49,892
This must be from
that officious friend of hers.

217
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:58,028
Tell me, where do you and Julie meet?

218
00:20:58,636 --> 00:20:59,933
In my room, sir.

219
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,062
- And is she coming tonight?
- Afraid so.

220
00:21:03,874 --> 00:21:06,104
I think I may be forced
to burst in on you.

221
00:21:06,343 --> 00:21:09,403
See if blackmail will succeed
any better than bribery.

222
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:11,208
About two o'clock suit you?

223
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:14,216
I don't want to embarrass you.
Will that give you enough time?

224
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:16,012
Ample, sir.

225
00:21:19,957 --> 00:21:23,449
Is this true about Monsieur Armand?

226
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:26,559
I don't believe I know
anyone of that name.

227
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:28,529
You may as well own up, Monsieur.

228
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,291
My footman happened to be passing when
you were in the village this morning.

229
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:35,566
I don't think you should pay too much
attention to servants' gossip.

230
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:37,798
It is true, isn't it?

231
00:21:40,144 --> 00:21:41,304
Well...

232
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:42,573
...yes.

233
00:21:43,013 --> 00:21:44,139
It is.

234
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:48,042
You dear boy, come and let me
give you a hug.

235
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:19,507
I can't understand how someone
whose instincts are so generous...

236
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,483
...could lead such a dissolute life.

237
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:25,012
I'm afraid you have
an exaggerated idea...

238
00:22:25,322 --> 00:22:28,587
...both of my generosity
and of my depravity.

239
00:22:28,893 --> 00:22:32,226
If I knew who'd given you
such a dire account of me...

240
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:37,132
Since I don't...

241
00:22:38,702 --> 00:22:40,795
...let me make a confession.

242
00:22:41,238 --> 00:22:44,935
I'm afraid the key to the paradox lies
in a certain weakness of character.

243
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:51,210
I can't see how so thoughtful an act
of charity could be described as weak.

244
00:22:51,348 --> 00:22:52,713
Because it was simply a response...

245
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:55,013
...to a strong new influence in my life.

246
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,508
Yours.

247
00:23:05,663 --> 00:23:07,824
You see how weak I am?

248
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:11,632
I promised myself
I was never going to tell you.

249
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:13,828
Is just that looking at you...

250
00:23:14,138 --> 00:23:15,162
You needn't worry...

251
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:17,167
...I have no illicit intentions.

252
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:19,936
I would not dream of insulting you.

253
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:24,744
But I do love you.

254
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:27,850
I adore you.

255
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,713
Please, help me.

256
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:30,971
- I rang a number of times.
- Didn't hear, sir.

257
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:34,016
- I require some hot water.
- Right away, sir.

258
00:24:34,418 --> 00:24:35,942
Don't move.

259
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:42,215
- Azolan...
- Sir?

260
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:44,293
Wait for me in my room.

261
00:24:47,464 --> 00:24:49,694
You know I can't condone
this sort of behaviour, Julie.

262
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:50,426
I know, sir.

263
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:52,992
But, you may rely on my discretion.

264
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:53,862
Thank you, sir.

265
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:57,168
Providing, of course,
that you agree to my price.

266
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:11,184
No. Nothing like that.

267
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:14,587
No, all I want is
to get to see every letter...

268
00:25:14,658 --> 00:25:17,786
...that Madame de Tourvel
has received since her arrival here...

269
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:20,555
...and every letter that she writes
from now on.

270
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:21,290
But, sir, I can't...

271
00:25:21,365 --> 00:25:23,890
Deliver them to Azolan
by midnight tomorrow.

272
00:25:26,036 --> 00:25:28,300
For your trouble.

273
00:26:34,238 --> 00:26:37,605
Would it be very wrong of me
to answer Monsieur Danceny's letters?

274
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:41,041
- In the circumstances, yes.
- In what circumstances?

275
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:43,609
Is not my place
to tell you this, my dear...

276
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:46,314
...if I hadn't become so fond of you...

277
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:47,709
Go on, please.

278
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:49,716
Your marriage has been arranged.

279
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,846
- Who is it?
- Oh, someone I know slightly.

280
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,480
Monsieur le Comte de Bastide.

281
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:56,285
- Whas he like?
- Well...

282
00:26:56,593 --> 00:26:57,355
You don't like him?

283
00:26:57,528 --> 00:27:00,759
Oh, is not that. He's a man of
somewhat erratic judgement.

284
00:27:00,831 --> 00:27:01,729
And rather serious.

285
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:02,866
How old is he?

286
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:07,062
- Thirty-six.
- Thirty-six! He's an old man.

287
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:09,801
Do you know when?

288
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:12,439
In the new year, I believe.

289
00:27:13,944 --> 00:27:17,038
Maybe there's a way to let you
write to Monsieur Danceny.

290
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:19,078
Oh, Madame.

291
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:25,819
If you were to let me see both sides
of the correspondence...

292
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,019
...I could reassure myself.

293
00:27:28,158 --> 00:27:31,423
But I can't show the letters
I've already sent him.

294
00:27:54,851 --> 00:27:58,048
I trust you slept well, Madame.
I wish I could say that I had.

295
00:27:58,121 --> 00:28:00,681
I thought the least I could hope for
was that you would respect me.

296
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:01,849
But I do, of course I do!

297
00:28:01,925 --> 00:28:03,893
You've offended me deeply.
Is unforgivable.

298
00:28:04,294 --> 00:28:07,525
This confirms everything
I've been told about you.

299
00:28:09,032 --> 00:28:11,398
I'm beginning to think you may
have planned the whole exercise.

300
00:28:11,468 --> 00:28:13,595
I had no idea you were staying here.

301
00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:17,170
Not that it would have disturbed me
in the slightest if I had known.

302
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:21,539
You see, until I met you,
I had only ever experienced desire.

303
00:28:21,712 --> 00:28:23,771
Love, never.

304
00:28:24,014 --> 00:28:25,811
- Thas enough.
- No, no...

305
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:26,871
...you've made an accusation.

306
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,817
You must allow me the opportunity
to defend myself.

307
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,784
I'm not going to deny
that I was aware of your beauty...

308
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:36,188
...but the point is, this has
nothing to do with your beauty.

309
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:38,658
As I got to know you,
I began to realize...

310
00:28:38,729 --> 00:28:41,323
...that beauty was the least
of your qualities.

311
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:43,829
I became fascinated by your goodness.

312
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:45,434
I was drawn in by it.

313
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:47,969
I didn't understand
what was happening to me.

314
00:28:48,071 --> 00:28:51,632
It was only when I began to feel
actual physical pain...

315
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,073
...every time you left the room...

316
00:28:53,143 --> 00:28:55,805
...that it finally dawned on me.
I was in love.

317
00:28:56,146 --> 00:28:58,546
For the first time in my life
I knew it was hopeless...

318
00:28:58,615 --> 00:29:00,207
...but that didn't matter to me.

319
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:03,845
Is not that I want to have you,
all I want is to deserve you.

320
00:29:05,756 --> 00:29:07,053
Tell me what to do.

321
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,023
Show me how to behave.
I'll do anything you say.

322
00:29:11,762 --> 00:29:15,095
Very well, then.
I would like you to leave this house.

323
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:19,799
I don't see why that
should be necessary.

324
00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:22,870
Les just say you've spent
your whole life making it necessary.

325
00:29:23,473 --> 00:29:26,101
And if you refuse,
I shall be forced to leave myself.

326
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:29,607
Well then, of course, whatever you say.

327
00:29:30,347 --> 00:29:31,939
Thank you.

328
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:41,921
Perhaps I might be so bold as
to ask a favour in return?

329
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,486
I think it would only be
just to let me know...

330
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:46,688
...which of your friends
has blackened my name.

331
00:29:46,797 --> 00:29:48,697
If friends of mine have warned me
against you...

332
00:29:48,765 --> 00:29:51,097
...I could hardly reward them
with betrayal.

333
00:29:51,335 --> 00:29:53,360
I must say, you devalue
your generous offer...

334
00:29:53,437 --> 00:29:55,132
...if you want to use it
as a bargaining point.

335
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:57,070
Very well, I withdraw the request.

336
00:29:57,207 --> 00:30:00,973
I hope you won't think I'm bargaining
if I ask you to let me write to you.

337
00:30:01,111 --> 00:30:02,601
- Well...
- And pray that you will do me...

338
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:04,271
...the kindness of answering my letters.

339
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:06,310
I'm not sure a correspondence
with you...

340
00:30:06,383 --> 00:30:07,975
...is something a woman of honour
could permit herself.

341
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:10,815
You're determined to refuse
my suggestions, however respectable.

342
00:30:10,887 --> 00:30:13,219
- I... I didn't say that.
- And you'd rather be unjust...

343
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,281
...than risk showing me
a touch of kindness?

344
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:17,222
I would welcome the chance
to prove to you...

345
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:20,990
...that what lies behind this
is not hatred or resentment but...

346
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:22,655
But what?

347
00:30:51,995 --> 00:30:53,485
Listen to this:

348
00:30:53,797 --> 00:30:57,460
"He knows exactly how far
he may venture without risk...

349
00:30:57,601 --> 00:30:59,592
"...and guarantees his own security...

350
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:04,003
"...by tormenting only the safest
kind of victim: Women."

351
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,938
Madame de Volanges...

352
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:21,124
- Goodbye, Aunt.
- Goodbye, dear boy.

353
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:28,863
- Monsieur, please...
- I'll write soon.

354
00:31:48,718 --> 00:31:52,245
My dear Madame de Tourvel...

355
00:31:54,658 --> 00:31:56,023
...I have just come...

356
00:31:57,394 --> 00:31:59,487
Don't move, I said.

357
00:32:01,898 --> 00:32:04,389
...to my desk...

358
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:09,471
...in the middle of a stormy night...

359
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:12,702
...during which...

360
00:32:13,743 --> 00:32:16,405
...I have been...

361
00:32:17,581 --> 00:32:19,208
...tossed...

362
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:23,116
...from exultation...

363
00:32:23,787 --> 00:32:26,722
...to exhaustion...

364
00:32:26,957 --> 00:32:29,084
...and back again.

365
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:31,954
Yet, despite these torments...

366
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,324
...I guarantee at this moment...

367
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:39,535
...I am far happier than you.

368
00:32:48,044 --> 00:32:51,707
We'll finish it later, shall we?

369
00:32:58,188 --> 00:33:00,122
Your damned cousin,
the Volanges bitch...

370
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,158
...wanted me away
from Madame de Tourvel.

371
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:05,625
Well, now I am and I intend
to make her suffer for it.

372
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:10,790
Your plan, to ruin her daughter,
are you making any progress?

373
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:14,795
Is there anything I can do to help?

374
00:33:15,338 --> 00:33:17,636
I'm entirely at your disposal.

375
00:33:19,476 --> 00:33:20,568
Well...

376
00:33:20,977 --> 00:33:21,739
...yes.

377
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:26,574
I told Danceny you would act
as his confidant and advisor.

378
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:30,842
I need you to stiffen his resolve,
if thas the phrase.

379
00:33:33,423 --> 00:33:34,913
I thought if anyone could help him...

380
00:33:34,991 --> 00:33:37,687
Help? He doesn't need help,
he needs hindrances.

381
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:39,585
If he has to climb over
enough of them...

382
00:33:39,663 --> 00:33:42,689
...he might inadvertently
fall on top of her.

383
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:45,325
I take it he hasn't been
a great success.

384
00:33:45,402 --> 00:33:47,427
He's been disastrous.

385
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:50,538
Like most intellectuals,
he's intensely stupid.

386
00:33:54,044 --> 00:33:57,810
I often wonder how you managed
to invent yourself.

387
00:33:58,615 --> 00:34:01,345
I had no choice, did I? I'm a woman.

388
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:05,878
Women are obliged to be
far more skillful than men.

389
00:34:06,456 --> 00:34:10,859
You can ruin our reputation and our life
with a few well-chosen words.

390
00:34:10,994 --> 00:34:13,155
So, of course, I had to invent
not only myself...

391
00:34:13,997 --> 00:34:17,797
...but ways of escape
no one has ever thought of before.

392
00:34:18,802 --> 00:34:21,032
And I've succeeded because...

393
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:26,804
...l've always known I was born
to dominate your sex and avenge my own.

394
00:34:28,612 --> 00:34:31,274
Yes, but what I ask was, how?

395
00:34:37,554 --> 00:34:41,046
When I came out into society I was 15.

396
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:45,516
I already knew that the role
I was condemned to...

397
00:34:45,662 --> 00:34:48,495
...namely, to keep quiet
and do what I was told...

398
00:34:48,598 --> 00:34:52,398
...gave me the perfect
opportunity to listen and observe.

399
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:56,231
Not to what people told me,
which naturally was of no interest...

400
00:34:56,773 --> 00:35:00,209
...but to whatever it was
they were trying to hide.

401
00:35:00,777 --> 00:35:03,337
I practiced detachment.

402
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,478
I learnt how to look cheerful
while under the table

403
00:35:06,549 --> 00:35:09,279
I stuck a fork into the back of my hand.

404
00:35:10,553 --> 00:35:12,214
I became...

405
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:15,722
...a virtuoso of deceit.

406
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:19,019
It wasn't pleasure I was after,
it was knowledge.

407
00:35:19,629 --> 00:35:23,463
I consulted the strictest moralist
to learn how to appear.

408
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,098
Philosophers, to find out what to think.

409
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:29,569
And novelists, to see
what I could get away with.

410
00:35:29,906 --> 00:35:35,208
And in the end I distilled everything
to one wonderfully simple principle...

411
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:38,908
...win or die.

412
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,642
So, you're infallible, are you?

413
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,081
If I want a man, I have him.

414
00:35:46,456 --> 00:35:49,550
If he wants to tell,
he finds that he can't.

415
00:35:51,594 --> 00:35:53,926
Thas the whole story.

416
00:35:54,564 --> 00:35:56,395
And was that our story?

417
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,632
I wanted you before we'd ever met.

418
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,672
My self-esteem demanded it.

419
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:10,310
Then when you began to pursue me...

420
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:13,242
...I wanted you so badly.

421
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:19,921
Is the only time I have ever been
controlled by my desire.

422
00:36:21,825 --> 00:36:24,191
Single combat.

423
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:47,977
Madame de Volanges...

424
00:36:57,761 --> 00:36:59,661
Your note said it was urgent.

425
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:03,488
Is days now. I haven't been able
to think of anything else.

426
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,898
Please, sit down.
I have reason to believe...

427
00:37:08,371 --> 00:37:11,340
...that a... how should I describe it...

428
00:37:12,408 --> 00:37:17,175
...that a dangerous liaison
has sprung up between your daughter...

429
00:37:17,447 --> 00:37:19,381
...and the Chevalier Danceny.

430
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:23,649
Oh, no, thas completely absurd.

431
00:37:23,787 --> 00:37:27,279
Cecile is still a child.
She understands nothing of these things.

432
00:37:27,857 --> 00:37:31,691
And Danceny is an entirely
respectable young man.

433
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:33,894
Tell me...

434
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,360
...does Cecile have a great
many correspondents?

435
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,328
Why do you ask?

436
00:37:38,535 --> 00:37:40,969
I went to her room
at the beginning of this week.

437
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,163
I simply knocked
on the door and entered.

438
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:44,863
She was stuffing an envelope...

439
00:37:44,941 --> 00:37:47,774
...into the top right-hand drawer
of her bureau...

440
00:37:48,011 --> 00:37:49,205
...in which I couldn't help noticing...

441
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:52,646
...there seemed to be a large number
of similar letters.

442
00:37:56,953 --> 00:37:59,319
I am most grateful to you.

443
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,552
Would you think it impertinent
if I were to make another suggestion?

444
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:08,392
No, no.

445
00:38:08,464 --> 00:38:10,227
If my recollection is correct...

446
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,028
...I overheard you saying
to the Vicomte de Valmont...

447
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:15,933
...that his aunt invited you and Cecile
to stay at her chteau.

448
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:16,698
No...

449
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:18,502
She has, yes, repeatedly.

450
00:38:23,513 --> 00:38:27,176
A spell in the country
might be the very thing.

451
00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:34,580
Thank you.

452
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,334
You asked for hindrances.

453
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:50,034
You are a genuinely wicked woman.

454
00:38:50,273 --> 00:38:52,605
And you wanted a chance
to make my cousin suffer.

455
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:53,505
I can't resist you.

456
00:38:53,676 --> 00:38:55,143
I made it easy for you.

457
00:38:55,478 --> 00:38:59,107
But, all this is most inconvenient.

458
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:04,280
The Comtesse de Beaulieu
has invited me to stay.

459
00:39:04,454 --> 00:39:06,752
Well, you will just have to put her off.

460
00:39:07,223 --> 00:39:10,920
Well, the Comtesse has promised me
extensive use of her gardens.

461
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:15,263
It seems her husbans fingers are
not as green as they once were.

462
00:39:15,498 --> 00:39:16,487
Maybe not.

463
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:19,961
But from what I hear,
all his friends are gardeners.

464
00:39:20,236 --> 00:39:21,828
Is that so?

465
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:24,300
You want your revenge,
I want my revenge.

466
00:39:24,607 --> 00:39:26,541
I'm afraid there's only
one place you can go.

467
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,475
Back to Auntie?

468
00:39:28,645 --> 00:39:30,272
Back to Auntie.

469
00:39:30,647 --> 00:39:33,480
Where you can also pursue
that other matter.

470
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:36,946
You have some evidence to procure,
have you not?

471
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,220
Don't you think it would
be a generous gesture...

472
00:39:45,361 --> 00:39:48,125
...to show the proper confidence
in my abilities...

473
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:50,789
...if we were to take
that evidence for granted?

474
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:54,159
I need it in writing, Vicomte.

475
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:59,902
- Now you must leave me.
- Must I? Why?

476
00:40:00,543 --> 00:40:02,773
- Because I'm hungry.
- Yes?

477
00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:05,106
I have quite an appetite myself.

478
00:40:06,249 --> 00:40:08,615
Then go home and eat.

479
00:40:12,855 --> 00:40:14,618
In writing.

480
00:41:49,252 --> 00:41:53,712
You'll be pleased to hear, my dear
that Armand is on his feet again...

481
00:41:53,956 --> 00:41:55,753
...and back at work.

482
00:42:01,197 --> 00:42:02,562
Who?

483
00:42:03,966 --> 00:42:05,900
Monsieur Armand!

484
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:08,863
Whose family you helped so generously.

485
00:42:10,173 --> 00:42:11,470
Oh, yes!

486
00:42:12,508 --> 00:42:16,706
When my nephew was last here
we discovered, quite by chance...

487
00:42:16,913 --> 00:42:18,608
...that he had gone into the village...

488
00:42:18,848 --> 00:42:20,543
Are you feeling all right, Madame?

489
00:42:20,817 --> 00:42:22,307
I'm sorry to interrupt, Aunt.

490
00:42:22,952 --> 00:42:24,112
It seemed to me, all of a sudden...

491
00:42:24,187 --> 00:42:26,655
...that Madame de Tourvel
didn't look at all well.

492
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:28,883
- No, I'm quite all right.
- Perhaps you need some fresh air.

493
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:30,323
Do you feel constricted in any way?

494
00:42:30,393 --> 00:42:33,226
I feel sure Madame de Volanges
is right, as usual.

495
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:34,694
A turn around the grounds, perhaps.

496
00:42:34,764 --> 00:42:39,326
Yes, a little walk in the garden.
Is not too cool, I think.

497
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:41,828
Fresh air will do you the world of good.

498
00:42:42,038 --> 00:42:44,404
That meal was somewhat heavy, perhaps.

499
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,131
I can't believe that was the cause.

500
00:42:48,978 --> 00:42:50,172
Come back for it.

501
00:43:03,826 --> 00:43:05,657
Mademoiselle!

502
00:43:06,596 --> 00:43:09,724
I've no wish to arouse suspicion,
so I'll be brief.

503
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:11,528
The letter is
from the Chevalier Danceny.

504
00:43:12,702 --> 00:43:15,432
- Yes, I thought...
- Now the handing over of such letters...

505
00:43:15,538 --> 00:43:18,371
...is a far from easy
matter to accomplish.

506
00:43:18,608 --> 00:43:22,442
I cannot be expected to create
a diversion every day.

507
00:43:22,879 --> 00:43:24,107
So...

508
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:27,642
This key resembles your bedroom key.

509
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,342
I happen to know it is kept
in your mother's room...

510
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:31,511
...on the mantelpiece,
tied with a blue ribbon.

511
00:43:31,787 --> 00:43:34,119
Take it, go up and attach
the blue ribbon to it...

512
00:43:34,257 --> 00:43:35,986
...and put it in the place
of your bedroom key.

513
00:43:36,058 --> 00:43:39,550
Bring it to me and I will get
a copy cut within two hours.

514
00:43:39,762 --> 00:43:42,196
Then I can collect your letters
and deliver Danceny's...

515
00:43:42,265 --> 00:43:44,563
...without any complications.

516
00:43:44,967 --> 00:43:46,366
Now...

517
00:43:46,836 --> 00:43:47,768
...in the cupboard by your bed...

518
00:43:47,837 --> 00:43:50,032
...you'll find a feather
and a small bottle of oil...

519
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:54,036
...so that you may oil the lock
and hinges on the ante-room door.

520
00:43:54,911 --> 00:43:56,378
Are you sure, Monsieur?

521
00:43:56,546 --> 00:43:58,013
Trust me.

522
00:44:01,584 --> 00:44:03,279
Believe me, Mademoiselle...

523
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:07,680
...if there's one thing I can't abide,
is deceitfulness.

524
00:44:32,448 --> 00:44:34,712
I trust you are feeling a little better.

525
00:44:44,527 --> 00:44:48,964
If I were ill, Monsieur, it would not be
difficult to guess who was responsible.

526
00:44:51,934 --> 00:44:54,198
You can't mean me, do you?

527
00:44:54,604 --> 00:44:56,902
- You promised to leave here.
- And I did.

528
00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:59,473
Would you excuse me, Madame?

529
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:18,891
Quick, your mother.

530
00:45:30,473 --> 00:45:32,100
What are you doing?

531
00:45:32,908 --> 00:45:35,638
I just came in to fetch your shawl.

532
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:29,891
Why are you so angry with me?

533
00:46:30,032 --> 00:46:33,559
All I can offer you is my friendship.
Can't you accept it?

534
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:36,763
I could pretend to,
but that would be dishonest.

535
00:46:37,073 --> 00:46:40,531
The man I used to be would have been
content with friendship...

536
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:44,202
...and then set about trying
to turn it to his advantage.

537
00:46:44,547 --> 00:46:46,037
But I have changed now.

538
00:46:46,382 --> 00:46:51,410
I can't conceal from you that
I love you tenderly, passionately...

539
00:46:51,554 --> 00:46:54,216
...and above all, respectfully.

540
00:46:56,292 --> 00:47:00,285
So how am I to demote myself
to the tepid position of friend?

541
00:47:00,429 --> 00:47:03,557
Not that you are even
pretending to show friendship.

542
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:06,335
- What do you mean?
- Well, is this friendly?

543
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:12,968
Why must you deliberately
destroy my peace of mind?

544
00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:22,916
You were wrong to feel
threatened by me, Madame.

545
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:27,153
Your happiness is far more
important to me than my own.

546
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:29,822
That is what I mean
when I say that I love you.

547
00:47:32,061 --> 00:47:34,291
I think we should end this conversation.

548
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:37,421
I shall leave you
in possession of the field.

549
00:47:42,204 --> 00:47:42,863
But look...

550
00:47:43,873 --> 00:47:47,331
We are to be living under the same roof,
at least for a few days.

551
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:49,635
Surely we don't have to try
to avoid each other?

552
00:47:51,714 --> 00:47:52,840
Of course not.

553
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:56,409
Provided you adhere
to my few simple rules.

554
00:47:56,619 --> 00:47:59,986
I shall obey you in this
as in everything.

555
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:08,821
Monsieur...

556
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:12,927
What?

557
00:48:14,303 --> 00:48:15,634
Nothing.

558
00:49:30,112 --> 00:49:31,704
Nothing to worry about.

559
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:34,171
Have you brought a letter?

560
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:35,517
No.

561
00:49:36,352 --> 00:49:37,410
Then what?

562
00:49:45,728 --> 00:49:47,719
What are you going to tell your mother?

563
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:51,290
How will you explain the fact
that I have your key?

564
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:53,998
If I tell her I'm here
at your invitation...

565
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:56,867
...I have a feeling she will believe me.

566
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,401
What do you want?

567
00:50:02,545 --> 00:50:04,069
Well, I don't know...

568
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:08,481
What do you think?

569
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:09,447
No!

570
00:50:09,585 --> 00:50:10,745
All right.

571
00:50:12,054 --> 00:50:14,147
I just want you to give me a kiss.

572
00:50:17,493 --> 00:50:19,085
- A kiss?
- Thas all.

573
00:50:21,263 --> 00:50:22,821
- Then will you go?
- Then I'll go.

574
00:50:23,165 --> 00:50:25,395
- Promise?
- Whatever you say.

575
00:50:46,188 --> 00:50:47,450
All right!

576
00:50:48,824 --> 00:50:50,189
Very nice.

577
00:50:50,659 --> 00:50:52,286
No, I mean, will you go now?

578
00:50:52,428 --> 00:50:54,419
Oh, I don't think so.

579
00:50:56,298 --> 00:50:57,287
But you promised.

580
00:50:57,433 --> 00:50:59,628
I promised to go
when you gave me a kiss.

581
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:02,202
You didn't give me a kiss.
I gave you a kiss.

582
00:51:02,705 --> 00:51:04,366
Not the same thing at all.

583
00:51:05,674 --> 00:51:07,437
And if I give you a kiss?

584
00:51:07,876 --> 00:51:11,710
Les just get ourselves
more comfortable, shall we?

585
00:51:41,777 --> 00:51:44,143
I had better go and see whas wrong,
if you will excuse me.

586
00:51:44,213 --> 00:51:46,044
Of course, my dear.

587
00:51:46,181 --> 00:51:47,375
I shouldn't worry, Madame.

588
00:51:47,483 --> 00:51:51,078
The young have such miraculous
powers of recuperation.

589
00:51:51,387 --> 00:51:54,413
I'm sure she will soon
be back in the saddle.

590
00:52:29,558 --> 00:52:32,584
Who else can I turn to in
my desperation, Madame?

591
00:52:33,429 --> 00:52:36,296
And how can I write the necessary words?

592
00:53:04,126 --> 00:53:06,458
There's something going on,
and Cecile will not tell me.

593
00:53:06,562 --> 00:53:08,757
You must speak to her at once.

594
00:53:09,765 --> 00:53:11,323
Tell me...

595
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,958
...you resisted him, did you?

596
00:53:13,936 --> 00:53:15,267
Of course I did...

597
00:53:16,271 --> 00:53:17,738
...as much as I could.

598
00:53:18,273 --> 00:53:20,332
- But he forced you?
- No...

599
00:53:22,044 --> 00:53:23,306
...not exactly.

600
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,871
But I found it almost
impossible to defend myself.

601
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,948
Why was that? Did he tie you up?

602
00:53:32,621 --> 00:53:35,749
No, he just has a way of putting things.

603
00:53:36,892 --> 00:53:38,382
You can't think of an answer.

604
00:53:38,627 --> 00:53:40,527
Not even "no"?

605
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,997
I kept on saying no all the time.

606
00:53:46,835 --> 00:53:49,497
But somehow, that was not
what I was doing.

607
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:55,440
I am so ashamed.

608
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:04,216
You'll find the shame is like the pain.

609
00:54:06,688 --> 00:54:09,020
You only feel it once.

610
00:54:16,999 --> 00:54:19,024
You really want my advice?

611
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:28,799
Please.

612
00:54:31,213 --> 00:54:33,647
Allow Monsieur de Valmont...

613
00:54:33,816 --> 00:54:36,580
...to continue your instruction.

614
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:41,520
Convince your mother
you've forgotten Danceny.

615
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:44,489
And raise no objection to the marriage.

616
00:54:44,593 --> 00:54:46,390
With Monsieur de Bastide?!

617
00:54:46,695 --> 00:54:50,028
When it comes to marriage,
one man is as good as the next.

618
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:53,692
And even the least accommodating
is less trouble than a mother.

619
00:54:54,169 --> 00:54:57,400
Are you saying,
I'm going to have to do...

620
00:54:57,973 --> 00:55:00,066
...that, with three different men?

621
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:02,700
I am saying, you stupid little girl...

622
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:05,814
...that provided you take
a few elementary precautions...

623
00:55:05,881 --> 00:55:07,405
...you can do it, or not...

624
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:08,982
...with as many men as you like...

625
00:55:09,084 --> 00:55:10,210
...as often as you like...

626
00:55:10,352 --> 00:55:12,718
...in as many different ways
as you like.

627
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:18,922
Our sex has few enough advantages,
so make the best of those you have.

628
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:23,695
Now, here comes your maman...

629
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:27,930
...so remember what I've said,
and above all, no snivelling.

630
00:55:36,411 --> 00:55:37,776
How are you feeling now, my dear?

631
00:55:38,113 --> 00:55:40,809
Oh, much better, thank you, maman.

632
00:55:40,949 --> 00:55:43,417
I think you look tired.
I think you should go to bed.

633
00:55:43,585 --> 00:55:44,244
No, l...

634
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,184
I think you should do
as your mother suggests.

635
00:55:46,255 --> 00:55:48,621
We can arrange to have
something brought to your room.

636
00:55:48,757 --> 00:55:50,748
I'm sure it will do you good.

637
00:55:51,994 --> 00:55:53,894
Well, perhaps you are right, Madame.

638
00:55:58,233 --> 00:56:01,327
You have such a very good
influence on her.

639
00:56:25,027 --> 00:56:28,588
I don't think I have congratulated you
on your revenge.

640
00:56:28,664 --> 00:56:30,655
- So, you know.
- Oh, yes.

641
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:35,125
And I believe from now
you will find her door unbolted.

642
00:56:45,514 --> 00:56:46,811
Where is she?

643
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:48,541
I can't see her at the moment.

644
00:56:51,987 --> 00:56:56,185
Surely I have explained to you before
how much I enjoy watching the battle...

645
00:56:56,258 --> 00:56:57,725
...between love and virtue.

646
00:56:57,826 --> 00:57:00,556
What concerns me is that
you seem to enjoy watching it...

647
00:57:00,629 --> 00:57:02,688
...much more than you used
to enjoy winning it.

648
00:57:03,065 --> 00:57:04,464
All in good time.

649
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:08,336
The century is drawing to its close.

650
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,971
Isn't it a pity that our agreement...

651
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:17,307
...does not relate to the task
you set me...

652
00:57:18,213 --> 00:57:20,807
...rather than the task I set myself?

653
00:57:21,149 --> 00:57:23,014
I am grateful, of course.

654
00:57:23,518 --> 00:57:26,715
But that would have been
almost insultingly simple.

655
00:57:27,322 --> 00:57:31,019
One does not applaud the tenor
for clearing his throat.

656
00:59:51,233 --> 00:59:54,066
As with every other science,
the first thing you must learn...

657
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:56,127
...is to call everything
by its proper name.

658
00:59:56,238 --> 00:59:58,672
I don't see why we have to talk at all.

659
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:00,775
Without the correct polite vocabulary...

660
01:00:00,842 --> 01:00:03,242
...how would you indicate
what you would like me to do...

661
01:00:03,345 --> 01:00:06,246
...or make an offer of something
I might find agreeable.

662
01:00:06,314 --> 01:00:07,372
Surely you just...

663
01:00:07,449 --> 01:00:09,314
You see, if I do my work adequately...

664
01:00:09,584 --> 01:00:11,415
...I would like to think that
you will be able to...

665
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:14,512
...surprise Monsieur de Bastide
on his wedding night.

666
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:16,915
- Would he be pleased?
- Of course.

667
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:21,420
He'll merely assume your maman
has done her duty and fully briefed you.

668
01:00:21,563 --> 01:00:24,464
Maman couldn't possibly talk
of anything of that sort.

669
01:00:24,533 --> 01:00:26,023
I can't think why.

670
01:00:26,168 --> 01:00:29,433
She was, after all, one of the most
notorious young women in Paris.

671
01:00:30,605 --> 01:00:32,095
- Maman?
- Certainly.

672
01:00:32,274 --> 01:00:35,175
More noted for her enthusiasm
than her ability...

673
01:00:35,243 --> 01:00:37,370
...if I remember rightly.

674
01:00:37,746 --> 01:00:41,045
There was a famous occasion
before you were born...

675
01:00:41,283 --> 01:00:42,944
This would have been...

676
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:51,684
...when your mother went to stay
with the Comtesse de Beaulieu...

677
01:00:51,793 --> 01:00:54,819
...who tactfully gave her a room
between your father's...

678
01:00:54,896 --> 01:00:56,295
...and that of a Monsieur de Vressac...

679
01:00:56,364 --> 01:00:58,559
...who was her acknowledged
lover at the time.

680
01:00:59,234 --> 01:01:02,260
Yet, in spite of these
careful arrangements...

681
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:05,369
...she contrived to spend
the night with a third party.

682
01:01:06,908 --> 01:01:08,102
I can't believe that.

683
01:01:08,243 --> 01:01:10,074
No, no, I assure you, is true.

684
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:12,570
How do you know?

685
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:15,608
The third party was myself.

686
01:01:30,098 --> 01:01:33,431
You asked me if Monsieur de Bastide
would be pleased with your abilities.

687
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:35,162
And the answer is...

688
01:01:35,937 --> 01:01:38,599
...education is never a waste.

689
01:01:45,947 --> 01:01:46,606
Now...

690
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,618
...I think we might begin...

691
01:01:51,353 --> 01:01:54,015
...with one or two Latin terms.

692
01:02:29,991 --> 01:02:32,653
We go for a walk together
almost every day.

693
01:02:33,328 --> 01:02:35,888
A little further every time
down the path...

694
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,225
...that has no turning.

695
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,290
She has accepted my love...

696
01:02:40,902 --> 01:02:42,733
...I have accepted her friendship.

697
01:02:44,406 --> 01:02:48,172
We are both aware of how little
there is to choose between them.

698
01:02:48,376 --> 01:02:50,469
I wish you knew me well enough
to recognize...

699
01:02:50,945 --> 01:02:52,742
...how much you have changed me.

700
01:02:53,381 --> 01:02:56,680
My friends in Paris
remarked on it at once.

701
01:02:57,085 --> 01:03:00,077
I have become
the soul of consideration...

702
01:03:00,221 --> 01:03:02,689
...conscientious, charitable...

703
01:03:03,692 --> 01:03:05,421
...more celibate than a monk.

704
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,784
More celibate?

705
01:03:06,861 --> 01:03:10,160
Well, you know the stories
one hears in Paris.

706
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,693
I feel she is inches from surrender.

707
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:17,035
Her eyes are closing.

708
01:03:33,388 --> 01:03:34,377
Madame.

709
01:03:36,758 --> 01:03:38,225
Where are you going, Monsieur?

710
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,687
- To the salon.
- There is no one there.

711
01:03:40,795 --> 01:03:43,389
The others have all
decided on an early night.

712
01:03:43,965 --> 01:03:47,025
- I very much missed our walk today.
- Yes.

713
01:03:49,471 --> 01:03:53,737
I fear with the weather as it is, we can
look forward to very few more of them.

714
01:03:54,242 --> 01:03:58,474
- This heavy rain is surely exceptional.
- Yes. May I?

715
01:04:00,548 --> 01:04:02,482
Of course.

716
01:04:08,056 --> 01:04:12,083
But, you see, within a week
I shall have concluded my business.

717
01:04:16,965 --> 01:04:18,796
- I see.
- Even so, I am not sure...

718
01:04:18,867 --> 01:04:20,732
...I will be able to bring myself
to leave.

719
01:04:21,102 --> 01:04:22,091
Oh, please. You must.

720
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:24,001
Are you still so anxious
to be rid of me?

721
01:04:24,105 --> 01:04:25,436
You know the answer to that.

722
01:04:28,843 --> 01:04:31,175
I rely on your integrity and generosity.

723
01:04:32,447 --> 01:04:33,778
I want to be grateful to you.

724
01:04:33,848 --> 01:04:36,043
Forgive me if I say
I do not want your gratitude.

725
01:04:36,117 --> 01:04:39,143
What I want from you
is something altogether deeper.

726
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:45,457
I know God is punishing me for my pride.
I was certain this could never happen.

727
01:04:45,527 --> 01:04:47,119
Nothing like what?
Do you mean love?

728
01:04:47,295 --> 01:04:49,160
- Is love what you mean?
- You promised not to speak of it.

729
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:50,891
Yes, of course, I understand,
but I must know.

730
01:04:50,965 --> 01:04:53,195
I can't, don't you understand?
Is impossible.

731
01:04:53,268 --> 01:04:56,704
You don't have to speak.
Just look at me.

732
01:05:10,518 --> 01:05:11,314
Yes...

733
01:05:37,145 --> 01:05:40,979
For Gos sake, you must leave
me if you don't want to kill me.

734
01:05:41,816 --> 01:05:43,511
You must help...

735
01:07:08,236 --> 01:07:11,399
Fetch Madame,
Madame de Tourvel has been taken ill.

736
01:07:31,893 --> 01:07:33,884
I heard something as I was passing.

737
01:07:33,995 --> 01:07:36,361
She seemed to be having
difficulty breathing.

738
01:07:36,598 --> 01:07:39,123
- Oh, my dear, whatever is it?
- I am all right now.

739
01:07:40,568 --> 01:07:43,594
I shall leave her
in your capable hands, Aunt.

740
01:07:43,738 --> 01:07:46,104
We must send for a doctor, my dear.

741
01:07:46,307 --> 01:07:48,366
No, no, please.
I don't need a doctor. I just...

742
01:07:51,613 --> 01:07:53,877
Sit with me for a moment.

743
01:08:34,288 --> 01:08:36,313
I must leave this house.

744
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,250
I am most desperately in love.

745
01:08:41,629 --> 01:08:44,427
To leave is the last thing in the world
I want to do, but...

746
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:47,531
...l'd rather die than
to live with this guilt.

747
01:08:47,969 --> 01:08:51,666
My dear girl, none of this
is any surprise to me.

748
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:56,941
The only thing that might surprise
one is how little the world changes.

749
01:08:57,345 --> 01:08:59,506
What should I do?
What is your advice?

750
01:08:59,847 --> 01:09:02,213
If I remember rightly in such matters...

751
01:09:02,383 --> 01:09:05,079
...all advice is useless.

752
01:09:06,287 --> 01:09:08,346
I have never been so unhappy.

753
01:09:08,623 --> 01:09:10,784
I'm sorry to say this but...

754
01:09:11,225 --> 01:09:15,855
...those who are most worthy of love
are never made happy by it.

755
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:18,522
But why? Why should that be?

756
01:09:19,033 --> 01:09:23,060
Do you still think men
love the way we do?

757
01:09:23,571 --> 01:09:24,560
No...

758
01:09:25,306 --> 01:09:27,638
...men enjoy the happiness they feel.

759
01:09:28,876 --> 01:09:32,368
We can only enjoy the happiness we give.

760
01:09:35,249 --> 01:09:37,581
They are not capable...

761
01:09:37,852 --> 01:09:41,549
...of devoting themselves
exclusively to one person.

762
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:46,223
So to hope to be made happy by love...

763
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:49,891
...is a certain cause of grief.

764
01:09:52,133 --> 01:09:54,601
I am devoted to my nephew.

765
01:09:55,336 --> 01:09:57,531
But what is true of most men...

766
01:09:57,705 --> 01:10:00,071
...is doubly so of him.

767
01:10:01,843 --> 01:10:02,832
And yet...

768
01:10:03,745 --> 01:10:06,373
...he could have, just now...

769
01:10:09,016 --> 01:10:10,779
...he took pity on me.

770
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:14,415
If he has released you...

771
01:10:15,156 --> 01:10:18,387
...my dear child, you must go.

772
01:10:26,968 --> 01:10:28,435
Get up, sir, quick.

773
01:10:29,537 --> 01:10:30,367
Sir!

774
01:10:35,376 --> 01:10:36,775
Over here.

775
01:10:41,115 --> 01:10:41,877
What is it?

776
01:10:41,983 --> 01:10:44,451
- Madame de Tourvel.
- What?!

777
01:10:47,421 --> 01:10:50,652
I want you to follow her, right now.
Stay close to her.

778
01:10:50,892 --> 01:10:52,792
I want to know everything.

779
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:57,656
Where she goes. Who she sees.
What she eats. If she sleeps.

780
01:10:57,832 --> 01:10:58,924
Everything.

781
01:11:05,339 --> 01:11:07,307
Thas for bribes.
Yours will come later.

782
01:11:07,441 --> 01:11:08,772
- Yes, sir.
- Now, go.

783
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:09,638
Go!

784
01:11:23,624 --> 01:11:25,649
Dear Father Anselme...

785
01:11:25,893 --> 01:11:27,861
...try as I may, I cannot see...

786
01:11:27,929 --> 01:11:30,659
...the necessity for the interview
you suggest.

787
01:11:30,998 --> 01:11:33,933
However, since you insist...

788
01:11:34,035 --> 01:11:35,730
...I propose you bring him to see me...

789
01:11:35,803 --> 01:11:39,000
...on Thursday, the 28th,
at six o'clock p.m.

790
01:11:44,745 --> 01:11:48,203
This is excellent.
Make sure Father Anselme receives it.

791
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:50,517
What news?

792
01:11:52,053 --> 01:11:53,179
No visitors.

793
01:11:53,788 --> 01:11:56,655
There still has not been
a single visitor since she got back.

794
01:11:57,158 --> 01:11:59,752
A bite of soup last night,
didn't touch the pheasant.

795
01:11:59,827 --> 01:12:01,192
Afterwards, a cup of tea.

796
01:12:01,495 --> 01:12:02,985
Nothing else to report.

797
01:12:04,532 --> 01:12:06,159
Oh yes, sir, there is.

798
01:12:06,534 --> 01:12:08,729
You wanted to know
what she was reading.

799
01:12:09,537 --> 01:12:12,062
The book by her bed is
"Christian Thoughts...

800
01:12:13,274 --> 01:12:14,673
"...Volume Two."

801
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,710
How is Julie?

802
01:12:23,484 --> 01:12:26,214
She seems a bit keener than
she was in the country.

803
01:12:26,387 --> 01:12:27,877
And yourself?

804
01:12:28,522 --> 01:12:30,581
Talk about devotion to duty.

805
01:12:31,926 --> 01:12:33,223
Off you go.

806
01:12:34,228 --> 01:12:35,559
Keep it up.

807
01:12:37,398 --> 01:12:39,298
- Madame...
- Vicomte...

808
01:12:44,505 --> 01:12:45,665
Well...

809
01:12:48,709 --> 01:12:51,075
...what a pleasant surprise.

810
01:12:54,582 --> 01:12:55,742
Danceny...

811
01:12:56,117 --> 01:12:57,778
Thank you, Monsieur, for everything.

812
01:12:58,219 --> 01:13:01,188
Well, I was afraid I had been
a sad disappointment to you.

813
01:13:02,023 --> 01:13:03,285
On the contrary.

814
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:06,756
It is you I have to thank
for keeping our love alive.

815
01:13:06,894 --> 01:13:09,385
Well, as to love,
Cecile thinks of little else.

816
01:13:09,463 --> 01:13:11,795
She and her mother are coming
back to Paris in two weeks...

817
01:13:11,866 --> 01:13:13,629
...and she is longing to see you.

818
01:13:14,035 --> 01:13:16,128
I have had the most
wonderful letter from her.

819
01:13:16,203 --> 01:13:16,931
Really?

820
01:13:17,071 --> 01:13:20,302
Not like any of her other letters,
somehow...

821
01:13:22,243 --> 01:13:24,905
...quite a different tone of voice.

822
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:28,646
My dearest...

823
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:30,778
...Danceny...

824
01:13:32,586 --> 01:13:34,645
...I swear to you...

825
01:13:35,222 --> 01:13:36,621
...on my chastity...

826
01:13:37,124 --> 01:13:42,619
...that even if my mother forces me
to go through with this marriage...

827
01:13:43,297 --> 01:13:46,266
...I shall be yours completely.

828
01:13:47,635 --> 01:13:50,866
Your friend, the Vicomte de Valmont...

829
01:13:51,339 --> 01:13:53,967
...has been very active on your behalf.

830
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:56,769
I doubt if you could do more yourself.

831
01:13:58,813 --> 01:14:02,146
I don't know how I could bear to go
another two weeks without seeing her.

832
01:14:02,683 --> 01:14:06,676
We shall have to do our very best
to provide some distraction for you.

833
01:14:07,254 --> 01:14:09,085
If you would be so kind
as to wait in the carriage.

834
01:14:09,156 --> 01:14:12,148
There's a matter I must discuss
with the Vicomte in private.

835
01:14:13,094 --> 01:14:14,322
Of course.

836
01:14:15,029 --> 01:14:17,190
I don't know how I can ever repay you.

837
01:14:17,331 --> 01:14:19,299
Don't give it another thought.

838
01:14:22,303 --> 01:14:24,168
Is been delightful.

839
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:30,978
Poor boy, he's quite harmless.

840
01:14:31,812 --> 01:14:34,679
Sometimes, Vicomte,
I can't help but adore you.

841
01:14:34,882 --> 01:14:38,340
I have a piece of news I hope
you might find entertaining.

842
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:42,789
I have reason to believe
the next head of the house of Bastide...

843
01:14:43,157 --> 01:14:44,522
...may be a Valmont.

844
01:14:44,725 --> 01:14:46,283
What can you mean?

845
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,692
Cecile is two weeks late.

846
01:14:51,565 --> 01:14:52,691
Aren't you pleased?

847
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,428
I'm not sure.

848
01:14:54,702 --> 01:14:57,227
Your aim was
to revenge yourself on Bastide.

849
01:14:57,338 --> 01:15:00,830
I have provided him with a wife trained
by me to perform, quite naturally...

850
01:15:00,941 --> 01:15:04,240
...services one would hesitate
to request from a professional...

851
01:15:04,378 --> 01:15:06,938
...and very likely pregnant as well.

852
01:15:08,082 --> 01:15:09,743
What more do you want?

853
01:15:10,151 --> 01:15:14,178
All right, Vicomte, I agree.
You have more than done your duty.

854
01:15:14,955 --> 01:15:17,651
Shame you let the other ones
slip through your fingers.

855
01:15:21,462 --> 01:15:22,929
I let her go.

856
01:15:23,397 --> 01:15:24,421
But why?

857
01:15:25,032 --> 01:15:26,226
I was moved.

858
01:15:26,367 --> 01:15:28,733
Oh, well then, no wonder you bungled it.

859
01:15:29,036 --> 01:15:31,266
I have an appointment
to visit her on Thursday...

860
01:15:31,338 --> 01:15:33,363
...and this time I shall be merciless.

861
01:15:33,607 --> 01:15:35,165
I am pleased to hear it.

862
01:15:40,414 --> 01:15:42,507
Why do you suppose we...

863
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:45,480
...only feel compelled to chase
the ones who run away?

864
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:47,951
Lmmaturity?

865
01:15:48,089 --> 01:15:50,751
I shan't have a momens peace
until is over.

866
01:15:51,759 --> 01:15:54,751
I love her, I hate her...

867
01:15:55,429 --> 01:15:57,192
My life is a misery.

868
01:16:01,235 --> 01:16:04,671
Well, I think I may have kept
our young friend waiting long enough.

869
01:16:05,139 --> 01:16:07,903
I shall call on you
sometime soon after Thursday.

870
01:16:08,242 --> 01:16:09,504
Only if you succeed, Vicomte.

871
01:16:09,677 --> 01:16:12,145
I am not sure I can face
another catalogue of incompetence.

872
01:16:12,279 --> 01:16:13,371
I shall succeed.

873
01:16:13,581 --> 01:16:15,071
I hope so.

874
01:16:15,349 --> 01:16:18,341
Once upon a time you were
a man to be reckoned with.

875
01:17:18,345 --> 01:17:20,142
I understand that Father Anselme...

876
01:17:20,214 --> 01:17:22,444
...has explained to you
the reason for my visit?

877
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:24,813
Yes, he said you wished
to be reconciled with me...

878
01:17:24,919 --> 01:17:27,183
...before beginning
instruction with him.

879
01:17:27,588 --> 01:17:28,577
That is correct.

880
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:33,926
But I see no need for formal
reconciliation, Monsieur.

881
01:17:34,028 --> 01:17:34,858
No.

882
01:17:34,962 --> 01:17:36,793
When I have, as you said,
insulted you...

883
01:17:36,864 --> 01:17:39,833
...and when you have treated me
with an unqualified contempt.

884
01:17:42,036 --> 01:17:43,264
Contempt?!

885
01:17:44,138 --> 01:17:46,436
You ran away from my auns house
in the middle of the night.

886
01:17:46,507 --> 01:17:49,374
You refuse to answer
or even receive my letters.

887
01:17:49,543 --> 01:17:51,807
And all this, after
I have shown a restraint...

888
01:17:51,879 --> 01:17:54,143
...of which I think we are both aware.

889
01:17:54,281 --> 01:17:56,977
I would call that,
at the very least, contempt.

890
01:17:57,051 --> 01:17:59,747
I am sure you understand me better
than you pretend to, Monsieur.

891
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:01,811
It was me you ran away from, wasn't it?

892
01:18:03,657 --> 01:18:04,817
I had to leave.

893
01:18:04,959 --> 01:18:06,551
And do you have to keep away from me?!

894
01:18:14,535 --> 01:18:17,971
I am as unhappy as you could
ever have wanted me to be.

895
01:18:19,306 --> 01:18:21,171
I have only ever wanted your happiness.

896
01:18:22,343 --> 01:18:24,743
How can I be happy without you?

897
01:18:25,379 --> 01:18:27,370
I must have you, or die.

898
01:18:38,592 --> 01:18:39,581
Death it is.

899
01:18:45,065 --> 01:18:47,056
I'm sorry, Madame.

900
01:18:47,735 --> 01:18:50,260
All I wanted from this meeting
was your forgiveness...

901
01:18:50,404 --> 01:18:52,804
...for the wrongs that you think
that I have done you.

902
01:18:52,873 --> 01:18:55,637
So that I may end my days
in some peace of mind.

903
01:18:56,243 --> 01:19:00,339
I understood you approved of the choice
my duty has compelled me to make.

904
01:19:00,414 --> 01:19:01,176
Yes.

905
01:19:01,582 --> 01:19:03,914
And your choice has determined mine.

906
01:19:04,018 --> 01:19:05,110
Which is what?

907
01:19:05,252 --> 01:19:08,119
The only choice capable of
putting an end to my suffering.

908
01:19:08,656 --> 01:19:09,350
What do you mean?

909
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:11,257
I love you.

910
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:12,948
You have no idea how much.

911
01:19:13,027 --> 01:19:16,155
Just remember I have made
far more difficult sacrifices...

912
01:19:16,297 --> 01:19:18,891
...than the one I am about to make.
Now...

913
01:19:22,236 --> 01:19:23,225
...goodbye.
- No.

914
01:19:24,104 --> 01:19:25,696
You must listen to me!

915
01:19:25,906 --> 01:19:27,032
No!

916
01:19:49,897 --> 01:19:53,958
Why should you be so upset
by the idea of making me happy?

917
01:19:55,402 --> 01:19:59,395
You are right. I cannot live
either unless I make you happy.

918
01:20:01,809 --> 01:20:03,140
So I promise...

919
01:20:03,944 --> 01:20:05,343
...no more refusals...

920
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,147
...and no more regrets.

921
01:20:24,264 --> 01:20:26,630
Success!

922
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:29,600
Success!

923
01:20:30,471 --> 01:20:31,563
Well...

924
01:20:32,072 --> 01:20:34,040
...I arrived at about six.

925
01:20:34,441 --> 01:20:36,875
Yes, I think you may omit
the details of the seduction.

926
01:20:37,544 --> 01:20:39,273
They are never very enlivening.

927
01:20:39,513 --> 01:20:41,344
Just describe the event itself.

928
01:20:41,482 --> 01:20:43,450
It was, unprecedented.

929
01:20:43,884 --> 01:20:44,714
Really?

930
01:20:44,952 --> 01:20:50,288
It had a kind of charm that
I don't think I have experienced before.

931
01:20:51,525 --> 01:20:56,019
Once she'd surrendered,
she behaved with perfect candour.

932
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:58,623
Total mutual delirium.

933
01:20:59,066 --> 01:21:03,298
Which, for the first time ever with me,
outlasted the pleasure itself.

934
01:21:04,204 --> 01:21:05,569
She was astonishing.

935
01:21:07,207 --> 01:21:11,871
So much so, that I ended by falling on
my knees and pledging her eternal love.

936
01:21:13,247 --> 01:21:15,238
And do you know that at that time...

937
01:21:15,382 --> 01:21:19,216
...and for several hours afterwards
I actually meant it.

938
01:21:22,055 --> 01:21:23,215
I see.

939
01:21:25,025 --> 01:21:26,890
Is extraordinary, isn't it?!

940
01:21:27,661 --> 01:21:28,821
Is it?

941
01:21:29,229 --> 01:21:32,323
- It sounds to me perfectly commonplace.
- Oh, no...

942
01:21:32,433 --> 01:21:33,832
...I assure you.

943
01:21:35,002 --> 01:21:37,368
But of course,
the best thing about it is...

944
01:21:37,838 --> 01:21:42,172
...I am now in a position
to be able to claim my reward.

945
01:21:50,284 --> 01:21:53,651
You mean to say you persuaded her
to write a letter as well...

946
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,347
...in the course of
this awesome encounter?

947
01:21:56,256 --> 01:22:00,920
I didn't necessarily think you were
going to be a stickler for formalities.

948
01:22:02,896 --> 01:22:07,196
In any case, I may have to declare
our arrangement null and void.

949
01:22:11,705 --> 01:22:12,933
What do you mean?

950
01:22:15,075 --> 01:22:17,134
I am not accustomed
to be taken for granted.

951
01:22:17,244 --> 01:22:19,041
But there is no question of that.

952
01:22:19,413 --> 01:22:21,278
You are misunderstanding me.

953
01:22:21,415 --> 01:22:24,748
And I have no wish to tear you away
from the arms of someone so astonishing.

954
01:22:24,818 --> 01:22:26,786
We have always been
frank with one another.

955
01:22:26,887 --> 01:22:29,082
And as a matter of fact,
I have also taken a new lover...

956
01:22:29,156 --> 01:22:30,589
...who at the moment,
is proving more than satisfactory.

957
01:22:31,225 --> 01:22:33,625
- Who is that?
- I am not in the mood for confidences.

958
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,387
Don't let me keep you.

959
01:22:37,731 --> 01:22:40,825
You can't seriously imagine
I prefer her to you?

960
01:22:40,968 --> 01:22:42,560
You may genuinely be unaware of this,

961
01:22:42,636 --> 01:22:45,730
but I can see quite plainly
that you are in love with this woman.

962
01:22:47,174 --> 01:22:47,833
No.

963
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:51,241
Not at all.

964
01:22:51,612 --> 01:22:54,638
Have you forgotten what it is like
to make a woman happy?

965
01:22:54,915 --> 01:22:56,314
And to be made happy yourself?

966
01:22:56,650 --> 01:22:57,412
I...

967
01:22:58,318 --> 01:22:59,342
Of course not.

968
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,511
We loved each other once, didn't we?

969
01:23:02,523 --> 01:23:03,990
I think it was love.

970
01:23:05,292 --> 01:23:06,919
And you made me very happy.

971
01:23:07,127 --> 01:23:09,595
And I could again.
We just untied the knot.

972
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,993
It was never broken.

973
01:23:11,164 --> 01:23:14,031
Illusions of course,
are by their nature sweet.

974
01:23:14,167 --> 01:23:17,534
I have no illusions.
I lost them on my travels.

975
01:23:22,843 --> 01:23:23,935
Now...

976
01:23:24,645 --> 01:23:26,169
...I want to come home.

977
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:40,159
As for this present infatuation,
it won't last...

978
01:23:40,294 --> 01:23:43,525
...but for the moment,
it is beyond my control.

979
01:24:27,507 --> 01:24:31,773
My dear Vicomte, I'm obliged
to go away for a couple of weeks...

980
01:24:31,912 --> 01:24:35,040
...but I am well aware
of our arrangement.

981
01:24:36,383 --> 01:24:41,616
On my return you and I will spend
a single night together.

982
01:24:42,222 --> 01:24:46,181
We shall enjoy it enough
to regret it is to be our last.

983
01:24:46,526 --> 01:24:52,362
But then we shall remember, that regret
is an essential component of happiness.

984
01:24:53,233 --> 01:24:54,359
All this, of course...

985
01:24:54,434 --> 01:24:58,427
...providing you are able
to procure this famous letter.

986
01:25:04,277 --> 01:25:06,438
It shall be done!

987
01:25:07,214 --> 01:25:10,980
But, Paris is so tedious without you.

988
01:25:11,551 --> 01:25:14,611
And I am living like a medieval hermit.

989
01:25:21,662 --> 01:25:22,959
All right, give me a moment.

990
01:25:23,096 --> 01:25:24,495
Drink up.

991
01:25:24,665 --> 01:25:25,859
What is it?

992
01:25:25,932 --> 01:25:28,628
Someone who may well not
appreciate your presence.

993
01:25:28,969 --> 01:25:32,302
- You mean a woman?
- A lady, we might even say.

994
01:25:33,173 --> 01:25:35,300
It is not the one
we wrote that letter to?

995
01:25:35,409 --> 01:25:37,775
- The very one.
- I enjoyed that.

996
01:25:37,844 --> 01:25:40,506
You proved a most talented desk.

997
01:25:41,948 --> 01:25:43,279
I'd like to see what she looks like.

998
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:45,250
- Well, you can't.
- Oh...

999
01:25:52,659 --> 01:25:56,925
On second thought,
I don't see why you shouldn't.

1000
01:26:04,971 --> 01:26:06,802
Tell me, do you have plans
for this evening?

1001
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:08,305
A few friends round for dinner.

1002
01:26:08,442 --> 01:26:11,502
- And after dinner?
- Nothing firm.

1003
01:26:15,449 --> 01:26:16,279
Well...

1004
01:26:42,242 --> 01:26:43,436
I will be there.

1005
01:27:01,061 --> 01:27:03,825
This is an unexpected pleasure.

1006
01:27:04,397 --> 01:27:06,262
- I know that woman.
- Are you sure?

1007
01:27:06,466 --> 01:27:07,433
I would be surprised.

1008
01:27:07,567 --> 01:27:09,501
She has been pointed out
to me at the opera.

1009
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:11,931
Yes, well, she is striking.

1010
01:27:12,439 --> 01:27:14,270
She is a courtesan, isn't she?

1011
01:27:18,979 --> 01:27:21,470
Yes, I suppose, in a manner of speaking.

1012
01:27:21,982 --> 01:27:23,779
Well I am sorry to have disturbed you.

1013
01:27:24,017 --> 01:27:26,713
Of course you have not disturbed me.
I'm overjoyed to see you.

1014
01:27:26,787 --> 01:27:28,584
You will never be received
at my house again.

1015
01:27:28,789 --> 01:27:30,450
I don't want your lies and excuses.

1016
01:27:30,524 --> 01:27:33,459
Sit down. Just hear me out.
That is all I ask.

1017
01:27:33,593 --> 01:27:35,356
Then you can judge.

1018
01:27:50,577 --> 01:27:54,138
Unfortunately, I cannot unlive
the years I lived before I met you...

1019
01:27:54,281 --> 01:27:56,841
...and during those years
I had a wide acquaintance...

1020
01:27:57,184 --> 01:28:01,245
...the majority of whom were no doubt
undesirable in one respect or another.

1021
01:28:01,321 --> 01:28:02,185
Now...

1022
01:28:02,455 --> 01:28:04,514
...it may surprise you to know
that Emilie...

1023
01:28:04,591 --> 01:28:08,425
...in common with many others
of her character and profession...

1024
01:28:08,562 --> 01:28:11,030
...is kind-hearted enough
to take an interest...

1025
01:28:11,097 --> 01:28:13,065
...in those less fortunate than herself.

1026
01:28:13,567 --> 01:28:15,159
In short...

1027
01:28:15,302 --> 01:28:20,535
...she has the time and the inclination
to do a great deal of charity work.

1028
01:28:22,509 --> 01:28:26,070
Donations to hospitals,
soup for the poor...

1029
01:28:29,449 --> 01:28:31,417
...protection for animals...

1030
01:28:31,818 --> 01:28:35,049
...anything which touches
her sentimental heart.

1031
01:28:36,089 --> 01:28:40,958
From time to time, I make a small
contribution to her purse. That is all.

1032
01:28:44,631 --> 01:28:46,360
Is that true?

1033
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,397
My relations with Emilie...

1034
01:28:48,468 --> 01:28:51,301
...have been, for some years now,
quite blameless.

1035
01:28:51,705 --> 01:28:56,438
I mean, she has even done a little
secretarial work for me on occasion.

1036
01:28:56,943 --> 01:28:58,604
Why did she laugh?

1037
01:28:58,745 --> 01:29:00,406
I have no idea.

1038
01:29:01,715 --> 01:29:03,307
Does she know about me?

1039
01:29:04,017 --> 01:29:06,679
No doubt she made what,
in view of my past...

1040
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:10,119
...must be regarded
as a fair assumption.

1041
01:29:15,829 --> 01:29:17,592
I want to believe you.

1042
01:29:17,898 --> 01:29:19,889
I knew you were coming up.

1043
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,227
You were announced.

1044
01:29:30,977 --> 01:29:32,308
I am sorry.

1045
01:29:41,187 --> 01:29:42,745
But no...

1046
01:29:44,991 --> 01:29:47,653
...no, it is I who must apologize.

1047
01:29:48,828 --> 01:29:51,695
It was most insensitive of me.

1048
01:29:57,837 --> 01:30:01,295
I didn't think it was possible
for me to love you more.

1049
01:30:02,609 --> 01:30:04,474
But your jealousy...

1050
01:30:09,149 --> 01:30:11,447
I love you so much.

1051
01:30:26,533 --> 01:30:29,730
When will you start writing to me again?

1052
01:30:42,582 --> 01:30:44,607
My dear Vicomte...

1053
01:30:44,851 --> 01:30:49,584
...I don't believe this self-denial
can be good for you.

1054
01:30:50,256 --> 01:30:54,522
I hope it does not mean you are
neglecting your little pupil.

1055
01:30:59,065 --> 01:31:01,033
But where can Danceny be?

1056
01:31:04,404 --> 01:31:07,202
I told you, I have all my people out
looking for him.

1057
01:31:07,273 --> 01:31:09,036
There is no trace of him.

1058
01:31:23,256 --> 01:31:24,883
It is only the wind.

1059
01:31:29,362 --> 01:31:30,920
Where are you?

1060
01:31:31,398 --> 01:31:33,161
There is nothing
to be frightened about.

1061
01:31:33,533 --> 01:31:35,262
Yes, there is.

1062
01:31:37,303 --> 01:31:39,066
I am bleeding.

1063
01:32:45,004 --> 01:32:47,063
Your porter seems to be
under the impression...

1064
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:49,040
...that you're still out of town.

1065
01:32:50,143 --> 01:32:52,839
I have in fact only just returned.

1066
01:32:53,213 --> 01:32:55,511
Without attracting the attention
of your porter?

1067
01:32:55,748 --> 01:32:58,546
I think it may be time to review
your domestic arrangements.

1068
01:32:58,618 --> 01:33:01,086
I am exhausted.
Naturally, I instructed the porter...

1069
01:33:01,287 --> 01:33:04,723
...to inform any casual callers
that I was out.

1070
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:07,751
And you here as well...

1071
01:33:08,061 --> 01:33:10,655
...my dear, young friend.

1072
01:33:12,699 --> 01:33:16,328
The porter appears to be having
a somewhat erratic evening.

1073
01:33:18,805 --> 01:33:20,363
Yes.

1074
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:22,735
As a matter of fact,
it is you that I am looking for.

1075
01:33:23,376 --> 01:33:24,707
Is it?

1076
01:33:25,278 --> 01:33:29,681
Mademoiselle Cecile returns to Paris
after an absence of over two months.

1077
01:33:29,849 --> 01:33:32,511
Now what do you suppose is
uppermost in her mind?!

1078
01:33:32,619 --> 01:33:37,420
Answer, of course, the longed-for
reunion with her beloved Chevalier.

1079
01:33:37,524 --> 01:33:38,320
Vicomte...

1080
01:33:38,491 --> 01:33:40,186
...this is no time to make mischief.

1081
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:43,195
Nothing could be further
from my mind, Madame.

1082
01:33:43,496 --> 01:33:44,428
Go on.

1083
01:33:44,831 --> 01:33:48,858
Imagine her distress and alarm when
her loved one is nowhere to be found.

1084
01:33:49,335 --> 01:33:52,736
I have had to do more improvising
than an Italian actor.

1085
01:33:52,872 --> 01:33:55,067
How is she? Is she all right?

1086
01:33:55,208 --> 01:33:58,075
Oh, yes. Well, no, to be quite frank.

1087
01:33:58,378 --> 01:34:00,403
I'm sorry to tell you she has been ill.

1088
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:02,673
- Ill!
- Calm yourself, my friend.

1089
01:34:03,082 --> 01:34:05,915
The surgeon has declared her
well on the road to recovery.

1090
01:34:06,152 --> 01:34:09,849
But you can well imagine how
desperate I have been to find you.

1091
01:34:09,989 --> 01:34:11,684
Of course, I...

1092
01:34:11,824 --> 01:34:14,725
My God, how could I have
been away at such a time?

1093
01:34:14,861 --> 01:34:16,852
How can I ever forgive myself?

1094
01:34:20,066 --> 01:34:20,964
But, look...

1095
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:23,295
...all is well now with Cecile,
I assure you.

1096
01:34:23,469 --> 01:34:26,097
And I shan't disturb you further.

1097
01:34:27,307 --> 01:34:31,266
It is only that I have a little
something to show the Marquise.

1098
01:34:42,355 --> 01:34:44,323
Wait in my dressing room.

1099
01:34:45,425 --> 01:34:47,723
- It is through there.
- I know where it is.

1100
01:34:57,370 --> 01:34:59,895
I see she writes as badly
as she dresses.

1101
01:35:01,307 --> 01:35:04,140
Is it really true
the little one's been ill?

1102
01:35:04,277 --> 01:35:06,541
Not so much an illness,
more a refurbishment.

1103
01:35:06,779 --> 01:35:07,507
What do you mean?

1104
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:08,638
Miscarriage.

1105
01:35:10,016 --> 01:35:12,177
Oh, Vicomte, I am so sorry.

1106
01:35:12,418 --> 01:35:14,443
Your son and Bastide's heir.

1107
01:35:19,959 --> 01:35:22,860
Isn't there something else
that we should be discussing?

1108
01:35:23,162 --> 01:35:25,630
I do hope you are not going
to be difficult about Danceny.

1109
01:35:25,698 --> 01:35:27,325
I know Belleroche was pretty limp...

1110
01:35:27,433 --> 01:35:30,129
...but I do think you could have found
a livelier replacement...

1111
01:35:30,203 --> 01:35:31,465
...than that mawkish schoolboy.

1112
01:35:31,537 --> 01:35:33,869
Mawkish or not, he's completely
devoted to me.

1113
01:35:34,507 --> 01:35:37,908
And, I suspect, better equipped
to provide me with...

1114
01:35:38,144 --> 01:35:40,772
...happiness and pleasure
than you are...

1115
01:35:41,014 --> 01:35:42,879
...in your present mood.

1116
01:35:43,116 --> 01:35:44,777
I see.

1117
01:35:47,387 --> 01:35:51,448
If I thought you would be
your old charming self...

1118
01:35:52,558 --> 01:35:54,958
...I might invite you to visit me
one evening next week.

1119
01:35:56,162 --> 01:35:57,220
Really?

1120
01:35:57,797 --> 01:35:59,788
I still love you, you see...

1121
01:36:01,668 --> 01:36:04,535
...in spite of all your faults
and my complaints.

1122
01:36:14,547 --> 01:36:17,641
Are you sure you are not going
to impose some new condition...

1123
01:36:17,817 --> 01:36:21,150
...before you agree
to honour your obligation?

1124
01:36:30,697 --> 01:36:35,157
I have a friend who became involved
with an entirely unsuitable woman.

1125
01:36:36,269 --> 01:36:38,737
Whenever any of us
pointed this out to him...

1126
01:36:39,072 --> 01:36:43,168
...he invariably made
the same feeble reply:

1127
01:36:43,743 --> 01:36:46,837
"Is beyond my control," he would say.

1128
01:36:47,146 --> 01:36:50,513
He was on the verge of
becoming a laughing stock.

1129
01:36:50,983 --> 01:36:54,680
At which point, another friend of mine,
a woman...

1130
01:36:55,054 --> 01:36:57,716
...decided to speak to him seriously.

1131
01:36:58,224 --> 01:37:01,022
She explained to him
that his name was in danger...

1132
01:37:01,127 --> 01:37:05,086
...of being ludicrously associated with
this phrase for the rest of his life.

1133
01:37:05,565 --> 01:37:07,192
So, do you know what he did?

1134
01:37:07,266 --> 01:37:09,757
I feel sure you are about to tell me.

1135
01:37:11,471 --> 01:37:15,703
He went round to see his mistress and
bluntly announced he was leaving her.

1136
01:37:16,109 --> 01:37:19,306
Well, as you can expect,
she protested vociferously.

1137
01:37:19,879 --> 01:37:21,870
But to everything she said...

1138
01:37:21,981 --> 01:37:24,381
...to every objection she made...

1139
01:37:24,717 --> 01:37:26,412
...he simply replied:

1140
01:37:27,253 --> 01:37:30,222
"Is beyond my control."

1141
01:37:35,027 --> 01:37:36,551
Good night.

1142
01:38:03,423 --> 01:38:05,983
You're only five minutes late,
but I get so frightened.

1143
01:38:06,259 --> 01:38:07,954
I become convinced I'm never
going to see you again.

1144
01:38:08,027 --> 01:38:10,860
- My angel.
- Is it like that for you, too?

1145
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,330
Yes.

1146
01:38:16,369 --> 01:38:19,361
At this moment, for example,
I'm quite convinced...

1147
01:38:19,439 --> 01:38:21,532
...I am never going to see you again.

1148
01:38:23,009 --> 01:38:24,271
What?

1149
01:38:24,944 --> 01:38:26,536
I'm so bored, you see.

1150
01:38:27,213 --> 01:38:29,113
Is beyond my control.

1151
01:38:31,551 --> 01:38:32,779
What do you mean?

1152
01:38:35,121 --> 01:38:37,214
Well, after all,
it has been four months.

1153
01:38:37,390 --> 01:38:38,789
So, what I said:

1154
01:38:38,991 --> 01:38:41,585
Is beyond my control.

1155
01:38:45,665 --> 01:38:47,292
Do you mean you don't love me anymore?

1156
01:38:47,633 --> 01:38:50,864
My love had great difficulty
outlasting your virtue.

1157
01:38:51,137 --> 01:38:53,071
Is beyond my control.

1158
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:57,038
- It is that woman, isn't it?
- You are quite right.

1159
01:38:57,143 --> 01:38:59,338
I have been deceiving you
with Emilie, among others.

1160
01:39:00,413 --> 01:39:03,644
Is beyond my control.

1161
01:39:05,518 --> 01:39:07,145
Why are you doing this?

1162
01:39:08,921 --> 01:39:11,913
There's a woman.
Not Emilie, another woman.

1163
01:39:12,492 --> 01:39:14,050
A woman I adore.

1164
01:39:15,094 --> 01:39:17,824
And I am afraid she is insisting
that I give you up.

1165
01:39:21,834 --> 01:39:24,359
Is beyond my control.

1166
01:39:26,939 --> 01:39:29,737
Liar! Liar!

1167
01:39:30,076 --> 01:39:31,771
You are quite right, I am a liar.

1168
01:39:31,944 --> 01:39:36,347
And is like your fidelity, a fact
of life. No more nor less irritating.

1169
01:39:36,582 --> 01:39:39,244
- Certainly beyond my control.
- Stop it!

1170
01:39:39,352 --> 01:39:40,944
Don't keep saying that!

1171
01:39:42,788 --> 01:39:44,756
Sorry. Beyond my control.

1172
01:39:48,427 --> 01:39:50,122
Why don't you take another lover?

1173
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:55,533
Whatever you would like.

1174
01:39:56,068 --> 01:39:58,093
Is beyond my control.

1175
01:40:03,543 --> 01:40:05,443
Do you want to kill me?

1176
01:40:07,146 --> 01:40:09,307
Listen. Listen to me.

1177
01:40:10,049 --> 01:40:11,983
You have given me great pleasure.

1178
01:40:12,418 --> 01:40:16,115
But I simply cannot bring myself
to regret leaving you.

1179
01:40:16,489 --> 01:40:17,979
It is the way of the world.

1180
01:40:18,758 --> 01:40:21,386
Quite beyond my control.

1181
01:41:05,004 --> 01:41:07,131
- Tomorrow morning, early.
- Yes, my lord.

1182
01:41:13,312 --> 01:41:15,371
This is not your appointed night.

1183
01:41:16,048 --> 01:41:17,845
That story you told me, how did it end?

1184
01:41:17,984 --> 01:41:19,474
I am not sure I know what you mean.

1185
01:41:19,719 --> 01:41:23,780
Once this friend of yours had taken
the advice of his lady-friend...

1186
01:41:23,856 --> 01:41:25,118
...did she take him back?

1187
01:41:26,492 --> 01:41:27,584
Am I to understand?

1188
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:31,824
The day after our last meeting,
I broke with Madame de Tourvel...

1189
01:41:31,964 --> 01:41:35,195
...on the grounds that it was
"beyond my control."

1190
01:41:36,035 --> 01:41:36,694
You didn't?!

1191
01:41:36,836 --> 01:41:38,303
I certainly did.

1192
01:41:39,839 --> 01:41:41,704
But how wonderful of you.

1193
01:41:42,041 --> 01:41:44,737
You kept telling me
my reputation was in danger...

1194
01:41:44,844 --> 01:41:48,405
...but I think this may well turn out
to be my most famous exploit.

1195
01:41:48,814 --> 01:41:51,681
I believe that it sets a new standard.

1196
01:41:53,219 --> 01:41:57,178
Only one thing could possibly
bring me greater glory.

1197
01:41:57,556 --> 01:41:59,183
What is that?

1198
01:42:01,494 --> 01:42:02,825
To win her back.

1199
01:42:03,596 --> 01:42:04,824
You think you could?

1200
01:42:05,731 --> 01:42:07,323
I do not see why not.

1201
01:42:07,933 --> 01:42:09,560
I'll tell you why not.

1202
01:42:10,936 --> 01:42:15,032
Because when one woman strikes at the
heart of another, she seldom misses...

1203
01:42:15,174 --> 01:42:17,404
...and the wound is invariably fatal.

1204
01:42:17,610 --> 01:42:19,544
- Is that so?
- Oh, yes.

1205
01:42:21,714 --> 01:42:24,774
I am also inclined to see this
as one of my greatest triumphs.

1206
01:42:24,917 --> 01:42:28,751
There is nothing a woman enjoys
so much as victory over another woman.

1207
01:42:28,888 --> 01:42:31,413
Except you see, Vicomte,
my victory wasn't over her.

1208
01:42:31,557 --> 01:42:33,081
Of course it was, what do you mean?

1209
01:42:33,392 --> 01:42:34,620
It was over you.

1210
01:42:36,395 --> 01:42:38,795
You loved that woman, Vicomte.

1211
01:42:39,398 --> 01:42:40,797
Whas more, you still do.

1212
01:42:41,300 --> 01:42:42,699
Quite desperately.

1213
01:42:43,903 --> 01:42:45,564
If you had not been so ashamed of it...

1214
01:42:45,638 --> 01:42:47,799
...how could you have
treated her so viciously?

1215
01:42:49,442 --> 01:42:53,811
You could not bear even the vague
possibility of being laughed at.

1216
01:42:55,147 --> 01:42:58,139
And this has proved something
I have always suspected.

1217
01:42:58,884 --> 01:43:01,284
That vanity and happiness...

1218
01:43:02,688 --> 01:43:04,622
...are incompatible.

1219
01:43:05,725 --> 01:43:11,493
Whatever may or may not be the truth
of these philosophical speculations...

1220
01:43:12,331 --> 01:43:16,267
...the fact remains, it is now
your turn to make a sacrifice.

1221
01:43:16,335 --> 01:43:17,233
Is that so?

1222
01:43:17,303 --> 01:43:19,931
- Danceny must go.
- Where?

1223
01:43:20,473 --> 01:43:25,672
I have been more than patient with this
little whim of yours. Enough is enough.

1224
01:43:25,811 --> 01:43:27,335
One of the reasons
that I never remarried...

1225
01:43:27,413 --> 01:43:29,404
...despite a quite bewildering
range of offers...

1226
01:43:29,515 --> 01:43:32,848
...was the determination never
again to be ordered around.

1227
01:43:33,319 --> 01:43:37,688
I must therefore ask you to adopt
a less "marital" tone of voice.

1228
01:43:37,857 --> 01:43:42,294
She is ill, you know.
I have made her ill for your sake.

1229
01:43:42,628 --> 01:43:46,155
So the least you can do is
get rid of that colourless youth!

1230
01:43:48,634 --> 01:43:52,001
Haven't you had enough of
bullying women for the time being?

1231
01:43:52,471 --> 01:43:55,497
I see I shall have to
make myself very plain.

1232
01:43:55,841 --> 01:43:58,332
I have come to spend the night.

1233
01:43:58,511 --> 01:44:01,674
I shall not take at all kindly
to being turned away.

1234
01:44:02,815 --> 01:44:05,943
I am sorry.
I have made other arrangements.

1235
01:44:07,653 --> 01:44:10,053
Yes, I knew there was something.

1236
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:12,322
What?

1237
01:44:17,163 --> 01:44:20,223
Danceny isn't coming. Not tonight.

1238
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,665
What do you mean. How do you know?

1239
01:44:26,405 --> 01:44:30,136
I know, because I have arranged
for him to spend the night with Cecile.

1240
01:44:34,013 --> 01:44:38,245
Come to think of it,
he mentioned he was expected here.

1241
01:44:38,717 --> 01:44:42,813
But, when I put it to him that he would
really have to make a choice...

1242
01:44:42,888 --> 01:44:45,254
...I must say, he did not hesitate.

1243
01:44:45,658 --> 01:44:49,219
He is coming to see you
tomorrow, to explain.

1244
01:44:49,395 --> 01:44:51,829
And to offer you...

1245
01:44:51,897 --> 01:44:54,525
I think I do...

1246
01:44:55,167 --> 01:44:56,930
...his eternal friendship.

1247
01:44:57,570 --> 01:45:01,233
As you said, he is
entirely devoted to you.

1248
01:45:02,942 --> 01:45:04,136
That is enough, Vicomte.

1249
01:45:05,110 --> 01:45:06,941
You are absolutely right.

1250
01:45:08,781 --> 01:45:10,078
Shall we go up?

1251
01:45:11,016 --> 01:45:13,075
Shall we, what?

1252
01:45:13,352 --> 01:45:14,512
Go up.

1253
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:18,784
Unless you prefer this, if memory
serves, rather purgatorial sofa.

1254
01:45:18,924 --> 01:45:21,518
- I think it is time you were leaving.
- No, I do not think so.

1255
01:45:21,794 --> 01:45:24,957
We made an arrangement. I really
don't think I can allow myself...

1256
01:45:25,097 --> 01:45:28,066
...to be taken advantage of
for a moment longer.

1257
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:30,530
Remember, I am better at this
than you are.

1258
01:45:30,703 --> 01:45:33,638
Perhaps. But it is always
the best swimmers who drown.

1259
01:45:33,739 --> 01:45:35,707
Now, yes or no?

1260
01:45:36,542 --> 01:45:37,839
It is up to you, of course.

1261
01:45:38,277 --> 01:45:41,075
I will merely confine
myself to remarking...

1262
01:45:41,146 --> 01:45:44,638
...that a "no" will be regarded
as a declaration of war.

1263
01:45:48,754 --> 01:45:51,882
A single word is all that is required.

1264
01:45:55,327 --> 01:45:56,487
All right.

1265
01:46:00,766 --> 01:46:02,563
War!

1266
01:46:25,925 --> 01:46:28,359
My dear Chevalier Danceny...

1267
01:46:29,495 --> 01:46:34,159
...I understand you spent last
night with Cecile Volanges.

1268
01:46:34,633 --> 01:46:38,364
I learnt this from her more,
regular lover...

1269
01:46:39,171 --> 01:46:41,765
...the Vicomte de Valmont.

1270
01:47:58,517 --> 01:48:01,179
I am dying because
I would not believe you.

1271
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:50,352
Fetch the surgeon.

1272
01:49:50,696 --> 01:49:52,027
No, no.

1273
01:49:52,498 --> 01:49:53,965
Do as I say.

1274
01:50:02,341 --> 01:50:03,865
A moment of your time.

1275
01:50:08,313 --> 01:50:12,647
Two things: A word of advice,
which of course you may ignore, but...

1276
01:50:13,118 --> 01:50:15,951
...it is honestly intended...

1277
01:50:16,455 --> 01:50:17,820
...and a request...

1278
01:50:19,224 --> 01:50:20,191
Go on.

1279
01:50:21,627 --> 01:50:24,960
The advice is: Be careful of
the Marquise de Merteuil.

1280
01:50:26,165 --> 01:50:28,759
You must permit me to treat
with scepticism...

1281
01:50:28,834 --> 01:50:30,825
...anything you have to say about her.

1282
01:50:31,136 --> 01:50:33,570
Nevertheless, I must tell you...

1283
01:50:33,972 --> 01:50:37,305
...in this affair,
we are both her creatures...

1284
01:50:42,681 --> 01:50:46,082
...as I believe her letters
to me will prove.

1285
01:50:49,021 --> 01:50:52,923
When you have read them,
you may decide to circulate them.

1286
01:50:57,362 --> 01:50:58,693
And the request?

1287
01:51:02,234 --> 01:51:03,724
I want you somehow...

1288
01:51:04,736 --> 01:51:05,600
...somehow...

1289
01:51:06,572 --> 01:51:09,735
...to get to see Madame de Tourvel.

1290
01:51:12,544 --> 01:51:14,102
I understand she is very ill.

1291
01:51:14,613 --> 01:51:16,945
That is why this is
most important to me.

1292
01:51:20,118 --> 01:51:23,281
I want you to tell her
that I cannot explain...

1293
01:51:23,855 --> 01:51:26,585
...why I broke with her as I did.

1294
01:51:27,459 --> 01:51:31,725
But that since then,
my life has been worth nothing.

1295
01:51:34,132 --> 01:51:37,761
I pushed the blade in deeper
than you just have my boy...

1296
01:51:38,403 --> 01:51:41,133
...and now I need you
to help me withdraw it.

1297
01:51:43,976 --> 01:51:47,309
Tell her it is lucky for her
that I have gone...

1298
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:51,374
...and I am glad not to have
to live without her.

1299
01:51:53,252 --> 01:51:58,656
Tell her, her love was the only
real happiness that I have ever known.

1300
01:52:03,729 --> 01:52:05,629
Will you do that for me?

1301
01:52:06,732 --> 01:52:07,960
I will.

1302
01:52:11,970 --> 01:52:14,336
It is all very well feeling sorry now.

1303
01:52:15,173 --> 01:52:16,572
Let him be.

1304
01:52:19,311 --> 01:52:21,176
He had good cause.

1305
01:52:24,583 --> 01:52:30,351
I don't believe thas something anyone
has ever been able to say about me.

1306
01:53:07,392 --> 01:53:08,552
Enough...

1307
01:53:12,631 --> 01:53:14,394
Draw the curtains.

1308
01:54:13,225 --> 01:54:15,523
Get out! Get out of here!
