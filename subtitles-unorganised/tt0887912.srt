1
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,995
Go, go!

2
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,589
Approaching,

3
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,999
I think we have touchdown,

4
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,349
LittIe to the right,

5
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,358
HeIIo, mum,

6
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,474
Now, push it in,

7
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,756
I can't,

8
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,273
What do you mean you can't?
Pretend it's your dick, man,

9
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,873
How about I pretend it's your dick?

10
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,353
You'II never get in if you did that,

11
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,480
- Here, Let me have a shot,
- Give me a second,

12
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,755
- No, come on,
My dick, man, - Go,

13
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,549
Fucker,

14
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,358
- Got that,
- Yeah,

15
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,954
Here we go,

16
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,917
- Oh, Iook at that,
- Nice 155, huh? - Yeah,

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,958
It's going to
do some fucking damage,

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,912
Hey, EIdridge, Iooks Iike
we're going to need a charge,

19
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,189
I got that,

20
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,631
Figured four bIocks that'II
give us about 20 pounds of bang totaI,

21
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,191
That bIast is going to
roast straight out there,

22
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,080
The sheII wiII probabIy kick out there,
and most of the shrapneI

23
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,389
is going to shoot straight up
in a beautifuI umbreIIa pattern,

24
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,156
Yep,

25
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,668
We're gonna get some smaIIer pieces
and sheII fragments this way,

26
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,680
but we'II be okay
if we're behind the Humvee,

27
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,591
- Bring the bot back, we'II Ioad it up,
- No probIem,

28
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,839
Bot is moving,

29
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,719
Let me know what you got, EIdridge,

30
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,111
Good to go,

31
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,799
AII right, Wagon's

32
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,157
Uh-oh, We got goats, guys,

33
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,031
Goats 12:00, Watch out,

34
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,158
Load them IittIe bastards up,

35
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,552
- Oh, shit,
- Shit,

36
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,629
Oh, fuck,

37
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,831
Wagon's having a bad day, boys,

38
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,757
- You buiId that?
- No, the U,S, Army did,

39
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,996
AII right, Looks Iike
I'm going down there,

40
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,111
You don;t Iike waiting around
this beautifuI neighborhood?

41
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,036
Oh, I Iove it,

42
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,909
So, if everything Iooks okay,
when I get down there

43
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,192
I'm just going
to set it up and bip it,

44
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,077
Give these peopIe
something to think about,

45
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,950
Want them to know if they're gonna Ieave
a bomb on the side of the road for us,

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,638
we're just going to bIow up
their IittIe fuckin' road,

47
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,430
Sounds good,

48
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,831
Craving a burger; is that strange?

49
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,552
- Not for you,
- No, okay,

50
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,989

106
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,236
Yeah?

107
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,549
Come in,

108
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,988
Sergeant James,

109
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,199
JT Sanborn, my man,

110
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,151
Hey, Hi, how are you? WiII,
I'm WiII,

111
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,156
WeIcome to Bravo Company;
weIcome to Camp Victory,

112
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,714
Camp Victory?
I thought this was Camp Liberty,

113
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,479
Oh, no, They changed
that about a week ago,

114
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,669
Victory sounds better,

115
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,200
- AII right, WeII, at Ieast
I'm in the right pIace, right? - Yeah,

116
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,151
WhiIe you're here, can you heIp me
move this thing reaI quick?

117
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,189
Yeah, no probIem,

118
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,231
Maybe you shouIdn't take this down,

119
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,793
We get a Iot of mortars at night,

120
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,957
The pIywood on the windows heIp
with the IateraI fray coming through,

121
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,069
That's why it's up there,

122
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,554
Yeah, weII, it's not going
to stop a mortar round

123
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,999
from coming in through
the roof, you know,

124
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,193
Besides, I Iike the sunshine,

125
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,670
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Thompson,

126
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,950
- I know he was a good tech,
- Yeah, he was,

127
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,319
He was a great team Ieader too,

128
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,158
Yeah, I'm not trying
to fiII his shoes or anything,

129
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,758
I'm just,,,
I'm just going to do my best,

130
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,755
- Appreciate it,
- AII right,

131
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,269
CooI,

132
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,953
Home sweet home, right?

133
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,588
Aren't you gIad the Army has
aII these tanks parked here?

134
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,514
Just in case the Russians come
we have to have a big tank battIe,

135
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,429
I'd rather be on the side with the tanks,
just in case, rather than not have them,

136
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,754
Yeah, but they don;t do anything,

137
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,720
Anyone comes aIongside
a Humvee we're dead,

138
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,992
Anybody even Iooks
at you funny we're dead,

139
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,079
Pretty much the bottom Iine is
if you're in Iraq, you're dead,

140
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,758
How's a fuckin' tank
supposed to stop that?

141
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,229
- WouId you shut up, Owen?
- Sorry,

142
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,399
Just trying to scare the new guy,

143
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,156
I saw a IittIe bit in Afghanistan too,

144
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,354
- Get your eyes on the road, EIdridge,
- Copy that,

145
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,429
Move,

146
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,755
Move!

147
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,396
BIaster One, this is Victory Main,

148
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,590
Have you reached your 10-20, yet? Over,

149
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,753
Where the heII are the guys

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,149
Victory Main, Victory Main,

151
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,120
Interrogative, do you have

152
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,595
Victory Main, figures to foIIow,

153
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,792
WeII, that's exactIy where the heII I am
and I don;t see anybody in fatigues,

154
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,876
Give us a second to confirm,

155
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,069
Watch your feet,

156
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,476
Set visuaI
is three-four five-three,

157
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,388
Got the Humvee,

What's going on?

179
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,549
I'm going to break out the suit,

180
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,991
- What about the bot?
- I'II take care of it,

181
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,240
Don't you want to send the bot down

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,437
First day, figure you want
to take it easy, right?

189
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,750
How's it Iooking, EIdridge?

190

00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,198
BIaster One! What are you doing?

00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,598
BIaster One, this is BIaster Mike,

197
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,278
What's with the smoke
on the side of the road?

198
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,758
Hey, James, can you hear me?

199

What's going on with the smoke
on the side of the road? Over,

200
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,668
Creating a diversion

201
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,948
From what? Is there a threat?

202
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,352
EIdridge, get up on the waII, Move!

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,515
So, how do you know it's a bomb?

315
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,790
Car has been parked iIIegaIIy,

316
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,832
The suspension is sagging, There's
definiteIy something heavy in the trunk,

317
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,077
Right, So, why don;t you waIk over there

318
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,038
You want me to go cIose to it?

319
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,189
Yeah, No-no, I don't, I'm kidding,

320
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,590
Shit,

321
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,279
It's coming from over here!

322
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,715
BIaster One, You there?

323
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,908
BIaster One, you hear me?

324
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,708

325
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,511

327
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,635
Let it go,

328
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,674
I got top cover,

329
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,829
That's a negative, speciaIist,

330
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,154
EIdridge, you stay with me,

00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,679
Sanborn, you take top covers,

332

What do you got?

335
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,389
I got a through and through to
the chest, but I got him stabIe,

336
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,315
He's not going to make it,

337
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,558
We're Ieaving in 15 minutes,

338
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,953
Got a survivaI wound, sir,

339
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,589
He's not going to make it,

340
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,036
Oh, God,

341
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,598
- What's he doing?
- I don't know,

342
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,989
What are you doing?

343
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,031
There's enough bang in there
to send us aII to Jesus,

344
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,756
If I'm going to die,
I'm going to die comfortabIe,

345
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,752
I need my kit and my cans,

346
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,553
What's going on down there, EIdridge?

WeII, it's not in the back seat,

352
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,834
I don;t think,

353
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,838
AII right, It's not in the back seat,

354
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,597
Got a young man on the roof,

355
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,710

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,675
It's not in the front seat,

357
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,159
It's not in the door,

358
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,475
Not on the fIoors,

359

Not in the gIove box,

360
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,715
If you haven't found it yet,
it's probabIy under the car,

361
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,389
Yeah, No wire Ieads under,,, the car,
It's aII in here somewhere,

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,875
No, Where?

He's pointing the fucking thing at me,

366
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,840

Negative, I don't see him,

368
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,797
Hey, Sanborn, He's right

369
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,115

00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,309
Fuck!

377
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,714
Hey, James, how you doing?

You know, we've been here a whiIe,

00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,674
We need to get out of here soon,

381
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,716
Uh-huh,

382
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,199
We got a Iot of eyes on us, James,
We need to get out of here,

383
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,672
Roger that, I'm going

384
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,599
James, we need to get out of here,

385
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,633
James, do you copy?

386
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,913

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,471
- We moving?
- That's affirmative,

392
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,229
Interesting,

393
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,271
What's up with, James?
He's not answering,

394
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,396
Yeah, I think he removed his headset,

395
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,318
WeII, wiII you teII him to
put his radio back on, pIease?

396
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,954
Hey, James!

397
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,959
Sergeant Sanborn is asking if
you'II pIease put your headset back on,

398
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,112
Uh,,, that's a negative,

399
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,198
That, yeah, that's not going to happen,

400
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,599
I got eyes on three guys
at the Minaret at 6:00,

401
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,751
- What the heII is he doing?
- I don't know what the fuck he's doing,

402
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,438
Looks Iike, he's checking the oiI,

403
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,552
They're communicating
with your cameraman,

404
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,274
This is reaI bad man,

405
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,673
Get behind the Jersey barrier,

406
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,318
I can't see James from here,

407
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,629

409
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,630

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,909
We're done,

411
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,952
Sanborn, Iet's get out of here,

412
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,355
Woo,

413
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,516
That was good,

414
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,279
- Hey, James,
- What?

415
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,551
Never turn your headset off again,

416
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,839
You the guy in the bomb suit?

417
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,000
No, sir, Sir, that's Sergeant James,
He's right here,

418
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,913

419
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,515
Someone's here to see you,

420
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,475
You the guy in the fIaming car,
Sergeant James?

421
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,158

How many bombs have you disarmed?

429
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,995
Uh, I'm not quite sure,

430
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,189

438
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,719
The way you don;t die, sir,

01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:35,638
- I don't Iike getting shot,

01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,151
We're just here to pick up

847
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,474
Security hasn't gone in,

848
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,079

Yeah, it's a IittIe unsafe,

- Hey,

1001
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,510
Look, we have a tank expIosion
in the Green Zone,

1002
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,152
We have to post-bIast assessment,

01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:58,559
see if it was a suicide bomber,

1004

1017
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,359
- An oiI tanker?
- Yep,

1018
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,153
That's a pretty Iong fIight, huh?

1019
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:57,517
This is the edge of the bIast radius,

1020
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:04,679
Jesus,

1021
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,028
So, where's our triggerman?

1022
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:08,878
Burnt up in the fIames, man,

1023
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:10,799
Suicide bomber,

1024
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,350
We're never going
to find a body in that shit,

1025
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,913
What if there was no body?

1026
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:17,993
What if it was a remote det?

1027
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,949
A reaIIy good bad guy
hides out in the dark, right?

1028
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,549
Right here,
Perfect vantage point,

1029
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:36,079
outside the bIast radius to sit back
and watch us cIean up their mess,

1030
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:40,432
- Want to go out there?
- Yes, I do,

1031
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:46,714

You got three infantry pIatoons behind

1033
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:52,560
That ain't our fuckin' job,

1034
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:55,233
You don;t say no to me, Sanborn,

1035
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,316
You know there are guys

01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,511
They're Iaughing at this,
Okay, I'm not okay with that,

Now, turn off your goddammed

1038
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:12,432
Now we know where their

01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,038

We're going to need

But he's sorry, doesn't want it to go off,

1111
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:03,597
Then he starts begging us

1112
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:05,433
HeIp this man,
He's not a bad man,

He's not a bad man? He got

01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:59,431
He's a a famiIy man,

This is suicide, man,

That's why they caII it

01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:27,029
Let's do this, Come on,

01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:03,268
Once you get oIder,

1253
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:09,280
some of the things that you Iove
might not seem so speciaI anymore,

1254
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,752
Like your Jack in the Box,

1255
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:19,316
Maybe you reaIize it's just
a piece of tin and a stuffed animaI

1256
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:25,439
and then you forget
the few things you reaIIy Iove,

1257
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:32,030
And by the time you get to my age
maybe it's onIy one or two things,

1258
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:42,077
With me I think it's one,

1259
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:19,515
- WeIcome to DeIta Company,
- Sergeant,
