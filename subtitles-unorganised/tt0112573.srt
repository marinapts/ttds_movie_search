1
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,153
Retreat.

2
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:55,861
Bastard.

3
00:02:56,906 --> 00:02:59,113
Come on.

4
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:41,153
All right.

5
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:12,065
Wallace.

6
00:04:18,284 --> 00:04:20,573
Wallace.

7
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:55,105
I knight thee

8
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:57,274
Sir William Wallace.

9
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:03,489
Sir William, in the name of God

10
00:05:03,582 --> 00:05:06,951
we appoint thee guardian
and high protector of Scotland

11
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:09,796
and thy captains as aides-de-camp.

12
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,665
Stand and be recognised.

13
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:26,603
Does anyone know his politics?

14
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,474
No, but his weight with the commoners
could upset everything.

15
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:33,404
The Balliols will kiss his arse,
and so we must.

16
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,323
Sir William.

17
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:53,130
Inasmuch as you and your captains
hail from a region

18
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:56,302
long known to support the Balliol clan,

19
00:05:56,388 --> 00:06:01,465
may we invite you to continue your support
and uphold our rightful claim?

20
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:05,518
Damn the Balliol clan.
They're all Longshanks's men.

21
00:06:07,024 --> 00:06:09,064
Gentlemen.

22
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:12,441
- Gentlemen.
- It's time to declare a king.

23
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,742
Halt. Wait. Are you prepared
to recognise our legitimate succession?

24
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:20,575
- You won't support the claim.
- Those were lies, written by you.

25
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:22,870
Oh, no.

26
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:28,545
- I demand recognition of these documents.
- These were lies when you wrote them.

27
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:31,422
Please, gentlemen.

28
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:36,388
Quiet. Sir William. Where are you going?

29
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,593
We have beaten the English.

30
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:44,809
But they'll come back
because you won't stand together.

31
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:49,233
- What will you do?
- I will invade England

32
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,403
and defeat the English on their own ground.

33
00:06:54,574 --> 00:06:56,650
Invade? That's impossible.

34
00:06:56,743 --> 00:06:59,413
Why? Why is that impossible?

35
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:05,159
You're so concerned with squabbling
for the scraps from Longshanks's table

36
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:09,250
that you've missed
your God-given right to something better.

37
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,416
There's a difference between us.

38
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:16,345
You think the people of Scotland exist
to provide you with position.

39
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:20,808
I think your position exists
to provide those people with freedom.

40
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:24,225
And I go to make sure that they have it.

41
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:39,529
Wait.

42
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:47,246
I respect what you said. But remember
that these men have lands and castles.

43
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:49,248
It's much to risk.

44
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:53,089
And the common man that bleeds
in battle, does he risk less?

45
00:07:58,142 --> 00:08:03,053
No. But from top to bottom,
this country has got no sense of itself.

46
00:08:03,147 --> 00:08:06,350
Its nobles share allegiance with England.

47
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,731
- Its clans war with each other.
- Aye.

48
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,898
If you make enemies on both sides
of the border, you'll end up dead.

49
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:19,904
- We all will. It's a question of how and why.
- I'm not a coward. I want what you want.

50
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:21,790
But we need the nobles.

51
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,283
- We need 'em?
- Aye.

52
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:28,122
What does that mean, to be noble?

53
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:33,257
Your title gives you claim to Scotland's
throne, but men don't follow titles.

54
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,256
They follow courage.

55
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,599
Our people know you.
Noble and common, they respect you.

56
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,351
And if you would just lead them to freedom...

57
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,935
they'd follow you.

58
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,647
And so would I.

59
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,596
Damn it. My sodomite cousin the Prince
tells me he has no troops to lend.

60
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:20,804
Every town in northern England
is begging for help.

61
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:23,432
He advances.

62
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:25,682
- To which town?
- To here, my Lord.

63
00:09:26,944 --> 00:09:31,487
Bring the provisions inside,
double the guards, seal the gate. Now.

64
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:33,816
Quickly. Bring in the provisions.

65
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:06,861
Sir, we can get you out if you leave now.

66
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:10,444
I will not tell my uncle I've lost him
the greatest city in the North.

67
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:53,236
Come on.

68
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:29,981
Make way for the King.

69
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,202
It's not your fault.

70
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:45,207
- Stand up to him.
- I will stand up to him and more.

71
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:25,836
What news of the North?

72
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:30,633
Nothing new, Your Majesty.
We've sent riders to speed any word.

73
00:12:31,556 --> 00:12:36,183
I heard the word in France where I was
fighting to expand your future kingdom.

74
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:42,312
The word, my son, is that
our entire northern army is annihilated.

75
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:46,353
And you have done nothing.

76
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:50,527
I... have ordered conscription, sir,
assembled and ready to depart.

77
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:56,946
Excuse me, sire, but there's
a very urgent message from York.

78
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,117
Come.

79
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:08,878
- Leave us.
- Thank you, sire.

80
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:15,101
- Wallace has sacked York.
- What?

81
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:17,262
Wallace has sacked York.

82
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:35,622
Sire... thy own nephew.

83
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:39,793
What beast could do such a thing.

84
00:13:40,963 --> 00:13:43,039
If he can sack York

85
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,882
he can invade Lower England.

86
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,714
We will stop him.

87
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:56,263
Who is this person who speaks to me
as though I needed his advice?

88
00:13:58,481 --> 00:14:02,230
- I have declared Phillip my High Counsellor.
- Is he qualified?

89
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,612
I am skilled in the arts of war
and military tactics, sire.

90
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:09,984
Are you?

91
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:11,609
Tell me...

92
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:16,947
What advice would you offer
on the present... situation?

93
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:50,193
I shall offer a truce

94
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:53,864
and buy him off.

95
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,285
But who will go to him? Not I.

96
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:02,756
If I fell under the sword of that murderer

97
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:05,925
it might be my head in a basket.

98
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,386
And not... my gentle son.

99
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:15,267
The mere sight of him would only encourage
an enemy to take over the whole country.

100
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:20,726
So whom do I send?

101
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:26,397
Whom do I send?

102
00:16:50,332 --> 00:16:52,408
I'm dreaming.

103
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:54,577
Yes, you are.

104
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,872
And you must wake.

105
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,467
I don't want to wake.

106
00:17:09,644 --> 00:17:11,720
I want to stay here with you.

107
00:17:13,273 --> 00:17:15,349
And I with you.

108
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,185
But you must wake now.

109
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:23,357
Wake up, William.

110
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:25,735
Wake up.

111
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:29,160
William, wake up...

112
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:32,791
William. A royal entourage comes

113
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:34,953
flying banners of truce

114
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:37,715
and the standards of Longshanks himself.

115
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:22,920
I am the Princess of Wales.

116
00:18:23,013 --> 00:18:26,513
I come as the King's servant
and with his authority.

117
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:29,761
To do what?

118
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:32,304
To discuss the King's proposals.

119
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,226
Will you speak with a woman?

120
00:18:57,007 --> 00:18:59,712
I hear you have been given the rank of knight.

121
00:18:59,802 --> 00:19:01,878
I have been given nothing.

122
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:04,798
God makes men what they are.

123
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,841
God made you the sacker of peaceful cities?

124
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:12,562
The executioner of the King's nephew,
my husband's own cousin?

125
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:16,898
York was the staging point
for every invasion of my country.

126
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:23,197
That cousin hanged innocent Scots, even
women and children, from the city walls.

127
00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:29,788
Longshanks did far worse
the last time he took a Scottish city.

128
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,982
You ask your King... to his face. Ask him.

129
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,691
See if his eyes can convince you of the truth.

130
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,366
Hamilton... Leave us.

131
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:14,123
- My Lady?
- Leave us. Now.

132
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:27,844
Let us talk plainly.

133
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:30,144
You invade England.

134
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:34,774
But you cannot complete the conquest
so far from your shelter and supply.

135
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:38,188
The King desires peace.

136
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,071
- Longshanks desires peace?
- He declares it to me, I swear it.

137
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:45,700
He proposes that you withdraw your attack.

138
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:49,324
In return he grants you title,
estates and this chest of gold

139
00:20:49,418 --> 00:20:51,458
which I am to pay to you personally.

140
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,008
A lordship and titles, gold...
that I should become Judas.

141
00:20:57,802 --> 00:21:01,088
- Peace is made in such ways.
- Slaves are made in such ways.

142
00:21:04,392 --> 00:21:07,726
The last time Longshanks spoke of peace,
I was a boy.

143
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:10,600
Many Scottish nobles
who would not be slaves,

144
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:14,024
were lured by him,
under a flag of truce, to a barn...

145
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:16,854
where he had them hanged.

146
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:22,525
I was very young, but I remember
Longshanks's notion of peace.

147
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:28,996
I understand you have suffered.

148
00:21:30,503 --> 00:21:33,421
I know... about your woman.

149
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:46,594
She was my wife.

150
00:21:48,939 --> 00:21:54,182
We married in secret because I would
not share her with an English lord.

151
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:57,946
They killed her... to get to me.

152
00:22:02,871 --> 00:22:04,947
I've never spoken of it.

153
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,412
I don't know why I tell you now, except...

154
00:22:12,756 --> 00:22:14,832
I see her strength in you.

155
00:22:20,765 --> 00:22:22,841
One day, you'll be a queen.

156
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:27,804
And you must open your eyes.

157
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,897
You tell your King

158
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:42,325
that William Wallace will not be ruled
and nor will any Scot while I live.

159
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:21,079
Ah. My son's loyal wife returns
unkilled by the heathen.

160
00:23:21,162 --> 00:23:24,531
- So he accepted our bribe?
- No. He did not.

161
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:28,243
Then why does he stay?

162
00:23:28,336 --> 00:23:31,207
My scouts tell me that he has not advanced.

163
00:23:31,298 --> 00:23:33,374
He waits for you at York.

164
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:38,544
He says he will attack no more towns
if you are man enough to come and face him.

165
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:41,304
Did he?

166
00:23:41,392 --> 00:23:45,472
The Welsh bowmen will not be detected

167
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:50,106
arriving so far around his flank.

168
00:23:50,902 --> 00:23:53,856
The main force of our armies
from France land here

169
00:23:53,947 --> 00:23:56,105
to the north of Edinburgh.

170
00:23:56,199 --> 00:24:00,493
Conscripts from Ireland
will approach from the southwest...

171
00:24:01,163 --> 00:24:02,194
to here.

172
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:05,824
Welsh bowmen, troops from France,
Irish conscripts.

173
00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:08,670
But they'd take weeks to assemble.

174
00:24:09,588 --> 00:24:13,123
I dispatched them... before I sent your wife.

175
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:21,934
So our little ruse succeeded. Thank you.

176
00:24:22,018 --> 00:24:26,265
And while this upstart
awaits my arrival in York,

177
00:24:26,356 --> 00:24:30,306
my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh, behind him.

178
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:34,357
You spoke with this...

179
00:24:35,282 --> 00:24:38,069
Wallace in private?

180
00:24:38,953 --> 00:24:40,613
Tell me...

181
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,324
What kind of man is he?

182
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:47,661
A mindless barbarian.

183
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:50,497
Not a king like you, my Lord.

184
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:55,465
You may return to your embroidery.

185
00:24:56,137 --> 00:24:58,214
Humbly, my Lord.

186
00:24:58,306 --> 00:25:00,383
You brought back the money?

187
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:08,975
No. I gave it to ease the suffering
of the children of this war.

188
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:13,901
That's what happens
when you send a woman.

189
00:25:16,075 --> 00:25:17,819
Forgive me, sire.

190
00:25:17,911 --> 00:25:23,249
I thought that generosity might demonstrate
your greatness to those you mean to rule.

191
00:25:26,837 --> 00:25:28,960
My greatness

192
00:25:29,047 --> 00:25:32,713
will be better demonstrated
when Wallace returns to Scotland

193
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:35,292
and finds his country in ashes.

194
00:25:40,685 --> 00:25:42,095
William.

195
00:25:42,186 --> 00:25:44,393
There's riders approaching.

196
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,853
A personal escort of the Princess.

197
00:25:54,407 --> 00:25:56,484
Aye.

198
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:58,908
Must have made an impression.

199
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,914
- Aye.
- I didn't think you were in the tent that long.

200
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:42,121
It's true. The English ships
are coming from the South.

201
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:45,494
I don't know about the Welsh yet,
but the Irish have landed.

202
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:50,747
- I had to see it myself to believe it.
- Why are the Irish fighting with the English?

203
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:54,342
I wouldn't worry about them.
Didn't I tell you before?

204
00:26:55,055 --> 00:26:56,763
It's my island.

205
00:26:56,849 --> 00:27:01,096
Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh
and assemble the council. Order it.

206
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,725
Right. Come on.

207
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,942
- Your island?
- My island. Yup.

208
00:27:11,072 --> 00:27:13,741
- We'll have to negotiate.
- Please, gentlemen.

209
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:16,197
Lords, Craig is right.

210
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:22,075
This time our only option is to negotiate.
Unless you want to see Edinburgh razed...

211
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:32,547
My army has marched for many days.

212
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:37,133
And we still have preparations to make,
so I'll make this plain.

213
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:43,726
We require every soldier you can summon,
your personal escorts, even yourselves.

214
00:27:44,774 --> 00:27:46,850
And we need them now.

215
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,109
With such a force arrayed against us,
it's time to discuss other options.

216
00:27:51,198 --> 00:27:53,274
Other options?

217
00:27:54,117 --> 00:27:57,617
Don't you wish at least
to lead your men onto the field

218
00:27:57,705 --> 00:28:00,540
and barter a better deal with Longshanks

219
00:28:00,624 --> 00:28:03,080
- before you run?
- Sir William...

220
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:05,043
- We cannot defeat them.
- We can.

221
00:28:05,171 --> 00:28:07,543
- Sir William.
- And we will.

222
00:28:09,884 --> 00:28:12,838
We won at Stirling, and still you quibble.

223
00:28:14,848 --> 00:28:17,600
We won at York
and you would not support us.

224
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:20,934
If you'll no stand up with us now,
I'd say you're cowards.

225
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:29,356
If you are Scotsmen,

226
00:28:29,447 --> 00:28:31,404
I'm ashamed to call myself one.

227
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:34,946
Please, Sir William, speak with me alone.

228
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,325
I beg you.

229
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:45,460
You've achieved so much,
but fighting these odds,

230
00:28:45,547 --> 00:28:48,382
it looks like rage, not courage.

231
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:50,543
It's well beyond rage.

232
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:54,963
Help me.

233
00:28:55,057 --> 00:28:59,269
In the name of Christ, help yourselves.

234
00:28:59,353 --> 00:29:01,429
Now is our chance. Now.

235
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:03,645
If we join, we can win. If we win,

236
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:06,568
we'll have what none of us
have ever had before.

237
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,355
A country of our own.

238
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:16,494
You're the rightful leader
and there is strength in you, I see it.

239
00:29:21,543 --> 00:29:23,785
Unite us.

240
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,713
Unite us. Unite the clans.

241
00:29:35,892 --> 00:29:38,928
- All right.
- Right.

242
00:29:44,234 --> 00:29:46,523
This cannot be the way.

243
00:29:46,611 --> 00:29:51,404
You said yourself
the nobles will not support Wallace.

244
00:29:52,785 --> 00:29:57,032
So how does it help us
to join the side that is slaughtered?

245
00:29:57,873 --> 00:29:59,950
I gave him my word.

246
00:30:08,176 --> 00:30:12,174
I know it is hard. Being a leader is.

247
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:15,925
My son...

248
00:30:16,518 --> 00:30:17,799
Son...

249
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,596
Look at me.

250
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:29,193
I cannot be King.

251
00:30:29,282 --> 00:30:31,855
You and you alone can rule Scotland.

252
00:30:33,077 --> 00:30:34,904
What I tell you, you must do.

253
00:30:35,622 --> 00:30:37,698
Not for me, not for yourself,

254
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:40,534
but for your country.

255
00:30:56,686 --> 00:30:58,975
Right, lads, make way. Coming through.

256
00:31:06,112 --> 00:31:08,188
Make way, lads.

257
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:17,368
- The Bruce is not coming, William.
- He'll come.

258
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:21,701
Mornay and Lochlan have come.

259
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,248
So will the Bruce.

260
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:32,006
Quite a lovely... gathering.

261
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,425
Wouldn't you agree?

262
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,351
- The archers are ready, sire.
- Not the archers.

263
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:45,142
My scouts say their archers
are miles away and no threat.

264
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:49,983
Arrows cost money.
Use up the Irish. The dead cost nothing.

265
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,531
And send in the infantry and cavalry.

266
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,823
Infantry.

267
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:57,991
Cavalry.

268
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:02,955
Advance.

269
00:33:27,345 --> 00:33:31,473
Ah, good to see ye this morning.

270
00:33:34,102 --> 00:33:35,300
Irish!

271
00:33:36,021 --> 00:33:38,263
Glad to have ye with us. Watch this.

272
00:35:49,662 --> 00:35:51,738
Mornay? Lochlan?

273
00:35:51,831 --> 00:35:54,749
I gave Mornay
double his lands in Scotland

274
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:56,874
and matching estates in England.

275
00:35:56,962 --> 00:36:00,378
Lochlan turned... for much less.

276
00:36:01,341 --> 00:36:02,539
Archers.

277
00:36:02,634 --> 00:36:05,635
I beg your pardon, sire?
Won't we hit our own troops?

278
00:36:08,098 --> 00:36:09,723
Yes.

279
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:13,427
But we'll hit theirs as well. We have reserves.

280
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,766
Attack.

281
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:18,556
Archers.

282
00:36:56,525 --> 00:36:59,230
Send in our reinforcements.

283
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:02,024
Send in the rest.

284
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:15,374
Bring me Wallace. Alive, if possible.

285
00:37:15,461 --> 00:37:17,538
Dead... just as good.

286
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,672
Send us news of our victory. Shall we retire?

287
00:38:47,684 --> 00:38:49,760
Protect the King.

288
00:40:53,192 --> 00:40:56,109
Get up.

289
00:40:58,072 --> 00:41:00,444
Get up.

290
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:03,283
- Get him out of here.
- Jesus.

291
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,707
Go.

292
00:42:10,357 --> 00:42:12,433
I'm dying.

293
00:42:15,571 --> 00:42:17,647
Let me be.

294
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,530
No.

295
00:42:25,206 --> 00:42:27,282
You're going to live.

296
00:42:29,002 --> 00:42:31,493
I've lived long enough to live free.

297
00:42:32,672 --> 00:42:34,499
Proud...

298
00:42:34,591 --> 00:42:37,164
to see you become the man you are.

299
00:42:42,015 --> 00:42:44,091
I'm a happy man.

300
00:44:33,717 --> 00:44:35,875
I'm the one who's rotting.

301
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:39,837
But I think your face looks graver than mine.

302
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,051
Son...

303
00:44:52,195 --> 00:44:56,109
We must have alliance
with England to prevail here.

304
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:58,275
You achieved that.

305
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:02,617
You saved your family
and increased your land.

306
00:45:02,706 --> 00:45:07,748
In time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.

307
00:45:07,836 --> 00:45:09,794
Lands.

308
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,205
Titles. Men.

309
00:45:12,299 --> 00:45:14,007
Power. Nothing.

310
00:45:14,093 --> 00:45:17,011
- Nothing?
- I have nothing.

311
00:45:18,347 --> 00:45:23,093
Men fight for me because if they do not
I throw them off my land

312
00:45:23,186 --> 00:45:26,306
and I starve their wives and their children.

313
00:45:26,398 --> 00:45:28,474
Those men

314
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:31,568
who bled the ground red at Falkirk...

315
00:45:33,196 --> 00:45:38,238
They fought for William Wallace, and he
fights for something that I've never had.

316
00:45:40,996 --> 00:45:43,832
And I took it from him when I betrayed him

317
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:46,787
and I saw it in his face on the battlefield.

318
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:49,120
And it's tearing me apart.

319
00:45:49,797 --> 00:45:53,048
Well, all men betray. All lose heart.

320
00:45:53,134 --> 00:45:55,886
I don't want to lose heart.

321
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:01,801
I want to believe...

322
00:46:02,185 --> 00:46:04,262
as he does.

323
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,154
I will never be on the wrong side again.

324
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,992
No.

325
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:04,435
Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?

326
00:48:04,523 --> 00:48:09,518
Aye. Wallace rode into his bedchamber
and killed him.

327
00:48:09,612 --> 00:48:12,530
More of a liability now than ever he was.

328
00:48:13,366 --> 00:48:15,939
And there's no telling who'll be next.

329
00:48:18,204 --> 00:48:20,280
Maybe you.

330
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,951
Maybe me.

331
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:31,042
It doesn't matter.

332
00:48:32,678 --> 00:48:35,086
- I'm serious, Robert.
- So am I.

333
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,193
Christ. Shit.

334
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:53,315
Search the place.

335
00:48:55,911 --> 00:48:58,236
Lochlan.

336
00:49:04,045 --> 00:49:06,333
William Wallace killed 50 men.

337
00:49:07,298 --> 00:49:09,374
50 if it was one.

338
00:49:09,467 --> 00:49:14,010
100 men... with his own sword.
Cut through them like...

339
00:49:14,097 --> 00:49:17,383
Moses through the Red Sea.

340
00:49:49,968 --> 00:49:52,044
His legend grows.

341
00:49:52,137 --> 00:49:54,260
It will be worse than before.

342
00:49:54,348 --> 00:49:59,853
He rallies new volunteers in every Scottish
town. When he replenishes his numbers...

343
00:49:59,937 --> 00:50:02,393
They're sheep. Mere sheep.

344
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:07,606
Easily dispersed if we strike the shepherd.

345
00:50:07,695 --> 00:50:09,403
Very well.

346
00:50:10,949 --> 00:50:15,243
Pick a flock of your finest assassins
and set a meeting.

347
00:50:15,328 --> 00:50:19,243
My Lord, Wallace is renowned
for his ability to smell an ambush.

348
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:26,456
If what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct

349
00:50:27,132 --> 00:50:30,833
he warmed to our future Queen
and would trust her.

350
00:50:32,388 --> 00:50:36,053
So we'll dispatch her
with the notion that she comes in peace.

351
00:50:36,142 --> 00:50:38,929
My Lord,
the Princess might be taken hostage

352
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,096
or her life be put in jeopardy.

353
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:44,973
My son would be most distressed by that.

354
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,692
But in truth if she were to be killed,

355
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:54,985
we would soon find the King of France
a useful ally against the Scots.

356
00:50:56,622 --> 00:50:58,698
You see...

357
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:03,868
As King, you must find
the good in any situation.

358
00:51:30,825 --> 00:51:32,948
It's William Wallace, sure.

359
00:51:33,745 --> 00:51:37,789
And he's given up his sword. Be ready.

360
00:53:17,646 --> 00:53:19,722
My Lady.

361
00:53:22,526 --> 00:53:24,519
I received your message.

362
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:41,830
This is... the second time
you've warned me of danger.

363
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:45,543
Why?

364
00:53:45,634 --> 00:53:49,549
There will be a new shipment
of supplies coming north next month.

365
00:53:49,638 --> 00:53:51,631
Foods and weapons. They will...

366
00:53:51,724 --> 00:53:53,800
No, stop.

367
00:53:55,269 --> 00:53:57,345
Why do you help me?

368
00:54:03,695 --> 00:54:05,771
Why do you help me?

369
00:54:06,615 --> 00:54:09,320
Because of the way
you are looking at me now.

370
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,442
Just when we thought all hope was lost,

371
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:07,201
our noble saviours have arrived.

372
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:12,655
Off with their hoods.

373
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:19,713
Sir William, we come to seek a meeting.

374
00:56:19,797 --> 00:56:21,873
Well, what's the point?

375
00:56:23,051 --> 00:56:27,464
- You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.
- An oath to a liar is no oath at all.

376
00:56:27,555 --> 00:56:30,307
Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.

377
00:56:30,392 --> 00:56:32,468
So let the council swear publicly.

378
00:56:33,145 --> 00:56:36,596
We cannot.
Some scarcely believe you're alive.

379
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:40,902
Others think you'll pay them Mornay's wages.
So we bid you to Edinburgh.

380
00:56:40,986 --> 00:56:45,280
Meet us two days from now. Pledge us
your pardon and we'll unite behind you.

381
00:56:45,366 --> 00:56:47,442
- Scotland will be one.
- One?

382
00:56:47,535 --> 00:56:49,991
- You mean us and you.
- No.

383
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:54,078
I mean this.

384
00:56:55,877 --> 00:56:58,285
It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.

385
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,929
You do know it's a trap. Tell him.

386
00:57:10,017 --> 00:57:13,469
If the Bruce wanted to kill you,
he'd have done it at Falkirk.

387
00:57:13,562 --> 00:57:14,725
Aye.

388
00:57:14,814 --> 00:57:16,391
I know. I saw.

389
00:57:16,482 --> 00:57:19,982
All right, leaving him aside,
what about the others?

390
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:25,574
Scheming bastards who couldnae agree on
the colour of shite. It's a trap. Are you blind?

391
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:27,735
Look at us.

392
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:31,158
We've got to try. We can't do this alone.

393
00:57:32,791 --> 00:57:37,121
Joining the nobles is our only hope.
You know what happens if we don't?

394
00:57:37,212 --> 00:57:38,837
What?

395
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:40,583
Nothing.

396
00:57:41,968 --> 00:57:45,503
- I don't want to be a martyr.
- Nor I.

397
00:57:45,596 --> 00:57:47,673
I want to live.

398
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:50,470
I want a home, and children. And peace.

399
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,636
- Do ye?
- Aye, I do.

400
00:57:52,729 --> 00:57:57,272
I've asked God for those things.
It's all for nothing if you don't have freedom.

401
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:00,313
- It's just a dream, William.
- A dream? Just a...

402
00:58:01,363 --> 00:58:05,028
Well, then,
what have we been doing all this time?

403
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,820
We've lived that dream.

404
00:58:07,912 --> 00:58:11,079
Your dream isn't about freedom.
It's about Murron.

405
00:58:11,165 --> 00:58:14,499
You're doing this to be a hero
because you think she sees ye.

406
00:58:14,585 --> 00:58:16,874
I don't think she sees me. I know she does.

407
00:58:17,922 --> 00:58:20,923
And your father sees you, too.

408
00:58:30,686 --> 00:58:32,263
Jesus.

409
00:58:39,695 --> 00:58:41,771
Shall I come with you?

410
00:58:42,865 --> 00:58:45,701
No. I'll go alone.

411
00:58:47,453 --> 00:58:50,371
- I'll see you after.
- Right.

412
00:58:55,379 --> 00:58:57,537
Sooner rather than later, I hope.

413
00:59:04,013 --> 00:59:06,089
- He won't come.
- He will.

414
00:59:07,558 --> 00:59:09,634
I know he will.

415
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,276
My Lord. He approaches.

416
01:00:09,332 --> 01:00:11,408
No!

417
01:00:16,089 --> 01:00:18,165
Stay out of it, Robert.

418
01:00:19,718 --> 01:00:21,378
Get away.

419
01:00:25,057 --> 01:00:28,390
The Bruce is not to be harmed,
that's the arrangement.

420
01:00:36,152 --> 01:00:37,694
Father!

421
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,495
You rotting bastard!

422
01:00:47,163 --> 01:00:48,788
Why?

423
01:00:53,795 --> 01:00:55,872
Longshanks required Wallace.

424
01:00:57,091 --> 01:00:59,167
So did our nobles.

425
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:02,510
That was the price of your crown.

426
01:01:02,596 --> 01:01:03,877
Die.

427
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:07,426
I want you to die.

428
01:01:07,518 --> 01:01:09,807
Soon enough I'll be dead.

429
01:01:09,896 --> 01:01:13,894
- And you'll be King.
- I don't want anything from you.

430
01:01:14,526 --> 01:01:16,602
You're not a man.

431
01:01:17,362 --> 01:01:19,438
And you're not my father.

432
01:01:23,076 --> 01:01:25,153
You're my son

433
01:01:25,245 --> 01:01:27,653
and you have always known my mind.

434
01:01:30,042 --> 01:01:33,209
- You deceived me.
- You let yourself be deceived.

435
01:01:34,005 --> 01:01:37,504
In your heart, you always knew
what had to happen here.

436
01:01:41,054 --> 01:01:44,221
At last, you know what it means to hate.

437
01:01:49,104 --> 01:01:51,512
Now you're ready to be a king.

438
01:01:53,233 --> 01:01:55,107
My hate...

439
01:01:55,194 --> 01:01:57,352
will die with you.

440
01:02:02,869 --> 01:02:06,819
William Wallace,
you stand in taint of high treason.

441
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:11,328
- Against whom?
- Against your King.

442
01:02:12,629 --> 01:02:14,705
Have you anything to say?

443
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:17,667
Never in my whole life

444
01:02:19,177 --> 01:02:21,384
did I swear allegiance to him.

445
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:25,891
It matters not. He is your King.

446
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:31,348
Confess and you may receive a quick death.

447
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:35,109
Deny and you must be purified by pain.

448
01:02:35,194 --> 01:02:37,271
Do you confess?

449
01:02:38,948 --> 01:02:42,115
Do you confess?

450
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:51,374
Then on the morrow
you shall receive your purification.

451
01:03:03,099 --> 01:03:05,590
- Your Highness.
- I will see the prisoner.

452
01:03:05,685 --> 01:03:09,553
- The King ordered...
- The King will die soon and his son is weak.

453
01:03:09,648 --> 01:03:12,020
Who do you think will rule this kingdom?

454
01:03:12,109 --> 01:03:14,185
Now open this door.

455
01:03:15,946 --> 01:03:18,022
Your Majesty.

456
01:03:23,621 --> 01:03:25,660
Come on, filth. Up on your feet.

457
01:03:25,748 --> 01:03:28,666
Stop it. Leave me.

458
01:03:30,378 --> 01:03:32,454
I said leave me.

459
01:03:45,269 --> 01:03:47,308
My Lady.

460
01:03:47,396 --> 01:03:49,472
Sir...

461
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:52,267
I come to beg you...

462
01:03:53,694 --> 01:03:58,570
to confess all and swear allegiance
to the King that he might show you mercy.

463
01:03:59,617 --> 01:04:01,942
Will he show mercy to my country?

464
01:04:02,829 --> 01:04:04,905
Mercy is to die quickly,

465
01:04:04,998 --> 01:04:07,074
perhaps even live in the Tower.

466
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,740
In time, who knows what can happen?

467
01:04:11,421 --> 01:04:13,497
If you can only live...

468
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:20,046
If I swear to him...

469
01:04:20,681 --> 01:04:23,884
then all that I am is dead already.

470
01:04:33,278 --> 01:04:35,436
You will die. It will be awful.

471
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:37,606
Every man dies.

472
01:04:40,535 --> 01:04:42,612
Not every man really lives.

473
01:04:49,253 --> 01:04:51,329
Drink this.

474
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:53,915
It will dull your pain.

475
01:04:54,008 --> 01:04:56,380
No. It will numb my wits.

476
01:04:56,469 --> 01:04:58,545
And I must have them all.

477
01:04:59,305 --> 01:05:01,879
For if I'm senseless or if I wail

478
01:05:01,975 --> 01:05:04,264
then Longshanks will have broken me.

479
01:05:04,936 --> 01:05:07,558
I can't bear the thought of your torture.

480
01:05:08,398 --> 01:05:10,474
Take it.

481
01:05:14,905 --> 01:05:16,565
All right.

482
01:06:03,415 --> 01:06:05,491
I have come

483
01:06:05,584 --> 01:06:07,956
to beg for the life of William Wallace.

484
01:06:10,297 --> 01:06:13,215
You're quite taken with him, aren't you?

485
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,423
I respect him.

486
01:06:16,554 --> 01:06:18,760
At worst, he was a worthy enemy.

487
01:06:18,848 --> 01:06:23,012
Show mercy, O thou great King,
and win the respect of your own people.

488
01:06:32,821 --> 01:06:34,897
Even now

489
01:06:35,657 --> 01:06:38,148
you are incapable of mercy.

490
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,618
And you...

491
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:53,167
To you, that word is as unfamiliar as love.

492
01:06:54,219 --> 01:06:56,710
Before he lost his powers of speech

493
01:06:56,805 --> 01:07:00,933
he told me his one comfort was that
he would live to know Wallace was dead.

494
01:07:20,038 --> 01:07:22,114
You see?

495
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:25,367
Death comes to us all.

496
01:07:35,429 --> 01:07:37,505
But before it comes to you,

497
01:07:38,515 --> 01:07:40,592
know this:

498
01:07:40,809 --> 01:07:42,886
Your blood dies with you.

499
01:07:45,565 --> 01:07:49,016
A child who is not of your line
grows in my belly.

500
01:07:51,946 --> 01:07:55,778
Your son will not sit long on the throne,
I swear it.

501
01:08:34,032 --> 01:08:36,109
I'm so afraid.

502
01:08:43,376 --> 01:08:45,452
Give me the strength...

503
01:08:46,379 --> 01:08:48,455
to die well.

504
01:09:11,989 --> 01:09:13,816
Here he comes.

505
01:10:42,585 --> 01:10:44,957
Now behold the awful price of treason.

506
01:10:51,887 --> 01:10:53,963
Or fall to your knees now,

507
01:10:56,391 --> 01:10:59,179
declare yourself the King's loyal subject

508
01:11:00,437 --> 01:11:02,264
and beg his mercy

509
01:11:09,238 --> 01:11:11,315
and you shall have it.

510
01:11:22,669 --> 01:11:24,211
Rope.

511
01:11:36,809 --> 01:11:38,885
Raise him.

512
01:11:45,986 --> 01:11:48,274
Stretch him.

513
01:11:49,865 --> 01:11:51,857
That's it.

514
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:54,026
Stretch him.

515
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:32,406
Pleasant, yes?

516
01:12:35,621 --> 01:12:37,531
Rise to your knees.

517
01:12:37,624 --> 01:12:40,494
Kiss the royal emblem on my cloak

518
01:12:40,585 --> 01:12:42,293
and you will feel no more.

519
01:13:24,089 --> 01:13:26,047
Rack him.

520
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:21,850
Enough?

521
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:16,616
It can all end...

522
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:19,164
right now.

523
01:15:19,253 --> 01:15:20,913
Peace.

524
01:15:21,714 --> 01:15:23,292
Bliss.

525
01:15:23,925 --> 01:15:25,205
Just say it.

526
01:15:26,344 --> 01:15:28,420
Cry out...

527
01:15:28,513 --> 01:15:30,173
"Mercy."

528
01:15:39,107 --> 01:15:40,566
Mercy.

529
01:15:40,651 --> 01:15:42,727
Mercy.

530
01:15:48,659 --> 01:15:49,738
Cry out.

531
01:15:56,501 --> 01:16:00,451
Just say it. "Mercy."

532
01:16:23,571 --> 01:16:28,032
- Mercy, William. Mercy.
- Jesus, man, say it.

533
01:16:33,748 --> 01:16:37,248
The prisoner wishes to say a word.

534
01:16:57,315 --> 01:17:00,352
Freedom!

535
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:55,178
After the beheading,

536
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:58,642
William Wallace's body was torn to pieces.

537
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:04,067
His head was set on London Bridge.

538
01:19:05,826 --> 01:19:08,282
His arms and legs

539
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:11,075
sent to the four corners of Britain

540
01:19:11,624 --> 01:19:13,700
as a warning.

541
01:19:13,793 --> 01:19:17,625
It did not have the effect
that Longshanks planned.

542
01:19:19,465 --> 01:19:22,585
And I, Robert the Bruce,

543
01:19:22,677 --> 01:19:26,841
rode out to pay homage
to the armies of the English King

544
01:19:27,891 --> 01:19:31,141
and accept his endorsement of my crown.

545
01:19:31,228 --> 01:19:33,766
I hope you've washed your arse this morning.

546
01:19:34,523 --> 01:19:36,599
It's about to be kissed by a king.

547
01:20:06,599 --> 01:20:08,675
Come. Let's get it over with.

548
01:20:21,156 --> 01:20:23,113
Stop.

549
01:20:40,426 --> 01:20:43,380
You have bled with Wallace!

550
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:51,313
Now bleed with me.

551
01:21:30,813 --> 01:21:33,482
Wallace!

552
01:21:57,716 --> 01:22:00,801
In the year of our Lord 1314,

553
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,971
patriots of Scotland,
starving and outnumbered,

554
01:22:05,641 --> 01:22:08,477
charged the fields of Bannockburn.

555
01:22:09,062 --> 01:22:11,434
They fought like warrior poets.

556
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:14,146
They fought like Scotsmen

557
01:22:15,193 --> 01:22:17,269
and won their freedom.
