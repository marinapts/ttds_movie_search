no longer own businesses.

That's why this

feel in their hands.

177

01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:37,937
Nobody knows who
stole the chicken, hmm?

1256
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:39,108
Tell him about the chicken.

1257
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:42,688
A man walks around with a chicken
and nobody notices this.

1258
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:45,365
Save yourselves.

1259
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:48,364
Tell him about the chicken.

1260
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,553
Still nobody knows.

(SOBBING)

1262
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:21,978
It was you.
You committed this crime.

1263
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,186
No, sir.

1264
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:24,437
But you know who, though.

1265
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:26,364
Yes.
Who?

1266
01:31:28,066 --> 01:31:30,034
Him!

1267
01:31:33,947 --> 01:31:35,790
He's very gifted.

1268
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:37,750
Yeah, sure.
Bring him over.

1269
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:44,167
Sir. Thank you.

1270
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:51,507
Thank you again, <i>Herr Direktor</i>.

1271
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:53,008
You're welcome again.

1272
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:55,594
It's an honor to work
for such a great company.

1273
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:56,678
It's great to have you.

1274
01:31:56,761 --> 01:31:59,765
I promise to learn everything there is
to know about enamelware production.

1275
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:01,065
That's great.

1276
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:17,416
Hello? Miss Elsa Krause is here.
I only need five minutes.

1277
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:19,993
She wants to speak
to the <i>Herr Direktor.</i>

1278
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:42,148
Yes.

1279
01:32:46,603 --> 01:32:48,731
He won't see you.

1280
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:21,392
Please, sit down.

1281
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,109
Pernod? Cognac?

1282
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:27,603
No. No, thank you.

1283
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:31,527
So, what can I do for you?

1284
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:39,285
They say that no one dies here.

1285
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:41,492
They say your
factory is a haven.

1286
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:46,455
They say you are good.

1287
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:50,799
Who says that?

1288
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:53,378
Everyone.

1289
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:03,062
My name is Regina Perlman,
not Elsa Krause.

1290
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:06,563
I've been living in Krakow on false
papers since the ghetto massacre.

1291
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:08,609
My parents are in Plaszow.

1292
01:34:08,685 --> 01:34:12,986
Their names are
Chana and Jakob Perlman.

1293
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:16,694
They are older people. They are
killing older people now in Plaszow.

1294
01:34:16,776 --> 01:34:20,076
They bury them up
in the forest. Look,

1295
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:23,791
I don't have any money.

1296
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:26,791
I borrowed these clothes.

1297
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:32,751
I'm begging you. Please.

1298
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:35,465
Please bring them here.

1299
01:34:35,545 --> 01:34:38,139
I don't do that.

1300
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:41,935
You've been misled.
I ask one thing.

1301
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:43,853
Whether or not the worker
has certain skills.

1302
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:45,396
That's what I ask
and that's what I care about.

1303
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:47,894
My father is an importer,
not a metalworker.

1304
01:34:47,974 --> 01:34:51,444
Such activities are illegal. You will
not entrap me! (CONTINUES ARGUING)

It's a fact of life.

01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:11,039
He wants to kill everybody?
Great!

1309
01:35:11,164 --> 01:35:12,962
What am I
supposed to do about it?

1310
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:15,794
Bring everybody over?
Is that what you think?

1311
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:18,721
Send them over to Schindler.
Send them all!

1312
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:22,676
His place is a haven, didn't you know?
It's not a factory.

1313
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:24,853
It's not an enterprise
of any kind.

1314
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:27,772
It's a haven for
rabbis and orphans

1315
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:30,976
and people with no
skills whatsoever!

You think I don't
know what you're doing?

01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:39,534
You're so quiet all the time.
I know, I know!

1319
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:40,781
Are you losing money?

1320
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:42,074
That's not the point!

1321
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:44,121
So the point is?

1322
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,207
It's dangerous!
It's dangerous to me!

1323
01:35:50,536 --> 01:35:54,006
You have to understand. Goeth
is under enormous pressure.

1324
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:56,710
You have to think of
it in his situation.

1325
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:00,346
He's got this
whole place to run.

1326
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:03,265
He's responsible for everything
here, all these people.

1327
01:36:03,341 --> 01:36:05,435
He's got a lot of
things to worry about.

1328
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:10,686
And he's got the war which
brings out the worst in people.

1329
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:14,645
Never the good, always the bad.
Always the bad.

1330
01:36:16,354 --> 01:36:21,281
But in normal circumstances he wouldn't
be like this. He'd be all right.

1331
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:24,408
There'd just be the good

He can't enjoy it.

somebody escaped

1338

Go on, take it.

I get extra food here.

Why not build yourself up?

1370

because I threw out
the bones from dinner.

For his dogs, you understand.

I don't know how I say this.

I never could say it now,

"Why are you beating me?"

I beat you now

is because you
ask why I beat you."

We were on the roof on Monday,

come out of the from door

1389
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:23,253
and down the steps by the
patio, right there below us,

1390
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:28,083
and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he

1391
01:41:28,165 --> 01:41:31,009
shot a woman who
was passing by.

1392
01:41:32,378 --> 01:41:35,632
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.

Just a woman on her way
somewhere, you know?

1394
01:41:39,468 --> 01:41:43,098
She was no fatter or thinner

1395
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,774
or slower or faster
than anyone else,

1396
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:50,026
and I couldn't
guess what had she done.

1397
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:57,699
The more you see of
the <i>Herr Kommandant,</i>

1398
01:41:57,778 --> 01:42:03,376
the more you see there is no set
rules that you can live by.

1399
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:08,173
You can't say to yourself, "If I
follow these rules, I will be safe."

1400
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:15,839
He won't shoot you because
he enjoys you too much.

1401
01:42:16,464 --> 01:42:20,469
He enjoys you so much he won't
even let you wear the star.

1402
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:22,144
He doesn't want
anyone else to know

1403
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:24,938
it's a Jew he's enjoying.

1404
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:31,187
He shot the woman
from the steps

1405
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:34,991
because she meant
nothing to him.

1406

or pleasing him.

1443
01:45:13,516 --> 01:45:16,986
And the emperor pardons him.

This worthless man.
He lets him go.

1876
02:19:46,336 --> 02:19:47,428
It's good business.

1877
02:19:47,504 --> 02:19:49,552
It's good business
in your opinion.

1878
02:19:49,631 --> 02:19:52,726
Look, you've got to move
them, the equipment,

1879
02:19:52,801 --> 02:19:54,223
everything to Czechoslovakia.

1880
02:19:54,303 --> 02:19:57,603
Pay for all that and build another camp.
Doesn't make any sense.

1881
02:19:57,681 --> 02:19:59,308
Look, Amon...
It's good for me.

1882
02:19:59,474 --> 02:20:01,067
You're not
telling me something.

1883
02:20:01,143 --> 02:20:03,111
I know them. I'm familiar with them.
I don't have to train them.

1884
02:20:03,186 --> 02:20:04,426
You're not
telling me something.

1885
02:20:04,521 --> 02:20:05,738
It's good for you.
I'll compensate you.

1886
02:20:05,814 --> 02:20:07,566
That's right.
It's good for the army.

1887
02:20:07,649 --> 02:20:08,946
Yeah, of course.

1888
02:20:08,984 --> 02:20:11,157
You know what I'm going to make?
What?

1889
02:20:11,486 --> 02:20:13,329
Artillery shells. Everyone's
making artillery shells.

1890
02:20:13,405 --> 02:20:15,123
Tank shells, they need that.
Tanks shells, ja.

1891
02:20:15,198 --> 02:20:18,042
Everybody's happy.
Everyone's happy, except me.

1892
02:20:18,118 --> 02:20:20,997
You're probably
scamming me somehow.

1893
02:20:21,413 --> 02:20:24,417
If I'm making 100,
you've got to be making 300.

1894
02:20:24,499 --> 02:20:27,969
And if you admit to 300, then
it's 400, actually. But how?

1895
02:20:28,045 --> 02:20:29,388
I just told you.

1896
02:20:29,504 --> 02:20:30,881
You did, but you didn't.

1897
02:20:33,842 --> 02:20:35,844
Ja, all right, don't tell me.

1898
02:20:36,094 --> 02:20:40,270
I'll go along with it. It's just
irritating I can't work it out.

1899
02:20:40,474 --> 02:20:44,195
Look, all you have to do is
tell me what it's worth to you.

1900
02:20:45,437 --> 02:20:47,940
What's a person worth to you?
No, no, no, no.

1901
02:20:48,023 --> 02:20:50,151
What's one worth to you?

1902

SCHINDLER: Thank you.

1915
02:21:42,911 --> 02:21:44,504
How many?

1916
02:21:44,621 --> 02:21:46,248
Four hundred, 450.

1917
02:21:49,418 --> 02:21:50,761
More, more.

1918
02:22:15,610 --> 02:22:18,910
Feigenbaum, Jakob.
Wolf. Wolf Wein.

1919
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:29,375
Feigenbaum, Lutek, Jakob...
Nacha. Yes? Nacha.

1920
02:22:29,458 --> 02:22:31,210
Nacha, that's right.

1921
02:22:31,626 --> 02:22:32,627
SCHINDLER: And Wolf.

1922
02:22:33,795 --> 02:22:35,047
How many?

1923
02:22:37,591 --> 02:22:40,265
600.
More.

1924
02:22:42,763 --> 02:22:44,185
SCHINDLER: You can do
the same thing I'm doing.

1925
02:22:44,306 --> 02:22:45,728
You might even
make money at it.

1926
02:22:45,807 --> 02:22:46,808
MADRITSCH: I don't know.

1927
02:22:46,892 --> 02:22:49,611
Come on, Julius, I know about the
extra food and clothes you give them.

1928
02:22:49,686 --> 02:22:51,438
Paid for out of
your own pocket.

1929
02:22:51,521 --> 02:22:53,114
If we make a combined
approach, we could

1930
02:22:53,231 --> 02:22:54,824
get more than 4,000 out,
mine and yours.

1931
02:22:54,900 --> 02:22:55,901
Oskar...

1932
02:22:55,984 --> 02:22:59,454
We could relocate them in something
like safety, in Moravia.

1933
02:23:00,197 --> 02:23:01,323
I don't know.

1934

How many cigarettes
have you smoked tonight?

1935
02:23:06,453 --> 02:23:07,500
Too many.

1936
02:23:07,579 --> 02:23:10,753
For every one... (COUGHS)
you smoke, I smoke half.

1937
02:23:12,918 --> 02:23:14,761
I've done all I can.
I will not accept that.

1938
02:23:14,836 --> 02:23:16,509
No, Oskar, I can't do any more.

1939
02:23:16,630 --> 02:23:18,257
I will not accept that.

1940
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:19,808
No.

1941
02:23:29,851 --> 02:23:31,228
How many? How many?

1942
02:23:31,353 --> 02:23:32,730
850, give or take.

1943
02:23:32,813 --> 02:23:36,192
Give or take what, Stern?
Count them. How many?

1944
02:23:47,327 --> 02:23:50,297
That's it.
You can finish that page.

1945
02:23:55,585 --> 02:23:59,306
What did Goeth say about this?

1946
02:23:59,381 --> 02:24:02,726
You just told him how many
people you needed and...

1947
02:24:06,304 --> 02:24:08,272
You're not buying them.

1948
02:24:11,351 --> 02:24:14,446
You're buying them? You're paying
him for each of these names?

1949
02:24:14,521 --> 02:24:15,943
If you were
still working for me,

1950
02:24:16,064 --> 02:24:17,486
I'd expect you to
talk me out of it.

1951
02:24:17,566 --> 02:24:19,409
It's costing me a fortune.

1952
02:24:21,778 --> 02:24:25,032
Finish the page and leave
one space at the bottom.

1953
02:24:47,345 --> 02:24:48,597
You...

1954
02:24:55,312 --> 02:24:57,781
The list is an absolute good.

1955
02:24:59,733 --> 02:25:02,156
The list is life.

1956
02:25:04,196 --> 02:25:07,746
All around its
margins lies the gulf.

1957
02:25:09,451 --> 02:25:11,453
Oskar,
there's a clerical error here

1958
02:25:11,578 --> 02:25:13,546
at the bottom of the last page.

1959
02:25:13,622 --> 02:25:16,045
No, there's one more name
I want to put there.

1960
02:25:16,124 --> 02:25:18,798
<i>I'll never find a maid as well
trained as her at Brinnlitz.</i>

1961
02:25:18,877 --> 02:25:20,379
<i>They are all country girls.</i>

1962
02:25:22,005 --> 02:25:23,097
No.

1963
02:25:32,766 --> 02:25:33,858
No.

1964
02:25:34,684 --> 02:25:35,685
One hand of 21.

1965
02:25:35,810 --> 02:25:36,857
No.

1966
02:25:36,937 --> 02:25:39,736
If you win, I pay you
7,400 reichsmarks. No.

1967
02:25:39,814 --> 02:25:42,658
Hit a natural, I make it 14,800.
No.

1968
02:25:43,735 --> 02:25:45,783
If I win,
the girl goes on my list.

1969
02:25:47,239 --> 02:25:48,639
I can't wager Helen
in a carol game.

1970
02:25:48,698 --> 02:25:50,075
Why not?

1971
02:25:50,158 --> 02:25:51,330
Wouldn't be right.

1972
02:25:51,409 --> 02:25:53,161
She's just going to Auschwitz
Number Two, anyway.

1973
02:25:53,245 --> 02:25:55,122
What difference does it make?
She's not going to Auschwitz.

1974
02:25:55,205 --> 02:25:57,503
I'd never do that to her.
No, I want her

1975
02:25:57,624 --> 02:25:59,922
to come back to Vienna with me.

1976
02:26:00,001 --> 02:26:02,971
I want her to come
to work for me there.

1977
02:26:03,171 --> 02:26:04,514
I want to grow old with her.

1978
02:26:04,631 --> 02:26:05,974
Are you mad?

1979
02:26:08,009 --> 02:26:11,104
Amon, you can't take
her to Vienna with you.

1980
02:26:11,513 --> 02:26:13,265
No, of course I can't.

1981
02:26:14,182 --> 02:26:16,059
That's what I'd like to do.

1982
02:26:16,977 --> 02:26:19,730
What I can do,
if I'm any sort of a man,

1983
02:26:19,854 --> 02:26:22,653
is the next most
merciful thing.

1984
02:26:22,732 --> 02:26:25,110
I shall take her
into the woods and

in the back of the head.

Under Department "W" provisions

2187
02:45:21,537 --> 02:45:24,461
it is unlawful to kill a

Hello.

2221
02:47:19,905 --> 02:47:21,665
What is it? We've received
an angry complaint

2222
02:47:21,740 --> 02:47:23,458
from the Armaments Board.

2223
02:47:23,534 --> 02:47:25,662
The artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings,

2224
02:47:25,744 --> 02:47:28,293
apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests.

2225
02:47:28,413 --> 02:47:30,461
That's to be expected.
Start-up problems.

2226
02:47:30,541 --> 02:47:32,714
This isn't pots and pans.
This is a precise business.

2227
02:47:32,834 --> 02:47:34,677
I'll write them a letter.
They're withholding payment.

2228
02:47:34,753 --> 02:47:36,596
Sure, so would I, so would you.

2229
02:47:36,672 --> 02:47:39,016
I wouldn't worry about it. We'll
get it right one of these days.

2230
02:47:39,091 --> 02:47:42,891
There's a rumor you've been going
around miscalibrating the machines.

2231
02:47:43,720 --> 02:47:46,644
They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.

2232
02:47:49,476 --> 02:47:51,649
I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.

2233
02:47:51,728 --> 02:47:52,729
Pass them off as ours.

2234
02:47:52,854 --> 02:47:53,935
I don't see the difference.

Whether they're made here
or somewhere else...

You don't see a difference?
I see a difference.

You'll lose a lot of money.

2238
02:47:57,859 --> 02:47:59,657
Fewer shells will be made.

2239
02:47:59,736 --> 02:48:01,534
Stern, if this factory
ever produces

2240
02:48:01,655 --> 02:48:03,498
a shell that can
actually be fired,

2241
02:48:03,574 --> 02:48:05,042

02:55:38,111 --> 02:55:39,613
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2335
02:55:58,631 --> 02:56:00,429
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2336
02:56:25,492 --> 02:56:28,211
As soon as peace occurs,
I want...

2337
02:56:29,913 --> 02:56:32,632
I want that cloth
distributed to the workers.

2338
02:56:33,666 --> 02:56:35,794
Two and a half meters each.

2339
02:56:36,419 --> 02:56:39,093
Also, each person is to
get a bottle of vodka.

2340
02:56:39,798 --> 02:56:41,971
They won't drink it.
They know its value.

2341
02:56:42,717 --> 02:56:45,846
Likewise those Egipshi
cigarettes we organized.

2342
02:56:46,346 --> 02:56:48,849
It'll be done.
Everything you ask.

2343
02:57:09,702 --> 02:57:12,672
We've written a letter,
trying to explain things

2344
02:57:14,207 --> 02:57:15,379
in case you are captured.

2345
02:57:18,461 --> 02:57:20,589
Every worker has signed it.

2346
02:57:31,724 --> 02:57:33,146
Thank you.

2347
02:58:00,795 --> 02:58:02,797
It is Hebrew, from the Talmud.

2348
02:58:02,881 --> 02:58:06,385
It says, "Whoever saves one
life, saves the world entire."

2349
02:58:14,267 --> 02:58:15,644
(RING CLATTERING)

2350
02:58:47,634 --> 02:58:49,557
I could have got more out.

2351
02:58:52,639 --> 02:58:54,812
I could have got more.
I don't know.

2352
02:58:55,141 --> 02:58:56,393
If I just...

2353
02:58:58,645 --> 02:58:59,692
I could have got more.

2354
02:58:59,771 --> 02:59:04,072
Oskar, there are 1,100 people who are
alive because of you. Look at them.

2355
02:59:05,693 --> 02:59:07,661
If I'd made more money.

2356
02:59:08,238 --> 02:59:09,455
(LAUGHS)

2357
02:59:11,991 --> 02:59:15,211
I threw away so much money.

2358
02:59:17,872 --> 02:59:20,466
(SOBBING) You have no idea.

2359
02:59:21,876 --> 02:59:23,219
If I had just...

2360
02:59:23,294 --> 02:59:26,173
There will be generations
because of what you did.

2361
02:59:28,508 --> 02:59:30,260
I didn't do enough.

2362
02:59:31,177 --> 02:59:32,770
You did so much.

2363
02:59:37,141 --> 02:59:38,438
This car.

2364
02:59:39,894 --> 02:59:42,022
Goeth would've bought this car.

2365
02:59:42,105 --> 02:59:45,609
Why did I keep the car?
Ten people right there.

2366
02:59:49,404 --> 02:59:50,997
Ten people.

2367
02:59:53,032 --> 02:59:54,659
Ten more people.

2368
02:59:57,453 --> 02:59:59,046
This pin...

2369
02:59:59,163 --> 03:00:00,585
Two people.

2370
03:00:03,668 --> 03:00:05,136
This is gold.

2371
03:00:05,670 --> 03:00:07,263
Two more people.

2372
03:00:07,547 --> 03:00:10,551
He would have given me
two for it, at least one.

2373
03:00:10,675 --> 03:00:12,723
He would have
given me one, one more.

2374
03:00:16,180 --> 03:00:17,807
One more person.

2375
03:00:20,435 --> 03:00:22,062
A person, Stern.

2376
03:00:24,355 --> 03:00:25,698
For this.

2377
03:00:28,401 --> 03:00:31,450
(SOBBING) I could have gotten

2378
03:00:32,196 --> 03:00:35,666
one more person, and I didn't.

2379
03:00:37,243 --> 03:00:38,961
And I didn't!

(LOUD SOBBING)

2381
03:02:09,585 --> 03:02:11,804
You have been liberated

2382
03:02:12,255 --> 03:02:14,257
by the Soviet Army!

2383
03:02:22,890 --> 03:02:24,563
Have you been in Poland?

2384
03:02:24,725 --> 03:02:25,977
I just came from Poland.

2385
03:02:29,439 --> 03:02:31,191
Are there any Jews left?

2386
03:02:37,321 --> 03:02:38,823
Where should we go?

2387
03:02:39,699 --> 03:02:42,077
RUSSIAN OFFICER: Don't go
east, that's for sure.

2388
03:02:42,160 --> 03:02:43,753
They hate you there.

2389
03:02:45,538 --> 03:02:47,757
I wouldn't go west either,
if I were you.

2390
03:02:50,376 --> 03:02:52,344
We could use some food.

2391
03:02:55,047 --> 03:02:57,391
Isn't there a town over there?
