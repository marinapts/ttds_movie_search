1
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,277
When the child was a child,
it walked with its arms swinging.

2
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,991
It wanted the stream to be a river,
the river a torrent...

3
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,119
and this puddle to be the sea.

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,592
When the child was a child,
it didn't know it was a child.

5
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,959
Everything was full of life,
and all life was one.

6
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,750
When the child was a child,
it had no opinion about anything.

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,273
It had no habits.

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,228
It often sat cross-legged,
took off running...

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,235
had a cowlick in its hair,
and didn't pull a face...

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,152
when photographed.

11
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,633
Look.

12
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,759
The consolation of lifting one's head
out here in the open...

13
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,754
of seeing the colours
enlightened by the sun...

14
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,878
in all men's eyes.

15
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,710
At last mad, no longer alone.

16
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,510
At last mad, at last redeemed.
At last mad, at last at peace.

17
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,910
At last an internal light.

18
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,074
We're approaching Berlin Tegel, the
no-smoking sign has been turned on.

19
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,472
Please stop smoking
until you're inside the airport.

20
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,836
There's a little house
with two floors and a terrace.

21
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,356
And every day we go bathing.

22
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,557
The man who lives there
is called Peter...

23
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,753
Pretty picture.

24
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,071
Nothing good to see on TV.

25
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,078
You stumble over your colours,
and are never punctual.

26
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,870
Still the same smell. But dustier.
She collected everything.

27
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,600
Stamps, postcards.

28
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,517
Even U-Bahn tickets.
She never threw anything away.

29
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,151
Mother. My mother.
She never was.

30
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,756
My father...
My father was my father.

31
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,472
She is dead.
No tears, no grief. Maybe later.

32
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:57,078
Dependant on everybody.
My sister. I have to get out of here.

33
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,916
She's never loved me.
And you also just pretend.

34
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,640
Be glad that they forgot about you.

35
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,839
Want to die immediately,
don't want to go on living.

36
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,189
My God, what will become of the boy?
He's only got music on his mind.

37
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,069
What does he want now?

38
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,473
I already bought him a guitar.
Does he wants drums now?

39
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,277
I'm slowly getting fed up with it.
Won't he ever grow up?

40
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,391
No really, I'm getting fed up.
I don't want to go on with this.

41
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,272
No really, this has to stop some time.
I can't help him any more.

42
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,679
No wonder, he only learnt rock 'n' roll.

43
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,675
Maybe he'll get a grip on himself
one day.

44
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,995
When the child was a child,
it was the time of these questions:

45
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,711
Why am I me, and why not you?

46
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,431
Why am I here, and why not there?

47
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,628
When did time begin,
and where does space end?

48
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,873
Isn't life under the sun
just a dream?

49
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,873
Isn't what I see, hear and smell just a
mirage of the world before the world?

50
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,433
Does evil actually exist,
and people who are really evil?

51
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:26,913
How can it be that I, the one I am,
wasn't there before I was there...

52
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:34,475
and that some time I, the one I am,
no longer will be the one I am?

53
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,995
The child needs oxygen.
Breathe deep down.

54
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,277
If I could only suffer in her place.
- It hurts.

55
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,514
It'll be over soon.
- It's almost over.

56
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,028
Poor little mite, I'm anxious to see you.
I wonder what you look like.

57
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,070
y ou bastard. y ou bastard.
- Women will fuck up your life.

58
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,872
Blackie, I think I got lost.
We wanted to go to the cemetery...

59
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,793
Well?

60
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,351
Sunrise at 7.22 am, sunset at 4.28 pm.
Moonrise at 7.04 pm, moonset...

61
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,988
Level of the Havel and the Spree...

62
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,757
20 years ago today, a Soviet jet fighter
crashed into the lakes at Spandau.

63
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,879
50 years ago, there were...
- The Olympic Games.

64
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,755
200 years ago,
the first balloon flew over the city.

65
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,079
Like the fugitives the other day.
- And today...

66
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,596
Lilienthaler Chaussee:
A man slows down...

67
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,275
and looks over his shoulder
into space.

68
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,633
Someone who wants
to put an end to it...

69
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,678
put first-issue stamps
on his farewell letters.

70
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,193
A different one on each.

71
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,036
Then he spoke English
with an American soldier...

72
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,273
for the first time since his schooldays,
fluently.

73
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,555
Just before dashing his head against
the wall, a prisoner said: "Now."

74
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,156
Instead of the station's name,
the guard...

75
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,949
suddenly shouted: "Tierra del Fuego."
- Nice.

76
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,317
An old man was reading
the Odyssey to a child...

77
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,315
and the young listener
stopped blinking his eyes.

78
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,914
And what do you have to tell?

79
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:15,871
A passer-by who, in the rain,
folded her umbrella and was drenched.

80
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,077
A schoolboy who described
to his teacher a fern growing...

81
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,674
and the astounded teacher.

82
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,268
A blind woman, who groped her watch,
feeling my presence.

83
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,750
It's great to live by the spirit,
to testify for eternity...

84
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,469
only what is spiritual
in people's minds.

85
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,669
But sometimes I'm fed up
with my spiritual existence...

86
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,751
of forever hovering above.

87
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,275
I'd like to feel a weight in me...

88
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,955
to end the infinity,
and to tie me to earth.

89
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,999
I'd like at each step,
each gust of wind...

90
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,755
to be able to say:
"Now, now and now."

91
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,559
No longer:
"Forever" and "For eternity".

92
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,396
Sit at the empty place at a card table,
be greeted...

93
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,676
even by a nod.

94
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,868
Every time we participated,
it was a pretence.

95
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,436
Wrestling, allowing a hip to be put out,
in pretence...

96
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,875
catching a fish in pretence.

97
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:31,353
In pretence, sitting at tables
drinking and eating in pretence.

98
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,548
Having lambs roasted and wine served
in the tents in the desert...

99
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,551
only in pretence.

100
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,236
I don't have to beget a child
or plant a tree...

101
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,791
but it would be nice,
coming home after a long day...

102
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,748
to feed the cat like Philip Marlowe...

103
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,277
to have a fever,
blackened fingers from the newspaper.

104
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,113
To be excited not only by the mind,
but by a meal.

105
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,073
By the line of a neck,
by an ear.

106
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,158
To lie.

107
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,550
Through one's teeth.

108
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,395
As you're walking,
to feel your bones moving along.

109
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,757
At last to guess
instead of always knowing.

110
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,914
To be able to say:
"Ah" and "Oh" and "Hey"...

111
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,629
instead of: "y es and amen."
- y es.

112
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,872
To be able to enthuse for evil...

113
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,794
to draw all the demons
from the passers- by...

114
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,872
and to chase them out into the world.

115
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,270
To be a savage.

116
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,755
Or to feel how it is to take off
your shoes under the table...

117
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,675
and to wriggle your toes, barefoot,
like that...

118
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,151
Stay alone.

119
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,869
Let things happen. Keep serious.

120
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,750
We can only be savages
in as much as we keep serious.

121
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,869
Do no more than look.
Assemble, testify, preserve.

122
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,471
Remain spirit.
Keep your distance. Keep your word.

123
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,077
Look, a convertible.
y ou don't buy that, you steal it.

124
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,549
Or it's stolen from you.
- lmagine...

125
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,872
Open the roof, leave the smog behind.
- In a pimpmobile.

126
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,275
Tell me, muse, the storyteller...

127
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,399
he who has been thrust
to the edge of the world...

128
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:22,477
both an infant and an ancient,
and through him reveal Everyman.

129
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,513
With time, those who listened to me
became my readers.

130
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,309
They no longer sit in a circle,
but apart...

131
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,268
and one doesn't know anything
about the other.

132
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,393
I'm an old man,
with a broken voice...

133
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,475
but the story
still rises from the depths...

134
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,359
and the slowly opened mouth...

135
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,752
repeats it as clearly
as it does powerfully.

136
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,438
A liturgy for which no one
needs to be initiated...

137
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,878
to the meaning
of the words and sentences.

138
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,476
Maybe she doesn't have the money
to see another doctor.

139
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,676
4 years since I saw her,
she's been sick for 2.

140
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,550
When will you pray with your
own words, and not for eternal life?

141
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,078
And then these young girls
make eyes at men...

142
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,199
So why am I living? Why am I living?

143
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,751
How will I pay?
With my small pension.

144
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,638
You're lost,
it can go on for a long time.

145
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,473
Abandoned by parents,
betrayed by wife.

146
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,758
Friend in another town,
your children only recall your stutter.

147
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,152
y ou could hit yourself
as you look in the mirror.

148
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,916
What's that?
What's going on?

149
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,471
I'm still there.
If I want it, if I only want it.

150
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,349
I must want it,
then I can get out of it again.

151
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,751
I let myself go,
I can drag myself out again.

152
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,480
Of course, mother was right.

153
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,437
Hey, two Marks.
- No, it's a beer top.

154
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,670
Nonsense, let's pull it up.

155
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,633
Only 10 Pfennigs.

156
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,678
"y ou bet?" was great last night.
- It wasn't on last night.

157
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,718
A few days ago, or a month...

158
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,315
I'm all alone,
just mad on my own...

159
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,871
three at play,
that'll be the day.

160
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,874
5 years ago.
- And they lived happily ever after.

161
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,990
Marion, not like that. Mon dieu.

162
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,632
What is this?
With a swing, not with force.

163
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,634
What are you doing?
Don't dangle, fly.

164
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,873
y ou are an angel.
- For heaven's sake.

165
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,753
And for my sake, too.

166
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,072
I can't fly with these things.
- y es, you can.

167
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,031
It's easier with wings than without.
- Not with these chicken feathers.

168
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,868
What did she say?
- These wings bother her.

169
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:51,114
Marion, just imagine you're a dove.
- y ou bunch of sparrows.

170
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,358
What are you playing at?
Sounds like a firemen's ball.

171
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,196
That's enough.
Concentrate, Marion.

172
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,352
She works hard
with those chicken feathers.

173
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,911
Marion, make an effort.
- Make an effort.

174
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,676
Of course, I make an effort.
What do you think I'm doing?

175
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,473
I'd have fallen on your heads long ago,
if I didn't make an effort.

176
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,353
One moment, please.

177
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,469
Hold everything. We can't pay the rent
and the electricity.

178
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,993
We're broke.

179
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,629
So tomorrow we'll take things down,
pull the caravans to winter quarters.

180
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,477
The bailiff's been.
This is it for the circus this year.

181
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,312
I'm sorry.

182
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,677
It's over. Not even a season.

183
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,913
Once again,
no time to bring something to an end.

184
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,676
Tonight the last night
of my good old number.

185
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,558
And it's a full moon.

186
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,635
And the trapeze artist
comes tumbling down...

187
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,950
Tais-toi. Be quiet.

188
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,150
I never imagined it like that,
the farewell to the circus.

189
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,472
The last evening, no one shows up,
you play like fools...

190
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,872
and I fly around the ring
like a poor chicken.

191
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,878
And then I'm a waitress again.
Merde.

192
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,554
Moments like that,
like right now...

193
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,349
a beautiful memory
in 10 years time.

194
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,755
Time will heal everything,
but what if time was the illness?

195
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,118
As if sometimes one had to lean over
to go on living.

196
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,876
To live... A look is enough.

197
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,713
The circus... I'll miss it.

198
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,192
It's funny.
It's the end, and I don't feel a thing.

199
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,032
An angel passes by.

200
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,875
I must stop
having a bad conscience.

201
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,472
As if pain had no past.

202
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,712
It always stops
when it's only just starting...

203
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,952
to be too good to be true.

204
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,634
At last outside, in the city.

205
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,555
Find out who I am,
who I have become.

206
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,350
Most of the time,
I'm too aware to be sad.

207
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,356
I waited an eternity
to hear a loving word.

208
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,670
Then I went abroad.

209
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,868
Someone who'd say:
"I love you so much today."

210
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,674
That would be wonderful.

211
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,597
I look up and the world
appears before my eyes...

212
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,479
and fills my heart.

213
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,468
As a child,
I wanted to live on an island.

214
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,471
A woman alone, gloriously alone.

215
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,475
y es, that's it.

216
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,676
Everything so empty, incompatible.

217
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,674
Emptiness, fear.

218
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,355
La peur, la peur, la peur...

219
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,873
Fear.

220
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,679
Like a small animal,
lost in the woods.

221
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,638
Who are you?
I don't know any more.

222
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:11,193
But I do know:
I will no longer be a trapeze artist.

223
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,476
Must not cry. That's how it is.

224
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,350
It happens,
not always as you'd like it.

225
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,672
Emptiness, such emptiness...

226
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,071
What shall I do?

227
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,477
Not think any more.
Just be there.

228
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,748
Berlin... Here I'm a stranger,
and yet it's all so familiar.

229
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,755
You can't get lost,
you always end up at the Wall.

230
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:45,155
I'm waiting for my photo at a machine,
and it comes out with another face.

231
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,869
That could be the beginning of a story.

232
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,352
The faces... I'd like to see faces.

233
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,671
Maybe I'll find a job as a waitress.

234
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,873
This evening scares me.

235
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,476
It's silly, fear makes me sick.

236
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,873
Only part of me worries,
the other part doesn't believe in it.

237
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,072
How should I live?
Maybe that's not the question.

238
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,879
How should I think?

239
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:43,270
I know so little. Maybe
because I'm always just curious.

240
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,670
Sometimes I think so wrongly...

241
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,868
because I'm thinking
as if I was talking to someone else.

242
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,519
lnside closed eyes,
close the eyes again.

243
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,358
Then even the stones come alive.

244
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,674
To be with the colours.

245
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,071
Les couleurs. The colours.

246
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,875
Neon lights in the evening sky,
the red and yellow S-Bahn.

247
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,230
Longing... longing.

248
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,676
I only need to be ready.

249
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,675
Longing for a wave of love
that would stir in me.

250
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,875
That's what makes me clumsy,
the absence of desire.

251
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,879
Desire to love.

252
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,873
Desire to love.

253
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,359
Don't stare.
Have you never seen anyone die?

254
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,674
I stink of gasoline.
I can't just... It was all so clear.

255
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,469
The way they're standing there,
staring at me.

256
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,872
I should have told her yesterday
that I'm sorry...

257
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,751
I can't simply...
I've still got so much to do...

258
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:57,675
As I came up the mountain
out of the misty valley into the sun...

259
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,354
The fire on the cattle range,
the potatoes in the ashes...

260
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,036
the boathouse floating on the lake.

261
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,354
The Southern Cross. The Far East.

262
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:22,073
The Great North. The Wild West.

263
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:29,874
The Great Bear Lake.
The Tristan de Cunha lsland.

264
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:37,673
The Mississippi Delta. Stromboli.

265
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,879
The old houses of Charlottenburg.
Albert Camus.

266
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,473
The morning light.
The eyes of the child.

267
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,476
Swimming near the waterfall.

268
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,348
The spots of the first drops of rain.
The sun.

269
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,470
The bread and wine. Hopping.

270
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:19,351
Easter. The veins of the leaves.

271
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,755
The blowing grass.
The colours of the stones.

272
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,471
The pebbles on the stream's bed.

273
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,189
The white tablecloth outdoors.

274
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,194
The dream of the house in the house.

275
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,399
The dear one asleep
in the next room.

276
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,271
The peaceful Sunday.
The horizon.

277
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,479
The light from the room
in the garden.

278
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,670
The night flight.
Riding a bicycle with no hands.

279
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,748
The beautiful stranger.

280
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,433
My father.

281
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,873
My mother.

282
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,353
My wife.

283
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,913
My child.

284
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,870
The world seems to be sinking
into dust, but I recount...

285
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,792
as in the beginning...

286
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,475
in my sing-song voice,
which sustains me...

287
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,872
saved by the tale
from present troubles...

288
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,874
and protected for the future.

289
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:09,990
Finished with the sweeping
over the centuries as in the past.

290
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,756
Now I can think only day by day.

291
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,597
My heroes are no longer
the warriors and kings...

292
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:27,472
but the things of peace,
one equal to the other.

293
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:34,796
The drying onions equal
to the tree trunk crossing the marsh.

294
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:42,913
But no one has so far succeeded
in singing an epic of peace.

295
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,871
What is wrong with peace
that its inspiration doesn't endure...

296
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,115
and that its story is hardly told?

297
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,357
Must I give up now?

298
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,548
If I do give up,
then mankind will lose its storyteller.

299
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,759
And once mankind
loses its storyteller...

300
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,674
it will also lose its childhood.

301
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,239
I cannot find the Potsdamer Platz.

302
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:38,515
Here? This can't be it.

303
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,277
Potsdamer Platz,
that's where Cafz Josti used to be.

304
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:51,152
In the afternoons, I went there
to chat and to drink a coffee...

305
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,197
and to watch the crowd.

306
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,148
Before that I smoked my cigar
at Loese and Wolf...

307
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,676
a renowned tobacconist.

308
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,796
Just across from here.

309
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:10,473
This can't be the Potsdamer Platz.

310
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,351
And no one whom you can ask.

311
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:26,793
It was a lively place.
Tramways, horse-drawn carriages...

312
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:33,593
and two cars:
mine and that of the chocolate shop.

313
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,311
The Wertheim store was here, too.

314
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:46,079
And then suddenly,
the flags appeared.

315
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,992
Here...

316
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:54,075
The whole Platz
was covered with them.

317
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,678
And the people
weren't friendly anymore ...

318
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,833
and the police wasn't either.

319
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,788
I will not give up...

320
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,954
as long as I haven't found
the Potsdamer Platz.

321
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,316
Where are my heroes?
Where are you, my children?

322
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,349
Where are my own, the dull-witted...

323
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,476
the original ones?

324
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,350
Name me, muse,
the immortal singer...

325
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,036
who,
abandoned by his mortal audience...

326
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,679
lost his voice.

327
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,752
He who,
from angel of poetry that he was...

328
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,313
became the organ grinder
ignored or mocked...

329
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,632
outside,
on the threshold of no man's land.

330
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:32,072
20 Marks, 40 Marks, 80 Marks.
In a week I could have 500.

331
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,390
Off to the south.

332
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,030
What a crazy idea to stand here.
Too much traffic.

333
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,078
Idiot,
three times he's been this way.

334
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,913
I want to get out of here.

335
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:48,870
If anyone recognises me, I'll be
thrown out of secondary school.

336
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,669
I need Klaus,
he'd take good care of me.

337
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:57,755
He was so good, too good.
And now he's dead.

338
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,069
Are there still borders?
More than ever.

339
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,633
Each street has its own border line.

340
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,190
Between each plot
there's a no man's land strip...

341
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,989
hidden by a hedge or by a ditch.

342
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,630
Who dares,
will fall on booby traps...

343
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,633
or be hit by laser beams.

344
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,351
The trout in the water
are really torpedoes.

345
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,479
Every proprietor, or even tenant...

346
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,313
sticks up his nameplate
like a coat of arms...

347
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,438
and studies the paper
like a world leader.

348
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,355
The German people are divided into as
many states as there are individuals.

349
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,035
And these small states are mobile.

350
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,316
Each one takes his own with him...

351
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,189
and demands a toll
when another wants to enter.

352
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:05,799
In the form of a fly in amber
or a leather bottle.

353
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,678
So much for the border.

354
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:13,710
But one can only enter each state
with the right passwords.

355
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,872
Today's German soul can only
be conquered and governed...

356
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,397
by he who arrives at each small state
with the password.

357
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,916
Fortunately,
no one is now able to do so.

358
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:51,599
So everyone migrates and
raises his own flag all over the world.

359
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,228
Even their children
shake their rattles...

360
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,676
and trail their filth around
in circles.

361
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,996
The medals reflect the best.

362
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,072
They were elegant,
those brothers.

363
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,879
Could I have light?
- But no flame.

364
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,270
y ou're welcome.
- Thank you.

365
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,835
The only thing I shall miss
from the outside...

366
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,118
from the realm of light,
will be sparrows.

367
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,953
Money buys happiness.
How to live?

368
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,839
The Man in the Golden Helmet
is a swindle.

369
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,278
You're not natives,
you're all refugees.

370
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,874
y ou're wet from swimming.

371
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,555
I've been sitting here
since this morning...

372
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,551
I'm so cold and bored.

373
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,793
Wind in the face,
the first snow in the air.

374
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,036
Water in the gutter.

375
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,192
The balcony
with the beautiful stranger.

376
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:00,036
Real ones. They look like it.
They could be real ones.

377
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,351
Some stole food from the dogs
in the camps.

378
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:09,072
That would take the grin off your face.
Don't be too sure yet.

379
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,392
The Frenchman.
I met him in the streets.

380
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:18,156
" Berlin won't be there any more,"
Constant said.

381
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:24,714
The house was half gone.
Some of it still stood. For how long?

382
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,235
Yes, I can still see this woman...

383
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:34,556
who was standing up there
in the ruins shaking the duvet.

384
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,635
When was that?
May... June 1945.

385
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:07,075
Is he good at what he's doing?
It seems so.

386
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,271
I'd like to see it.
Maybe he'll give it to me.

387
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,313
Come, I'll show you something else.

388
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:05,192
When the child was a child
it choked on spinach, peas...

389
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,670
rice pudding
and steamed cauliflower...

390
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:13,356
and now eats all of that,
and not just because it has to.

391
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:18,389
When the child was a child,
it woke up once in a strange bed...

392
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,755
but now time and time again.

393
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:26,313
Many people seemed beautiful then,
nowadays it's only the odd one.

394
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:32,919
It had a precise picture of Paradise,
and now can only guess at it.

395
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:38,677
It couldn't imagine nothingness,
and today shudders at the idea.

396
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:43,391
When the child was a child,
it played with enthusiasm...

397
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:50,636
and now it can only muster it
when it concerns its work.

398
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,554
Do you recall our first visit here?

399
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,235
History had not yet begun.

400
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,393
We let mornings and evenings go by,
and waited.

401
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:58,999
It took a long time for the river to find
its bed and the stagnant water to flow.

402
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:04,996
Valley of the primeval river.
One day, I still remember...

403
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,597
the glacier melted
and the icebergs drifted to the north.

404
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,880
A tree passed by, still green,
with an empty bird's nest.

405
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,999
Only the fish had leapt
over a myriad of years.

406
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,550
Then came the moment
when the bees drowned.

407
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:27,236
Some time later,
the two stags fought on the bank.

408
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:47,366
Then the flies and the antlers,
like branches, flowing down the river.

409
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,805
All that ever grew again was grass...

410
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:54,361
growing over the bodies of wild cats,
wild boar and buffaloes.

411
00:56:54,530 --> 00:57:00,048
One morning, out of the savannah,
its forehead smeared with grass...

412
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:04,328
appeared the biped,
our image, so long awaited.

413
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:06,720
And its first word was a shout.

414
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:13,568
Was it "ah" or "oh",
or was it merely a groan?

415
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:18,679
We were at last able to laugh,
for the first time.

416
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:24,163
Through this man's shout and that
of his followers, we learnt to speak.

417
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:26,480
A long story.

418
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,720
Sun, lightning, thunder in the sky...

419
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:32,405
and below on earth,
the firesides, the leaps...

420
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:35,926
the round dances,
the signs, the writing.

421
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:42,287
Then one broke through the cycle
and ran straight ahead.

422
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:49,049
As long as he ran straight ahead,
swerving sometimes perhaps from joy...

423
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:52,839
he seemed free,
and again we could laugh with him.

424
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:58,528
But then, suddenly, he ran zigzag,
and stones flew.

425
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:07,002
With his flight began
the history of wars. It is still going on.

426
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:12,324
But the story of the grass, the sun,
the leaps and the shouts...

427
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,924
is still going on, too.

428
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:24,888
Do you know how one day
the road was built here...

429
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:29,248
which the next day
saw the Napoleon retreat...

430
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:33,483
and was paved later on?

431
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:39,646
Today it is covered with grass
and sunk in like a Roman road...

432
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:41,926
with the tank tracks.

433
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:48,319
But we weren't even spectators.
We've always been too few.

434
00:58:53,890 --> 00:59:00,079
You really want...
- To conquer a history for myself.

435
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,367
What my timeless downward look
has taught me...

436
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:07,000
I want to transmute,
to sustain a glance...

437
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:11,368
a short shout, a sour smell.

438
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:17,046
I've been outside long enough.
Absent long enough.

439
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:21,567
Long enough out of the world.
Let me enter the history of the world.

440
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:24,403
Or just hold an apple in my hand.

441
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:29,724
Look, those feathers,
there on the water, already vanished.

442
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:36,921
Look, the tyre marks on the asphalt,
and now the cigarette butt rolling.

443
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:43,040
The primeval river has dried up,
and only today's raindrops still quiver.

444
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:46,759
Down with the world behind the world.

445
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:10,002
Only the Roman roads
still lead somewhere...

446
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:13,924
only the oldest traces
lead anywhere.

447
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:16,479
Where is the top of the pass here?

448
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:22,566
Even the plains, even Berlin,
has its hidden passes.

449
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:29,329
And it's only there that my country,
the country of the tale, begins.

450
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:33,483
Why doesn't everyone see
from childhood on...

451
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:37,928
the passes, doors and crevices...

452
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:42,083
on the ground
and above in the sky.

453
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:49,406
If everyone saw them, there would be
history without murder or war.

454
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:53,802
This time I'm doing it.
Funny I'm so calm.

455
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:57,963
Why red socks with black shoes?
Stupid.

456
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:01,679
Foggy, cold.
Put on a pullover, afraid to be cold.

457
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:06,241
Very good jacket. A bargain.
Just the pocket's torn.

458
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:08,082
She gave it to me.

459
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:13,404
Pebbles on the roof. Why?
So it doesn't fly away? Nonsense.

460
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:15,847
Once I'd like to fly.

461
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:20,526
The plane circles over Berlin,
one day it'll crash.

462
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:24,888
It's cold. My hands were
always warm. A good sign.

463
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:27,723
It crackles underfoot.
What time is it?

464
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:33,248
The sun's setting. Logical, the west.
Now I know where the west is.

465
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:36,561
I always took the U-Bahn to the east
to go home...

466
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:39,119
bought 10 tickets, saved a Mark.

467
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:42,327
The sun in my back,
on the left the star.

468
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:46,085
That's good: sun and a star.
Her little feet.

469
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:49,765
Hopping from one foot to the other.
She danced so sweetly.

470
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:51,283
We were all alone.

471
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:55,045
Has she got my letter?
I don't want her to read it.

472
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:59,362
Berlin means nothing to me...
Havel? Is that a lake?

473
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:04,320
Over there Wedding, or what?
The East is everywhere really.

474
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:08,483
Strange people, they're shouting.
I don't care.

475
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:14,122
All these thoughts.
I'd really rather not think any more.

476
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,246
I'm going, why?

477
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:48,803
Leave me alone, you swine.
- Mother. Mother.

478
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:26,122
I'll never make it tonight.
No trapeze on full-moon nights.

479
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:30,283
Not the last time, the very last time.

480
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:33,044
I should wake up from this dream.

481
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:37,761
The end of the circus. Fini.

482
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:43,084
And once again I feel
as if night were falling inside of me.

483
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:47,368
Fear... Fear of death.

484
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:51,000
Why not death?

485
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,400
The essential at times...

486
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:59,486
just being beautiful, and nothing more.

487
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:05,008
To look at oneself in the mirror
is to see oneself think.

488
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:08,162
So what do you think?

489
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:13,688
I think I still have the right to be afraid,
but not to talk about it.

490
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:18,640
You're not yet blind,
the heart is still beating.

491
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:21,802
And now you're crying after all.

492
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:26,407
You'd like to cry
like a very sad little girl.

493
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:29,801
Do you know why you're crying?
For whom?

494
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:34,088
Not for me.
I don't know for whom.

495
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:39,040
I'd like to know. I know nothing.

496
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:45,888
I'm a little bit afraid.
It's gone, gone away. It'll come back.

497
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:47,881
It doesn't matter.

498
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:13,999
Just to be able to say,
like right now, I'm happy.

499
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:20,040
I have a story,
and I'll go on having one.

500
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:11,159
There it is again,
this feeling of well- being...

501
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:17,166
as if inside my body
a hand was softly tightening.

502
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:10,280
When the child was a child,
it was the time of these questions:

503
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:14,728
Why am I me, and why not you?

504
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:19,441
Why am I here, and why not there?

505
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:23,888
When did time begin,
and where does space end?

506
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:29,920
Isn't life under the sun just a dream?

507
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:47,122
Isn't that Columbo?
- Don't think so.

508
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:52,080
Not with that moth-eaten coat.
- He wouldn't be out here.

509
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:31,240
Well?
- I'm going to enter the river.

510
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:35,403
An old human expression
that I only understand today.

511
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:37,401
Now or never, moment of the ford.

512
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:41,358
But there is no other bank,
there is only the river.

513
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:44,567
lnto the ford of time,
the ford of death.

514
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:47,688
We're not yet born,
so let's descend.

515
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:51,206
To look is not to look from on high,
but at eye-level.

516
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:54,521
First, I'll take a bath.

517
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:58,729
Then I'll be shaved
by a Turkish barber...

518
01:23:58,890 --> 01:24:02,439
who will also massage me
down to the fingertips.

519
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:08,640
Then I'll buy a newspaper and read it
from the headlines to the horoscope.

520
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:14,487
On the first day, I'll only be served.
For requests, ask the neighbour.

521
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:18,438
If someone stumbles over my legs,
he'll apologise.

522
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:20,726
If pushed, I'll push back.

523
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:23,927
The bartender will find me
an empty table.

524
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:28,003
A car will stop,
and the mayor will give me a lift.

525
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:30,923
I'll be familiar to everyone,
suspect to no one.

526
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:34,162
I won't say a word,
will understand every language.

527
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:39,450
This will be my first day.
- But none of it will be true.

528
01:25:09,410 --> 01:25:15,121
I'll take her in my arms,
and she'll take me in her arms.

529
01:25:58,730 --> 01:26:01,369
I think he's drunk.
- Yes.

530
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:26,283
Let's go.

531
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:57,323
It's got a taste.

532
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:03,083
Now I begin to understand.

533
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:12,244
Is that red?
- Yes.

534
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:14,480
Did you hurt yourself?

535
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:17,039
Is today a good day?
- It's okay.

536
01:27:18,490 --> 01:27:21,402
And the pipes?
- They're yellow.

537
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:24,528
Yellow. What about him?
- He's grey-blue.

538
01:27:24,690 --> 01:27:27,648
Grey-blue. This one?
- Purple.

539
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,562
This one?
- Orange. Ochre.

540
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:32,403
Ochre or orange?
- Ochre.

541
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:35,767
Yellow, red... this one?
- It's green.

542
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:40,082
And what's that over the eye?
- That's blue.

543
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:42,603
Blue.

544
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:46,167
Is it very cold?
- It'll soon be over.

545
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:48,207
I'd love to have a coffee.

546
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:52,079
Do you have money?
- Yes... no.

547
01:27:56,530 --> 01:27:59,283
I'm glad everything is fine today.

548
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:10,723
Beautiful.

549
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:39,328
Coffee.
- With milk and sugar?

550
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:40,923
Black.

551
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:29,443
When the child was a child, it lived
on apples and bread, that was enough.

552
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:31,805
And it is still that way.

553
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:41,690
When the child was a child, berries fell
only like berries into its hand.

554
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:44,603
And they still do now.

555
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:52,400
Fresh walnuts made its tongue raw,
and they still do now.

556
01:29:52,570 --> 01:29:59,089
Atop each mountain
it was longing for a higher mountain.

557
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:05,246
And in each city
it was longing for a bigger city.

558
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:08,800
And it still does.

559
01:30:12,050 --> 01:30:15,326
Reached in the treetop
for the cherries...

560
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:19,722
as excitedly as it still does today.

561
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:27,682
Was shy in front of strangers,
and it still is.

562
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:36,809
Waited for the first snow,
and still waits that way.

563
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:51,323
When the child was a child, it threw
a stick like a lance into a tree.

564
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:55,369
And it's still quivering there today.

565
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:39,080
How do I get to Akazienstrasse?
- Go up Potsdamer to Kleistpark.

566
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:44,643
Right at Grunewald past Gleditsch,
no right turn at Goltzstrasse.

567
01:31:44,810 --> 01:31:47,119
Turn left, and there you are.

568
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:23,805
This entrance is for the crew.
Extras, the other way, please.

569
01:32:32,410 --> 01:32:35,402
Extra.
- That's just what you look like.

570
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:37,242
They all want autographs.

571
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:39,643
Lousy cop.

572
01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:11,238
Come on, Marion. Don't worry.
It'll be alright.

573
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:14,925
I'll send you a postcard
of the Eiffel Tower.

574
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:19,766
See you next season.
Don't forget the Alekan Circus.

575
01:35:19,930 --> 01:35:24,481
Bye Archie, see you next year.
- Au revoir.

576
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:26,083
A thousand kisses.

577
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:31,278
I'll send you a parcel.
With some Camembert cheese?

578
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:34,643
I couldn't say who I am.
I don't have the slightest idea.

579
01:36:34,810 --> 01:36:40,487
I am someone
with no roots, no story, no country...

580
01:36:40,650 --> 01:36:43,164
and I like it that way.

581
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:49,769
I am here, I am free. I can imagine
anything. It's all possible.

582
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:55,607
I only have to raise my eyes,
and once again I become the world.

583
01:36:55,770 --> 01:36:59,524
Now, in this very place...

584
01:36:59,690 --> 01:37:05,686
a feeling of happiness
that I could always have.

585
01:39:00,970 --> 01:39:03,803
What are you doing?
- I'm sitting.

586
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:06,359
Are you sad?
- No.

587
01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:10,079
Are you sick?
- Yes.

588
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:12,764
What's the matter?
- A need.

589
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:15,444
Oh, that's it.

590
01:39:15,610 --> 01:39:19,285
A double knot is the only way
to make it hold.

591
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:27,768
A need. A need of food perhaps.
- Or a need of drink.

592
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:34,324
She isn't gone, Cassiel. I know it.

593
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:36,765
I'll find her.

594
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:41,321
Something will happen,
something important, tonight.

595
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:46,928
She'll teach me everything.

596
01:39:47,970 --> 01:39:52,521
There are other suns then the one
up in the sky, Cassiel.

597
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:57,161
In the deep of the night,
spring will begin today.

598
01:39:57,330 --> 01:40:00,561
Other wings will grow
in place of the old ones.

599
01:40:00,730 --> 01:40:04,484
Wings that will at last astound me.

600
01:48:51,850 --> 01:48:54,922
It must finally become serious.

601
01:48:58,530 --> 01:49:03,445
I've often been alone,
but I've never lived alone.

602
01:49:07,330 --> 01:49:10,959
When I was with someone
I was often happy...

603
01:49:11,130 --> 01:49:14,406
but at the same time
it all seemed a coincidence.

604
01:49:14,570 --> 01:49:20,247
These people were my parents,
but it could have been others.

605
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:23,686
Why was the brown-eyed one
my brother...

606
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:28,526
and not the green-eyed boy
on the opposite platform?

607
01:49:29,970 --> 01:49:33,360
The taxi driver's daughter
was my friend...

608
01:49:33,530 --> 01:49:40,481
but I might as well have put
my arm around a horse's neck.

609
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:45,360
I was with a man, I was in love...

610
01:49:45,530 --> 01:49:48,522
and I might as well
have left him there...

611
01:49:48,690 --> 01:49:54,640
and gone off with the stranger
we met in the street.

612
01:49:57,970 --> 01:50:00,928
Look at me, or don't.

613
01:50:01,090 --> 01:50:04,082
Give me your hand, or don't.

614
01:50:05,490 --> 01:50:10,689
No, don't give me your hand,
and look away.

615
01:50:16,250 --> 01:50:19,128
I think tonight is the new moon.

616
01:50:20,570 --> 01:50:22,800
No night more peaceful.

617
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:29,520
No bloodshed in all the city.

618
01:50:29,690 --> 01:50:32,329
I've never played with anyone
and yet...

619
01:50:32,490 --> 01:50:37,610
I never opened my eyes and thought:
Now it's serious.

620
01:50:40,690 --> 01:50:43,807
At last it's becoming serious.

621
01:50:46,850 --> 01:50:49,489
So I've grown older.

622
01:50:51,970 --> 01:50:55,246
Was I the only one
who wasn't serious?

623
01:50:56,570 --> 01:50:59,721
Is it our times that are not serious?

624
01:51:01,010 --> 01:51:06,448
I've never been lonely,
neither alone, nor with someone else.

625
01:51:06,610 --> 01:51:09,602
But I would have liked to be lonely.

626
01:51:09,770 --> 01:51:14,605
Loneliness means: I am whole at last.

627
01:51:14,770 --> 01:51:20,561
Now I can say it,
as tonight I'm lonely at last.

628
01:51:20,730 --> 01:51:24,643
I must put an end to coincidence.

629
01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:31,681
The new moon of decision.

630
01:51:31,850 --> 01:51:36,640
I don't know if there is a destiny,
but there is a decision.

631
01:51:36,810 --> 01:51:39,324
Decide.

632
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:43,324
Now we are the times.

633
01:51:43,490 --> 01:51:49,565
Not only the whole town, the whole
world is taking part in our decision.

634
01:51:49,730 --> 01:51:55,441
Now we are more than the two of us.
We incarnate something.

635
01:51:55,610 --> 01:51:58,727
We are sitting
on the People's Square...

636
01:51:58,890 --> 01:52:04,567
and the whole place is full of people
whose dream is the same as ours.

637
01:52:04,730 --> 01:52:08,803
We are deciding everybody's game.

638
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:16,160
I am ready.
Now it's your turn.

639
01:52:16,330 --> 01:52:19,402
You hold the game in your hand.

640
01:52:19,570 --> 01:52:22,926
Now or never.

641
01:52:27,490 --> 01:52:34,168
You need me.
You will need me.

642
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:41,406
There is no greater story than ours,
that of man and woman.

643
01:52:41,570 --> 01:52:45,529
It will be a story of giants.

644
01:52:45,690 --> 01:52:50,559
lnvisible, transposable.

645
01:52:50,730 --> 01:52:54,518
A story of new ancestors.

646
01:52:56,530 --> 01:52:59,567
Look, my eyes.

647
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:05,802
They are the image of necessity...

648
01:53:05,970 --> 01:53:10,009
of the future of everyone in the place.

649
01:53:13,050 --> 01:53:17,885
Last night I dreamt of a stranger.

650
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:23,640
Of my man.

651
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:26,961
Only with him could I be lonely...

652
01:53:27,130 --> 01:53:29,200
open up to him...

653
01:53:29,370 --> 01:53:33,807
wholly open, wholly for him...

654
01:53:33,970 --> 01:53:37,599
welcome him wholly into me...

655
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:45,563
surround him with the labyrinth
of shared happiness.

656
01:53:45,730 --> 01:53:48,847
I know...

657
01:53:49,010 --> 01:53:51,478
it's you.

658
01:54:17,770 --> 01:54:19,726
Something happened.

659
01:54:21,450 --> 01:54:27,923
It is still going on. It binds me.

660
01:54:28,090 --> 01:54:35,041
It was true at night, and it's true
in the day, even more so now.

661
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:41,240
Who was who?
I was in her and she was around me.

662
01:54:43,050 --> 01:54:47,885
Who in the world can claim that he
was ever together with another being?

663
01:54:48,050 --> 01:54:51,087
I am together.

664
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:58,167
No mortal child was begot,
only an immortal common image.

665
01:54:58,330 --> 01:55:02,243
I learned astonishment that night.

666
01:55:02,410 --> 01:55:07,484
She came to take me home,
and I found home.

667
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:13,200
It happened once.

668
01:55:15,810 --> 01:55:19,928
Once, and therefore forever.

669
01:55:22,210 --> 01:55:27,000
The image that we created
will be with me when I die.

670
01:55:28,650 --> 01:55:31,767
I will have lived within it.

671
01:55:33,410 --> 01:55:40,202
The amazement about the two of us,
amazement about man and woman...

672
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:43,123
has turned me into a human being.

673
01:55:47,570 --> 01:55:53,566
I know now...

674
01:55:53,730 --> 01:55:55,482
what...

675
01:55:55,650 --> 01:56:01,998
no angel knows.

676
01:56:07,570 --> 01:56:12,690
Name the men, women and children
who will look for me...

677
01:56:12,850 --> 01:56:17,605
me, their storyteller,
their cantor, their spokesman...

678
01:56:17,770 --> 01:56:25,882
because they need me
more than anything in the world.

679
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:30,484
We have embarked.
