No, we did that yesterday.
I don't want to do that.

Don't get me started

If I could just meet one,
one who wasn't so superficial.

503

EVE.

505
01:06:15,798 --> 01:06:17,288
EVE!

01:06:18,467 --> 01:06:19,434
Oh!

507
01:06:34,483 --> 01:06:35,450
Huh?

508
01:06:36,819 --> 01:06:38,548
Foreign contaminant.

509
01:06:46,495 --> 01:06:48,486
There you go, little guy.

510
01:06:48,597 --> 01:06:51,430
You came a long way
for a drink of water.

511
01:06:51,534 --> 01:06:54,230
Just needed someone
to look after you, that's...

512
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:09,445
We have to go back.

513
01:07:11,587 --> 01:07:14,385

- <i>Aye, aye, sir.</i>

You may give it to me.

518
01:07:27,203 --> 01:07:30,639
- You know what? I should do it myself.
- Captain.

519
01:07:31,907 --> 01:07:35,104
Sir, I insist you give me the plant.

520
01:07:35,211 --> 01:07:38,669
- Auto, get out of my way.
- We cannot go home.

521
01:07:38,781 --> 01:07:42,547
- What are you talking about? Why not?
- That is classified, Captain.

522
01:07:42,651 --> 01:07:44,949
- Give me the plant.
- What do you mean, "classified"?

523
01:07:45,054 --> 01:07:46,521
You don't keep a secret
from the captain.

524
01:07:46,622 --> 01:07:47,714
Give me the plant.

525
01:07:47,823 --> 01:07:50,155
- Tell me what's classified.
- The plant.

526
01:07:50,259 --> 01:07:52,090
Tell me, Auto! That's an order.

527
01:07:55,931 --> 01:07:57,398
Aye, aye, sir.

536
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:27,429
"Unsustainable"? What?

537
01:08:27,563 --> 01:08:31,556
<i>Darn it all, we're going to have</i>

543
01:08:41,977 --> 01:08:43,137
"Easier"?

550
01:09:05,101 --> 01:09:07,365
Now, the plant.

551
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:09,438
No. Wait a minute.

552
01:09:09,538 --> 01:09:11,904
Computer, when was that message
sent out to the <i>Axiom?</i>

553
01:09:12,007 --> 01:09:14,441
<i>Message received</i>
<i>in the year 2110.</i>

554
01:09:14,543 --> 01:09:17,944
That's... That's nearly 700 years ago!

555
01:09:18,047 --> 01:09:21,073
Auto, things have changed!
We've got to go back.

556
01:09:21,183 --> 01:09:23,845
Sir, orders are "do not return to Earth."

557
01:09:23,953 --> 01:09:28,890
But life is sustainable now.
Look at this plant. Green and growing.

558
01:09:28,991 --> 01:09:32,324
- It's living proof he was wrong.
- Irrelevant, Captain.

559
01:09:32,428 --> 01:09:36,421
What? It's completely relevant!
Out there is our home.

560
01:09:36,532 --> 01:09:37,794
Home, Auto.

561
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:41,631
And it's in trouble.
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

562
01:09:41,737 --> 01:09:43,034
That's all I've ever done.

563
01:09:43,139 --> 01:09:46,438
That's all anyone on this blasted ship
has ever done. Nothing!

564
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:48,874
On the <i>Axiom</i> you will survive.

565
01:09:48,978 --> 01:09:53,677
- I don't want to survive. I want to live!
- Must follow my directive.

Hey! That's not...

570
01:10:26,749 --> 01:10:29,309
This is mutiny! EVE, arrest him.

571
01:10:35,591 --> 01:10:39,425
EVE, you are to put this plant
straight in the holo-detector.

572
01:10:40,129 --> 01:10:41,118
No!

573
01:10:51,407 --> 01:10:52,431

580
01:11:06,355 --> 01:11:07,947
