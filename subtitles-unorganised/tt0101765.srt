1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,713
<i>That's the star we're waiting for</i>

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,315
<i>to start Christmas Eve.</i>
<i>Do you see it?</i>

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,757
<i>And there,</i>

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,436
<i>below, the fog. Look.</i>

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,679
<i>It's not fog.</i>

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,069
<i>It's really</i>
<i>millions of little stars.</i>

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,555
<i>Show me.</i>

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,518
<i>Here's the first leaf.</i>

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,755
<i>It's springtime</i>
<i>and all the trees have leaves.</i>

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,870
<i>Look.</i>

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,599
<i>Here, on the lighter side, there are</i>
<i>little veins and a very fine down...</i>

12
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,873
THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE

13
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,999
You sing beautifully.

14
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,951
Thanks.

15
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,273
You should change.

16
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,277
Come.

17
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,676
Show me.

18
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,199
I'm ashamed of it.

19
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,153
How did it happen?

20
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,272
My girlfriend's father
slammed a car door on it

21
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,519
right after high school exams.

22
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,991
I had just passed my piano exam

23
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,793
that day.

24
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,994
I fainted.

25
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,631
Papa...

26
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,709
What are you listening to?

27
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,232
The same as always.

28
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,675
I woke up.

29
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,839
Tell Antek I have to leave.
He'll be sad.

30
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,116
And you?

31
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,191
I'm sorry Auntie's not well.

32
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,038
But I'm glad she called.

33
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,714
You want to go there?

34
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,790
Yes.

35
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,554
I like Krakow.

36
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,230
Did you ask her to call?

37
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,877
No.

38
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,152
I have a strange feeling.

39
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,591
I feel that I'm not alone.

40
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,959
Not alone, how?

41
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,636
That I'm not alone in the world.

42
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,914
You aren't.

43
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,476
I don't know.

44
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,956
What do I really want, Papa?

45
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,235
I don't know.

46
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,397
Probably quite a lot of things.

47
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,594
A blond boy?

48
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,391
Yes.

49
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,592
You've slept with him?

50
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,548
Yes.

51
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,156
Tell me.

52
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,434
The last time...

53
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,792
there was a downpour.

54
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,317
We were in a passageway.

55
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,191
I was soaked to the skin.

56
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,798
And I wanted to make love to him
right in that passageway...

57
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,156
Who's that?

58
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,795
The lawyer.

59
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,192
I have some business matters
to settle.

60
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,515
What business?

61
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,675
Legal matters.

62
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,830
Yesterday you were surprised
to find me alive.

63
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,873
Everyone in our family
died while in good health.

64
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,998
My mother, and yours also.

65
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,918
It's about my will.

66
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,276
Auntie!

67
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,510
Weronika, get up.
The lawyer is here.

68
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,432
<i>Weronika?</i>

69
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,152
Yes...

70
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,636
It's Weronika.

71
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,351
<i>My Godl You're here?</i>

72
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,356
I'm here.

73
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,989
<i>Here, in Krakow?</i>

74
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,837
Right here.

75
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,875
A week now.

76
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,230
<i>Reallyl Will you come see me?</i>

77
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,953
Of course.

78
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,030
<i>Today at rehearsal.</i>
<i>At two o'clock.</i>

79
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,109
At rehearsal?

80
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,359
Good. That's how it should sound.

81
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,674
Once more, please.

82
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,756
Thank you.
See you tomorrow.

83
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,238
Put more energy
into your playing, Marta.

84
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,839
You sing well.

85
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,877
Yes.

86
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,156
You heard me?

87
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,190
It was beautiful.

88
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,509
Thank you.

89
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,918
I'd like to audition you.
Your voice is...

90
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,353
a very unusual voice.

91
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,713
How are you feeling?

92
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,349
Fine.

93
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,550
Have a seat.

94
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,715
I don't mind standing.

95
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,553
Have a seat.

96
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,594
You have no real singing experience.

97
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,151
You only have
a high school music diploma...

98
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,911
in piano, no less!

99
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,037
Our vote was not unanimous...

100
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,109
but you are the winner

101
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,429
of this competition.

102
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,076
My congratulations.

103
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,792
You look fantastic, Auntie.

104
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,995
Really.

105
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,430
Fantastic.

106
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,272
If you had played cards all night

107
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,715
and drunk vodka,
you'd be equally beautiful.

108
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,112
How did things go?

109
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,110
Fine.

110
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,388
I'm even afraid it went too well.

111
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,991
I was wondering
if you'd notice me.

112
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,157
Were you following me a long time?

113
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,679
A long time.

114
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,677
My aunt said you had called.

115
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,878
I spoke with my father.

116
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,833
He said you were fine.

117
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,556
I'm alive.

118
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,070
I thought I would

119
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,838
bring you a present.

120
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,388
Christmas is coming.

121
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,837
I haven't called you because...

122
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,988
No, you didn't.

123
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,438
Actually, I came here
to tell you I love you.

124
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,116
I'm staying at the Holiday Inn.

125
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,712
If you want to tell me anything,
call me.

126
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,952
Room 287.

127
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,031
Antek!

128
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,198
Give me a ride home.

129
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,116
I'll call.

130
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,358
I'll call you.

131
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,269
Madame!

132
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,433
I'll come and help you.

133
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,669
Weronika...

134
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,074
Are you getting dressed?

135
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,951
Yes.

136
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,677
Yes.

137
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,155
She's dead.

138
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,631
The last time
we saw each other was...

139
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,030
At graduation.

140
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,390
Was it really?

141
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,351
Yes.

142
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,989
What's wrong?

143
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,276
Are you sad?

144
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,556
No.

145
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,591
Yes.

146
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,875
I don't know why.
It's as if I were grieving.

147
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,355
For someone?

148
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,675
I don't know.

149
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,116
I'll tell you something funny.

150
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,230
No.

151
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,350
Are you all right?

152
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,473
Can I stay a while?

153
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,751
No.

154
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,597
Veronique?

155
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,199
You've come at the wrong time
or on the wrong day.

156
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,276
Or is it my mistake?

157
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:22,957
No.

158
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,874
I came to tell you

159
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,199
that I'm quitting.

160
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,431
What?

161
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,035
I'm quitting.

162
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,470
Why?

163
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,509
I don't know.

164
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,040
But I know I have to quit... now.

165
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,157
You're wasting your talent.

166
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,750
No one has the right to do that.

167
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,594
You deserve

168
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,911
to be dragged into court.

169
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,718
Yes.
No one has the right to do that.

170
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,430
Veronique...

171
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,110
I won't see you again?

172
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,195
Excuse me...

173
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,914
I have a class in here.

174
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,474
I wasn't told.

175
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,429
Oh, I'm sorry.

176
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,669
You smell so nice.

177
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,830
You're beautiful.

178
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,231
I love your chimes.

179
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,156
Thank you.

180
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,992
Did you sleep well last night?

181
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,072
If you like, I could help you
carry the chimes home.

182
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,514
We're finishing early today.

183
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,436
Why?

184
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,073
You don't know?
The marionettes.

185
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:25,951
What?

186
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,953
I really like this piece.

187
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,470
It's by a very interesting composer.
He was discovered only recently

188
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,514
although he lived in Holland
over two centuries ago.

189
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,276
Ready?

190
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,791
One...

191
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,751
two...

192
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,997
Hello.

193
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,715
Who is it? Please answer.

194
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,631
I'll hang up.

195
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,477
<i>No.</i>

196
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,389
Then you hang up.

197
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,959
You hang up first.

198
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,676
I was sleeping.

199
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,916
I bought a milling machine. Look.

200
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,076
27,000 rotations per minute.

201
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,110
Papa...

202
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,993
I'm in love.

203
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,992
I'm really in love.

204
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,068
Do I know him?

205
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:14,791
No...

206
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,077
and neither do I.

207
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,879
I don't understand.

208
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,635
Can you explain?

209
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,431
Yes, once I understand it.

210
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,549
Not long ago,
I had a strange sensation.

211
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,830
I felt that I was alone.

212
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,229
All of a sudden.

213
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,953
Yet nothing had changed.

214
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,116
Someone disappeared from your life.

215
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,634
Yes, that's it.

216
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,399
When Mother died...

217
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,553
didn't you feel that way?

218
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,231
But something really had changed.

219
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,076
And then I had you.
You were so little.

220
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,916
I had to hold your hand.

221
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,031
Yes...

222
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,358
You held my hand.

223
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,871
My lawyer asked
five or six of his girlfriends.

224
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,514
I'm sure he had dozens,
but I only knew a few of them.

225
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,035
Of course they all refused.

226
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,273
I can't do it either, Catherine.

227
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,118
I've really thought about it...
I just can't.

228
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,869
I understand.

229
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,028
I'm sorry.

230
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,789
I understand.

231
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,428
I can do it.

232
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,397
You?

233
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,629
Why not?

234
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,071
You'll come to court?

235
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,038
You'll say, "I slept with that man

236
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,754
thirteen times last year
and also this year"?

237
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,072
I'll say it.

238
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,799
But I need to know something
about him. I don't know him.

239
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,353
You saw him once.

240
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,511
Yes.

241
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,674
But I should know what a woman knows
if she has had...

242
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,199
Make yourself at home.

243
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,118
I'm frozen. I won't stay.

244
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:30,836
Yesterday

245
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,799
you told me that...

246
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,992
you hardly noticed that man.

247
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,235
The puppeteer?

248
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,111
Yes.

249
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,634
Did you notice him?

250
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:44,831
Yes.

251
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,352
Do you remember his name?

252
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,432
His name was on the van.

253
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,951
His first name began with an "A".

254
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,351
Antoine? Alexandre?

255
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,115
I don't remember.

256
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,870
And the show...
do you remember the story?

257
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,549
A dancer...

258
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,190
A ballerina...

259
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,072
who lives in a box, wants
to dance, but breaks her leg.

260
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,558
So she turns into a butterfly.

261
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,034
Yes, but wait.

262
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,833
All along I kept feeling
I knew that story.

263
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,591
That's it!

264
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,359
I read it to Natalie.

265
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,036
He must have stolen it.
Don't move!

266
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,751
He didn't steal anything.
He wrote it.

267
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,913
Alexandre Fabbri.

268
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,317
There's also a lovely story
about a shoelace.

269
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,436
I'm sorry I got you mixed up
in all this.

270
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:08,836
All what?

271
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,195
My situation.

272
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,231
Someone told Jean-Pierre.

273
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,758
Anything for me?

274
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,309
Do you know what this is?

275
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,110
No idea.

276
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,918
It must be a box
of "Virginia" cigars,

277
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,111
an empty box.

278
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,269
You knew?

279
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,710
I guessed.

280
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,039
There's no return address.

281
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,229
It's from Paris.

282
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,316
Thank you.

283
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,996
Jean-Pierre, what are you...

284
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,319
Why are you doing it?

285
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,155
Do you want to,

286
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:23,876
really?

287
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,228
Say something.

288
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,392
Say something, at least.

289
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,756
Oh, God...

290
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,638
It's so complicated.

291
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,908
What are you doing?

292
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,199
I'm turning myself in. That's all.

293
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,396
I'm sorry.

294
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,557
Daddy...

295
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,599
I'm in the bathtub.

296
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,514
Don't touch the chairs!

297
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,350
Try this.

298
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,156
It's nice.

299
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,271
The other one was more pleasant.

300
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,794
This is from the end of autumn,
the other was from the beginning.

301
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:18,355
I don't know if people will need
this fragrance, but we'll see.

302
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,635
I'll get dressed.

303
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,950
Have you understood, at last?

304
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,799
There's a letter for you.

305
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,229
Beautiful handwriting.

306
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:53,670
Here?

307
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:55,997
No.

308
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,309
You'll stay? We'll fix lunch...

309
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,351
No, I have to go.
I have a music class.

310
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,959
I must have dreamt it.

311
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,279
I saw a drawing...

312
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,232
very simple, even naive.

313
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,593
A sloping road in a small town...

314
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,792
lined on both sides by houses...

315
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,350
with a church in the background.

316
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,070
Chagall?

317
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,319
No, not Chagall.

318
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,354
A tall, slender church,
made of red brick...

319
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,516
Stop.
Nicole, you're playing off-key.

320
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,035
Yes, I know.

321
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,628
Fine, let's start again.

322
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,391
Nicole!

323
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:16,796
Stop.

324
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,678
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

325
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,792
<i>Miss Sandrine Ekar,</i>

326
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,758
<i>please come to the reception desk</i>
<i>at gate...</i>

327
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,195
<i>Excuse me, excuse me.</i>

328
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,157
<i>Attention, please.</i>

329
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,794
<i>Train number 3316</i>

330
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,036
<i>from Cherbourg</i>

331
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,152
<i>is arriving on platform 18.</i>

332
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,235
Who's there?

333
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,874
Excuse me... is there another cafe
in this station?

334
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:21,876
Over there.

335
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,396
Can you hear the loudspeaker there?
For the train departures?

336
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,676
I don't know.
I was never there.

337
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,637
Thank you.

338
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,395
Excuse me, excuse me.

339
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,515
Would you like some tea?

340
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:56,836
Coffee.

341
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,512
Please...

342
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,675
Tea with lemon?

343
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,515
And one coffee.

344
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,116
"Stop".

345
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,757
Have you been waiting long?

346
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,669
48 hours.

347
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,309
Maybe longer.

348
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,234
It was worth it.

349
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,629
I have to apologize.

350
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,670
For what?

351
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,873
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

352
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,035
I was afraid

353
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,349
you wouldn't be here.

354
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,348
I had to be here.

355
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,470
I would have waited for you

356
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,675
two more days...

357
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:23,876
or three.

358
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,319
I wanted to be sure...

359
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,157
I wanted to see if it was possible.

360
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,749
Be sure of what?

361
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,595
Whether it was possible...

362
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,909
psychologically.

363
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,279
If what was psychologically
possible?

364
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,833
Since you're here, you must know
that I write children's books.

365
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,074
But now I want to write a book...

366
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,075
a real book.

367
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,238
In this book there's a woman...

368
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,677
a woman who responds
to the call of an unknown man.

369
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,635
So I wondered whether
that was possible.

370
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,354
Whether, psychologically, a woman...

371
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,031
Well, whether it was possible.

372
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,709
You're not saying anything?

373
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:38,790
Why me?

374
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,318
Why did you choose me?

375
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,309
Because...

376
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:48,830
I don't know.

377
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,234
Thanks for the coffee.

378
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,035
Wait, please!

379
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:05,118
Are there any rooms
facing the back? I'm exhausted.

380
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,912
Sure. What floor?

381
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,748
As long as it's quiet.

382
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,549
Number 287.
You want a wake-up call?

383
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,988
No, thank you.

384
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,029
I'm sorry.

385
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,474
Please forgive me.

386
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:50,751
For what?

387
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,589
As I was falling asleep
I saw a sheet floating down.

388
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,589
I love you.

389
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,155
I love you.

390
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,311
What else do you want to know
about me?

391
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:47,597
Everything.

392
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,749
What's this?

393
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,756
It's when I have chapped lips.

394
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,310
Shit!

395
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,392
I've been looking for those
for a year!

396
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:53,950
Veronique...

397
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:55,597
Yes?

398
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,035
I know now why

399
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,435
you were the one.

400
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,557
Yes.

401
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,754
It was not the book.

402
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,668
I knew it.

403
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:18,797
What?

404
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,831
Why you were doing it.

405
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,310
Since the first night you called me.

406
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,309
Even before that.

407
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:29,556
You knew?

408
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:32,951
Everything.

409
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,794
This may have nothing to do with it,
or it may.

410
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,197
All my life I've felt I was
in two places at the same time.

411
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,553
Here and somewhere else.

412
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:49,989
It's hard to explain.

413
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,555
But I know...

414
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,796
I always feel what I should do.

415
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:08,635
Where is this?

416
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,275
It's not in France.

417
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:15,077
That's during a trip
to Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland.

418
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,553
That must be in Krakow.

419
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,992
That's a beautiful photograph.

420
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,597
And you, in that huge coat.

421
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,635
That's not me.

422
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,149
Sure it's you.

423
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,274
That's not my coat.

424
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:45,479
Is that me?

425
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:46,915
Of course it's you.

426
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:09,956
Why...

427
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,109
Why two?

428
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,196
Because during performances
I handle them a lot.

429
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,668
They damage easily.

430
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:28,671
Try it...

431
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,668
Should I read it to you?

432
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,876
November 23, 1966

433
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,355
was the most important day
of their lives.

434
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,389
That day, at three in the morning,

435
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,194
they were both born
in two different cities,

436
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,992
on two different continents.

437
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,197
They both had dark hair
and brownish-green eyes.

438
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,879
When they were both two years old
and already knew how to walk,

439
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,715
one of them
burned her hand on a stove.

440
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:34,629
A few days later,

441
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,150
the other one reached out
to touch the stove

442
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,157
but pulled away just in time.

443
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,197
And yet, she could not have known
that she was about to burn herself.

444
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:51,676
Do you like it?

445
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,948
I think I'll call it
"The Double Life of..."

446
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,551
I haven't yet decided
what names to give them.
