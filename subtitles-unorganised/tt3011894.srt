1
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
-Hello
-Hello

2
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,700
Documents Please

3
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,900
Yes

4
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,000
Can I ask you a question?
This ticket was actually paid by a company

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Do you know if you can place the miles
Under my name?

6
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,000
No. This ticket doesn't include miles

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, well. In that case I won't ask anything

8
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,000
They are already boarding through gate 3

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thanks

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,500
I'll help you

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
All right

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,800
Work or pleasure?

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500
Both things, I hope

14
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,900
What do you do?

15
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,900
I'm a model

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Excuse me, I should've imagined

17
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,200
Thanks

18
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,000
Fashion show or advertisement

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Fashion Show

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You?

21
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
-What do you do?
-You killed me there

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,700
Why?

23
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,000
That "you" dropped me to the 5th level of hell

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I will need to fix myself right up from this

25
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm a music critic

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It sounds horrible, I know

27
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,000
No. Rock?

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,800
Now you want to fix it?

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,100
Classical music

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
My first boyfriend was a classical musician

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
In fact he studied classical music

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What's his name?

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, he is not known

34
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,000
He tried to present some works when we
were together

35
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
But as far as I know he never published

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,900
Or edited...No... How do you say it?

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You choose the term you want and I'll install it
in the artistic community

38
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,600
Pasternak. Gabriel Pasternak

39
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,000
Pasternak

40
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,300
Knowing this I would've told you I'm grave digger and not a critic

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,700
He presented his thesis in the contest of the conservatory
when I was a the president of the jury

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I kicked him out of it

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes, I was with him at the time

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It was tremendous what they did to him

45
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,000
He passed a week in bed after reading the critic

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Sometimes it's like that. I have to hurt a poor devil's self esteem

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
In order to protect the ears of a whole population

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,500
Eventually I can make mistakes, but in this case this was a...

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
An unpresentable abomination

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you still see him?

52
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,000
No, we didn't end up very well

53
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I still care for him, though

54
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,200
He wasn't a bad person

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,500
I don't know that, but to present something like that in a contest

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Some problem he has to have

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Gabriel Pasternak, how can I forget him

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We all laughed at it for months

59
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,000
Sorry I interrupt you but

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I was eavsdropping the conversation

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I can't believe so much coincidence

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I was the teacher of Gabriel Pasternak in the school #7 of Palomar

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I had the difficult task of informing him that he was repeating the year

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I can testify that the kid had problems

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,500
In thirty years of teaching I've never saw something like it

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He screamed and cried like a newborn baby

67
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
-Mrs. Leguizamón?
-Yes

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm Ignacio Fontana. Do you remember me?

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Ignacio Fontana. This is incredible

70
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,000
There's a cosmic connection here

71
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,000
-Wasn't pasternak your classmate?
-Yes

72
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,000
-Are you friends?
-Oh yes, best friends

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,900
Poor dude. We used to bully him a lot

74
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,000
This is more than incredible

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,500
I was a Home Depot manager, where this fellow that you speak of
worked for a while

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,500
Since he always had a problem with his clients I had to fire him

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
-When I...
-Sorry, someone else knows Gabriel Pasternak?

78
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,000
-Yes
-I know him
-I do

79
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,000
Why are you in this flight? Did you buy the tickets?

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I worked for real estate and they sent me to see some farms for sale

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,500
In my job they made an appointment for me to go see the
secretary of tourism

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I won it at a raffle, they said I couldn't change the date

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,400
I either flew today or nothing

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Gabriel Pasternak is the captain of this flight

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We trained together. We were friends, but when he invited me out
and I said no and he started to...

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It doesn't matter now. After we took off I gave him coffee...

88
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,000
The door is locked. The pilots are not answering. 
I'm desperate, I don't know what to do

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I cheated on him with his only friend

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
With him

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,500
Gabriel! Are you there?

92
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,500
I'm Victor Llensen, speak to me please!

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
-Who are you
-I was his psychiatrist for years

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
At some point I augmented his session time.
He got angry and he never came back

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Gabriel, listen to me

96
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
You don't have to blame yourself for anything

97
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,000
You are the victim of this situation

98
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm saying it plain and simple. The ones who ruined your life
were your parents

99
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,000
Since you were born they've been asking you for too much

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The placed on you all their frustration.
They are the responsibles of your suffering

101
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,500
All of us here, Gabriel, don't have anything to do with this

102
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Good evening, a table for one?

103
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I see you're good at math

104
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
One, yes

105
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,500
Sit wherever you want

106
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,500
The special for today is lentils with rice

107
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Sounds delicious

108
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So?

109
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Hey

110
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That guy is from my town

111
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
An usurper

112
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,000
A corrupt politician

113
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He auctioned our house

114
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And because of him my dad committed suicide

115
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Two weeks after the burial

116
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He tried to hit on my mom 

117
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,500
He stalked her so much

118
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,000
That we had to move here

119
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,000
Do you know for how long I've dreamed to have him like this?

120
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,000
In front of me

121
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I will have to and say something to him

122
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,000
Say something to him?

123
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,700
Thanks to that guy your father committed suicide

124
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,500
And the only thing you plan to do is to insult him?

125
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Why don't we put rat poison in his food?

126
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,000
There's in the back

127
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,000
A good dosis and in five minutes his heart will explode

128
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
A lot of work today?

129
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,000
Not with this rain

130
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I'm asking because I've been calling you for a while

131
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You have to look over here, darling

132
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
My apologies

133
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Do you know what are you going to order?

134
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,000
Bring my fries with eggs

135
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,500
If I'm still hungry I will ask for something else

136
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Any beverages?

137
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Diet Coke

138
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,900
Diet Coke?

139
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Diet

140
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Coke

141
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,500
Fries. With eggs

142
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Do you want me to write it for you?

143
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I hate him. I hate him

144
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,000
Make him some fries with eggs

145
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
[RAT POISON]

146
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Are you crazy?

147
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Do you want me to go to jail?

148
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,000
Jail?

149
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Do you believe the FBI is going to make an autopsy
on that prick?

150
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Fires with eggs

151
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,500
They are going to think that it was the cholesterol

152
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Can you make him the fries with eggs?

153
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Can I ask for your opinion on something?

154
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,500
Since you seem to be an atentive girl. Come here

155
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Which one do you like. This one?

156
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Or this one?

157
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'll choose the red one

158
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The red one. Wait. Wait.

159
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Do you think I look too serious in this picture?

160
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,000
No, I think it looks fine

161
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Thank you

162
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Besides jail is not that bad

163
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,000
It just has bad publicity

164
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
They give you food

165
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You don't pay rent

166
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You live with no worries

167
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,000
And if you have good group
you'll have a lot of fun

168
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You play bridge

169
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,000
You were in jail?

170
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,000
For some time

171
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And I can assure I felt more free there

172
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
This is a shithole

173
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,000
And wht did you do?

174
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Nothing that I regret

175
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Besides he is going to run for mayor

176

Wake up, girl!

179
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What do you say

180
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Do we make a favor for the community?

181
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Perfect

182

You put the rat posion!

183

Don't play like a naive girl. Tell me you
didn't noticed it

184
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's how this country runs

185

Everybody wants give this characters what they deserve
but nobody wants to move a finger

186
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,500
Feel proud about it, girl

187
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
For once in your miserable life you are
doing something worthy

188
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Hey! I'm not doing anything here

189
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
No? You keep discussing with me instead of taking away his plate?

190
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Calm down. You don't have to worry about anything

191
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,000
In the investigation I'm going to say that this morning
I was placing poison in the kitchen

192
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Because everything was full of bugs, which on the other hand
it is completely true

193
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And that coincidentally a little rock got inside a pan.
What are they going to tell me

194
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,600
This is madness

195
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Hey, this shit wasn't expired, right?

196
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It doesn't say the expiring date

197
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
How was it?

198
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,000
When a poison is expired

199
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,000
Is it more or less deadly

199
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
-Everything fine?
-Yes

200
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Sit right there

201
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,500
What will you drink, Alexis

202
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't know. A Fanta?

203
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
-What if I got heat these up a little?
-No, no, leave it there

204
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,000
If i need you to heat them up I'll ask you

208

Do we put more posion?

209

He's a kid!

210
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But he is going to grow. Like father like son

211
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's better if we finish with all the weed right now

-Excuse me, this has to be freezing by now
-No, leave it there!

216
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Who the fuck taught you to work like these
Could you let people eat in peace?

217

There was no possible way that I could know that the place
was a no-parking area

328
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I understand

329
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I see. Now, if you want to retreive the vehicle from here
You will have to pay the towing service. Ok?

330
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Later, if you want you can make a withdrawal from monday to friday,
from eight to fourteen hours

331
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
In the address Carlos Pellegrini 211, first floor

332
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Hmm. No. Do you know what we are going to do?

333
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I'm going to ask you to go and talk to whoever you have to

334
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I want to take my car without paying a penny

335
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,500
I want you to give me what I paid 
for the taxi to get here and

336
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,000
And that you give my respective apologies

335
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,000
What are you laughing about, I'm being serious

336
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Where is the office where they give you your apologies
when they make a mistake?

337
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
We are all in the same boat, sir. Hurry up, please

338
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Look. The ticket said your car
was in a no-parking zone

339
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
We don't need more proof than that.
I'll repeat again

340
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
If you want to take your car you have to pay

341
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
If that's not the case I'll ask you to leave
and let me continue working

342
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And if I don't have cash?

343
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You can pay it with credit, debit,
or you can come another day.

344
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
However, we will charge you for the car
parked here

345
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Did you know that you're a criminal?

346
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,000
-I'm doing my jobe here
-No

347
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
The ones who work for criminals are
other criminals

348
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,400
Well, it's a way of looking at it

349
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,000
Miserable public worker

350
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Of this corrupt system

351
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Thank you, have a nice day

352
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,000
We were with you when you were born

353
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
When you received your first toys

354
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
[I'M ARRIVING]

355
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
[DON'T COME, ALMOST EVERYBODY LEFT]

356
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you

357
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Happy Birthday dear Camila.
Happy Birthday to you

358
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Happy Birthday, honey

359
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Tell them to sing again

360
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,500
Don't even talk to me, Simón

361
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Hello, darling. Happy Birthday

362
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,600
Hello kids

363
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,900
How are you, Antonio

364
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Hello, dear! Everything's good

365
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
-Hello. How are you
-We were leaving

366
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Wait, I'll come with you

367
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Couldn't you take a taxi and take the car later?

368
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
-No! No!
-You missed your daughter's brithday, Simón

369
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,000
Everything is so easy for you.
I'm just tired of people taking my money

370
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
The sidewalk was absolutely unpainted!

371
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Do you have any idea of the anger this produces on me?

372
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Do you have any idea of the anger this produces on me
that you always blame everything?

373
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
That you have to blame society for everything

374
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Today it was the car. Yesterday it was the traffic.
Tomorrow will be the protest

375
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
The truth is that you were perfectly capable
of leaving earlier

376
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
You could've helped me organize the party

377
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And you would be ready to receive your daughter's guests

378
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
But no. Everything is a priority except
your family

379
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,000
-No
-And I am standing here like an idiot
Thinking that you'll change

380
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And you know what?

381
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Society will not change

382
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,500
You will not change

383
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,500
And I am tired of it

384
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
What does that mean?

385
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
The engineer here is you. 
Make the math

386
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
The goverment lets a private company
make money for nothing

387
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,000
Obviously in exchange for a payment that
we all have to choose

388
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
It's indignant, but it'ss like that

389
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And you have two choices

389
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
You either pay and work a little

390
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Or your heart explodes due to stress

391
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And you know what, man

392
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I have a lot of reasons to live

393
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,000
I want to sail.
Travel the world with my grandchildren

394
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Don't get angry

395
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
-Hello. Good morning
-Good morning

396
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
They filed this fine, and I already payed
the towing service. But there's an error

397
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,500
-Because the sidewalk was unpainted...
-Would you let me see?

398
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,000
Yes

399
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
It is 560 pesos

400
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Look. I'm a little nervous here
So I'll ask you to listen to me

401
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
The sidewalk was unpainted. I think you should
send someone to the address where they took my car

402
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,000
In order to verify that I'm right

403
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Then, ask the city's government to
forgive me, because I'm right

404
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Give me back the money I paid.
AND pay me for all the time I've been wasting

405
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
The ticket says that the car was
in a no-parking zone

406
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And that is considered enough proof

407
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
The fine is 560 pesos that you HAVE to pay

408
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
If you don't pay we will start charging interests

409
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Are you listening to me?

410
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Enough proof? Fuck off.

411
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm telling you
the curb was not painted yellow

412
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
First, I'm going to ask you
to stop insulting me

413
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Because I'm working here

414
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Second, you should inform yourself
of how the law works

415
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:20,000
The fact that you don't know the laws
does not excempt you from braking them

416
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,500
Tomorrow you kill somebody and say
"I didn't know you couldn't do that"
You'll go to jail

417
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,000
That's fine, maybe nobody explained it to you 

418
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But you still go to jail.
Is it understandable?

419
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,000
This example that you just gave wasn't
very accurate

420
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
With that criteria I should know by heart
the streets where I can park and the ones where I can't

421
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Without taking in account whether they are painted or not

422
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Exactly. The information is available in the website
of the Department of Mobile Vehicles

423
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Ok. I need to talk with your manager, please

424
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
No, there's no manager to call

425
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,500
No?

426
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,000
Who do you think you are?
The president of the country, moron?

427
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Sir, there's a lot of people

428
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,000
If you don't want to pay I'll ask you to let me work

429
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
What does it feel like to be a criminal?
Come on, tell me

430
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Security in station seven

431
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Are you calling for security? Great!

432
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I am making a claim. I am defending as a citizen
and I'm a criminal

433
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,300
You have to be behind there
and call for security

434
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,400
Do you want to call security?

435
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Call security! Call it!

436
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,600
Now call for security!

437
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Leave me!

438
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000

-My god
-How are you doing

440
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
They didn't rape you, right?

441
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
It's unbelievable. 
Really unbelievable

442
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
What a madness

443
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Seijas sent a lawyer from the company
and told him to be in charge of everything

444
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I hope he plays it good because lately...

445
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Yeah, more or less.

446
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Your name and last name appear there

447
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
[VIOLENT REACTION IN THE DMV]

448
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
They mention that you work for the firm

448
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,000
Seija's partners didn't like the shit you pulled

449
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
The city's government is one of our main clients!

450
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
They are going to cut you off, Simón

451
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,000
It has been decided

452
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I understand that at this moment you don't have a job, Mr. Fischer

453
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Yes. Why you ask?

454
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Is it a crime?

455
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I didn't say it was a crime, right?

456
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Right. But I think I perceived certain condemning tone

457
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It is not a crime, but it's a problem at the time
to be pay the living of your wife

458
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
The lawyer is talking about the living expenses of Camila
that includes clothes, school...

459
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Excuse me

460
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I've been in charge of the yearly expenses of my wife
since I know her

461
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And my daughter will not be missing anything

462
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
If I have a problem, don't worry because I'll fix it

463
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Luckily Ms. Malamut DOES have a job at the moment

464
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So we don't see the necesitty of granting Mr. Fischer
the shared expenses

465
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I'm sorry. Excuse me

466
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I've been in charge of everything for years

467
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And for a month where she has a job and I don't

468
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I don't have the right to share the expenses of my daughter?

469
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I hope the judge will take into account
how unfair this situation is

470
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,800
What the judge won't take into account is the violence
that you are using with your wife

471
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,000
WHAT violence?!

472
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I'm describing a situation.
Where do you see the violence?

473
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I see violence, Mr. Fischer.
In a lot of places

474
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I see violence in the street.
I see violence when the TV is on

475
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,000
Without going very far. I can see it
in an article of this newspaper

476
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:17,000
And I'm convinced that the less contact a small kid
can have with this type of episodes

478
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
It would be better for its psychophysical integrity

Do you want to take away my daughter?

481
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
No, it's not that

482
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Then what is it?! Are you going nuts?

483
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
All right. My client and I will end the mediation

484
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
And we will mantain silence until we see each other in Tribunales

485

You're not planning to say anything?
Who hired you. Her?

00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Mr. Fischer, calm down. Please

487
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
-Hello
-Good evening

488
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I'm Simón Fischer
I spoke with Mr. Ederer's secretary

489
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
-I'm supposed to leave my resume
-Sure, I'll give it to her

490
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I'd rather give it to her personally..

491
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
and if Mr. Ederer's here,
I'd like to have a word with him

492
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I worked for over ten years...

493
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
at Seijas Raffo Martinez and Associates

494

I'm not a rookie

495
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,000
The engineer is on a construction site

496
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
-And his secretary?
-She's out for lunch

497
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It's 4 pm

498
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I don't handle her schedule

499
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
You know what?
I won't leave you a damn thing

500
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
You can all go fuck yourselves:
you, Ederer and his secretary

501
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,000
Especially his secretary.
Everybody can go fuck themselves!

502
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Lunch at 4 pm?
They must think I'm an idiot!

503
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
The blue Chevrolet?

504
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
You are being rude, and this is completely fascist

-I have to pay first and discuss later
-Exactly

Speak!

It happened moments ago in the Libertador Avenue

A driver ran over a pregnant lady and ran away
He didn't stop to help the victim

Santiago, tell me the truth

530

What did you drink.
Did you smoke weed?

531
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
The car was not able to be identified

532
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
At this moment the police is analyzing
the security cameras

533
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:48,000
A hit and run. Another sad moment done by an
assassin in the north area of Buenos Aires

534
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Under what name is the car

-Mine
-And the adress under the car?

What di I do, what did I do

538
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
What did you do?
You ruined our lives, asshole!

539
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
-Help him, Mauricio!
-Take her away

540
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Santiago, listen to me.
I need you to answer some questions

541
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Did you have any passengers?

542
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,000
-Did you tell anybody about it?
-No

543
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Let's go see the car

544
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
It has tinted windows

545
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Do you remember if you had your windows up?

546
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
-I think so
-Please remember

547
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yes, yes I had them up

548
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Did you went out to see what happened?
Or was it a hit and run?

549
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Hit and run

550
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And where were you coming from?

551
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
From a bar, downtown

552
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Did anybody saw you come here with the car?
Friends, or any girls?

553
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I don't know, I can't remember

554
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:08,000
We were just informed that the woman and the baby
died on their way to the hospital

555
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:17,000
The police is still finding evidence

556
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And also asking different witnesses...

557
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
-Thanks a lot, Mrs.
-Please

558
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I'm really embarassed
to propose this to you,

559
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
But we've known you for years

560
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
And I feel we have this
kind of a bond

561
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Besides you are a father,
and you want the best for your family

562
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:31,000
So I think that an arrangement
like this one will help you

563
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:42,000
If you say that you took the car last night
while we were sleeping

564
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And that you drove during the accident

565
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I will place the best lawyer that will
get you out of jail as quickly as possible

566
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
With good conduct you're out in less than
year and a half

567
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
-Does it work that way?
-It does

568
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:08,000
And for that incredible favor
I'll offer you 500,000 dollars

569
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
You will never win that amount
of money with your job

570
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
You will be able to provide good education
and well-being to your family for the rest of your life

571
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
You know Santiago.

572
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
He would not survive in a jail

573
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
José, sit in the car please

574
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Grab the steering wheel with both hands

575
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Touch it as much as you can

576
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Good

577
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
You drank a glass of whisky and your boss
was sleeping

578
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
When you came to park the car like every night

579
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
You felt the need to go drive outside

580
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
If they were going to ask you about it,
what are you going to say

581
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
That you just went to check the tires

582
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Suddenly something crossed your path

583
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
You felt a bump and from then on
you don't remember anything

584
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,700
Yes

585
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
José, I can't explain how
grateful I am with you

586
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
No, don't touch each other. Please.

587
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
It's fine, Mrs.

588
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Excuse me

589
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I'm thinking that... I don't know

590
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I would like to talk it out with my wife

591
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
No. She can't know this, José.
At least for now

592
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
We can't run the risk if she talks

593
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And if she talks, the arrangement we did
finishes and you still go to jail

594
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
For lying

595
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
My darling

596
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
You two take my SUV and go to the ranch

597
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
When you pass the tollbooth look down,
and don't stop at any gas station

598
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And if you want to buy something
pay only in cash

599
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Santiago, let's go

600
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Let's go

601
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
José, sit again in the car

602
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
He sits in the back

603
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Move the sit forward

604
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
You two go to your room and go to bed

605
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Nobody knows anything about this

606
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Calm down and be quiet

607
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I'm in charge of this

608
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,500
Mauricio Pereyra Hamilton?

609
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,000
I'm his lawyer

610
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I was about to call the police.
Please, come in

611
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,000
What a horrible tragedy

612
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
About an hour ago my client heard something
in the first floor

613
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
He thought that burglars were trying to get in

614
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
When he goes down to see what happened
He finds the housekeeper

615
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Sitting in his car, drunk and in shock

616
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:48,000
Then he heard what happened in the news,
he connected everything and then he called me

617
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Mauricio Pereyra. This is the attorney
in charge of the case

618
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
-Good morning
-Good morning

619
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
And the gentlman here is José

620
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
-Hello
-He has worked for the family for...

621
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
-...15 years?
-Yes

622
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:11,000
...The husband of the victim.
Sir, what's your reaction about this?

623
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
What's my reaction about this?
How am I supposed to react

624
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Turn it off, it's unnecesary

625
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,500
...I'm only going to say one thing

626
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,000
Whoever was it is going to pay for this

627
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Can you hear me? It doesn't matter
where you hide

628
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I'm going to fi...

629
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
What happened, José?

630
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Excuse me. José. I want to remind you
that you can stay in silence

631
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I'm going to represent Mr. Torres
by request of my client

632
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
There has never been a problem
and he is the father of two sons

633
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Could you tell me the story of the accident?

634
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yes, well...

635
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I always park the car of Mr. Mauricio

636
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
And for a while I always wanted
to take the new car for a ride

637
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Run it a little, you know? The BMW

638
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
And last night

639
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I drank a little, to be honest

640
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,000
And...well. I felt excited so I went out

641
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I never imagined that something wrong could happen

642
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And I was going down Libertador Avenue, and..

643
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
And I was going a little fast, to be honest...
...Very fast

644
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And suddenly something crossed my path.
I couldn't see what was it

645
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I though it was a dog

646
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I felt a very hard bump

647
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And I got scared because I thought
I ruined Mr. Mauricio's car

648
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And I wanted to come back fast
so I could fix it before Mr. Mauricio woke up

649
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Excuse me

650
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
José, would you be kind enough to sit
in the front seat?

651
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
-Do I touch it?
-Yes, grab the steering wheel

652
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Sit back, please

653
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
-Could yo close the door?
-Sure

654
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
José. Do you ever use the rearview mirrors?

655
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Rearview mirrors? Of course!
How am I not going to?

656
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Because in that position you can
only look at the ceiling

657
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
It's a miracle that you only ran over
one person

658
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
May be they moved with the bump

659
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
All of them at once?

660
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Yeah, you may be right

661
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I would say that his car was drived
by someone taller than you

662
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Who else lives in this house?

663
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Yes. My wife and son... The dog

664
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Let the dog sleep

665
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I'd like to meet your wife and son

666
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Of course! I'll let them know that you
want to see them

667
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Do you give me permission
to make a negotiation?

668
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
How did it go?

669
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Everything's fine

670
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
He is willing to negotiate but...

671
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
it won't be cheap

672
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
How much

673
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,000
-One million
-Dollars?!

674
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
He saw how you lived and
the house you've got...

675
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
He won't ask for less

676
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
The good thing is that he will
be in charge of everything

677
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
He knows the chief of police,
most of the jury

678
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
And he would help us reinforce
our story

679
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
The one of the housekeeper?
We cannot take him out of the deal?

680
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
No, there has to be a responsible for this

681
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
There were two deaths involved and it's
in every news channel

682
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
That's fine, but I don't know if
I have that amount of money in cash

683
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
It's 1.5 million dollars!

684
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I know, and my part is also in that

685
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,400
Your part?

686
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,000
My part because I'm the person who is fixing
everything for you

687
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I pay a lot of money to your firm every year

688
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
But that is for other things, Mauricio

689
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
This is not an every-day fee

690
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I'm risking my repuation here

691
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I was about to give my SUV to your family
so they could escape

692
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I think your being inconsiderate

693
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
How much are talking

694
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,000
I don't know...

695
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Another 500,000 dollars?

696
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
If you want to call another lawyer
it's fine,

697
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
My work would be done here

698
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Go finish this

699
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Is everything fine, José?

700
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,500
Actually, no.

701
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:57,600
Why?

702
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
For two years in jail I'm going
to get the same as that lawyer?

703
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I know I'm poor, but...

704
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,000
Did you know it's very bad what you
ar doing now?

705
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Bad?

706
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
In that cas you go to jail

707
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,000
Last night I watched a cowboy's movie

708
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,500
I drank some liquor, and I was in bed by 11
like every night

709
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,000
What else do you want?

710
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And be clear because there's no time

711
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,000
The money we agreed and...

712
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
An appartment in the beach

713
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Mauricio. José

714
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Can we all have a talk?

715
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Mauricio

716
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Justice! Justice! Justice!

717
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Let's talk fast, gentlemen.

718
01:18:40,000 --> 01:10:43,200
Because we don't have a lot of time
And we don't want any misunderstandings

719
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,000
The story that you made up will not be changed

720
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,500
I will ask you and your family to testify
in a few moments...

721
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,000
So nobody goes anywhere

722
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
You'll leave here handcuffed
and with your head covered

723
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Outside we will find the news, a mob

724
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,500
They're going to ask you things.
They're going to insult you

725
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,000
-But you will not answer back
-Sure

726
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
We have to stop the rumors and let
the case go with no friction

727
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Let the jury make the sentence and
everyone's happy

728
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Mom, stop!

729
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,500
He says he wants to confess
and go out in the street

730
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,000
It's the right thing to do!

731
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Please, explain him he doesn't understand

732
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Calm down, Santiago

733
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Your mom is right

734
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Everything will be fine

735
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Could you, please, close the door
and take care of Santiago?

736
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
-Yes. Let's go.
-Don't worry, Santi.

737
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
May we continue?

738
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,500
From now on you'll be the connection
between all of us

739
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:40,000
Me and Mr. Pereyra are not going to talk again
except when he declares the facts

740
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,500
And you, José, stay away from all sort 
of communication with anyone who isn't your lawyer

741
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,000
Perfect

742
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I'm going to need some cash for
any expenses I have to pay

743
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Around 30,000 dollars

744
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
That you'll send me on monday at 
first hour of the morning

745
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I'm sorry I ask...

746
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
What would those expenses be?

747
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Outside there's the whole police

748
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
If somebody saw or heard anything
we will have to put them in the story

749
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
We have to be ready against any loose
ends this story might have

750
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:12,000
-So if everyone agrees...
-I'm sure that the money will arrive you on monday...

751
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
But it comes out of the money
we talked earlier

752
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I'm not paying one more cent

753
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Mauricio, please stop

754
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Exactly. Please stop! That's the same
thing I want to say. Please stop

755
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,760
Understand that I'm in a complicated situation

756
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:25,510
But I'm not going to let you
take my money like these

757
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:28,640
Mauricio. What the attorney is saying
is understandable

758
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:32,020
Don't let yourself go by 30,000 dollars

759
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:33,810
Then pay them yourself

760
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:35,060
Pay them from your part

761
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:40,400
Gentlemen, this is not the time for
a discussion like this

762
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,320
If you want to finish, this is the time

763
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,530
Or why doesn't it come from your part.
You'll collect from this a million dollars

764
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:48,320
And you are asking me 30,000 more
for expenses

765
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,950
Who is getting a million dollars?

766
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:56,960
No. He's right.

767
01:20:57,830 --> 01:21:01,040
The million dollars includes expenses

768
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,710
The expenses plus your part adds up
to a million

769
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:06,340
Don't touch my part, all right?

770
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:10,260
You know what, guys?

771
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,600
I'm done with this. There's no deal

772
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:17,020
No. Mauricio, what do you mean there's no deal

773
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:19,400
It's done. It's done. It's no more.

774
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,230
They'll be nothing for anyone.

775
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:22,570
Anyone!

776
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,280
Santiago!

777
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:27,530
Didn't you want to confess what you did?

778
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:30,780
Sounds perfect. Go outside and do it.

779
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:32,410
I gave you the best education.

780
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:36,870
And you always did whatever you wanted.
So now go fuck yourself!

781
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:38,120
Mauricio.

800
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:39,920
Mauricio.

801
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:43,800
Mauricio, calm down. Could we talked about it!

802
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,380
What happend? What happened?

803
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:48,090
They are all a bunch of vultures.

804
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:49,300
That happened.

805
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,300
But it's over. I did not kill anyone.

806
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:54,560
Mauricio I'm asking you, please!

807
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:00,140
We are in the heart of San Isidro
where a tragic accident happened this morning...

808
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:28,170
Mauricio.

809
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:31,220
Can you open the door? I have something important to tell you.

810
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:33,640
Mauricio.

811
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:36,350
Can we talk in a civilized way?

812
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:38,180
What's up?

813
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:42,150
It's done. We reached into an agreement
and the 30,000 dollars will be paid by all.

814
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:45,900
I don't want to hear anything else. It's over! Get out of my house.

815
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:48,610
Mauricio I remind you that there were two deaths.

816
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:52,530
If Santiago is found guilty this will cost us
a lot more.

817
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:55,410
However, José, is poor.

818
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:58,660
So who is going to pay the victims' families?

819
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:01,210
The money should go there.

820
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:04,250
This piece of garbage has a salary that
comes out of my taxes.

821
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,840
Go find out what happened.

822
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:10,630
You want to defend my son, set your fees with him.
If he can afford it, I'm fine with it.

823
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:13,380
Do what you have to do. Go talk!

824
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:17,640
Look. We already had a deal. 
A gentleman wouldn't get out of it like this.

825
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,060
I ask  for apologies if I offended you.

826
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:25,190
But since I am here, I haven't done nothing else 
but to defend your family.

827
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:27,980
I thank you a lot! You are an angel from God!

828
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,040
Will you let me talk to them?

829
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,540
To see if I can improve the situation.

830
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,880
Excuse me.

831
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:51,210
Well.

832
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:54,130
I think we have a better proposal.

833
01:23:54,590 --> 01:24:00,270
José will accept the initial 500,000
and says you should forget the appartment.

834
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:04,520
The attorney and I will share a million. The end. 
Not one more cent.

835
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:08,060
We have to do it now, Mauricio. The news is outside.

836
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:12,440
And the attorney says that he cannot delay
anymore the entrance of the police officer.

837
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:14,860
No.

838
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,580
I'll pay a million in total.

839
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:20,580
And you share it however you want.

840
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:23,540
-How come just a million? 
-It's that or nothing.

841
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:25,710
If you like it, fine. If not, go away.

842
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:30,340
If you hit the door with any other deal
and I'll denounce you for extortion.

843
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:31,800
TYou and the attorney.

844
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,350
Mr. Could yo reveal us the identity of the assassin?

845
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:43,560
At the moment nothing will be said.
The only thing I can say is that the case is practically solved.

846
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:47,100
There is one single suspect and in a few moments
he will be presented to the judge

847
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,190
Thank you very much.

848
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,280
Baldie, you are naked in every picture!

849
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:46,580
And now,

850
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,040
The time has come

851
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,880
To stand up

852
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,250
in order to receive

853
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:55,840
our dear

854
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,630
Romina and Ariel.

855
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:39,170
I'll leave you my father-in-law.

856
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:42,390
I'll watch you

857
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:44,180
I'm looking at you

858
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,680
Yes, yes

859
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,560
Thank you!

860
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:54,650
I wish you a happy evening!

861
01:26:54,650 --> 01:26:56,190


862
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,820
Everybody look at the camera.

863
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,330
Whisky.

864
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:31,330
Whisky!

865
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:32,830
Let's see a smile.

866
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:36,170
Very good. Thank you very much.

867
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:40,590
Thank You. Thank you very much.

868
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:42,590
Well, enjoy.

869
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:44,970
Romina.

870
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:46,470
Yes?

871
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:49,760
Here's a little present for you.

872
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,810
Oh, please. You didn't have to.

873
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:56,190
The gift here is that you came.

874
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:59,110
-Are you having fun?
-Everything's beautiful.

875
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:03,280
Your family is very kind and funny.

876
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,030
It's a shame the insecurity in the country

877
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:10,240
Last night some burglars robbed his wallet
without him noticing.

878
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:13,290
Oh, I can't believe it.

879
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:16,580
Sounds terrible. Oh well, little by little...

880
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:20,840
-Beautiful people. Are they friends? 
-Yes.

881
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:25,630
Okay. That's the table of the guys from the country club.

882
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:29,800
We had not seen each other for 13 years 
but met up thanks to Facebook.

883
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,220
With Facebook.

884
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:36,140
The ones in the back are college friends with their boyfriends.

885
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:38,100
Well, the ones who have. Right?

886
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:40,770
Those are ...

887
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:43,230
Coworkers of Ariel.

888
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,110
Are you having fun?

889
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,410
Yes, you?

890
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:50,450
Yes.

891
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:53,410
Everything's very ... standard.

892
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:56,410
Your so much fun

893
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:02,040
-Have fun. 
-You too.

894
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,010
Do you know a good place to learn tango?

895
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:12,140
Yeah ... No.

896
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:14,140
No, but I assure you that my cousin does.

897
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:15,850
I'll present her to you.

898
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:51,470
Hello.

899
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,240
Hello.

900
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:15,120
Hello.

901
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,790
Oh, fuck.

902
01:31:19,790 --> 01:31:21,500
What happened?

903
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:24,580
But... I'll take away the wine?

904
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:28,050
No, it's not the wine.

905
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,670
Shut up, shut up

906
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:33,510


907
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:35,600


908
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,440


909
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:23,060
Ariel, what's the name of the girl with long hair?

910
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:25,270
-Which One? 
-That one.

911
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:27,230
Your coworker.

912
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:32,360
Lourdes.

913
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,240
Why?

914
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,740
No. No.

915
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:42,160
And how does Lourdes knows your guitar teacher?

916
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:46,210
What, my guitar teacher?

917
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:53,510
When I asked you a couple of months ago about this number,
you said it was your guitar teacher.

918
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:56,050
Since I found it strange I saved the number.

919
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:59,350
And it's weird that when I call him this girl, Lourdes, answers.
Right?

920
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:04,850
-I have no idea what you're talking about. 
-You don't know what I'm talking about?

921
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:06,600
About that, Ariel

922
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,310
That with all the celular companies that exist

923
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:13,990
And all the promotions they have, it's weird that this girl
has the same telephone number as your guitar teacher.

924
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:16,650
Especially if they have never met

925
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:18,740
Isn't it an incredible coincidence?.

926
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,580
-So?
-What?

927
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:25,370
Give me an answer, or otherwise I'll go ask her.

928
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:27,330
-Romi, please ... 
-"Romi" Fuck off!

929
01:33:27,330 --> 01:33:29,210
Answer my question.

930
01:33:30,630 --> 01:33:31,670
Ariel

931
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:35,010
Does the entire table 27 knows that you've fucked that girl?

932
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:40,010
Did you invite all those assholes to our marriage? What did you do?

933
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:42,510
Sorry to interrupt.

934
01:33:42,510 --> 01:33:45,430
Would allow me a dance with the prince?

935
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:47,060
Of course. My queen!

936
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:49,270
Here is your prince.

937
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:56,400
What happened?

938
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:07,500
Romi, are you okay?

939
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:12,250
What happened?

940
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,550
One second, please.

941
01:34:17,090 --> 01:34:18,340
Romi.

942
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:22,600
Baldie, would you let me one more dance?

943
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:34,360
My love.

944
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:37,110
Honey, stop it.

945
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:38,820
Let's enjoy the party.

946
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:43,660
Were you with that bitch?

947
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,710
Please, I beg you!

948
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:51,080
I need to know!

949
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,130
Yes, I was.

950
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:03,550
But for me it meant absolutely nothing.

951
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:08,430
Romi, please don't make a scene in front of everyone.

952
01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:11,060
I was stupid. I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

953
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:12,350
I want to be alone.

954
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,200
-What's up? 
-Did you see her?

955
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,740
You are asking me?

956
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:24,840
Are you all right?

957
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:31,770
Should I call someone?

958
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:37,940
But are you okay?

959
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,740
Obviously you're not.

960
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:43,990
No.

961
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,660
Calm down, what happened?

962
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:52,370
I just learned that my husband is cheating on me with another guest.

963
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:53,710
Oh, that's bad.

964
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:57,420
And now I don't know what to do.

965
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:00,210
With all the people there.

966
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:03,880
Relax, these things happen.

967
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:05,550
They're overcomed with time.

968
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:07,220
Here.

969
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:12,640
If you want him, on the long run you'll be able to forgive him.

970
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:16,900
-If hee is your husband. 
-No, I do not know if he is what I want.

971
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,400
I don't know if he's my man.

972
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,570
He is an asshole.

973
01:37:24,570 --> 01:37:25,780
Oh, well.

974
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:28,240
In that case take the opportunity.

975
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:32,200
And th guests? Well, don't feel like you were the first ont to be cheated on.

976
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:36,370
Also, if you are going to care so much of what others say then ...

977
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:38,630
You're done, darling

978
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:43,000
Are we cool?

979
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:46,050
Look.

980
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:49,340
If I was you I go there.

981
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:52,510
I accelerate everything so the party finishes early,

982
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:55,230
and then, the next night at home,

983
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:58,140
you break up with him. What happened to you is terrible.

984
01:37:58,350 --> 01:37:59,690
I will not deny it.

985
01:38:01,150 --> 01:38:02,570
But you must move forward.

986
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:07,360
Better?

987
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:24,810
Romina?

988
01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:29,530
You leave right now from here and you don't say a word!

989
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:32,110
You don't have any idea of who you are dealing with!

990
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:35,280
I'll get every cent from you,

991
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:41,040
I'll get every single property that your father has bought for you
 in order to evade the Treasury.

992
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,290
We are married,

993
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,710
Legally married.

994
01:39:44,710 --> 01:39:49,460
I will dedicate my days to sleep with every person who gives a minimum shit about me.

995
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:52,180
With whoever who gives me athe most little gram of love.

996
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:54,470
And when you want to have a divorce,

997
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:56,140
I'll take acting classes

998
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:58,930
to sit in front of the judge with a puppy face,

999
01:39:58,930 --> 01:40:01,430
and tell him that I'm fighting, I'm struggling.

1000
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:04,310
That way our marriage is prolonged indefinitely.

1001
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,610
I will divulge all your secrets through Facebook,

1002
01:40:07,610 --> 01:40:11,150
I'll put my finger in the cut and stir it until cry you of pain.

1003
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,990
You'll go through so many humiliations,

1004
01:40:13,990 --> 01:40:18,280
that your only escape will be throw yourself off the balcony.

1005
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:21,120
And then, when death do us part,

1006
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:24,040
when YOUR death do us part,

1007
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,460
I'm getting with everything.

1008
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:29,840
Ariel!

1009
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,670
Ariel, calm down.

1010
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:33,970
Come on, skinny.

1011
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:36,640
Go, go.

1012
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,720
Ariel.

1013
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:58,490
Bitch! Where were you? Everything's okay?

1014
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:16,470
Bring me down, assholes!

1015
01:41:16,590 --> 01:41:19,430
Idiots! Are you listening?!

1016
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:21,890
Get me off!

1017
01:41:24,270 --> 01:41:27,350
Get me off!

1018
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:29,270
What is he saying?

1019
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:33,230
-Ariel, watch out. 
-Fuck you!

1020
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:43,830
Asshole!

1021
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:51,880
Bring me down!

1022
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,680
Are you already leaving?

1023
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:49,890
Please, no. Come.

1024
01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:52,730
-No, it's ... 
-Seriously, everything's fine

1025
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:54,360
Come with me, Lour.

1026
01:43:05,370 --> 01:43:07,250
Please stop. I'm getting dizzy.

1027
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:09,620
This is great!

1028
01:43:10,370 --> 01:43:11,920
Stop it! Seriously!

1029
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:15,380
Did you used to go to our club, or were you younger.

1030
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:18,880
Did you know that they closed it because
someone got kicked there?.

1031
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:33,270
She threatened him saying she was going to get everything
up to his last property.

1032
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:35,980
...Yes, it's better.

1033
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:37,980
I'm deeply sorry for what happened.

1034
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:40,530
However, the party was wonderful.

1035
01:43:41,530 --> 01:43:42,860
Excuse me, please.

1036
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:45,120
Most of wounds are superficial.

1037
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:46,740
They will heal well.

1038
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:50,79o
However, we will still take to ensure that she did not cut any tendons.

1039
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:52,960
Does she have a good insurance company?

1040
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:55,880
Romina, Please ...

1041
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:57,880
Go back to the hall!

1042
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:00,670
I'm just wondering if she has a good insurance company.

1043
01:44:00,670 --> 01:44:01,880
Sounds good. Stay inside!

1044
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:08,260
I'm fine.

1045
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:13,140
Romi, dear. Are you okay?

1046
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:16,150
Yeah yeah. Stay calm.

1047
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:22,150
What if we use this hole for the cake?

1048
01:44:33,870 --> 01:44:37,290
Come on, girls. Do not leave me standing like this.

1049
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:38,750
Come on, girls.

1050
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:40,670
Come on, girls.

1051
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:47,180
I had a very shitty moment but now I want to enjoy
my marraige.

1052
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:51,140
I do not think I'll get married again.

1053
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,350
Ready?

1054
01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:57,150
Romi.

1055
01:44:58,650 --> 01:45:01,360
Oh my God, Mili. You?

1056
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,530
I can't believe it.

1057
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:05,950
A picture with Mili.

1058
01:45:05,950 --> 01:45:07,240
Picture.

1059
01:45:12,950 --> 01:45:14,710
Do you want to marry Mili?

1060
01:45:14,710 --> 01:45:16,830
Oh, no, Romi!

1061
01:45:17,630 --> 01:45:20,300
Let's show that everything here is a lie,

1062
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:22,590
but that the ring is true.

1063
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:24,880
Wouldn't it be great?

1064
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,180
Romi, stop

1065
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:29,890
Kiss her! Kiss her!

1066
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:31,640


1067
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:33,430


1068
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:35,270
-Romina. 
-Yes?

1069
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:39,520
Now comes the bouquet and the Rio carnival ...

1070
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:41,520
I don't know if you want to continue or...

1071
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:42,940
Suspend it.

1072
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:44,440
End it.

1073
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:47,490
But why? Why are you being so bitter?

1074
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:49,320
Girls, here it goes!

1075
01:45:51,450 --> 01:45:54,200
We are also missing the pastrami, right?

1076
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:55,910
You know how much did it cost?

1077
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:57,790
Say the truth, Ariel.

1078
01:45:57,790 --> 01:46:02,250
We argued for a whole week about the hot pastrami.

1079
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:05,510
We decided to pay for it and now I want to eat it. Is it possible, sir?

1080
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:07,880
Romina. Stop!

1081
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:09,720
Let the people go home.

1082
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:11,890
Isn't it a stupid thing what you are doing now?

1083
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:15,850
To give you an idea, my family lawyer says we should sue you for threats you made.

1084
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:27,400
Don't tell me this was a plan from your mom.

1085
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:29,990
Romina, seriously. Cut it.

1086
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:32,870
Your mom is a real ...

1087
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:35,910
-wedding planner.
-Stop it!

1088
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:39,830
What did I do to you?!

1089
01:46:40,170 --> 01:46:43,340
I didn't do anything compared to what you're doing to me!

1090
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:52,800
Dear.

1091
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:56,470
Please, I ask you to stay calm.

1092
01:46:56,470 --> 01:46:57,560
Please.

1093
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:02,900


1094
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:05,730
Oh my God ...

1095
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:09,740
Shoot this, Néstor.

1096
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:13,830
Nestor, shoot this please.

1097
01:47:15,370 --> 01:47:17,000
You too, come.

1098
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:19,830
Shoot, please.

1099
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,250
If I get married again,

1100
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:28,880
If I get a guy who's worth it,

1101
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:33,340
I'll put this as a blooper on the big screen.

1102
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:35,340
No...

1103
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:38,600
I'll even watch this with my kids.

1104
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:42,690
Instead of fucking Dora The Explorer, I'll put this video.

1105
01:47:44,730 --> 01:47:46,270
I know!

1106
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:50,490
I'll put in those electronic portraits that go on a loop

1107
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:51,990
all day.

1108
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:58,410


1109
01:47:58,410 --> 01:47:59,410
Get your hands off my daughter, bitch!

1110
01:47:59,410 --> 01:48:01,330
You better get the fuck away

1111
01:48:01,330 --> 01:48:02,540
I'm here to help, Baldie!

1112
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:06,090
Leave her

1113
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:11,590
Darling, are you okay?

1114
01:48:46,290 --> 01:48:47,670
Doctor!

1115
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:53,510
Take care of the lady, please. You deal with the gentleman.

1116
01:48:53,510 --> 01:48:54,930
What did he drink?

1117
01:48:54,930 --> 01:48:57,800
Nothing. Emotional shock.

1118
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:00,640
Can you walk?

1119
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:03,060
-Here, over here. 
-Hello, Romina.

1120
01:49:03,690 --> 01:49:06,980
I'm going to ask you to calm down. I'm going to take your pressure, okay?

1121
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:09,320
Romina

1122
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:10,900


1123
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:12,490
Sit here.

1124
01:49:12,490 --> 01:49:14,280
Can you take his blazer off, please.

1125
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:17,700
Take a sit, Romina

1126
01:49:18,370 --> 01:49:19,910
Sit down

1127
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:25,790
Are you okay? Don't worry, Calm down.

1128
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:28,880
Romina.

1129
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:31,710


1130
01:49:32,170 --> 01:49:34,090
Can I bother you with a glass of water?

1131
01:49:34,090 --> 01:49:35,550
Yes, please.

1132
01:49:36,130 --> 01:49:38,890
Oh, no. Romi, no.

1133
01:49:38,890 --> 01:49:41,680
Don't worry, Romi

1134
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:03,660
Wait, Ariel

1135
01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:08,000
Calm down, Ariel.

1136
01:50:09,290 --> 01:50:10,630
Quiet, quiet.

1137
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,140
Nothing happened, we're fine.

1138
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:27,270
-Quiet. 
-It's okay.

1139
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:41,700
Let him be

1140
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:55,460
Stop, Ariel. Stop.

1141
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:56,590
No! Ariel!
