1
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:28,205
They say Japan was made
by a sword.

2
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:33,528
They say the old gods dipped
a coral blade into the ocean...

3
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:38,289
...and when they pulled it out, four
perfect drops fell back into the sea...

4
00:00:38,453 --> 00:00:41,763
...and those drops became
the islands of Japan.

5
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:47,611
I say Japan was made
by a handful of brave men...

6
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,528
... warriors willing to give their lives...

7
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:54,287
...for what seems to have become
a forgotten word:

8
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:56,847
Honor.

9
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:53,202
Ladies and gentlemen:
Winchester.

10
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:55,841
America's leader in all forms
of armament used. . .

11
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:57,492
. . .by the United States Army. . .

12
00:01:57,653 --> 00:02:02,363
. . .celebrates our nation's centennial
by bringing you a true American hero.

13
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:07,408
One of the most decorated warriors
this country has ever known.

14
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:10,212
Winner of the Medal of Honor
for his gallantry. . .

15
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:12,523
. . .on the hallowed ground
of Gettysburg.

16
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:13,921
San Francisco, 1 876

17
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:16,812
He is late of the 7th Cavalry. . .

18
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:20,932
. . .and their triumphant campaign against
the most savage of the lndian nations.

19
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:25,251
Ladies and gentlemen,
l present to you:

20
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:28,412
Captain Nathan Algren!

21
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:39,371
Captain Nathan Algren!

22
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:41,287
Yes!

23
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,681
Yes!

24
00:02:44,173 --> 00:02:46,607
One moment,
ladies and gentlemen.

25
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,448
Goddamn you, Algren,
get out there!

26
00:02:51,613 --> 00:02:55,652
This is your last performance!
You're fired! Now get out there!

27
00:02:57,173 --> 00:02:59,607
Come on! l'm sick of this!

28
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,041
Come on!

29
00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:03,521
Yes!

30
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:14,089
My thanks, Mr. McCabe,
you are too kind.

31
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:18,572
This, ladies and gents. . .

32
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:21,691
. . .is the gun that's winning the West.

33
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:24,890
Why, many's the time
l've found myself. . .

34
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:29,930
. . .surrounded by a swarm of. . .

35
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,969
. . .angry hostiles. . .

36
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:36,693
. . .with nothing but this rifle. . .

37
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:41,324
. . .between me and a certain
and gruesome death.

38
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:44,646
And let me tell you, folks,
the red man. . .

39
00:03:45,453 --> 00:03:47,728
. . .is a fearsome enemy.

40
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:49,611
And if he'd had his way. . .

41
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:52,970
. . .why, this scalp of mine
would be long gone. . .

42
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:56,569
. . .and there'd be a balder man
standing before you today.

43
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:04,686
Like those poor bastards out there. . .

44
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:07,364
. . .on the Little Bighorn.

45
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,449
Bodies stripped bare. . .

46
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,405
. . .mutilated.

47
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:18,008
Left to rot in the sun.

48
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:26,249
This, ladies and gentlemen,
the 73 lever-action. . .

49
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:28,165
. . .Trapper.

50
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:32,731
lt's got a seven-shot capacity. Accurate
400 yards, one round per second.

51
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,131
Son, have you ever seen
what this could do to a man?

52
00:04:36,293 --> 00:04:39,046
This would blow a hole
in your daddy six inches wide.

53
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,487
That's right, missy.

54
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:42,452
This beauty.

55
00:04:42,613 --> 00:04:46,925
You could kill yourself five, six, seven
braves without ever having to reload.

56
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:50,802
Note the patented loading port
and the smooth cocking action.

57
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:09,967
My thanks on behalf
of those who died. . .

58
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:13,603
. . .in the name of better
mechanical amusements. . .

59
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:16,004
. . .and commercial opportunities.

60
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:19,533
Mr. McCabe here will take your orders.

61
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,923
God bless you all.

62
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:32,490
l must say, captain, you have a flair
for the old melodrama.

63
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:35,850
-You're alive.
-l am, indeed.

64
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:39,922
Your man Custer says to me,
''We're going to the Little Bighorn. ''

65
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:43,369
Says l, ''What's this 'we' stuff?''
lt's the walking ticket for me.

66
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:46,206
Nine lives l have.
But l'll tell you what else l have.

67
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:48,284
l have a good job for the both of us.

68
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:51,013
God knows it looks
as if you'll need one real soon.

69
00:05:51,173 --> 00:05:53,129
What kind of a job?

70
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:57,889
The only job you're fit for, boyo.
A man's job.

71
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:02,728
Unless, of course, you got your heart
set on a career in the theater.

72
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:08,206
Nathan!

73
00:06:08,373 --> 00:06:10,568
Just listen to what
your man has to say.

74
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,644
Been a while.
lt's good to see you.

75
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:15,647
l'd like you to meet
Mr. Omura from Japan. . .

76
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:19,488
. . .and his associate, whose name
l've given up trying to pronounce.

77
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:20,881
Sit down, please.

78
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,681
Whiskey.

79
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:33,082
Now, Japan's got it in mind
to become a civilized country.

80
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:36,006
And Mr. Omura here is willing
to spend what it takes. . .

81
00:06:36,173 --> 00:06:38,733
. . .to hire white experts
to train their army.

82
00:06:38,893 --> 00:06:40,804
And if we play our cards right. . .

83
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:44,443
. . .the Emperor grants the U.S.
exclusive rights to supply arms.

84
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:53,929
Well, l have an agreement
with Winchester Company.

85
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:57,244
l'm certain Mr. Omura has some concept
of what an agreement is.

86
00:06:57,453 --> 00:07:02,607
Your performances for the Winchester
Company bring you $25 a week.

87
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:05,333
We will pay you $400 a month.

88
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:12,561
Five. For each.

89
00:07:13,253 --> 00:07:17,041
And another 500
when we get the job done.

90
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:21,892
How many other genuine heroes
you got lined up?

91
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:24,965
He's rude.

92
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:28,284
That's how it is here.
A land of cheap traders.

93
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:29,921
Whiskey.

94
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:32,846
So who will we be training
your boys to fight?

95
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:37,411
His name is Katsumoto Moritsugu.
He was once the Emperor's teacher.

96
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:40,608
-He's Samurai.
-Samurai?

97
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:43,003
The word you might use is ''warrior. ''

98
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:46,609
Mr. Omura is familiar with our
experiences dealing with renegades.

99
00:07:46,773 --> 00:07:48,604
ls he?

100
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:50,365
He's even read your book.

101
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:52,569
Captain Algren's study of the tribes. . .

102
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,531
. . .was a crucial factor
in our defeat of the Cheyenne.

103
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:10,807
Please excuse. What is funny?

104
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:17,290
The corps back together again.
lt's just so. . .

105
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:20,367
. . .inspiring!

106
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,771
Excuse me.

107
00:08:29,613 --> 00:08:32,081
l need to use the necessities.

108
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:38,405
This isn't a problem.
l'll just talk to him for a minute.

109
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:40,006
Colonel Bagley.

110
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:43,609
We contacted you because you are
Captain Algren's superior officer. . .

111
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:46,122
. . .and you assured us
of his participation.

112
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:49,410
He'll do it.
l just need a minute.

113
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:53,172
Nathan.

114
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:57,766
l did what l was ordered
to do out there.

115
00:08:58,253 --> 00:08:59,732
And l have no remorse.

116
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:03,602
So, what do you say we
put the past behind us?

117
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:10,370
You want me to kill Jappos,
l'll kill them.

118
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,445
-l'm not asking you to kill anybody.
-You want me to kill their enemies. . .

119
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:15,092
. . .l'll kill their enemies.

120
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:18,810
Rebs or Sioux or Cheyenne. . . .

121
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:22,329
For 500 bucks a month,
l'll kill whoever you want.

122
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,809
But keep one thing in mind. . .

123
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:29,046
. . .l'd happily kill you for free.

124
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:46,687
July 1 2th, 1 87 6.

125
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,321
There is some comfort
in the emptiness of the sea.

126
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:53,769
No past, no future.

127
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:59,732
And then at once, I am confronted by
the hard truth of present circumstances.

128
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:07,723
I have been hired to help suppress
the rebellion of yet another tribal leader.

129
00:10:07,893 --> 00:10:11,488
Apparently, this is the only job
for which I am suited.

130
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:17,487
I am beset by the ironies of my life.

131
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:52,564
Yokohama Harbor, 1 876

132
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:27,088
-Captain Algren, l presume?
-Yes.

133
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,608
Jolly good. How do you do?
Simon Graham.

134
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:33,124
Twenty years ago,
this was a sleepy little town.

135
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,567
Now look at it.

136
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:37,805
You see, the Emperor is mad
for all things Western. . .

137
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:40,885
. . .and the Samurai believe
it's changing too fast.

138
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:44,011
The ancient and the modern
are at war for the soul of Japan.

139
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:47,051
So your new employer, Mr. Omura,
is bringing in. . .

140
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:49,329
. . .every Western expert he can get.

141
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:53,247
Lawyers from France, engineers from
Germany, architects from Holland. . .

142
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,689
. . .and now, of course,
warriors from America.

143
00:11:56,853 --> 00:12:01,244
l came over with the British
trade mission, oh, years ago.

144
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:03,210
l was soon relieved of my position.

145
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:05,841
l had an unfortunate tendency
to tell the truth. . .

146
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:08,686
. . .in a country where no one ever
says what they mean.

147
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:13,051
So now, l very accurately translate
other people's lies.

148
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:21,165
For 2000 years, no emperor
was even seen by a commoner.

149
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:25,724
You have to realize what an honor this
is. lt's all highly ritualized, of course.

150
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:28,646
You may look at him,
but do not speak unless spoken to.

151
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:32,647
lf he stands, you must bow.
lf he bows, you must bow lower.

152
00:12:32,813 --> 00:12:35,725
Do l look presentable?
l haven't worn this in a decade.

153
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:38,923
Rather snug around the midriff.

154
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,245
And bow.

155
00:12:56,493 --> 00:12:59,291
The divine Emperor Meiji
bids you welcome.

156
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:02,570
He is grateful for the assistance
your country offers.

157
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:05,681
We hope to accomplish
the same national harmony. . .

158
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:08,162
. . .you enjoy in your homeland.

159
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:18,491
The Emperor is most interested
in your American lndians. . .

160
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:20,962
. . .if you have fought
against them in battle.

161
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,125
We have, Your Highness.
The red man is a brutal adversary.

162
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:34,363
The Emperor wishes
to ask Captain Algren. . .

163
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:37,127
. . .if it is true they wear eagle feathers. . .

164
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:40,205
. . .and paint their faces
before going into battle. . .

165
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:42,489
. . .and that they have no fear.

166
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:47,205
They are very brave.

167
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:56,886
Bow.

168
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:08,008
Thank you very much.

169
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:21,166
And step back.

170
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:26,565
Step back, step back and turn.

171
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,802
Right, you little bastards!

172
00:14:31,973 --> 00:14:35,488
You will stand up straight
or l will personally shit-kick. . .

173
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:39,009
. . .every Far Eastern buttock
that appears before my eyes!

174
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,726
Well done, sergeant.

175
00:14:42,893 --> 00:14:45,965
When you understand the language,
everything falls into place.

176
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:48,853
The first rank will kneel,
rifles at the ready.

177
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:51,321
The second rank. . . .

178
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:54,371
July 22nd, 1 87 6.

179
00:14:55,173 --> 00:14:59,564
For six months ' work, I am to receive
three years of captain 's pay...

180
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,247
... teaching Orientals to soldier.

181
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:06,284
They are an army of conscripts.

182
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:09,331
Most of them are peasants
who have never even seen a gun.

183
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,051
Fire!

184
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:15,530
They are led by General Hasegawa,
a man of small stature...

185
00:15:15,693 --> 00:15:18,366
... who nonetheless commands
enormous respect.

186
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:22,367
What can the general tell me about
this man, this Samurai, Katsumoto?

187
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,603
He seems to have great knowledge
of Katsumoto and his rebellion.

188
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:33,207
I will count on his help
when facing the Samurai.

189
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:35,125
Who supplies their weapons?

190
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,282
Katsumoto no longer dishonors himself
by using firearms, you see.

191
00:15:46,973 --> 00:15:48,372
He uses no firearms?

192
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:51,331
To those who honor the old ways,
Katsumoto is a hero.

193
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:53,172
How well does he know him?

194
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,450
The general and Katsumoto
fought together for the Emperor.

195
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:57,966
He fought with the Samurai?

196
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:01,721
He is Samurai.

197
00:16:08,213 --> 00:16:11,091
You must understand.
Katsumoto pledged his sword. . .

198
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:12,481
. . .to defend the Emperor.

199
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:15,167
They say that a Samurai's sword
is his soul.

200
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,971
Samurai are paradoxical.

201
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,966
l've tried to write about them,
but they keep to themselves.

202
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:22,567
The bastards are still wearing armor.

203
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,770
When the lrish were comporting
themselves in loincloths. . .

204
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:29,005
. . .these chaps were the most
sophisticated warriors on Earth.

205
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:31,209
l need information
on their battle tactics.

206
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:34,405
l have several more books
just waiting to be translated.

207
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:36,643
He'll be speaking the lingo in no time.

208
00:16:36,813 --> 00:16:38,804
You should hear him blather on
in Blackfoot.

209
00:16:38,973 --> 00:16:40,406
Really?

210
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:43,246
A fellow linguist? Oh, capital!

211
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:46,530
Come on, sir.
A word or two in the savage tongue.

212
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:50,083
Just ''hello'' or ''goodbye'' or--
No, no, no!

213
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:52,608
''Cut his tongue out
and boil him in oil. ''

214
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:56,963
Early day tomorrow, captain.

215
00:16:57,133 --> 00:17:00,808
-lt's about bedtime, isn't it?
-l always had a fascination with scalping.

216
00:17:00,973 --> 00:17:03,692
l never quite understood
its technique.

217
00:17:08,613 --> 00:17:12,845
lmagine someone who hates you
with the utmost intensity. . .

218
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:17,809
. . .grabbing a handful of your hair while
you're lying prostrate and helpless. . .

219
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,803
. . .and scraping a dull blade
of a rusty knife around your scalp. . .

220
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:29,168
. . .with a saw-like motion.

221
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:34,723
And let your imagination grasp, if you
can, the effect of a strong, quick jerk. . .

222
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,210
. . .on the turf of your hair
to release any clinging particles. . .

223
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:42,012
. . .would have on your nervous system.

224
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:49,602
And you'll have some idea
of how it feels to be scalped. . .

225
00:17:49,773 --> 00:17:52,128
. . .Mr. Graham.

226
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,484
How soon can you
translate those books?

227
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:03,525
Right away.

228
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:08,883
l'm just delighted you're taking
such an interest in Samurai.

229
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:12,329
l don't give a damn about the Samurai.
l want to know my enemy.

230
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:15,769
l shall not sleep until it is done.

231
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:19,845
Sake.

232
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:22,245
l bid you good night.

233
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:24,481
Can l get you anything?

234
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:26,609
This is a punitive expedition, captain.

235
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,810
Col. Bagley, these people had
nothing to do with the raids!

236
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:32,487
-Good night, sir.
-Quietly now, boys.

237
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:17,522
Fire!

238
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:29,844
We should be grateful they're all firing
in the same direction.

239
00:19:30,013 --> 00:19:32,163
Couldn't have put it better myself, sir.

240
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:38,646
Rifle butt, against the shoulder.

241
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,688
Eye, down the sight.

242
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:44,492
Now, slowly. . . .

243
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:50,726
Well done.

244
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:53,486
Nathan!

245
00:19:57,253 --> 00:20:00,325
Katsumoto's attacked a railroad
at the border of his province.

246
00:20:00,493 --> 00:20:03,530
We cannot govern a country
in which we cannot travel freely.

247
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:04,921
He must be stopped now.

248
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:08,563
My railroad is a priority
for this country.

249
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:09,961
They're not ready.

250
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:13,762
The rebels don't have any rifles.
They're savages with bows and arrows.

251
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:17,443
Whose sole occupation for the last
thousand years has been war.

252
00:20:17,613 --> 00:20:21,208
You have superior firepower
and a larger force.

253
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:24,766
l am ordering the regiment
to move against Katsumoto.

254
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,130
You will track him down
and engage him.

255
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:32,761
Load.

256
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:36,164
Mr. Graham!
Tell this man to fire at me!

257
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,689
-l beg your pardon?
-Tell this man. . .

258
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:43,243
. . .if he does not shoot me,
l will kill him!

259
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:47,364
-Captain, if l might have a word.
-Tell him!

260
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:50,411
Tell him!

261
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,771
Load!

262
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:03,205
Load!

263
00:21:06,173 --> 00:21:07,322
Faster!

264
00:21:08,573 --> 00:21:09,801
Faster!

265
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:16,483
Shoot me, damn it.

266
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,405
Fire!

267
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:25,521
Fire!

268
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:52,241
They're not ready.

269
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:57,442
The regiment leaves at 6 a.m. !

270
00:22:27,253 --> 00:22:31,007
A thousand miles of rail track laid
in less than two years.

271
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:32,765
lt's astonishing.

272
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:34,924
And Omura owns all of it?

273
00:22:35,093 --> 00:22:37,971
As soon as he can get rid
of the Samurai, he will, yes.

274
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:40,567
How do you intend
to find Katsumoto?

275
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:45,090
Don't worry, Mr. Graham.
l assure you, he'll find us.

276
00:22:55,653 --> 00:22:56,881
Move into position!

277
00:22:57,053 --> 00:22:58,281
Yoshino Province, 1 876

278
00:22:58,453 --> 00:23:00,683
1 st Company,
form a battle line on me!

279
00:23:00,853 --> 00:23:02,764
Pay attention,
it will save your life!

280
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:05,447
2nd Company,
form on 1 st Company.

281
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:07,843
3rd and 4th Company,
form up behind.

282
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,492
Fill in on command!

283
00:23:09,653 --> 00:23:13,328
-Where's Hasegawa?
-He refuses to fight against Katsumoto.

284
00:23:16,253 --> 00:23:18,084
-Cover down!
-Captain Algren.

285
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,652
We are not here as combatants.

286
00:23:20,813 --> 00:23:23,327
-Then who's gonna lead them?
-Their own officers.

287
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:26,166
-Let's move to the rear.
-We'll be there presently.

288
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:27,806
Fix bayonets!

289
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:36,091
-Mr. Graham, accompany me to the rear.
-Yes, of course.

290
00:23:40,493 --> 00:23:45,408
Sergeant Gant, report to the rear and see
to the disposition of the supply trains.

291
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:48,321
-Did you hear my order?
-l did indeed, sir!

292
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,723
Then you will obey it. Now!

293
00:23:50,893 --> 00:23:54,124
No disrespect intended, sir,
but shove it up your ass.

294
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:01,761
-Load!
-Load!

295
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:29,641
Samurai come.

296
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:32,761
You'll be fine, son.

297
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:52,528
-Assume firing positions!
-Assume firing positions!

298
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:07,882
Fire on my order only!

299
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:30,092
Hold your fire!

300
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:32,692
Hold your fire!

301
00:25:38,853 --> 00:25:40,411
Reload!

302
00:25:44,613 --> 00:25:46,205
Hold the line!

303
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:49,571
Fire at will!

304
00:26:05,053 --> 00:26:06,406
Lieutenant, fall back!

305
00:26:48,013 --> 00:26:49,366
Zeb!

306
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:27,364
He's mine.

307
00:28:53,413 --> 00:28:54,766
Stop!

308
00:29:02,093 --> 00:29:03,765
Take him away!

309
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:06,892
What is your name?

310
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,805
lnsolent swine! Answer!

311
00:31:23,093 --> 00:31:25,004
Leave him be.

312
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:35,411
This is my son's village.

313
00:31:35,573 --> 00:31:39,122
We are deep in the mountains and
winter is coming. You cannot escape.

314
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,851
Jolly good.

315
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:44,807
My Lord, why do you spare
the barbarian?

316
00:33:45,213 --> 00:33:47,443
He is shamed in defeat.

317
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:49,931
He should kill himself.

318
00:33:50,093 --> 00:33:52,288
That is not their custom.

319
00:33:56,613 --> 00:33:58,012
Then. . .

320
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:00,171
. . .l will kill him.

321
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:01,847
Father. . . .

322
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:03,731
l don't think. . . .

323
00:34:06,093 --> 00:34:07,446
Ujio. . .

324
00:34:07,773 --> 00:34:10,412
. . .there will be plenty of killing to come.

325
00:34:10,813 --> 00:34:12,132
For now. . .

326
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:14,932
. . .we will learn about our new enemy.

327
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:17,204
Keep him alive.

328
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:26,932
He's in bad shape.

329
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,561
Sake.

330
00:34:31,173 --> 00:34:32,652
Sake?

331
00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:35,009
Sake.

332
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:43,321
Sake.

333
00:34:43,573 --> 00:34:45,291
Taka will take care of you.

334
00:34:45,493 --> 00:34:46,972
Sake.

335
00:35:44,493 --> 00:35:46,006
Sake.

336
00:35:48,653 --> 00:35:49,642
Sake!

337
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:52,327
Let him drink, Aunt.

338
00:35:52,813 --> 00:35:54,212
No. That will not do.

339
00:35:54,373 --> 00:35:55,567
This is my village.

340
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:57,769
This is my house.

341
00:36:02,373 --> 00:36:03,726
Please.

342
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:05,566
Sake.

343
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:17,168
Sake!

344
00:36:23,373 --> 00:36:26,092
No!

345
00:36:27,213 --> 00:36:29,204
No!

346
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:35,811
l told you!

347
00:36:42,453 --> 00:36:44,728
No!

348
00:37:26,653 --> 00:37:28,006
Morning.

349
00:39:14,573 --> 00:39:16,211
Over there!

350
00:39:16,533 --> 00:39:19,093
Go. You, go.

351
00:39:20,493 --> 00:39:22,085
What's your name?

352
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:24,444
You got a name, don't you?

353
00:39:28,293 --> 00:39:30,568
You don't know what l'm saying,
do you?

354
00:39:31,893 --> 00:39:33,326
l know why you don't talk.

355
00:39:34,613 --> 00:39:36,205
You're angry.

356
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:39,285
You're angry because
they make you wear a dress.

357
00:39:40,773 --> 00:39:42,001
Son of a bitch.

358
00:40:19,693 --> 00:40:23,208
This temple was built by my family
a thousand years ago.

359
00:40:25,493 --> 00:40:27,961
My name is Katsumoto.

360
00:40:28,173 --> 00:40:30,892
What is your name?

361
00:40:36,613 --> 00:40:39,332
Are my words not correct?

362
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:46,446
l will practice my English with you. . .

363
00:40:47,853 --> 00:40:49,650
. . .if you would honor me.

364
00:40:51,373 --> 00:40:53,443
You kept me alive just to speak English?

365
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:57,285
Then what do you want?

366
00:40:58,533 --> 00:40:59,761
To know my enemy.

367
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:03,847
l've seen what you do to your enemies.

368
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:06,084
Warriors in your country do not kill?

369
00:41:06,253 --> 00:41:09,370
They don't cut the heads off defeated,
kneeling men.

370
00:41:10,373 --> 00:41:13,922
General Hasegawa asked me
to help him end his life.

371
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:18,604
A Samurai cannot stand
the shame of defeat.

372
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,449
l was honored to cut off his head.

373
00:41:24,373 --> 00:41:29,003
Many of our customs seem strange
to you. The same is true of yours.

374
00:41:29,173 --> 00:41:30,652
For example. . .

375
00:41:30,813 --> 00:41:35,568
. . .not to introduce yourself is considered
extremely rude, even among enemies.

376
00:41:42,093 --> 00:41:43,811
Nathan Algren.

377
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,528
l am honored to meet you.

378
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:52,887
-l enjoyed this conversation in English.
-l have questions.

379
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:56,568
l have introduced myself.
You have introduced yourself.

380
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:58,769
This is a very good conversation.

381
00:41:59,453 --> 00:42:01,250
-l have questions.
-They come later.

382
00:42:01,413 --> 00:42:03,688
Who was the warrior in the red armor?

383
00:42:04,653 --> 00:42:08,168
-My brother-in-law, Hirotaro.
-And the woman who cares for me?

384
00:42:08,453 --> 00:42:11,047
My sister, Hirotaro's wife.

385
00:42:11,213 --> 00:42:12,726
Her name is Taka.

386
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:14,241
l killed her husband?

387
00:42:16,093 --> 00:42:18,209
lt was a good death.

388
00:42:30,653 --> 00:42:31,881
You!

389
00:42:32,053 --> 00:42:36,171
You! Come. . . . Please. . . .

390
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:05,521
Thank you.

391
00:43:13,533 --> 00:43:17,446
He smells like the pigs.
Tell my brother l cannot stand this.

392
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:18,881
Why don't you tell him?

393
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:21,010
At least make him take a bath.

394
00:44:24,773 --> 00:44:26,491
Nicely done.

395
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:31,568
They may be children,
but they are strong.

396
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:32,961
You try.

397
00:44:33,933 --> 00:44:35,286
Try.

398
00:45:14,093 --> 00:45:15,321
Put down the sword.

399
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:40,852
l just realized, l've been remiss.
Forgive me.

400
00:47:41,213 --> 00:47:44,489
l have yet to thank you
for looking out for me yesterday.

401
00:47:44,813 --> 00:47:46,929
That is your job, correct?

402
00:47:47,373 --> 00:47:48,965
Protecting me?

403
00:47:50,053 --> 00:47:51,850
Well done, Bob.

404
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:54,563
You don't mind if l call you ''Bob,''
do you?

405
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:59,007
l knew a Bob once.
God, he was ugly as a mule.

406
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:01,810
You a ladies' man, Bob?

407
00:48:05,613 --> 00:48:09,288
Ujio is teaching you the way
of the Japanese sword.

408
00:48:10,893 --> 00:48:12,565
Yes, indeed.

409
00:48:14,373 --> 00:48:17,922
You fought against your Red lndians?

410
00:48:22,413 --> 00:48:23,641
Yes.

411
00:48:23,813 --> 00:48:25,485
Tell me of your part in this war.

412
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,166
-Why?
-l wish to learn.

413
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:30,530
-Read a book.
-l would rather have a good conversation.

414
00:48:30,693 --> 00:48:32,649
-Why?
-Because. . .

415
00:48:32,813 --> 00:48:34,610
. . .we are both students of war.

416
00:48:41,813 --> 00:48:43,132
So. . .

417
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:46,767
. . .you were the general of your army?

418
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,492
No.

419
00:48:51,653 --> 00:48:53,962
l was a captain.

420
00:48:54,373 --> 00:48:56,329
This is a low rank?

421
00:48:58,573 --> 00:49:00,325
A middle rank.

422
00:49:01,533 --> 00:49:02,807
And who was your general?

423
00:49:07,733 --> 00:49:10,042
Don't you have a rebellion to lead?

424
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:13,410
People in your country
do not like conversation?

425
00:49:13,573 --> 00:49:15,882
He was a lieutenant colonel.

426
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:18,171
His name was Custer.

427
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:19,561
l know this name.

428
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:21,924
He killed many warriors.

429
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:23,685
Oh, yes. Many warriors.

430
00:49:23,853 --> 00:49:25,923
So he was a good general.

431
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:29,483
No. No, he wasn't a good general.
He was arrogant and foolhardy.

432
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:33,851
He got massacred because he took
a battalion against 2000 angry lndians.

433
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:36,642
Two thousand lndians?

434
00:49:37,053 --> 00:49:38,281
How many men for Custer?

435
00:49:38,693 --> 00:49:40,046
Two hundred and eleven.

436
00:49:41,453 --> 00:49:43,330
l like this General Custer.

437
00:49:43,853 --> 00:49:47,732
He was a murderer who fell in love
with his own legend.

438
00:49:47,893 --> 00:49:49,929
And his troopers died for it.

439
00:49:50,093 --> 00:49:52,084
l think this is a very good death.

440
00:49:52,253 --> 00:49:54,164
Maybe you can have one
like it someday.

441
00:49:54,373 --> 00:49:56,409
lf it is in my destiny.

442
00:49:57,293 --> 00:50:00,205
-What do you want from me?
-What do you want for yourself?

443
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,086
What are you doing?

444
00:50:04,253 --> 00:50:06,289
Why are we having these conversations?

445
00:50:07,013 --> 00:50:09,288
What the hell am l doing here?

446
00:50:14,253 --> 00:50:15,766
ln spring. . .

447
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:19,209
. . .the snows will melt
and the passes will open.

448
00:50:20,973 --> 00:50:23,533
Until that time, you are here.

449
00:50:25,293 --> 00:50:27,932
Good day, captain.

450
00:50:48,093 --> 00:50:49,845
1 87 6.

451
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:53,085
Day unknown. Month unknown.

452
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:57,608
I continue to live among
these unusual people.

453
00:50:58,813 --> 00:51:01,885
I am their captive,
in that I cannot escape.

454
00:51:03,773 --> 00:51:06,367
Mostly, I'm treated with
a kind of a mild neglect...

455
00:51:07,253 --> 00:51:11,644
...as if I were a stray dog
or an unwelcome guest.

456
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:25,850
Everyone is polite.
Everyone smiles and bows.

457
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:31,970
But beneath their courtesy,
I detect a deep reservoir of feeling.

458
00:52:10,853 --> 00:52:12,525
They are an intriguing people.

459
00:52:12,853 --> 00:52:14,571
From the moment they wake...

460
00:52:14,733 --> 00:52:18,567
... they devote themselves to
the perfection of whatever they pursue.

461
00:52:26,773 --> 00:52:29,606
I have never seen such discipline.

462
00:52:30,653 --> 00:52:34,612
I am surprised to learn that the word
''Samurai'' means ''to serve''...

463
00:52:34,773 --> 00:52:37,162
...and that Katsumoto believes
his rebellion to be...

464
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:39,164
...in the service of the Emperor.

465
00:54:36,013 --> 00:54:38,573
Please forgive. Too many mind.

466
00:54:39,933 --> 00:54:41,651
Too many mind?

467
00:54:42,173 --> 00:54:46,291
Mind sword, mind people watch,
mind enemy.

468
00:54:47,093 --> 00:54:48,811
Too many mind.

469
00:54:50,693 --> 00:54:51,921
No mind.

470
00:54:53,853 --> 00:54:55,366
No mind.

471
00:55:23,413 --> 00:55:26,291
Thank you. More rice?

472
00:55:27,893 --> 00:55:31,090
Taka. He spoke Japanese!

473
00:55:32,053 --> 00:55:34,931
Eat a lot. Don't be polite.

474
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,648
Not so fast. What are these?

475
00:55:42,093 --> 00:55:44,049
How can he understand?

476
00:55:47,413 --> 00:55:48,892
Top knot.

477
00:55:52,973 --> 00:55:54,292
No, no. Not so fast.

478
00:55:58,293 --> 00:55:59,521
l'm Algren.

479
00:56:06,973 --> 00:56:09,692
-Nobutada.
-Nobutada.

480
00:56:10,373 --> 00:56:12,204
-Magojiro.
-Magojiro.

481
00:56:12,373 --> 00:56:13,601
Higen.

482
00:56:14,213 --> 00:56:15,532
Higen.

483
00:56:18,973 --> 00:56:20,247
Taka.

484
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:26,609
Brother, please make him leave.
l cannot stand it.

485
00:56:27,053 --> 00:56:28,725
ls he so repulsive?

486
00:56:28,973 --> 00:56:32,010
The shame is unbearable.
l ask permission to end my life.

487
00:56:32,213 --> 00:56:34,408
You will do as you are told!

488
00:56:40,213 --> 00:56:43,046
You'd rather l kill him
to avenge your husband?

489
00:56:43,213 --> 00:56:44,771
Yes.

490
00:56:48,213 --> 00:56:51,330
Hirotaro tried to kill the American.
lt was karma.

491
00:56:51,493 --> 00:56:53,051
l know.

492
00:56:56,933 --> 00:56:58,446
Forgive my weakness.

493
00:56:59,053 --> 00:57:02,841
There must be some reason
why he is here.

494
00:57:05,373 --> 00:57:08,331
lt is beyond my understanding.

495
00:57:26,573 --> 00:57:28,529
She's been very kind to me.

496
00:57:29,453 --> 00:57:33,287
She's honored to have
my guest in her house.

497
00:57:56,733 --> 00:57:59,327
Winter, 1 87 7.

498
00:57:59,573 --> 00:58:02,087
What does it mean to be Samurai?

499
00:58:02,253 --> 00:58:05,529
To devote yourself utterly
to a set of moral principles...

500
00:58:06,253 --> 00:58:09,006
... to seek a stillness of your mind...

501
00:58:09,613 --> 00:58:12,730
...and to master the way of the sword.

502
00:58:12,893 --> 00:58:14,451
He's getting better, no?

503
00:58:16,133 --> 00:58:18,283
But still so ugly.

504
00:58:26,653 --> 00:58:27,972
Cold?

505
00:58:39,293 --> 00:58:40,612
Also. Also cold.

506
00:58:41,613 --> 00:58:42,887
Fire.

507
00:58:51,133 --> 00:58:52,646
To burn.

508
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:11,806
No, please.

509
00:59:13,613 --> 00:59:16,252
Japanese men do not help with this.

510
00:59:16,693 --> 00:59:19,844
l am not Japanese.

511
00:59:49,133 --> 00:59:50,361
l'm sorry.

512
00:59:59,533 --> 01:00:02,331
For your husband, Hirotaro.

513
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:19,249
He did his duty.

514
01:00:22,773 --> 01:00:26,561
You did your duty.

515
01:00:31,453 --> 01:00:33,967
l accept your apology. . . .

516
01:00:52,493 --> 01:00:55,212
Spring, 1 87 7.

517
01:00:55,613 --> 01:01:00,368
This marks the longest I have stayed
in one place since I left the farm at 1 7.

518
01:01:03,733 --> 01:01:06,930
There is so much here
that I'll never understand.

519
01:01:11,133 --> 01:01:13,806
I have never been a church-going man...

520
01:01:13,973 --> 01:01:16,168
...and what I've seen
on the field of battle...

521
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:18,210
...has led me to question God's purpose.

522
01:01:18,373 --> 01:01:20,648
But there is, indeed, something...

523
01:01:20,813 --> 01:01:23,725
...spiritual in this place.

524
01:01:26,893 --> 01:01:30,203
And though it may forever
be obscure to me...

525
01:01:30,373 --> 01:01:33,683
...I cannot but be aware of its power.

526
01:01:41,813 --> 01:01:46,568
I do know it is here that I have known
my first untroubled sleep in many years.

527
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:52,606
No, you gotta get the ball!
Go and get it.

528
01:01:52,773 --> 01:01:56,732
No, not me!
You gotta get the ball! The ball!

529
01:02:04,773 --> 01:02:07,003
Ujio will win in three moves.

530
01:02:09,653 --> 01:02:11,086
ln five!

531
01:02:24,973 --> 01:02:26,372
Next in five moves.

532
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:29,561
ln six.

533
01:02:47,893 --> 01:02:49,485
No mind.

534
01:03:52,853 --> 01:03:54,081
A draw!

535
01:04:35,933 --> 01:04:37,446
Who is this amateur?

536
01:05:37,853 --> 01:05:39,206
Katsumoto!

537
01:05:42,493 --> 01:05:44,245
Protect Katsumoto!
Protect our Lord!

538
01:06:22,453 --> 01:06:23,806
Lord, please go inside!

539
01:08:57,773 --> 01:09:00,924
The perfect blossom is a rare thing.

540
01:09:01,093 --> 01:09:05,928
You could spend your life looking for
one, and it would not be a wasted life.

541
01:09:06,693 --> 01:09:08,604
Who sent those men to kill you?

542
01:09:08,773 --> 01:09:11,731
l'm writing a poem about a dream l had.

543
01:09:12,213 --> 01:09:14,966
The tiger's eyes are like my own

544
01:09:15,133 --> 01:09:18,205
But he comes from across
A deep and troubled sea

545
01:09:19,093 --> 01:09:20,845
Was it the Emperor?

546
01:09:22,613 --> 01:09:23,841
Omura?

547
01:09:24,013 --> 01:09:27,767
lf the Emperor wishes my death,
he has but to ask.

548
01:09:28,653 --> 01:09:30,405
So it was Omura.

549
01:09:30,973 --> 01:09:33,043
l'm having trouble finishing the poem.

550
01:09:33,213 --> 01:09:36,728
-Can you suggest a last line?
-l'm not a writer.

551
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:41,763
Yet you have written many pages
since you came here.

552
01:09:44,133 --> 01:09:46,203
What else has she told you?

553
01:09:48,013 --> 01:09:49,969
You have nightmares.

554
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:54,172
Every soldier has nightmares.

555
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:57,643
Only one who is ashamed
of what he has done.

556
01:09:58,373 --> 01:10:01,445
You have no idea what l have done.

557
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:11,450
You have seen many things.

558
01:10:12,213 --> 01:10:13,441
l have.

559
01:10:13,613 --> 01:10:17,652
And you do not fear death,
but sometimes you wish for it.

560
01:10:18,173 --> 01:10:20,129
ls this not so?

561
01:10:22,573 --> 01:10:25,041
-Yes.
-l, also.

562
01:10:25,933 --> 01:10:29,812
lt happens to men who have seen
what we have seen.

563
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:35,566
And then l come to this place
of my ancestors. . .

564
01:10:35,853 --> 01:10:37,764
. . .and l remember.

565
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:40,163
Like these blossoms. . .

566
01:10:40,853 --> 01:10:42,809
. . .we are all dying.

567
01:10:44,613 --> 01:10:47,923
To know life in every breath. . .

568
01:10:48,653 --> 01:10:50,769
. . .every cup of tea. . .

569
01:10:50,933 --> 01:10:53,845
. . .every life we take.

570
01:10:54,013 --> 01:10:56,288
The way of the warrior.

571
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:58,569
Life in every breath.

572
01:10:59,613 --> 01:11:01,763
That is Bushido.

573
01:11:05,893 --> 01:11:09,363
The Emperor has granted
a safe passage to Tokyo.

574
01:11:10,013 --> 01:11:11,969
We leave tomorrow.

575
01:11:14,733 --> 01:11:16,086
Good.

576
01:11:17,133 --> 01:11:18,407
Good.

577
01:11:24,733 --> 01:11:27,566
When l took these, you were. . .

578
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:29,926
. . .my enemy.

579
01:11:49,253 --> 01:11:51,209
Excuse me.

580
01:11:52,733 --> 01:11:55,805
No, so sorry, l am finishing.

581
01:12:12,973 --> 01:12:14,770
l must go away.

582
01:12:35,853 --> 01:12:38,765
You have been kind to me.

583
01:12:41,893 --> 01:12:43,451
l won't forget. . . .

584
01:13:09,173 --> 01:13:12,688
Algren-san! Algren-san.

585
01:15:59,813 --> 01:16:01,405
Algren?

586
01:16:01,573 --> 01:16:04,371
Algren, my God, you are alive.

587
01:16:08,293 --> 01:16:10,648
Well, you never cease to astonish.

588
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:14,928
-Howitzers.
-Yes, indeed.

589
01:16:15,093 --> 01:16:17,766
As soon as the Emperor signs
the trade agreement. . .

590
01:16:17,933 --> 01:16:19,924
. . .he gets the whole package.

591
01:16:20,093 --> 01:16:23,483
lncluding this particular item.
Two hundred rounds a minute.

592
01:16:23,893 --> 01:16:26,965
And the new cartridges
cut down on jamming.

593
01:16:27,133 --> 01:16:28,805
l need a bath.

594
01:16:28,973 --> 01:16:32,409
After living with those savages,
l can only imagine.

595
01:16:33,893 --> 01:16:36,009
Welcome back, captain.

596
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:47,526
You rise against me, my teacher.

597
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:50,602
No, Highness.
l rise against your enemies.

598
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:54,724
They are my advisors, like you.

599
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:57,683
They advise in their own interest.

600
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:03,126
l need advisors who know
the modern world.

601
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:07,889
lf l am no use,
l will happily end my life.

602
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:11,203
No. . . .

603
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:14,563
l need your voice in the council.

604
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:16,880
lt is your voice we need, Highness.

605
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:20,841
You are a living god.
Do what you think is right.

606
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:23,604
l am a living god. . .

607
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:28,486
. . .as long as l do
what they think is right.

608
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:31,720
What sad words you speak.

609
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:35,048
Forgive me for saying
what a teacher must.

610
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,481
Have you forgotten your people?

611
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:42,483
Tell me what to do. . .

612
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:46,038
. . .my teacher.

613
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:53,330
You are Emperor, my Lord, not me.

614
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:58,449
You must find the wisdom for all of us.

615
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:05,684
Gentlemen, come in.

616
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:09,242
Captain Algren, it seems
you have endured your captivity. . .

617
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:10,638
. . .with little ill effect.

618
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:13,049
l was not ill-treated, sir.

619
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:16,680
Mr. Omura, l have here
a draft of the arms agreement.

620
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:20,479
l'm eager to know how many Samurai
have joined Katsumoto.

621
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:22,003
l'm afraid l don't know.

622
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:25,401
-You spent the winter at his encampment.
-As his prisoner.

623
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:29,643
Has he fortified his position?
Acquired firearms? Tell us what you saw.

624
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:34,930
As you said, colonel,
they're savages with bows and arrows.

625
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:38,878
-Sir, about the--
-l'm sure your documents are in order.

626
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:43,282
Thank you. Leave them on my desk.
l'll address them at the appropriate time.

627
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:47,648
With all due respect, sir,
our president's patience is wearing thin.

628
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:50,244
Perhaps there is someone else
we should speak to.

629
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:52,685
With all due respect, ambassador. . .

630
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:55,444
. . .perhaps there is someone else
we should speak to.

631
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:58,283
For instance, the French
or the English.

632
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:01,442
Or any of the legations
waiting in the next room.

633
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:06,241
We should be looking forward
to hearing from you.

634
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:10,440
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Captain Algren.

635
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:15,526
Perhaps you and l might have
a word in private. Please, sit down.

636
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:21,647
-May l offer you whiskey?
-No, thank you.

637
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:30,727
Katsumoto is an extraordinary man,
is he not?

638
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:34,439
He's a tribal leader.
l've known many of them.

639
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:39,365
But none who are Samurai.
Their ways have great appeal.

640
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:43,239
-l don't see how this concerns me.
-But it does.

641
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:48,438
You see, you were right. Last year,
we were not prepared to go to battle.

642
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:51,124
You were right,
and Colonel Bagley was wrong.

643
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:53,167
But now, we are ready.

644
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:56,606
lf Katsumoto is allowed to attract
other Samurai to his cause. . .

645
01:19:56,770 --> 01:20:01,400
. . .we will have 1 0 years of rebellion.
This is something l will not allow.

646
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:06,928
Either l'll stop him at the council today,
or you'll lead my army against him.

647
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:11,049
And with these new weapons,
you will crush him.

648
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:16,160
-l appreciate the offer.
-lt is not an offer.

649
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:20,803
Mr. Omura, my contract with you
was to train your army.

650
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:23,359
Then we will make a new contract. . .

651
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:26,806
. . .one that will recognize
the extraordinary contribution. . .

652
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:28,528
. . .you've made to the Emperor.

653
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:31,205
Do we understand each other?

654
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:37,438
-Yes, we understand each other perfectly.
-Then l am pleased.

655
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:49,321
Follow him. lf he goes anywhere
near Katsumoto, kill him.

656
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,569
Captain Algren!
What in heaven's name is going on?

657
01:20:57,730 --> 01:20:59,641
The diplomatic community is abuzz.

658
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:02,449
Omura has passed laws
against the Samurai.

659
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:03,838
l need a drink.

660
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:08,208
ls your friend Katsumoto planning to go
up against the council this afternoon?

661
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:14,400
You, Samurai!
Don't you know about the order?

662
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:16,164
My God, it's started.

663
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:18,725
Hey boy, are you listening?

664
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:21,801
No wonder the foreigners mock you.

665
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:23,289
Let's give this Samurai a haircut.

666
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:24,889
Cut off his top knot.

667
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:26,478
Get down! Kneel!

668
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:27,639
Captain Algren!

669
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:28,799
Lower your weapons!

670
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:31,248
Lower your weapons!

671
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:33,685
Who are you?

672
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:35,124
l am Captain Algren.

673
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:38,843
Stop!

674
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:03,363
Get down!

675
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:19,648
Let's go.

676
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:37,441
l'll take you home.

677
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:40,082
Jolly good.

678
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,966
We must resist the Western powers. . .

679
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:09,848
. . .by becoming powerful ourselves.

680
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:14,285
Our army, our economy,
must be strong.

681
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:20,847
Minister, you honor us.

682
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:25,684
lt is my honor to rejoin this council.

683
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:32,927
Perhaps you are unaware of the law
against wearing swords?

684
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:35,126
l read every law carefully.

685
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:38,600
Yet you bring weapons
into this chamber?

686
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:45,280
This chamber was protected
by my sword when--

687
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:48,681
We need no protection.
We are a nation of laws.

688
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:51,444
We are a nation of whores,
selling ourselves--

689
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:55,649
lf we are whores,
the Samurai made us this way.

690
01:23:56,490 --> 01:24:00,449
l have not seen the Omura family
giving gold to the masses.

691
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:06,763
Minister Katsumoto,
it is with great regret. . .

692
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:10,165
. . .but l must ask you
to remove your sword.

693
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:16,321
This sword serves the Emperor.

694
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:18,958
Only he can command me to remove it.

695
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:44,643
The Emperor's voice is too pure
to be heard in this council.

696
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:49,966
Then, l must refuse
to give up my sword.

697
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:58,640
Then regretfully, my guards will
accompany you to your home in Tokyo.

698
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:01,404
There you will await our summons.

699
01:25:24,570 --> 01:25:26,481
l heard you were leaving.

700
01:25:28,210 --> 01:25:31,122
Omura offers you my job,
and you run away.

701
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:34,286
l suppose l should thank you.

702
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:39,167
$500 a month, including
back pay for time spent. . .

703
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:41,322
. . .in captivity.

704
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:46,047
Enough to climb back inside a bottle
for the rest of your life.

705
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:50,729
You're welcome.

706
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:58,124
Well, it is pretty much over.

707
01:25:58,290 --> 01:26:02,488
Katsumoto's under arrest.
Omura won't let him last the night.

708
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:06,848
With him dead, we should have
little trouble handling the rebellion. . .

709
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:08,682
. . .even without you.

710
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:15,080
Especially without you.

711
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:21,966
Just tell me one thing.

712
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:26,649
What is it about your own people
that you hate so much?

713
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:19,200
Save us the trouble. . . .

714
01:30:02,290 --> 01:30:04,520
The Samurai are finished!

715
01:30:29,170 --> 01:30:30,398
Stop!

716
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:31,764
Don't come any closer!

717
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:34,490
Don't stop.
Whatever you do, don't stop.

718
01:30:34,650 --> 01:30:39,201
Minister Omura has commanded us
to photograph the traitor--

719
01:30:39,730 --> 01:30:41,163
Stop! Somebody!

720
01:30:41,570 --> 01:30:42,969
Bring that equipment here now!

721
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:44,449
lmmediately!

722
01:30:44,610 --> 01:30:46,282
You stop!

723
01:30:46,490 --> 01:30:50,449
You insolent, useless son
of a peasant dog!

724
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:56,522
How dare you show your sword in
his presence! Do you know who this is?

725
01:30:56,730 --> 01:31:00,086
This is the President
of the United States of America!

726
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:04,283
He is here to lead our armies
in victorious battle against the rebels!

727
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:06,202
lt's not my responsibility. . . .

728
01:31:06,410 --> 01:31:09,925
Now get over there and
help those men with their equipment!

729
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:14,563
Carry the equipment.

730
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:21,162
-President of the United States?
-Sorry.

731
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:23,048
l think l'm going to be sick.

732
01:31:40,530 --> 01:31:42,486
How's your poem coming?

733
01:31:45,010 --> 01:31:47,763
The end is proving difficult.

734
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:51,718
This is Mr. Simon Graham. He'd like
very much to take your photograph.

735
01:31:53,170 --> 01:31:55,240
l thought you returned to America.

736
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:59,881
l decided to stay.
See if l could convince you to escape.

737
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:02,166
How do you plan to do that?

738
01:32:10,610 --> 01:32:14,444
Mr. Graham, perhaps you would care
to take pictures of my village.

739
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:16,726
l would be greatly honored.

740
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:35,846
My Lord, no!

741
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:38,004
Nobutada!

742
01:34:21,170 --> 01:34:23,889
Father, let me stay.

743
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:29,442
lt is my time.

744
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,569
My Lord. . .

745
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:46,047
. . .we must go.

746
01:36:05,490 --> 01:36:08,243
The Emperor could not hear my words.

747
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:12,879
His army will come.

748
01:36:14,130 --> 01:36:15,961
lt is the end.

749
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:22,687
For 900 years, my ancestors
have protected our people.

750
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:26,440
Now. . .

751
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:28,248
. . .l have failed them.

752
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:42,606
So you will take your own life. . .

753
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:45,318
. . .in shame?

754
01:36:50,290 --> 01:36:53,805
Shame for a life of service?

755
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:57,443
Discipline? Compassion?

756
01:36:58,210 --> 01:37:01,520
The way of the Samurai
is not necessary anymore.

757
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:04,045
Necessary?

758
01:37:05,970 --> 01:37:08,359
What could be more necessary?

759
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:15,686
l will die by the sword.

760
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:19,639
My own. . .

761
01:37:19,810 --> 01:37:21,562
. . .or my enemy's.

762
01:37:22,690 --> 01:37:24,726
Then let it be your enemy's.

763
01:37:28,210 --> 01:37:31,839
Together, we will make
the Emperor hear you.

764
01:37:58,450 --> 01:38:02,079
He was a good man.

765
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:07,281
Will you fight the white men, too?

766
01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:12,684
lf they come here, yes.

767
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:16,003
Why?

768
01:38:18,650 --> 01:38:25,488
Because they come to destroy
what l have come to love.

769
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:44,363
The way of Samurai is difficult
for children. He misses his father.

770
01:38:45,730 --> 01:38:53,762
And he is angry
because l am the cause of that.

771
01:38:57,890 --> 01:39:03,886
No. He is angry because
he fears you will die as well.

772
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:28,320
My father taught me
it is glorious to die in battle.

773
01:39:32,570 --> 01:39:38,884
That is what he believed.

774
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:43,926
l would be afraid to die in battle.

775
01:39:45,570 --> 01:39:46,969
So would l.

776
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:51,479
But you have been in many battles.

777
01:39:53,370 --> 01:39:56,328
And l was always afraid.

778
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:05,004
l don't want you to go.

779
01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:08,247
Algren.

780
01:40:08,410 --> 01:40:09,638
They are coming.

781
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:39,761
l'd say two full regiments.

782
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:42,125
They'll come in waves of a thousand.

783
01:40:42,650 --> 01:40:44,208
And they have the howitzers.

784
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:48,443
lt makes no difference. They will come,
and we will make our stand.

785
01:40:48,610 --> 01:40:51,522
-How many men will we have?
-Maybe 500.

786
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:53,808
Like General Custer, huh?

787
01:40:57,970 --> 01:41:01,804
There was once a battle
at a place called Thermopylae.

788
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:05,406
Three hundred brave Greeks held off
a Persian army of a million men.

789
01:41:05,570 --> 01:41:08,038
A million. You understand this number?

790
01:41:08,210 --> 01:41:10,121
l understand this number.

791
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:12,838
For two days the Greeks
made them pay so dearly. . .

792
01:41:13,010 --> 01:41:18,130
. . .the Persian army lost all taste
for battle and were defeated soon after.

793
01:41:18,290 --> 01:41:22,283
-What do you have in mind?
-Take away the advantage of their guns.

794
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:25,846
They're overconfident. We'll use that.
Lure them close.

795
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:28,483
Close enough for a sword.

796
01:41:30,130 --> 01:41:32,325
You believe. . .

797
01:41:32,490 --> 01:41:34,481
. . .a man can change his destiny?

798
01:41:37,330 --> 01:41:40,367
l think a man does what he can. . .

799
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:42,566
. . .until his destiny is revealed to him.

800
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:53,165
May 25th, 1 87 7.

801
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:56,367
This will be the last entry
in this journal.

802
01:41:56,530 --> 01:42:01,524
I've tried to give a true accounting
of what I have seen, what I have done.

803
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:05,126
I do not presume to understand
the course of my life.

804
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:09,329
I know I am grateful
to have partaken of all this...

805
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:11,446
...even if for a moment.

806
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:03,680
Algren-san, will you come with me?

807
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:23,360
lf you wear this armor,
it will honor us.

808
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:17,123
You will need this.

809
01:47:28,490 --> 01:47:29,718
What does it say?

810
01:47:30,770 --> 01:47:36,049
''l belong to the warrior in whom
the old ways have joined the new. ''

811
01:48:37,450 --> 01:48:39,884
Good God.

812
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:47,129
Sir, the lmperial Army of Japan
demands your surrender.

813
01:48:47,570 --> 01:48:50,038
lf you lay down your arms,
you will not be harmed.

814
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:54,727
This is not possible,
as Mr. Omura knows.

815
01:48:58,730 --> 01:49:00,561
Captain Algren.

816
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:02,561
We will show you no quarter.

817
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:05,290
You ride against us,
and you are the same as them.

818
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:08,206
l'll look for you on the field.

819
01:49:28,130 --> 01:49:29,529
Captain Algren.

820
01:49:29,690 --> 01:49:32,204
Mr. Graham.

821
01:49:35,370 --> 01:49:38,601
Perhaps you can use these
for your book.

822
01:49:38,770 --> 01:49:41,079
Yes, l will. Captain.

823
01:49:44,130 --> 01:49:45,802
Godspeed.

824
01:49:47,370 --> 01:49:49,645
Mr. Graham.

825
01:50:12,530 --> 01:50:15,283
Well they won't surrender.

826
01:50:20,570 --> 01:50:23,403
Are we ready?

827
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:26,529
Get into your positions!

828
01:51:09,130 --> 01:51:11,803
Commence firing!

829
01:52:24,570 --> 01:52:27,038
-They're covering their retreat.
-You see?

830
01:52:27,210 --> 01:52:30,805
Even the mighty Samurai
cannot stand up to the howitzers.

831
01:52:30,970 --> 01:52:34,042
-Signal the attack.
-l advise sending in skirmishers first.

832
01:52:34,210 --> 01:52:36,121
Nonsense! Full attack!

833
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:31,720
They're coming.

834
01:54:02,770 --> 01:54:04,567
Wait for the volley.

835
01:54:15,890 --> 01:54:17,642
Second volley.

836
01:55:10,170 --> 01:55:12,365
-What on earth?
-What is happening?

837
01:55:55,330 --> 01:55:58,527
-The attack has been stopped.
-Send in the rest of the regiment.

838
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:05,485
What happened to the warriors
at Thermopylae?

839
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:08,523
Dead to the last man.

840
01:57:09,010 --> 01:57:10,682
Algren-san!

841
01:59:52,290 --> 01:59:55,009
Son of a bitch thinks he can win.

842
02:00:56,610 --> 02:01:00,364
They'll bring two more regiments
up here soon.

843
02:01:00,530 --> 02:01:02,486
We won't be able to stop them again.

844
02:01:03,450 --> 02:01:05,441
You do not have to die here.

845
02:01:08,370 --> 02:01:11,009
l should have died
so many times before.

846
02:01:11,530 --> 02:01:12,883
Now, you live again.

847
02:01:16,010 --> 02:01:18,126
Yes.

848
02:01:20,210 --> 02:01:23,043
lt was not your time.

849
02:01:26,290 --> 02:01:28,485
lt's not over.

850
02:02:12,890 --> 02:02:14,243
What is this?

851
02:02:14,410 --> 02:02:15,889
Cannon, prepare to fire!

852
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:17,683
Prepare to fire!

853
02:02:18,330 --> 02:02:22,482
-This is madness. He's going to attack?
-Yes.

854
02:02:30,450 --> 02:02:33,362
He's defeated!
He must accept his shame!

855
02:02:44,850 --> 02:02:47,159
Kill him. All of them.

856
02:02:47,330 --> 02:02:49,639
Now!

857
02:02:53,530 --> 02:02:54,804
My horse!

858
02:03:45,570 --> 02:03:46,798
Fire!

859
02:04:22,290 --> 02:04:23,564
Ready!

860
02:04:26,810 --> 02:04:28,038
Aim!

861
02:04:33,170 --> 02:04:34,444
Fire!

862
02:04:40,370 --> 02:04:41,803
Fire at will!

863
02:05:26,090 --> 02:05:27,967
Bring up the new guns!

864
02:05:28,570 --> 02:05:29,969
Prepare the new guns!

865
02:05:34,730 --> 02:05:36,482
Fire!

866
02:05:38,450 --> 02:05:39,724
Backward!

867
02:05:42,610 --> 02:05:44,680
Quickly! Quickly!

868
02:05:48,050 --> 02:05:49,563
Fire!

869
02:07:29,890 --> 02:07:31,243
Stop firing!

870
02:07:31,570 --> 02:07:33,322
ldiots, keep on firing!

871
02:07:33,490 --> 02:07:35,082
Stop firing! Stop!

872
02:07:44,370 --> 02:07:45,769
No.

873
02:07:47,090 --> 02:07:50,480
Shoot! Kill Katsumoto!
Kill the American!

874
02:07:52,570 --> 02:07:55,209
You have your honor again.

875
02:07:57,330 --> 02:07:59,480
Let me die with mine.

876
02:08:08,530 --> 02:08:10,441
Help me up.

877
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:30,888
Are you ready?

878
02:08:37,730 --> 02:08:41,245
l will miss our conversations.

879
02:09:25,890 --> 02:09:28,120
Perfect.

880
02:09:34,450 --> 02:09:37,522
They are all. . .

881
02:09:38,490 --> 02:09:40,526
. . .perfect.

882
02:11:05,010 --> 02:11:08,525
On behalf of the United States
of America...

883
02:11:09,410 --> 02:11:14,438
. . .the signing of this treaty will usher in
an era of unprecedented prosperity. . .

884
02:11:14,610 --> 02:11:18,569
. . .and cooperation between
our two great nations.

885
02:11:18,890 --> 02:11:20,528
On behalf of the Emperor. . .

886
02:11:20,690 --> 02:11:24,319
. . .we are pleased to have
successfully concluded this. . .

887
02:11:27,570 --> 02:11:29,765
. . .negotiation.

888
02:11:37,090 --> 02:11:38,762
He is here?

889
02:12:40,570 --> 02:12:43,323
Highness, if we could just conclude
the matter at hand. . . .

890
02:13:09,690 --> 02:13:12,409
This is Katsumoto's sword.

891
02:13:13,690 --> 02:13:16,284
He would have wanted you to have it. . .

892
02:13:17,410 --> 02:13:20,368
. . .that the strength of the Samurai
be with you always.

893
02:13:21,210 --> 02:13:25,965
Enlightened One,
we all weep for Katsumoto, but--

894
02:13:26,170 --> 02:13:27,683
He hoped. . .

895
02:13:28,290 --> 02:13:30,406
. . .with his last breath. . .

896
02:13:30,770 --> 02:13:34,001
. . .that you would remember the
ancestors who held this sword. . .

897
02:13:35,730 --> 02:13:37,925
. . .and what they died for.

898
02:13:39,250 --> 02:13:40,968
Your Highness. . . .

899
02:13:57,330 --> 02:13:59,446
You were with him. . .

900
02:14:00,570 --> 02:14:02,561
. . .at the end?

901
02:14:07,730 --> 02:14:11,040
Emperor, this man fought against you!

902
02:14:15,090 --> 02:14:16,648
Your Highness. . .

903
02:14:17,850 --> 02:14:22,241
. . .if you believe me to be your enemy,
command me. . .

904
02:14:22,410 --> 02:14:24,605
. . .and l will gladly take my life.

905
02:14:38,170 --> 02:14:42,083
l have dreamed of a unified Japan. . .

906
02:14:42,250 --> 02:14:47,802
. . .of a country strong
and independent and modern.

907
02:14:47,970 --> 02:14:53,522
And now we have railroads
and cannon, Western clothing.

908
02:14:55,410 --> 02:14:56,968
But. . .

909
02:15:00,210 --> 02:15:04,089
. . .we cannot forget who we are. . .

910
02:15:05,490 --> 02:15:09,802
. . .or where we come from.

911
02:15:21,690 --> 02:15:24,158
Ambassador Swanbeck. . .

912
02:15:24,330 --> 02:15:27,049
. . .l have concluded that your treaty. . .

913
02:15:27,210 --> 02:15:31,840
. . .is not in the best interest
of my people.

914
02:15:32,570 --> 02:15:36,040
-Sir, if l may--
-So sorry. . .

915
02:15:36,410 --> 02:15:38,128
. . .but you may not.

916
02:15:38,450 --> 02:15:41,647
This is an outrage!

917
02:15:47,410 --> 02:15:48,809
Enlightened One,
we should discuss this--

918
02:15:48,970 --> 02:15:50,289
Omura. . .

919
02:15:50,450 --> 02:15:52,520
. . .you have done quite enough.

920
02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:55,284
Everything l have done,
l have done for my country.

921
02:15:55,450 --> 02:15:58,283
Then you will not mind
when l seize your family's assets. . .

922
02:15:58,530 --> 02:16:00,998
. . .and present them
as my gift to the people.

923
02:16:01,170 --> 02:16:03,400
You disgrace me.

924
02:16:03,610 --> 02:16:05,566
lf your shame is too unbearable. . .

925
02:16:14,570 --> 02:16:15,969
. . .l offer you this sword.

926
02:16:45,490 --> 02:16:47,924
Tell me how he died.

927
02:16:55,370 --> 02:16:59,727
l will tell you how he lived.

928
02:17:08,610 --> 02:17:12,842
And so the days
of the Samurai had ended.

929
02:17:13,010 --> 02:17:18,323
Nations, like men, it is sometimes said,
have their own destiny.

930
02:17:19,370 --> 02:17:21,838
As for the American captain...

931
02:17:22,010 --> 02:17:24,240
...no one knows what became of him.

932
02:17:24,410 --> 02:17:27,720
Some say that he died of his wounds...

933
02:17:27,890 --> 02:17:31,678
...others, that he returned
to his own country.

934
02:17:31,850 --> 02:17:33,408
But I like to think...

935
02:17:33,570 --> 02:17:38,439
...he may have at last found
some small measure of peace...

936
02:17:38,610 --> 02:17:40,521
... that we all seek...

937
02:17:41,250 --> 02:17:44,287
...and few of us ever find.

938
