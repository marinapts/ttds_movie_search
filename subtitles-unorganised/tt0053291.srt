1
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:25,588
All right, Charlie.

2
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:29,759
- That the joint? Who runs it?
- l already told you.

3
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:32,137
- Refresh my memory.
- Spats Colombo.

4
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:35,598
- What's the password?
- ''I've come to Grandma's funeral.''

5
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:37,892
- Your admission card.
- Thanks, Charlie.

6
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:41,521
lf you want a ringside table,
just say you're a pallbearer.

7
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:43,732
We're all set. Whens the kickoff?

8
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:46,943
I'd better blow.
lf Colombo sees me, it's goodbye, Charlie.

9
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:49,154
Goodbye, Charlie.

10
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:53,616
Give me five minutes,
then hit 'em with everything you got.

11
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:55,869
You betcha.

12
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:12,344
Good evening, sir.

13
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:16,181
- I'm Mr Mozarella. What can l do for you?
- I've come to the old lady's funeral.

14
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:18,683
l haven't seen you at our services before.

15
00:05:18,808 --> 00:05:21,102
- No, I've been on the wagon.
- Please.

16
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:23,813
Where is the wake?
I'm one of the pallbearers.

17
00:05:23,897 --> 00:05:26,941
Show the gentleman into the chapel.
Pew number three.

18
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:29,444
Yes, Mr Mozarella. This way, sir.

19
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:50,173
Well, if you gotta go,
that's the way to do it.

20
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:52,592
Follow me, please.

21
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,981
- What'll it be, sir?
- Booze.

22
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:09,359
- Sorry. We only serve coffee.
- Coffee?

23
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:12,404
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee,
sour mash coffee...

24
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:15,323
Scotch. Make it a demitasse,
with soda on the side.

25
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:19,160
Wait a minute. Haven't you got
a pew not so close to the band?

26
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:21,162
How about that one over there?

27
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:25,333
Sorry, but that's reserved
for members of the immediate family.

28
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,886
Oops.

29
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:45,770
Hey, l want another cup of coffee.

30
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:48,565
l want another cup of coffee.

31
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,911
Better bring a check
in case the joint is raided.

32
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:06,291
- Who's gonna raid a funeral?
- Some people don't respect the dead.

33
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:32,359
Say, Joe. Tonight's the night, isn't it?

34
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:36,029
- I'll say.
- No, tonight we get paid.

35
00:07:36,112 --> 00:07:39,783
- Why?
- I've got to see a dentist tomorrow.

36
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:42,911
You wanna blow
your first week's pay on your teeth?

37
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:46,873
Just a filling. Doesn't have to be gold.

38
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:51,336
How can you be so selfish? We owe rent.
We owe $89 to Moe's Delicatessen.

39
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:55,840
The Chinese laundry is suing us.
We owe money to every girl in the line.

40
00:07:55,924 --> 00:08:00,011
You're right. Tomorrow we'll pay
everyone something on account.

41
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:05,308
No. Tomorrow we go to the dog track
and bet it all on Greased Lightning.

42
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:08,144
- You'd bet my money on a dog?
- He's a shoo-in.

43
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:11,523
Max the waiter knows the electrician
that wires the rabbit.

44
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:15,360
- What are you givin' me with a rabbit?
- The odds are 10 to 1 .

45
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:19,239
- Suppose he loses.
- Why worry? This job'll last a long time.

46
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:23,410
- Suppose it doesn't.
- Jerry boy, why paint everyzhing black?

47
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:28,081
Suppose you got hit by a truck.
Suppose the stock market crashes.

48
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:31,126
Suppose Mary Pickford
divorces Douglas Fairbanks.

49
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:34,129
Suppose the Dodgers leave Brooklyn.

50
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:36,339
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows.

51
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:40,176
Well, don't look now,
but the whole town is underwater.

52
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:54,274
Four,

53
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:55,734
three,

54
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:57,277
two,

55
00:08:57,485 --> 00:08:58,653
one.

56
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:15,128
All right, everybody. This is a raid.

57
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:18,256
I'm a federal agent.
You're all under arrest.

58
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:21,801
l want another cup of coffee.

59
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:35,357
All right, Spats.

60
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,151
- The services are over. Let's go.
- Go where?

61
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,322
A country club for retired bootleggers.
I'm puttin' you up for membership.

62
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,450
- l don't join nothin'.
- Oh, you'll like it there.

63
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:50,246
I'll get the prison tailor to fit you
with a pair of special spats - striped.

64
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:53,500
Big joke. What's the rap this time?

65
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:57,754
Embalming people with coffee. 86 proof.

66
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:59,964
Me? I'm just a customer.

67
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:05,595
Oh, come on, Spats. We know you own
the joint. Mozarella's just frontin' for you.

68
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,974
- Mozarella? Never heard of him.
- We got different information.

69
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:12,977
From who? Toothpick Charlie maybe?

70
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:15,897
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.

71
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:20,819
Buttermilk.

72
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:23,613
Too smart to drink your own stuff, huh?

73
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:26,741
Come on. On your feet.

74
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,829
- You're wastin' the taxpayers' money.
- Call your lawyer if you wanna.

75
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:33,832
These are my lawyers. All Harvard men.

76
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:45,010
l wan' another cuppa coffee.

77
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:26,926
That solves one problem. Now we don't
have to worry about who to pay first.

78
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:29,971
- Quiet. I'm thinking.
- The landlady will lock us out.

79
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,807
At Moe's Deli no
more knockwurst on credit.

80
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:36,227
We can't borrow from the girls -
they're on the way to jail.

81
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:39,773
l wonder how much Sam the bookie
will give us for our overcoats.

82
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:44,569
Sam the bookie? Nothin' doin'.
You're not puttin' my overcoat on a dog.

83
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:47,822
- Jerry, l told you, it's a sure thing.
- We will freeze.

84
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,325
lt is below zero. We'll get pneumonia.

85
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:54,162
Look, stupid, he's 10-1 .
Tomorrow we'll have 20 overcoats.

86
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:06,257
Greased Lightning.

87
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:10,220
- l oughta have my head examined.
- l thought you weren't talkin' to me.

88
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:13,682
The bull fiddle's
dressed warmer than l am.

89
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:22,232
- Anyzhing today?
- Nothing.

90
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:23,983
Thank you.

91
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:28,279
- Anyzhing today?
- Nothing.

92
00:12:28,488 --> 00:12:30,031
Thank you.

93
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,536
l can't go on, Joe. I'm weak from hunger,
l got a fever, l got a hole in my shoe...

94
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:37,455
lf you gave me a chance,
we could be living like kings.

95
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:39,749
- How?
- There's a dog running in the third.

96
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,421
Galloping Ghost. He's 1 5-1 and it's
his kind of a track. He's a real mudder.

97
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:47,132
What do you want from me?
My head on a plate?

98
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,051
No, your bass.
lf we hock that and my sax...

99
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,930
Are you crazy? We're up the creek
and you wanna hock the paddle.

100
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:57,142
All right, go ahead and starve.
What do l care? Freeze.

101
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:59,978
- Anyzhing today?
- Oh, it's you.

102
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:02,063
Well, you've got a lot of nerve.

103
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:04,149
Thank you.

104
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:06,317
Joe. Come back here.

105
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:13,950
Nellie, baby, if it's about Saturday night,
l can explain.

106
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,370
What a heel. l spend $4
to get my hair marcelled,

107
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,581
l buy me a brand-new negligee,

108
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:21,750
l bake him a great big pizza pie.

109
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,878
- And where were you?
- Where were you?

110
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:26,254
- With you.
- Me?

111
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:28,340
Remember? You had this bad tooth.

112
00:13:28,548 --> 00:13:30,717
lt was impacted. His jaw was swoll out.

113
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:31,885
lt was?

114
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:34,054
Oh, yeah.

115
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:37,724
- l took him for a blood transfusion.
- We have the same type blood.

116
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:40,643
- Type O.
- Oh?

117
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:44,814
- I'll make it up to you.
- You're makin' it up pretty good so far.

118
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:49,402
As soon as we get a job, I'll take you
to the swellest restaurant in town.

119
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:53,365
How about it? Has Poliakoff got
anyzhing for us? We're desperate.

120
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:57,202
Well, it just so happens
he is looking for a bass.

121
00:13:57,327 --> 00:13:58,995
And a sax.

122
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,663
Right?

123
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:02,207
Right.

124
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:05,126
- What's the job?
- Three weeks in Florida.

125
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:09,214
At the Seminole-Ritz in Miami.
Transportation and expenses all paid.

126
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:12,550
Isn't she a bit of terrific?
Let's see Poliakoff.

127
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:16,304
- He's busy. You'll have to wait, boys.
- All right, we'll wait.

128
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,015
Look, Gladys, it's three weeks in Florida.

129
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,518
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.

130
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:24,729
They need a couple of girls
on sax and bass.

131
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:28,692
Whaddaya mean, who is it?
It's Poliakoff. l got a job for ya.

132
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:30,485
Gladys. Are ya there?

133
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:32,862
Gladys!

134
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:36,116
Meshugeneh.
Played 1 1 2 hours at a marathon dance.

135
00:14:36,324 --> 00:14:39,661
- Now she's in bed with nervous collapse.
- Tell her to move over.

136
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,329
And Cora Jackson?

137
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:44,999
Last l heard, she was playin'
with the Salvation Army.

138
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,210
Drexel 9044.

139
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:49,295
Those idiot broads.

140
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:53,258
Here we are, packed and ready to leave
for Miami, and what happens?

141
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:58,680
The sax runs off with a Bible salesman
and the bass gets pregnant.

142
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:00,765
Bienstock, l oughta fire you.

143
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:04,102
Me? I'm the manager,
not the night watchman.

144
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,896
Hello. Let me talk to Bessie Malone.

145
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:09,607
What's she doing in Philadelphia?

146
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:12,110
On the level?

147
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:15,030
Bessie let her hair grow
and is playing with Stokowski.

148
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:18,908
- Black Bottom Bessie?
- Schpielt zich mit der Philharmonic.

149
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:20,994
How about Rosemary Schultz?

150
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:23,288
Slashed her wrists when Valentino died.

151
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:27,125
We might as well do the same
if we don't find two dames by tonight.

152
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,629
We don't care where you find them.
Just get them on that train by 8 o'clock.

153
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:35,675
The moment anyzhing turns up,
I'll give you a tinkle.

154
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:38,595
Bye, Sig. l wonder
if I've got room for another ulcer.

155
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:41,014
Nellie, get me long-distance.

156
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:45,602
- Sig, we wanna talk to you.
- About the Florida job.

157
00:15:45,685 --> 00:15:48,104
- Nellie told us about it.
- Not too late, are we?

158
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:50,607
What are ya? Comedians? Get out.

159
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:53,610
The William Morris Agency in New York.

160
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:57,489
- You need a bass and a sax?
- The instruments are right but you're not.

161
00:15:57,572 --> 00:15:58,948
I wanna speak to Mr Morris.

162
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:01,659
- What's wrong with us?
- You're the wrong shape.

163
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:05,914
- What do you want? Hunchbacks?
- It's not the backs that worry me.

164
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:07,499
What kind of a band is it?

165
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:10,001
- You gotta be under 25.
- We could pass for that.

166
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:11,670
- And blond.
- We could dye our hair.

167
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:13,129
And you gotta be girls.

168
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:14,464
No, we couldn't.

169
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:17,717
- Mr William Morris.
- You mean this is a girls' band?

170
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:21,346
Yeah. Good old Nellie.
l could wring her neck.

171
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:23,848
Let's talk this over. Why couldn't we do it?

172
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:27,185
When we worked in the gypsy tearoom,
we wore gold earrings.

173
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:30,647
When you booked us with
the Hawaiian band, we wore grass skirts.

174
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:33,983
- What's with him? He drinks?
- No, he ain't eatin' so good.

175
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,152
His empty stomach has gone to his head.

176
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:40,323
Joe, three weeks in Florida. We could
borrow clothes from the chorus girls.

177
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:43,785
- You've flipped your wig.
- Now you're talking.

178
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:46,496
We get second-hand wigs, a little padding.

179
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:49,082
We call ourselves
Josephine and Geraldine.

180
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,544
Josephine and Geraldine... Come on.

181
00:16:52,752 --> 00:16:55,255
lf you wanna pick up
a little money tonight,

182
00:16:55,338 --> 00:16:59,426
at the University of lllinois
they're havin' a St Valentine's dance.

183
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:01,094
We'll take it.

184
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:04,014
$6 a man. Be on the campus
at Urbana at 8 o'clock.

185
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:06,808
All the way to Urbana
for a one-night stand?

186
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:10,061
It's $12. We can get
one of the overcoats out of hock.

187
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:13,815
Hello. Mr Morris?
This is Poliakoff in Chicago.

188
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:16,735
You don't have two girl musicians
available, do you?

189
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:18,403
A sax player and a bass?

190
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:23,408
- lf William Morris doesn't come through...
- Come on, Geraldine.

191
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:27,579
It's 100 miles. It's snowin' outside.
How do we get there?

192
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:29,539
- I'll find something.
- Like what?

193
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,167
Don't crowd me.

194
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,795
- How'd it go, girls?
- I oughta wring your neck.

195
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,631
Please, Jerry. That's no way to talk.

196
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:41,843
Nellie baby, what are you doin' tonight?

197
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:45,722
- Tonight? Why?
- Cos I've got some plans.

198
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:49,267
- I'm not doing anything.
- Really?

199
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:53,521
l just thought I'd go home
and have some cold pizza.

200
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,732
Then you'll be in all evening?

201
00:17:55,815 --> 00:17:57,609
Yes, Joe.

202
00:17:57,817 --> 00:17:59,903
Good. Then you won't
be needing your car.

203
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:02,113
My car? Why, you...

204
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:07,660
Isn't he a bit of terrific?

205
00:18:16,836 --> 00:18:20,382
We coulda had three weeks
in Florida, all expenses paid.

206
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:23,176
Lyin' in the sun, palm trees, flyin' fish...

207
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:25,387
Knock it off, will ya?

208
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:31,726
Possible straight, possible nothing,
and a pair of eights.

209
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:36,856
All right, drop 'em, you guys.

210
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,234
- Drop what?
- We came for a car.

211
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:41,945
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

212
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,075
Musicians.

213
00:18:47,283 --> 00:18:48,618
Wise guys.

214
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,246
OK, let's go. Aces bet.

215
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:54,249
It's a '25 Hupmobile, green, coupe... sir.

216
00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:56,751
- It's over here.
- Yeah, over here.

217
00:18:56,876 --> 00:19:01,881
- Want some gas?
- Yeah, about 40 cents' worth, please.

218
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:05,427
- Put it on Miss Weinmeyer's bill?
- Yeah. Why not?

219
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,138
And while you're at it, fill it up.

220
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:20,233
All right, everybody. Hands up.

221
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:24,404
Face the wall.

222
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:28,992
You too, Toothpick.

223
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:31,077
Come on.

224
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:34,914
Come on.

225
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,220
Hey. Join us.

226
00:20:00,357 --> 00:20:02,776
OK, boss.

227
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:17,665
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.

228
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:21,836
- Spats, what are you doin' here?
- l just dropped in to pay my respects.

229
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:24,464
- You don't owe me nothin'.
- l wouldn't say that.

230
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:27,175
You recommended
my mortuary to your friends.

231
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:30,720
- l don't know what you mean.
- Now l got all those coffins on my hands.

232
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,474
- l hate to see 'em go to waste.
- l had nothin' to do with it.

233
00:20:34,557 --> 00:20:38,645
Too bad, Charlie.
You woulda had three eights.

234
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:45,318
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- No, Spats, no.

235
00:20:45,402 --> 00:20:47,487
No, Spats. Please, no.

236
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:56,246
l think I'm gonna be sick.

237
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:04,379
All right, come on outta there.

238
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:06,172
Come on.

239
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,675
Come on.

240
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:13,471
- We didn't see anyzhing. Did we?
- What? No. Not a thing.

241
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:17,475
Besides, it's none of our business
if you guys wanna bump each other off.

242
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:21,855
Say... Don't l know you two
from somewhere?

243
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:24,649
Oh, no. We're just a couple of musicians.

244
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:27,485
We came to pick up a car.
Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

245
00:21:27,694 --> 00:21:29,654
There's a dance tonight.

246
00:21:29,863 --> 00:21:32,157
- Come on, Jerry.
- Wait a minute.

247
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:36,745
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- Urbana. It's about 100 miles from here...

248
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:38,830
You're not goin' nowhere.

249
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:44,252
- We're not?
- l don't like no witnesses.

250
00:21:44,377 --> 00:21:47,714
- We won't breathe a word.
- You won't breathe nothin'.

251
00:21:47,922 --> 00:21:49,883
Not even air.

252
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:27,128
All right, boys, let's blow out of here.
We'll take care of those guys later.

253
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,977
l think they got me.

254
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,271
- They got the bull fiddle.
- No blood?

255
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:48,900
lf they catch us, there'll be blood
all over. Type O. Come on.

256
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,666
- Where are you running?
- As far away as possible.

257
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:09,462
It's not far enough. Those guys know us.
Every hood in Chicago will be after us.

258
00:23:22,892 --> 00:23:25,186
Quick, gimme a nickel.

259
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:29,899
You're gonna call the police?

260
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:33,445
We'd never live to testify
against Spats Colombo.

261
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:36,156
We gotta get out of town.
We could grow beards.

262
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:38,867
We will get out of town,
but we're gonna shave.

263
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,704
At a time like this? They wanna blast
our heads off, and you wanna shave.

264
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:45,206
- Shave our legs, stupid.
- Shave our legs...?

265
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,794
Hello. Mr Poliakoff?

266
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,548
l understand you're looking
for a couple of girl musicians.

267
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,319
Florida Limited leaving
on track one for Washington,

268
00:24:14,402 --> 00:24:17,739
Charleston, Savannah,
Jacksonville and Miami.

269
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:20,367
All aboard.

270
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:29,834
What now?

271
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:32,796
How do they keep their
balance in these things?

272
00:24:32,962 --> 00:24:36,883
Must be the way the weight
is distributed. Now come on.

273
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:39,052
lt is so draughty.

274
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,262
They must catch cold all the time.

275
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,265
- Quit stalling. We'll miss the train.
- l feel naked.

276
00:24:44,474 --> 00:24:48,645
- l feel like everybody's starin' at me.
- With those legs? Are you crazy?

277
00:24:58,238 --> 00:25:01,074
It's no use. We're not gonna
get away with it, Joe.

278
00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:05,036
My name is Josephine, and this was
your idea in the first place.

279
00:25:28,268 --> 00:25:31,521
Look at that. Look how she moves.

280
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:34,232
That's just like Jell-O on springs.

281
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:37,652
They must have some sort of
built-in motor or something.

282
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:40,071
l tell ya, it's a whole different sex.

283
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:42,866
Nobody's asking you to have a baby.

284
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:46,119
As soon as we're in Florida
we'll blow this whole setup.

285
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:48,079
You will not talk me into...

286
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:52,042
Extra. Extra. Seven slaughtered
in North Side garage.

287
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,669
Fear of bloody aftermath. Extra. Extra.

288
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:59,466
- You talked me into it. Let's go.
- Attagirl, Geraldine.

289
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,385
- Rosella.
- Fiddle.

290
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:04,471
- Move along, Dolores.
- Trombone.

291
00:26:04,554 --> 00:26:06,973
- Hey, Olga, how's your back?
- Trumpet.

292
00:26:09,893 --> 00:26:12,604
- Here we are.
- Are you two from the Poliakoff Agency?

293
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:15,523
- Yes. We're the new girls.
- Brand new.

294
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:19,778
This is our manager, Mr Bienstock.
And I'm Sweet Sue.

295
00:26:20,403 --> 00:26:22,280
My name is Josephine.

296
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:24,699
I'm Daphne.

297
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,953
Saxophone, bass. Am l glad to see
you girls. You saved our lives.

298
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,830
Likewise, I'm sure.

299
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,041
Where did you girls play before?

300
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:36,378
Here, there and... around, and...

301
00:26:36,586 --> 00:26:40,840
We spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

302
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,259
All aboard.

303
00:26:43,343 --> 00:26:45,428
You're in berths 7 and 7A.

304
00:26:45,553 --> 00:26:46,596
7 and 7A.

305
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,682
- Thanks ever so.
- You're welcome.

306
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,850
Oh. The feeling's mutual.

307
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,230
- Upsy-daisy.
- Fresh.

308
00:26:55,355 --> 00:26:58,274
Looks like Poliakoff sent
a couple of real ladies.

309
00:26:58,358 --> 00:27:01,695
You'd better tell the other girls
to watch their language.

310
00:27:11,204 --> 00:27:12,664
What are you...?

311
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:14,416
Daphne?

312
00:27:14,624 --> 00:27:17,460
l never did like the name Geraldine.

313
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:27,345
Hi. I'm the bass fiddle.
Just call me Daphne.

314
00:27:29,222 --> 00:27:31,725
My name is Josephine. Sax.

315
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,438
- Welcome to No Man's Land.
- You'll be sorry.

316
00:27:36,646 --> 00:27:40,066
- Take off your corsets and spread out.
- Oh, l don't wear one myself.

317
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:42,277
- Don't you bulge?
- Bulge? Me?

318
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,905
l have the most divine seamstress.
Comes in just once a month.

319
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:49,617
- She is so inexpensive and she told...
- Come on, Daphne.

320
00:27:49,784 --> 00:27:53,163
Say, do you know the one
about the girl tuba player

321
00:27:53,246 --> 00:27:56,166
who was stranded on an island
with a one-legged jockey?

322
00:27:56,291 --> 00:28:00,337
- No. How does it go?
- Cut it out, girls. No rough talk.

323
00:28:00,462 --> 00:28:04,299
They went to a conservatory.

324
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:10,764
How about that talent, huh?

325
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,683
- Like fallin' into a tub of butter.
- Watch it, Daphne.

326
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:17,979
When l was a kid, Joe, l dreamed l was
locked up overnight in a pastry shop.

327
00:28:18,188 --> 00:28:20,273
And there was goodies all around.

328
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:25,070
Jelly rolls, mocha clairs
and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts...

329
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:28,615
Listen to me: no butter, no pastry.
We're on a diet.

330
00:28:28,698 --> 00:28:30,784
Yeah, sure, Joe.

331
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,620
Not there. That's the emergency brake.

332
00:28:35,372 --> 00:28:37,582
Now you've done it.

333
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:41,628
- Done what?
- You tore off one of my chests.

334
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:45,090
- You'd better go get it fixed.
- You'd better come help me.

335
00:28:53,223 --> 00:28:55,100
This way, Daphne.

336
00:28:55,308 --> 00:28:58,228
Now you tore the other one.

337
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:12,075
Terribly sorry.

338
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,369
It's OK. l was scared it was Sweet Sue.

339
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:17,080
- You won't tell anybody, will you?
- Tell what?

340
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:20,542
lf they catch me once more,
they'll kick me out of the band.

341
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,587
Are you the replacement
for the bass and sax?

342
00:29:24,713 --> 00:29:26,798
That's us. And I'm Daphne.

343
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:28,883
This is Joe... sephine.

344
00:29:29,092 --> 00:29:30,844
Come in.

345
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:32,846
I'm Sugar Cane.

346
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:35,974
- Sugar Cane?
- l changed it from Sugar Kowalczyk.

347
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:39,936
- Polish?
- Yes. l come from this musical family.

348
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,939
My mother's a piano teacher.
My father was a conductor.

349
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:46,818
- Where did he conduct?
- On the Baltimore and Ohio.

350
00:29:49,404 --> 00:29:52,449
l play the ukulele, and l sing, too.

351
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:56,077
l don't have much of a voice,
but this isn't much of a band, either.

352
00:29:56,286 --> 00:29:58,163
I'm only with them cos I'm running away.

353
00:29:58,288 --> 00:30:02,334
- Running away from what?
- Oh, don't get me started on that.

354
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:05,170
Hey, you want some? It's bourbon.

355
00:30:05,253 --> 00:30:08,089
I'll take a rain check.

356
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:13,303
l don't want you to think I'm a drinker.
l can stop if l want to, only l don't want to.

357
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:16,097
- Especially when I'm blue.
- We understand.

358
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:20,268
All the girls drink. But I'm the one
that gets caught. Story of my life.

359
00:30:20,393 --> 00:30:23,521
l always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

360
00:30:28,818 --> 00:30:30,487
Are my seams straight?

361
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,781
I'll say.

362
00:30:34,157 --> 00:30:37,369
- See you around, girls.
- Bye, Sugar.

363
00:30:37,494 --> 00:30:39,871
We have been playing
with the wrong bands.

364
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,791
- Down, Daphne.
- See the shape of that liquor cabinet?

365
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:45,835
Forget it. One false move
and we're off the train.

366
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,172
Then it's the police,
the papers and the Mob in Chicago.

367
00:30:49,255 --> 00:30:52,509
Boy, would l love to
borrow a cup of that Sugar.

368
00:30:52,592 --> 00:30:54,177
Look...

369
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:58,431
No pastry, no butter - and no Sugar.

370
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,934
You tore 'em again.

371
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:43,226
Hey, Sheboygan. What was your last job?
Playing square dances?

372
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,395
No. Funerals.

373
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:49,482
Would you mind rejoining the living?
Goose it up a little.

374
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:51,568
We'll try.

375
00:31:51,651 --> 00:31:54,696
How did those holes get there?

376
00:31:54,904 --> 00:31:57,407
Those?

377
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,492
l don't know.

378
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:01,161
Mice?

379
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:05,540
All right, girls. Let's take it from the top.
And put a little heat under it.

380
00:33:10,897 --> 00:33:12,982
Bienstock!

381
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:15,193
Yes, Sue?

382
00:33:15,402 --> 00:33:19,364
l thought l made it clear
that l don't want any drinking in this outfit.

383
00:33:25,078 --> 00:33:27,580
All right, girls. Who does this belong to?

384
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,791
Come on, now. Speak up.

385
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:32,502
- Sugar, l warned you...
- Please, Mr Bienstock.

386
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:35,839
I've had it. ln Kansas you smuggled
liquor in a shampoo bottle.

387
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,341
Before that you had
a pint in your ukelele...

388
00:33:38,425 --> 00:33:40,218
Mr Bienstock, could l have my flask?

389
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:43,221
Sure. Pack your things.
At the next station... Your flask?

390
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:47,308
Yes. Just a little bourbon.
Must have slipped through.

391
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,643
Give me that.

392
00:33:48,768 --> 00:33:51,688
Didn't you girls say
you went to a conservatory?

393
00:33:51,771 --> 00:33:55,942
- Oh, yes. For a whole year.
- l thought you said three years.

394
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:58,862
We got time off for good behaviour.

395
00:33:58,987 --> 00:34:04,909
There are two things l will not put up with
during working hours: liquor and men.

396
00:34:05,535 --> 00:34:08,246
- Men?
- Don't worry about that.

397
00:34:08,371 --> 00:34:10,457
We wouldn't be caught dead with men.

398
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:13,877
Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands.

399
00:34:14,002 --> 00:34:17,213
And they all just want
one thing from a girl.

400
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:20,300
l beg your pardon, miss.

401
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:23,428
All right, girls. From the top again.

402
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:04,719
- Hortense, dear, good night.
- Good night, Daphne.

403
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:07,222
- Maude, sweet dreams.
- Good night, Daphne.

404
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,182
Good night, Gloria.

405
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,893
Dolores, you sleep tight, you hear?

406
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:16,481
- Nighty-night, Emily.
- Toodle-oo.

407
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:21,069
How about that ''toodle-oo''.

408
00:35:21,194 --> 00:35:25,365
Steady, boy.
Just keep tellin' yourself you're a girl.

409
00:35:25,448 --> 00:35:28,159
- I'm a girl.
- You're a girl.

410
00:35:28,368 --> 00:35:31,705
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

411
00:35:32,038 --> 00:35:33,581
I'm a...

412
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,046
Get a load of that rhyzhm section.

413
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,257
I'm a girl.

414
00:35:42,465 --> 00:35:44,426
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

415
00:35:44,634 --> 00:35:46,636
I'm a girl.

416
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,181
Good night, Sugar.

417
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:56,312
Good night, honey.

418
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,400
Honey? Hey, she called me ''honey''.

419
00:36:00,483 --> 00:36:02,152
Ooh, honey.

420
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,697
- What are you doin'?
- Just makin' sure honey stays in her hive.

421
00:36:05,822 --> 00:36:08,116
There'll be no buzzin' around tonight.

422
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,453
Supposin' l gotta go...
like for a drink of water or something.

423
00:36:11,661 --> 00:36:14,039
- Fight it.
- Well, suppose l lose.

424
00:36:14,164 --> 00:36:18,001
- Suppose it's an emergency.
- Pull the emergency brake.

425
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:23,548
Hey, Bienstock. You know, there's
something funny about those new girls.

426
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:27,385
- Funny? ln what way?
- l don't know, but l can feel it right here.

427
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:31,264
Having an ulcer is like
having a burglar alarm go off inside you.

428
00:36:31,473 --> 00:36:34,184
You watch your ulcers,
I'll watch those two.

429
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:38,563
OK, everybody go to bed.
Good night, girls.

430
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:41,483
- Good night, Daphne.
- Good night, Josephine.

431
00:36:50,116 --> 00:36:52,952
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

432
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:54,829
l wish l were dead.

433
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm a girl... I'm a girl... I'm a girl...

434
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,419
Daphne.

435
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,723
Sugar.

436
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:58,893
l wanted to thank you for
covering up for me. You're a real pal.

437
00:38:01,271 --> 00:38:03,273
It's nothing.

438
00:38:03,356 --> 00:38:05,567
l just thought that
us girls should stick together.

439
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,695
lf it wasn't for you,
they'd have kicked me off the train.

440
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:11,906
I'd be out in the middle of nowhere,
sitting on my ukulele.

441
00:38:13,283 --> 00:38:15,160
It's freezing outside.

442
00:38:15,368 --> 00:38:18,288
l mean, when l think about you
and your poor ukulele...

443
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,999
lf there's ever anyzhing l can do for you...

444
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:23,710
l can think of a million things.

445
00:38:26,421 --> 00:38:28,798
That's one of 'em.

446
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,509
It's Sweet Sue.

447
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:45,398
l don't want her to know we're in cahoots.

448
00:38:45,482 --> 00:38:49,152
Oh, well, we won't tell anybody.
Not even Josephine.

449
00:38:49,235 --> 00:38:52,364
Maybe I'd better stay here
till she goes back to sleep.

450
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:55,075
You stay here as long as you like.

451
00:38:57,786 --> 00:38:59,871
I'm not crowding you, am l?

452
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:02,082
No. It's nice and cosy.

453
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:07,796
When l was a little girl, on cold nights
like this, I'd crawl into bed with my sister.

454
00:39:08,004 --> 00:39:11,549
We'd cuddle up under the covers and
pretend we were lost in a dark cave

455
00:39:11,758 --> 00:39:14,386
and were trying to find our way out.

456
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:16,888
Very interesting.

457
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:21,267
- Anyzhing wrong?
- No, no. Not a thing.

458
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:25,647
You poor thing. You're trembling all over.

459
00:39:25,855 --> 00:39:27,816
That's ridiculous.

460
00:39:28,024 --> 00:39:30,652
- Your head's hot.
- That's ridiculous.

461
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:34,197
- You've got cold feet.
- Isn't that ridiculous?

462
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,366
Here, let me warm them up a little.

463
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:40,453
- There. Isn't that better?
- Yes. I'm a girl... I'm a girl...

464
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:42,831
- What?
- I'm a very sick girl.

465
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:45,875
- I'd better go before l catch something.
- Not that sick.

466
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,961
I've got very low resistance.

467
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:51,923
Sugar, if you feel you're
coming down with something, my dear,

468
00:39:52,132 --> 00:39:55,051
the best thing in the world
is a shot of whiskey.

469
00:39:55,135 --> 00:39:58,054
- You've got some?
- l know where to get it.

470
00:39:58,179 --> 00:39:59,723
Don't move.

471
00:40:00,473 --> 00:40:02,767
- Hold on.
- OK.

472
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:26,541
Up. Up.

473
00:40:32,047 --> 00:40:34,257
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

474
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:37,385
- How's the bottle?
- Half-full.

475
00:40:38,845 --> 00:40:40,930
- You'd better get some cups.
- Cups?

476
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,111
Oh, l tell you, my dear,
this is the only way to travel.

477
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:57,947
Put on the lights.
l can't see what I'm doing.

478
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,575
No lights. We don't want them to know.

479
00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:03,286
- But l might spill some.
- So spill it.

480
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:06,414
Spills, thrills, laughs and games.

481
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:09,209
This may even turn out
to be a surprise party.

482
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,711
- What's the surprise?
- Not yet.

483
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,339
- When?
- Better have a drink first.

484
00:41:14,422 --> 00:41:16,508
That'll put hair on your chest.

485
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:18,718
No fair guessing.

486
00:41:20,053 --> 00:41:22,055
Is this a private clambake?

487
00:41:22,138 --> 00:41:24,140
It's private. Please, go away.

488
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,518
Dolores, do you still have that vermouth?

489
00:41:26,643 --> 00:41:28,311
- Sure.
- Who needs vermouth?

490
00:41:28,395 --> 00:41:31,439
We've got bourbon.
We can make Manhattans.

491
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:33,733
Manhattans? At this time of night?

492
00:41:33,817 --> 00:41:36,444
- Bring the cocktail shaker.
- Oh, Sugar.

493
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:38,613
You're gonna spoil my surprise.

494
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:42,909
- Hey, honey, what's up?
- Party in upper 7.

495
00:41:42,992 --> 00:41:47,080
- I'll get cheese and crackers.
- I'll get a shaker, you get a corkscrew.

496
00:41:47,163 --> 00:41:49,457
Hey, Rosella, there's a party in upper 7.

497
00:41:49,582 --> 00:41:51,459
- You got a corkscrew?
- Stella has.

498
00:41:51,668 --> 00:41:54,170
Go get some paper cups.

499
00:41:54,254 --> 00:41:56,881
Hey, there's a party in upper 7.

500
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:05,098
- Here's the vermouth.
- This is a private party. Please go away.

501
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:07,934
l brought some cheese and crackers.

502
00:42:08,018 --> 00:42:11,896
- Will ten cups be enough?
- This is a party for two. Ten cups?

503
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:17,527
- Please, girls. Will you stop this?
- Could you use some Southern Comfort?

504
00:42:18,653 --> 00:42:21,990
Girls, you'll wake up
the neighbours downstairs.

505
00:42:22,615 --> 00:42:24,617
Watch that corkscrew.

506
00:42:24,826 --> 00:42:27,829
- Here's a cracker.
- No crackers in bed.

507
00:42:27,954 --> 00:42:30,457
Will you girls go away
and form your own party?

508
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,542
Here's the cocktail shaker.

509
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:35,962
- I wish we had ice.
- Easy on the vermouth.

510
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:40,258
1 3 girls in a berth is bad luck.
1 2 of you will have to get out.

511
00:42:40,342 --> 00:42:43,803
- Pass me the peanut butter.
- Anyone for salami?

512
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:46,306
No more food.
I'll have ants in the morning.

513
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,603
Hey. Have you got any
maraschino cherries on you?

514
00:42:51,811 --> 00:42:53,813
Never mind.

515
00:42:59,861 --> 00:43:01,821
Maraschino cherries?

516
00:43:10,997 --> 00:43:12,582
What's going on here?

517
00:43:12,665 --> 00:43:16,419
Daphne. Daphne, where are you?

518
00:43:17,045 --> 00:43:20,090
It's not my fault. l didn't invite 'em.

519
00:43:20,173 --> 00:43:22,676
Come on, girls, break it up.

520
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:26,638
You heard Josephine.
Girls. Everybody out.

521
00:43:27,597 --> 00:43:30,100
- Not you, Sugar.
- I'm going to get some ice.

522
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:32,268
Get out.

523
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:35,188
That's right, Sugar.
Now the rest of you. Out.

524
00:43:36,856 --> 00:43:39,567
- Come on in. The water's fine.
- Have a Manhattan.

525
00:43:39,693 --> 00:43:43,238
- Pipe down. We'll all be fired.
- Sugar. Don't leave me here alone.

526
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:45,949
Come on, kids. It's two o'clock.

527
00:43:46,032 --> 00:43:49,285
You've had your fun.
The party's over. Everybody go home.

528
00:43:50,203 --> 00:43:53,456
- What's this?
- Josephine, over here before it melts.

529
00:44:00,213 --> 00:44:02,507
Put it here.

530
00:44:02,632 --> 00:44:05,010
Sugar, you're gonna
get into a lot of trouble.

531
00:44:05,218 --> 00:44:06,886
You'd better keep a lookout.

532
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:09,139
lf Bienstock catches you again...

533
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,433
What's the matter with you, anyway?

534
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:13,518
I'm not very bright, l guess.

535
00:44:13,727 --> 00:44:15,895
l wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.

536
00:44:16,104 --> 00:44:20,900
No, just dumb. lf l had any brains, l
wouldn't be with this crummy girls' band.

537
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:22,902
Well, why'd you take this job?

538
00:44:22,986 --> 00:44:25,822
l used to sing with male bands,
but l can't afford it any more.

539
00:44:25,905 --> 00:44:28,408
Have you ever been with a male band?

540
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:29,993
Who, me?

541
00:44:30,076 --> 00:44:31,661
That's what I'm running away from.

542
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:35,415
l worked with six in the last two years.
Oh, brother.

543
00:44:35,623 --> 00:44:37,500
- Rough?
- I'll say.

544
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:40,628
- You can't trust those guys.
- l can't trust myself.

545
00:44:40,712 --> 00:44:43,340
l have this thing about saxophone players.

546
00:44:43,423 --> 00:44:45,425
Especially tenor sax.

547
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:50,930
- Really?
- l don't know why, but they curdle me.

548
00:44:51,139 --> 00:44:54,601
All they have to do is play eight bars of
''Come To Me, My Melancholy Baby''

549
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:58,563
and l get goose-pimply all over,
and l come to 'em.

550
00:44:58,646 --> 00:45:00,940
- That so?
- Every time.

551
00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:04,819
You know, l play tenor sax.

552
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:08,865
But you're a girl - thank goodness.
That's why l joined this band.

553
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:13,244
Safety first. Anyzhing
to get away from those bums.

554
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:16,581
You don't know what they're like.
You fall for 'em.

555
00:45:16,706 --> 00:45:19,709
You think this is gonna be
the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin.

556
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:22,337
The next thing you know,
they're borrowing money from you,

557
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,674
spending it on other dames
and betting on horses.

558
00:45:25,882 --> 00:45:27,217
You don't say.

559
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:30,679
Then one morning you wake up,
the guy's gone, the sax's gone.

560
00:45:30,887 --> 00:45:35,475
All that's left is a pair of old socks
and a tube of toothpaste all squeezed out.

561
00:45:35,684 --> 00:45:40,063
You pull yourself together, you go on to
the next job, the next saxophone player.

562
00:45:40,146 --> 00:45:42,357
It's the same thing all over again.

563
00:45:42,565 --> 00:45:46,194
You see what l mean? Not very bright.

564
00:45:46,403 --> 00:45:48,488
Brains aren't everyzhing.

565
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:52,784
l can tell you one thing. It's not
gonna happen to me again - ever.

566
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:55,912
I'm tired of getting
the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

567
00:45:55,995 --> 00:46:00,083
lce. What's keeping the ice?
The natives are getting restless.

568
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:03,003
- How about a couple of drinks for us?
- Sure.

569
00:46:04,337 --> 00:46:07,590
- You know, I'm gonna be 25 in June.
- You are?

570
00:46:07,674 --> 00:46:10,385
That's a quarter of a century.
Makes a girl think.

571
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,178
- About what?
- The future.

572
00:46:12,262 --> 00:46:15,724
You know - like a husband. That's why
I'm glad we're going to Florida.

573
00:46:15,932 --> 00:46:19,144
- What's in Florida?
- Millionaires. Flocks of them.

574
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:21,646
They all go south for the winter, like birds.

575
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:25,108
- Gonna catch yourself a rich bird?
- l don't care how rich he is.

576
00:46:25,191 --> 00:46:29,362
As long as he has a yacht, a private
railroad car and his own toothpaste.

577
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:32,615
- You're entitled.
- Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.

578
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:36,578
With money like Rockefeller and
shoulders like Johnny Weissmuller.

579
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:39,372
- l want mine to wear glasses.
- Glasses?

580
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:43,460
Men who wear glasses are so much
more gentle and sweet and helpless.

581
00:46:43,543 --> 00:46:46,796
- Haven't you ever noticed it?
- Yeah, now that you mention.

582
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:49,591
They get those weak eyes from reading.

583
00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:54,304
Those long, tiny little columns
in The Wall Street Journal.

584
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:58,141
That bass fiddle, she sure
knows how to throw a party.

585
00:46:58,266 --> 00:47:01,186
Hot-diggety-dog.

586
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:03,772
Well, happy days.

587
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:09,527
l hope this time you wind up
with the sweet end of the lollipop.

588
00:47:11,279 --> 00:47:13,365
So the one-legged jockey said...

589
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:15,575
What did he say?

590
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:21,289
So the one-legged jockey said: ''Don't
worry about me, baby. l ride side-saddle.''

591
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:30,840
I'm terribly sorry. l seem to have hiccups.

592
00:47:30,924 --> 00:47:33,343
Hey, let's rub some ice on her neck.

593
00:47:33,426 --> 00:47:35,512
l think... Ow. You dropped it.

594
00:47:35,637 --> 00:47:37,305
Oh, that's cold.

595
00:47:37,514 --> 00:47:41,142
- Oh, no, please. Don't do that.
- She's ticklish.

596
00:47:44,688 --> 00:47:47,399
Help. Please. Help. Help.

597
00:47:47,524 --> 00:47:48,858
Josephine.

598
00:47:48,983 --> 00:47:52,529
Please stop that. Stop that.

599
00:48:03,164 --> 00:48:05,250
- What happened?
- Search me.

600
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,335
l mean, I'll see.

601
00:48:17,846 --> 00:48:20,265
All right, what's goin' on around here?

602
00:48:20,557 --> 00:48:22,350
Bienstock!

603
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:25,353
Are we in Florida?

604
00:49:10,398 --> 00:49:11,983
Sugar?

605
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:14,486
Here. I'll carry the instruments.

606
00:49:14,694 --> 00:49:17,072
- Thank you, Daphne.
- Thank you, Daphne.

607
00:49:17,197 --> 00:49:19,491
Isn't she a sweetheart?

608
00:49:25,747 --> 00:49:27,707
How do you do?

609
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:32,087
Zowie!

610
00:49:32,295 --> 00:49:35,757
There they are. More millionaires
than you can shake a stick at.

611
00:49:35,965 --> 00:49:37,842
l bet there isn't one under 75.

612
00:49:37,926 --> 00:49:41,262
That's three quarters of a century.
Makes a girl think.

613
00:49:41,471 --> 00:49:44,099
Let's hope they brought
their grandsons along.

614
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:45,767
Yes.

615
00:49:54,818 --> 00:49:56,820
Pardon me, miss.

616
00:49:58,571 --> 00:50:00,573
- May l?
- Help yourself.

617
00:50:00,782 --> 00:50:03,493
I'm Osgood Fielding the Third.

618
00:50:03,576 --> 00:50:05,662
I'm Cinderella the Second.

619
00:50:05,787 --> 00:50:10,375
lf there's one thing l admire,
it's a girl with a shapely ankle.

620
00:50:11,084 --> 00:50:13,086
Me, too. Bye-bye.

621
00:50:13,586 --> 00:50:16,715
- Let me carry one of the instruments.
- Oh, thank you.

622
00:50:16,923 --> 00:50:19,342
Aren't you a sweetheart.

623
00:50:24,139 --> 00:50:27,350
lt certainly is delightful
having young blood around here.

624
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:28,935
Personally, I'm type O.

625
00:50:29,144 --> 00:50:31,730
I've always been fascinated
by show business.

626
00:50:31,938 --> 00:50:33,314
ls that so?

627
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:36,735
As a matter of fact,
it's cost my family quite a bit of money.

628
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,654
- Oh, you invest in shows?
- Showgirls.

629
00:50:39,863 --> 00:50:42,741
- I've been married seven or eight times.
- You're not sure?

630
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:44,826
Mama is keeping score.

631
00:50:45,035 --> 00:50:47,746
- She's getting annoyed with me.
- l wouldn't wonder.

632
00:50:47,954 --> 00:50:51,708
So when George White's Scandals
opened, she packed me off to Florida.

633
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:56,588
She thinks I'm out on my yacht,
deep-sea fishing.

634
00:50:57,547 --> 00:51:01,926
Well, pull in your reel, Mr Fielding.
You're barking up the wrong fish.

635
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:06,306
lf l promise not to be a naughty boy,
how about dinner?

636
00:51:06,514 --> 00:51:09,517
- I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.
- Oh, of course.

637
00:51:09,726 --> 00:51:12,228
- Which instrument do you play?
- Bull fiddle.

638
00:51:12,354 --> 00:51:13,813
Oh, fascinating.

639
00:51:13,897 --> 00:51:16,191
Do you use a bow, or do you just pluck it?

640
00:51:17,233 --> 00:51:20,362
Most of the time, l slap it.

641
00:51:20,487 --> 00:51:22,989
You must be quite a girl.

642
00:51:23,073 --> 00:51:24,866
Wanna bet?

643
00:51:25,075 --> 00:51:28,828
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer.
Sort of a contortionist.

644
00:51:28,912 --> 00:51:32,374
She could smoke a cigarette
while holding it between her toes.

645
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:33,917
Zowie!

646
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:36,127
- But Mama broke it up.
- Why?

647
00:51:36,211 --> 00:51:38,421
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.

648
00:51:40,715 --> 00:51:42,801
- Bye-bye, Mr Fielding.
- Bye-bye?

649
00:51:42,884 --> 00:51:45,929
- This is where l get off.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

650
00:51:46,137 --> 00:51:48,098
You don't get off that easy.

651
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:50,809
All right, driver.
Once around the park, slowly.

652
00:51:51,017 --> 00:51:53,436
And keep your eyes on the road.

653
00:52:02,821 --> 00:52:05,740
What kind of a girl
do you think l am, Mr Fielding?

654
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,328
- Oh, please. lt won't happen again.
- I'll say.

655
00:52:10,537 --> 00:52:13,039
- Please, come back.
- I'll walk, thank you.

656
00:52:13,123 --> 00:52:15,208
Please, miss...

657
00:52:17,836 --> 00:52:19,295
Zowie!

658
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:22,424
All right, girls. Here are
your room assignments.

659
00:52:22,632 --> 00:52:25,343
My glasses. Where are my glasses?

660
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:28,555
Olga and Mary Lou are in 41 2.

661
00:52:28,763 --> 00:52:32,225
And, Mary Lou, do up your kimono
when you ring for room service.

662
00:52:32,308 --> 00:52:34,519
Josephine and Daphne are in 41 3.

663
00:52:34,602 --> 00:52:37,647
- Dolores and Sugar in 414.
- Me and Sugar?

664
00:52:37,856 --> 00:52:40,150
What did you expect?
A one-legged jockey?

665
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:41,901
Rosella and Emily in 41 5...

666
00:52:42,861 --> 00:52:45,155
- l wish they'd put us in the same room.
- So do l.

667
00:52:45,363 --> 00:52:48,908
But don't worry about it, Sugar.
We'll see a lot of each other.

668
00:52:50,243 --> 00:52:54,539
414... That's the same room number
l had in Cincinnati,

669
00:52:54,748 --> 00:52:56,833
my last time around with a male band.

670
00:52:56,916 --> 00:52:58,793
What a heel he was.

671
00:52:58,918 --> 00:53:02,672
- A saxophone player?
- What else? Was l ever crazy about him.

672
00:53:02,756 --> 00:53:05,675
At two in the morning he sent me down
for hot dogs and potato salad.

673
00:53:05,884 --> 00:53:08,595
They were out of potato salad,
so l brought coleslaw.

674
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,474
- So he threw it right in my face.
- Forget saxophone players.

675
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:15,268
You're gonna meet
a millionaire - a young one.

676
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:18,813
- What makes you so sure?
- My feminine intuition.

677
00:53:27,072 --> 00:53:29,032
Oh. Are these your bags?

678
00:53:30,492 --> 00:53:33,411
- And that one, too.
- OK, doll.

679
00:53:34,454 --> 00:53:37,999
- l suppose you want a tip.
- Forget it, doll.

680
00:53:38,124 --> 00:53:43,213
After all, you work here and l work here.
It's nice to have you with the organisation.

681
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:45,632
- Bye-bye.
- Listen, doll.

682
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,635
- What time do you get off tonight?
- Why?

683
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,971
I'm workin' the night shift and
l got a bottle of gin stashed away.

684
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:55,642
- When there's a lull...
- Aren't you a little young for that, sonny?

685
00:53:55,725 --> 00:53:59,646
Oh, you wanna see my driver's licence?

686
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,485
- Get lost, will you?
- That's the way l like 'em - big and sassy.

687
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,613
Oh, and... get rid of your roommate.

688
00:54:23,712 --> 00:54:25,505
- Dirty old man.
- What happened?

689
00:54:25,588 --> 00:54:28,842
- l got pinched in the elevator.
- See how the other half lives?

690
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:30,510
I'm not even pretty.

691
00:54:30,593 --> 00:54:34,889
They don't care. You're wearing a skirt.
It's like waving a red flag to a bull.

692
00:54:34,973 --> 00:54:37,809
I'm sick of being the flag.
l wanna be a bull again.

693
00:54:37,892 --> 00:54:39,894
- Let's blow.
- Blow where?

694
00:54:40,103 --> 00:54:43,440
You promised me that the minute
we hit Florida we'd beat it.

695
00:54:43,523 --> 00:54:47,193
- How can we? We're broke.
- We can find another band. A male band.

696
00:54:47,402 --> 00:54:52,615
Spats Colombo is looking for us
in every male band in the country.

697
00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:56,036
- It's humiliating.
- So you got pinched. So what?

698
00:54:56,244 --> 00:54:58,955
Would you rather be
picking lead out of your navel?

699
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,041
But how long can we keep this up?

700
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:03,668
What's the beef? We're sittin' pretty.

701
00:55:03,877 --> 00:55:07,297
Look. We get room and board.
We're getting paid every week. Look.

702
00:55:07,422 --> 00:55:09,716
Look at the palm trees, flying fish...

703
00:55:09,924 --> 00:55:12,093
What are you givin' me with flyin' fish?

704
00:55:12,218 --> 00:55:14,721
l know why you wanna stay.
You're after Sugar.

705
00:55:14,804 --> 00:55:17,724
- Me, after Sugar?
- l saw the both of you in that bus.

706
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:21,811
All lovey-dovey and whisperin'
and borrowin' each other's lipstick.

707
00:55:21,895 --> 00:55:24,522
- What are you saying? Me and Sugar?
- You and Sugar.

708
00:55:24,731 --> 00:55:28,360
- We're just like sisters.
- Well, I'm your fairy godmother.

709
00:55:28,485 --> 00:55:31,071
And I'm gonna keep an eye on you.

710
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:34,407
Are you decent?

711
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,081
Come in.

712
00:55:41,831 --> 00:55:44,959
You girls seen a brown bag
with a white stripe and my initials?

713
00:55:45,043 --> 00:55:46,711
lt has all my resort clothes.

714
00:55:46,836 --> 00:55:49,339
- No, we haven't.
- l can't understand it.

715
00:55:49,422 --> 00:55:52,133
First my glasses disappear,
then one of my suitcases.

716
00:55:52,258 --> 00:55:54,219
- Where's my ukulele?
- Now a ukulele.

717
00:55:54,344 --> 00:55:58,932
- There must be a sneak thief around here.
- Oh. Here it is. Hi, Sug.

718
00:55:59,015 --> 00:56:02,894
- We're going for a swim. Coming?
- A swim. Oh, you betcha.

719
00:56:03,103 --> 00:56:05,814
You haven't got a bathing suit.

720
00:56:05,897 --> 00:56:07,774
l don't have one either.

721
00:56:07,982 --> 00:56:11,861
- She doesn't have one either. You don't?
- We can rent some at the bathhouse.

722
00:56:11,945 --> 00:56:15,490
- How about you, Josephine?
- l think I'll soak in a hot tub.

723
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:19,786
- On a day like this? It's lovely out.
- Yeah, well, let her soak. Come on.

724
00:56:19,869 --> 00:56:23,206
- Don't get burned, Daphne.
- Oh, I've got suntan lotion.

725
00:56:23,331 --> 00:56:28,753
See? She'll rub it on me, I'll rub it on her,
we'll rub it on each other. Bye-bye.

726
00:57:30,607 --> 00:57:34,694
Daphne. Cut it out.
What do you think you're doing?

727
00:57:34,903 --> 00:57:37,822
Just a little trick
l picked up in the elevator.

728
00:57:37,906 --> 00:57:41,034
Ooh, look out. Here comes a big one.

729
00:58:11,272 --> 00:58:14,317
Daphne. l had no idea
you were such a big girl.

730
00:58:14,401 --> 00:58:17,112
You should've seen me
before l went on a diet.

731
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,322
l mean your shoulders and your arms.

732
00:58:19,531 --> 00:58:21,700
It's carrying that bull fiddle around.

733
00:58:21,908 --> 00:58:24,327
- There's one thing l envy you for.
- What's that?

734
00:58:24,536 --> 00:58:26,496
You're so flat-chested.

735
00:58:26,705 --> 00:58:29,541
Clothes hang better on you
than they do on me.

736
00:58:29,624 --> 00:58:31,626
Watch out, Daphne.

737
00:58:31,835 --> 00:58:34,337
Sugar, come on. Let's play ball.

738
00:58:35,797 --> 00:58:37,549
Junior, time for your nap.

739
00:58:37,757 --> 00:58:39,968
No. l wanna play.

740
00:58:40,176 --> 00:58:42,345
You heard your mother, Junior. Scram!

741
00:58:42,554 --> 00:58:45,265
This beach ain't big enough
for the both of us.

742
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:47,559
Mommy!

743
00:58:47,767 --> 00:58:49,019
Here we go.

744
00:58:49,144 --> 00:58:52,147
l like coffee, l like tea.

745
00:58:52,355 --> 00:58:56,026
How many boys are stuck on me?

746
00:58:56,526 --> 00:58:59,362
One, two, three,

747
00:58:59,571 --> 00:59:02,782
four, five, six, seven...

748
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:11,750
I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?

749
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:14,252
- l don't think so.
- l wish you'd make sure.

750
00:59:14,461 --> 00:59:16,463
Because when people find out who l am,

751
00:59:16,671 --> 00:59:21,468
they hire a shyster lawyer and sue me
for three quarters of a million dollars.

752
00:59:21,676 --> 00:59:25,096
- l won't sue you, no matter who you are.
- Thank you.

753
00:59:27,515 --> 00:59:29,476
- Who are you?
- Now, really!

754
00:59:31,895 --> 00:59:33,355
Sugar!

755
00:59:33,855 --> 00:59:35,732
Come on.

756
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,108
Honestly.

757
00:59:38,443 --> 00:59:40,236
Cheerio.

758
00:59:45,116 --> 00:59:48,161
- Haven't l seen you somewhere before?
- Not very likely.

759
00:59:48,244 --> 00:59:50,747
- Are you staying at the hotel?
- Not at all.

760
00:59:50,955 --> 00:59:52,957
Your face is familiar.

761
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:55,669
You may have seen it
in newspapers or magazines.

762
00:59:55,752 --> 00:59:58,588
- Vanity Fair.
- That must be it.

763
00:59:58,672 --> 01:00:02,342
Would you mind moving a little?
You're blocking my view.

764
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:03,593
Of what?

765
01:00:03,802 --> 01:00:07,847
They run up a red-and-white flag
on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.

766
01:00:08,056 --> 01:00:10,058
You own a yacht?

767
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:12,977
Which one is it? The big one?

768
01:00:13,687 --> 01:00:14,729
Certainly not.

769
01:00:14,938 --> 01:00:19,651
With all the world unrest, nobody should
have a yacht that sleeps more than 1 2.

770
01:00:19,734 --> 01:00:21,736
l quite agree.

771
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:24,030
Tell me, who runs up that flag?

772
01:00:24,114 --> 01:00:26,825
- Your wife?
- No, my flag steward.

773
01:00:27,033 --> 01:00:30,161
Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?

774
01:00:30,286 --> 01:00:32,414
No, my cocktail steward.

775
01:00:32,497 --> 01:00:34,916
Look, if you're interested in
whether l am married or not...

776
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:37,919
- Oh, I'm not interested at all.
- Well, I'm not.

777
01:00:38,545 --> 01:00:41,256
That's very interesting.

778
01:00:43,967 --> 01:00:46,803
- How's the stock market?
- Up, up, up.

779
01:00:46,886 --> 01:00:49,597
I'll bet while we were talking,
you made $100,000?

780
01:00:49,806 --> 01:00:51,808
Could be. You play the market?

781
01:00:51,891 --> 01:00:55,145
- No, the ukulele. And l sing, too.
- For your own amusement?

782
01:00:55,353 --> 01:00:57,313
We are appearing at the hotel.

783
01:00:57,439 --> 01:00:59,607
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.

784
01:00:59,733 --> 01:01:03,903
- You're society girls.
- Oh, yes, quite. Bryn Mawr, Vassar...

785
01:01:04,112 --> 01:01:06,197
We're just doing this for a lark.

786
01:01:06,823 --> 01:01:10,994
Syncopators. Does that mean you play
that very fast music... jazz?

787
01:01:11,077 --> 01:01:13,788
Yeah. Real hot.

788
01:01:13,913 --> 01:01:17,459
l guess some like it hot.
l personally prefer classical music.

789
01:01:18,293 --> 01:01:19,210
l do, too.

790
01:01:19,419 --> 01:01:24,549
As a matter of fact, l spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

791
01:01:24,632 --> 01:01:28,511
Good school. Your family
doesn't object to your career?

792
01:01:28,595 --> 01:01:32,057
They do indeed. Daddy threatened
to cut me off without a cent.

793
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,933
But l don't care. lt was such a bore.

794
01:01:34,017 --> 01:01:36,436
- Coming-out parties.
- lnauguration balls.

795
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:38,521
- Opening at the opera.
- Riding to hounds.

796
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:41,524
And always the same 400.

797
01:01:41,733 --> 01:01:44,444
It's amazing we never
ran into each other before.

798
01:01:44,569 --> 01:01:47,572
I'd have remembered
anybody as attractive as you.

799
01:01:47,697 --> 01:01:51,451
You're very kind. I'll bet
you're also gentle and helpless.

800
01:01:51,534 --> 01:01:52,994
l beg your pardon?

801
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,705
You see, l have a theory
about men who wear glasses.

802
01:01:55,914 --> 01:01:59,167
- What theory?
- I'll tell you when l know you better.

803
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,961
- What are you doing tonight?
- Tonight?

804
01:02:02,087 --> 01:02:05,090
Maybe you could come
to the hotel and hear us play.

805
01:02:05,298 --> 01:02:08,134
- I'd like to, but that would be difficult.
- Why?

806
01:02:08,218 --> 01:02:11,680
l only come ashore twice a day
when the tide goes out.

807
01:02:11,763 --> 01:02:14,599
It's on account of these shells.
That's my hobby.

808
01:02:14,808 --> 01:02:17,727
- You collect shells?
- So did my father and grandfather.

809
01:02:17,936 --> 01:02:20,438
You might say we had
a passion for shells.

810
01:02:20,522 --> 01:02:23,024
That's why we named
the oil company after it.

811
01:02:24,609 --> 01:02:29,197
- Shell Oil?
- Please, no names. Just call me Junior.

812
01:02:29,406 --> 01:02:31,491
Sugar!

813
01:02:31,574 --> 01:02:33,034
Time to change for dinner.

814
01:02:33,159 --> 01:02:36,496
Run along, Daphne dear.
I'll catch up with you later.

815
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:49,634
What, young lady?
What are you staring at?

816
01:02:49,926 --> 01:02:51,594
Happens to me all the time.

817
01:02:51,803 --> 01:02:55,056
l recognised him, too.
His picture was in Vanity Fair.

818
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:58,601
- Would you move along, please?
- Yes. You're in his way.

819
01:02:58,685 --> 01:03:01,312
He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.

820
01:03:01,396 --> 01:03:03,273
His yacht?

821
01:03:03,481 --> 01:03:06,943
lt sleeps 1 2. This is my friend Daphne.
She's a Vassar girl.

822
01:03:07,569 --> 01:03:08,695
I'm a what?

823
01:03:08,903 --> 01:03:10,905
Or was it Bryn Mawr?

824
01:03:12,032 --> 01:03:15,910
l heard a very sad story
about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.

825
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:17,787
She squealed on her roommate

826
01:03:17,996 --> 01:03:21,124
and they found her strangled
with her own brassiere.

827
01:03:21,207 --> 01:03:26,338
Yes. We have to be very careful
whom we pick for a roommate. Hm?

828
01:03:26,421 --> 01:03:28,423
Well, l think I'd better be going.

829
01:03:28,631 --> 01:03:30,717
lt was delightful meeting you both.

830
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,928
- You will come and hear us play?
- lf it's at all possible.

831
01:03:34,054 --> 01:03:36,348
Do come. lt'll be such fun.

832
01:03:36,431 --> 01:03:39,476
- And bring your yacht.
- Come on, Daphne.

833
01:03:45,523 --> 01:03:49,819
- How about that guy?!
- Hands off. l saw him first.

834
01:03:50,028 --> 01:03:54,824
Sugar, a little advice. lf l were a girl,
and l am, I'd watch my step.

835
01:03:55,033 --> 01:03:57,869
lf I'd been watching my step,
l never would have met him.

836
01:03:57,952 --> 01:04:01,831
- l can't wait to tell Josephine.
- Yeah, Josephine...

837
01:04:01,915 --> 01:04:04,626
l can't wait to see her face.
Will she be surprised.

838
01:04:04,834 --> 01:04:07,337
Neither can l.
Let's go tell her right now.

839
01:04:07,545 --> 01:04:09,964
- We don't have to run.
- Oh yes, we do.

840
01:04:18,515 --> 01:04:20,475
Josephine. Yoo-hoo.

841
01:04:21,518 --> 01:04:24,229
- l guess she's not here.
- Isn't that funny. Josie!

842
01:04:24,354 --> 01:04:26,314
l can't imagine where she'd be.

843
01:04:26,523 --> 01:04:28,525
- I'll be back later.
- Oh, no. You wait.

844
01:04:28,608 --> 01:04:30,819
l have a feeling
she'll show up any minute.

845
01:04:30,902 --> 01:04:35,198
- Believe it or not, Josephine predicted it.
- Yes. This is one for Ripley.

846
01:04:35,281 --> 01:04:38,326
- Do you suppose she went shopping?
- Shopping. That's it.

847
01:04:38,535 --> 01:04:43,123
Something tells me she's gonna come
through that door in a brand-new outfit.

848
01:04:56,344 --> 01:04:59,681
- Josephine.
- Oh. l didn't hear you come in.

849
01:05:06,563 --> 01:05:11,276
- Have a good time, girls?
- The most wonderful thing happened.

850
01:05:11,484 --> 01:05:13,028
- What?
- Guess.

851
01:05:13,236 --> 01:05:17,407
- They repealed Prohibition?
- Oh, you can do better than that.

852
01:05:18,033 --> 01:05:20,452
- l met one of them.
- One of whom?

853
01:05:20,535 --> 01:05:24,497
Shell Oil Junior. He's got millions,
glasses and a yacht.

854
01:05:24,706 --> 01:05:26,082
You don't say.

855
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:28,043
He's not only got a yacht.
He's got a bicycle.

856
01:05:28,251 --> 01:05:30,253
Daphne.

857
01:05:30,337 --> 01:05:32,422
Go on. Tell me all about him.

858
01:05:32,547 --> 01:05:35,675
Well, he's young and he's handsome.
He's a bachelor.

859
01:05:35,884 --> 01:05:40,472
He's a real gentleman.
You know. Not one of these grabbers.

860
01:05:40,555 --> 01:05:42,974
Maybe you'd better go after him
if you don't want to lose him.

861
01:05:43,183 --> 01:05:47,228
I'm not gonna let this one get away.
He's so cute. He collects shells.

862
01:05:47,437 --> 01:05:49,856
Shells? Whatever for?

863
01:05:49,939 --> 01:05:53,193
Oh, you know. The old shell game?

864
01:05:53,276 --> 01:05:54,944
Daphne, you're bothering us.

865
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:57,781
- Anyway, you're gonna meet him tonight.
- l am?

866
01:05:57,864 --> 01:06:00,075
He said he'd come
to hear us play - maybe.

867
01:06:00,283 --> 01:06:04,746
What do you mean, maybe? l saw the way
he looked at you. He'll be there for sure.

868
01:06:04,954 --> 01:06:06,331
l hope so.

869
01:06:06,539 --> 01:06:10,085
What do you think, Josephine?
What does your crystal ball say?

870
01:06:10,794 --> 01:06:13,838
Sugar. ls Sugar in here?

871
01:06:13,922 --> 01:06:18,093
Sugar, you got the key? I'm locked out
and I'm makin' a puddle in the hall.

872
01:06:18,218 --> 01:06:20,720
See you on the bandstand, girls.

873
01:06:24,474 --> 01:06:28,103
What are you tryin' to do to that girl,
puttin' on a millionaire act?

874
01:06:28,311 --> 01:06:32,399
And that phoney accent?
Nobody talks like that.

875
01:06:32,482 --> 01:06:34,693
I've seen you pull
some low tricks on women.

876
01:06:34,776 --> 01:06:38,655
This is without doubt
the trickiest, lowest, meanest...

877
01:06:44,703 --> 01:06:46,996
I'm not afraid of you.

878
01:06:48,748 --> 01:06:50,625
I'm thin, but I'm wiry.

879
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:54,796
You're gonna get hurt.
When I'm aroused, I'm a tiger.

880
01:06:55,005 --> 01:06:59,718
Joe. Don't look at me like that.
lt was all a joke. l didn't mean any harm.

881
01:06:59,801 --> 01:07:02,971
I'm gonna press
the suit myself. Telephone.

882
01:07:03,179 --> 01:07:05,473
Answer the tele...phone.

883
01:07:09,853 --> 01:07:11,438
Hello?

884
01:07:12,689 --> 01:07:14,858
Yes, this is 41 3.

885
01:07:15,066 --> 01:07:18,528
Ship to shore? All right, I'll take it.

886
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:21,322
Daphne? It's that naughty boy again.

887
01:07:21,448 --> 01:07:23,742
You know - Osgood? ln the elevator?

888
01:07:23,825 --> 01:07:26,536
You slapped my face?

889
01:07:27,787 --> 01:07:30,498
- Who is this?
- This is her roommate.

890
01:07:30,707 --> 01:07:32,917
Daphne can't talk right now. ls it urgent?

891
01:07:33,001 --> 01:07:35,628
Well, it is to me.
Will you give her a message?

892
01:07:35,712 --> 01:07:40,091
Tell her I'd like her to have supper with
me on my yacht after the show tonight.

893
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:43,428
Got it. Supper, yacht,
after the show. I'll tell her.

894
01:07:43,553 --> 01:07:47,182
- Your yacht?
- The New Caledonia. That's its name.

895
01:07:47,307 --> 01:07:51,895
The Old Caledonia went down
during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.

896
01:07:52,103 --> 01:07:57,192
But tell her not to worry. This'll be a quiet
little midnight snack, just the two of us.

897
01:07:58,651 --> 01:08:02,322
Just the two of you?
What about the crew?

898
01:08:02,405 --> 01:08:06,493
That's all been taken care of.
I'm giving them shore leave.

899
01:08:06,701 --> 01:08:09,079
We'll have cold pheasant
with champagne.

900
01:08:09,287 --> 01:08:13,875
I've checked with the coastguard.
There's gonna be a full moon tonight.

901
01:08:14,084 --> 01:08:18,380
And tell her I've got
a new batch of Rudy Vallee records.

902
01:08:19,714 --> 01:08:23,385
That's good thinking.
Daphne's a pushover for him.

903
01:08:23,468 --> 01:08:25,970
Pushover for who? What...

904
01:08:26,096 --> 01:08:28,181
Yes, Mr Fielding.

905
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:32,143
You'll pick her up after the show
in your motorboat. Goodbye.

906
01:08:32,227 --> 01:08:34,104
What's that you said?

907
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:38,817
- ''Zowie.'' I'll give her the message.
- What message? What motorboat?

908
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:43,071
You got it made. Fielding wants to have
cold pheasant with you on his yacht.

909
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:46,950
Just the three of you on that
great big boat. You, him and Rudy Vallee.

910
01:08:47,033 --> 01:08:49,452
Fat chance. Call him back
and say I'm not goin'.

911
01:08:49,661 --> 01:08:51,329
Of course you're not.

912
01:08:51,413 --> 01:08:53,415
I'm going.

913
01:08:54,124 --> 01:08:57,043
You're gonna be on the boat
with that dirty old man?

914
01:08:57,168 --> 01:08:59,337
I'm gonna be on the boat with Sugar.

915
01:08:59,546 --> 01:09:02,382
- Where's he gonna be?
- He's gonna be ashore with you.

916
01:09:02,465 --> 01:09:04,134
- With me?
- That's right.

917
01:09:04,342 --> 01:09:07,178
Oh, no. Not tonight, Josephine.

918
01:10:23,129 --> 01:10:26,257
Daphne, your boyfriend's waving at you.

919
01:10:26,466 --> 01:10:28,426
You can both go take a flyin' jump.

920
01:10:28,635 --> 01:10:31,680
Remember, he's your date
for tonight, so smile.

921
01:10:33,223 --> 01:10:37,727
Oh, you can do better than that.
Give him the teeth, the whole personality.

922
01:10:47,612 --> 01:10:50,240
Why do l let you talk me
into these things? Why?

923
01:10:50,448 --> 01:10:53,159
Because we're pals. The two musketeers.

924
01:10:53,243 --> 01:10:57,122
Don't give me the musketeers.
How am l gonna keep him ashore?

925
01:10:57,205 --> 01:11:00,125
Tell him you get seasick.
Play miniature golf with him.

926
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:04,629
Oh, no. I'm not gonna get caught
in a miniature sand trap with that guy.

927
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,720
Hi. Which of you dolls is Daphne?

928
01:11:11,803 --> 01:11:13,471
Bull fiddle.

929
01:11:13,596 --> 01:11:15,890
From satchel mouth at table seven.

930
01:11:20,979 --> 01:11:24,649
- This is from me to you, doll.
- Beat it, buster.

931
01:11:24,858 --> 01:11:28,403
Never mind leaving your door open.
l got a passkey.

932
01:11:34,117 --> 01:11:38,204
- What are you doin' with my flowers?
- Borrowing 'em. You'll get 'em back.

933
01:12:07,901 --> 01:12:11,154
l guess he's not gonna show up.
It's five minutes to one.

934
01:12:11,237 --> 01:12:14,991
- Do you suppose he forgot?
- You know how those millionaires are.

935
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,993
These came for you.

936
01:12:17,202 --> 01:12:18,953
For me?

937
01:12:20,622 --> 01:12:21,998
It's Shell Oil.

938
01:12:22,207 --> 01:12:24,292
- No!
- Yes!

939
01:12:24,376 --> 01:12:26,586
He wants to have supper
with me on his yacht.

940
01:12:26,795 --> 01:12:28,463
He's picking me up at the pier.

941
01:12:28,672 --> 01:12:30,006
- No!
- Yes.

942
01:12:30,215 --> 01:12:32,008
You heard her - yes.

943
01:12:32,092 --> 01:12:36,596
Josephine, just imagine. Me,
Sugar Kowalczyk from Sandusky, Ohio,

944
01:12:36,805 --> 01:12:38,556
on a millionaire's yacht.

945
01:12:38,765 --> 01:12:41,393
lf my mother could only see me now.

946
01:12:43,561 --> 01:12:46,064
l hope my mother never finds out.

947
01:12:47,524 --> 01:12:50,860
That's it for tonight.
This is Sweet Sue saying good night,

948
01:12:50,985 --> 01:12:56,408
reminding all you daddies out there
that every girl in my band is a virtuoso.

949
01:12:56,616 --> 01:12:59,202
And l intend to keep it that way.

950
01:13:05,458 --> 01:13:07,544
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

951
01:14:37,592 --> 01:14:40,512
But it's such a waste.
A full moon, an empty yacht.

952
01:14:40,595 --> 01:14:43,014
- I'll throw up.
- Then let's go dancing.

953
01:14:43,098 --> 01:14:45,517
There's a roadhouse down the coast...

954
01:14:49,771 --> 01:14:52,816
Well, I'll be.... He does have a bicycle.

955
01:14:52,899 --> 01:14:54,901
Who?

956
01:14:54,984 --> 01:14:56,986
About the roadhouse?

957
01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:59,364
They have a Cuban band
that's the berries.

958
01:14:59,489 --> 01:15:03,535
Let's go there, blindfold the orchestra
and tango till dawn.

959
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,745
- You know something, Mr Fielding?
- What?

960
01:15:05,829 --> 01:15:07,831
You're dynamite.

961
01:15:08,039 --> 01:15:10,834
You're a pretty hot
little firecracker yourself.

962
01:16:03,386 --> 01:16:05,597
Ahoy, there.

963
01:16:06,723 --> 01:16:08,933
Ahoy.

964
01:16:17,067 --> 01:16:19,569
- Been waiting long?
- It's not how long you wait.

965
01:16:19,652 --> 01:16:23,615
- It's who you're waiting for.
- Thank you. And for the flowers.

966
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:28,536
l wanted them to fly orchids from our
greenhouse, but Long lsland is fogged in.

967
01:16:28,745 --> 01:16:30,705
It's the thought that counts.

968
01:16:37,921 --> 01:16:39,881
l seem to be out of gas.

969
01:16:40,006 --> 01:16:43,968
It's sort of funny, you being out of gas.
l mean, Shell Oil and everyzhing.

970
01:16:44,177 --> 01:16:46,262
Oops. There.

971
01:16:51,267 --> 01:16:53,478
lt seems to be stuck in reverse.

972
01:16:54,938 --> 01:16:58,483
l just got this motorboat.
It's an an experimental model.

973
01:16:58,608 --> 01:17:00,777
lt seems like they're on the wrong track.

974
01:17:00,902 --> 01:17:03,613
Do you mind riding backwards?
lt may take a little longer.

975
01:17:03,822 --> 01:17:07,158
It's not how long it takes.
It's who's taking you.

976
01:17:33,435 --> 01:17:35,520
lt looked so small from the beach.

977
01:17:35,603 --> 01:17:38,857
But when you're on it, it's like
a cruiser or a destroyer.

978
01:17:39,065 --> 01:17:43,862
It's just regulation-size. We have three.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton.

979
01:17:43,945 --> 01:17:47,198
Daddy's is in Venezuela.
The company is laying a new pipeline.

980
01:17:47,282 --> 01:17:51,244
My dad's more interested in railroads.
Baltimore and Ohio.

981
01:17:51,453 --> 01:17:53,663
Which is the port
and which is the starboard?

982
01:17:53,747 --> 01:17:56,583
That depends on
whether you're coming or going.

983
01:17:56,666 --> 01:18:00,754
l mean, normally the aft
is on the other side of the stern.

984
01:18:00,837 --> 01:18:05,550
And that's the bridge. So that you can get
from one side of the boat to the other.

985
01:18:05,633 --> 01:18:09,387
- Would you like a glass of champagne?
- Love it. Which way?

986
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:16,186
- You have an upstairs and a downstairs.
- Yes, the hurricane cellar.

987
01:18:17,937 --> 01:18:22,442
And another nice thing about
this yacht - lots of closet space.

988
01:18:22,525 --> 01:18:26,905
Now, let me see. Where do you
suppose the steward set it up?

989
01:18:29,741 --> 01:18:31,701
ln here.

990
01:18:33,161 --> 01:18:34,746
Of course. How silly of me.

991
01:18:34,829 --> 01:18:38,500
On Thursdays they always
serve me in the small salon.

992
01:18:46,925 --> 01:18:50,053
It's exquisite. Like a floating mansion.

993
01:18:50,178 --> 01:18:52,263
It's all right for a bachelor.

994
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:57,060
- What a beautiful fish.
- l caught him off Cape Hatteras.

995
01:18:57,977 --> 01:19:00,063
What is it?

996
01:19:00,188 --> 01:19:03,108
It's a member of the herring family.

997
01:19:03,817 --> 01:19:05,819
A herring?

998
01:19:06,027 --> 01:19:10,615
Isn't it amazing how they get those
big fish into those little glass jars?

999
01:19:10,824 --> 01:19:12,992
They shrink when they're marinated.

1000
01:19:13,118 --> 01:19:15,203
- Champagne?
- l don't mind if l do.

1001
01:19:15,286 --> 01:19:17,997
Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.

1002
01:19:18,123 --> 01:19:20,208
Bon voyage.

1003
01:19:24,254 --> 01:19:26,965
- Look at all that silverware.
- Trophies.

1004
01:19:27,173 --> 01:19:30,510
You know. Skeet shooting,
dog breeding, water polo.

1005
01:19:30,635 --> 01:19:32,721
Isn't water polo terribly dangerous?

1006
01:19:32,929 --> 01:19:35,432
I'll say. l had two ponies
drowned under me.

1007
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,600
Where's your shell collection?

1008
01:19:37,809 --> 01:19:40,228
Yes, of course.
Where could they have put it?

1009
01:19:40,437 --> 01:19:43,023
You see, on Thursdays
I'm sort of lost around here.

1010
01:19:43,231 --> 01:19:46,151
- What's on Thursdays?
- It's the crew's night off.

1011
01:19:46,359 --> 01:19:49,612
- You mean we're alone on the boat?
- Completely.

1012
01:19:49,696 --> 01:19:53,450
I've never been completely alone
with a man in the middle of the night,

1013
01:19:53,658 --> 01:19:56,286
- in the middle of the ocean.
- Oh, it's perfectly safe.

1014
01:19:56,369 --> 01:19:59,289
We're anchored.
The ship's in shipshape shape.

1015
01:19:59,497 --> 01:20:02,125
The coastguard will call
if any icebergs appear.

1016
01:20:02,834 --> 01:20:04,210
It's not the icebergs.

1017
01:20:04,294 --> 01:20:07,630
But certain men would try to
take advantage of a situation like this.

1018
01:20:07,797 --> 01:20:11,634
- You're flattering me.
- Of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.

1019
01:20:12,594 --> 01:20:16,348
It's not that. It's just that I'm harmless.

1020
01:20:16,431 --> 01:20:19,142
- Harmless? How?
- l don't know how to put it,

1021
01:20:19,351 --> 01:20:21,561
but I've got this thing about girls.

1022
01:20:21,644 --> 01:20:25,190
- What thing?
- They just sort of leave me cold.

1023
01:20:25,398 --> 01:20:27,192
You mean, like, frigid?

1024
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,778
Well, it's more like a mental block.

1025
01:20:29,986 --> 01:20:33,448
When I'm with a girl,
it does absolutely nothing to me.

1026
01:20:33,531 --> 01:20:38,036
- Have you tried?
- Have l. I'm trying all the time.

1027
01:20:44,584 --> 01:20:47,504
See? Nothing.

1028
01:20:47,629 --> 01:20:50,215
- Nothing at all?
- Complete washout.

1029
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:53,551
- That makes me feel just awful.
- My dear, it's not your fault.

1030
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,680
Now and then Mother Nature
throws somebody a dirty curve.

1031
01:20:56,805 --> 01:20:58,890
Something goes wrong inside.

1032
01:20:58,973 --> 01:21:02,018
- You mean you can't fall in love?
- Not any more.

1033
01:21:02,227 --> 01:21:04,938
l was in love once,
but I'd rather not talk about it.

1034
01:21:05,146 --> 01:21:08,066
- Would you like a little cold pheasant?
- What happened?

1035
01:21:08,274 --> 01:21:11,486
- l don't want to bore you.
- You couldn't possibly.

1036
01:21:11,695 --> 01:21:13,697
Well...

1037
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:15,990
lt was my freshman year at Princeton.

1038
01:21:16,199 --> 01:21:18,493
There was this girl. Her name was Nellie.

1039
01:21:18,576 --> 01:21:21,287
Her father was
the vice president of Hupmobile.

1040
01:21:21,496 --> 01:21:23,915
She wore glasses, too.

1041
01:21:24,124 --> 01:21:26,626
That summer we were
at the Grand Canyon.

1042
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:29,629
We were on the highest ledge
watching the sunset,

1043
01:21:29,754 --> 01:21:32,257
when suddenly we got
this impulse to kiss.

1044
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:35,802
l took off my glasses.
She took off her glasses.

1045
01:21:35,885 --> 01:21:37,971
l took a step toward her.

1046
01:21:38,179 --> 01:21:41,099
She took a step toward me.

1047
01:21:41,725 --> 01:21:45,603
Yes. Eight hours later
they brought her up by mule.

1048
01:21:45,687 --> 01:21:49,774
l gave her three transfusions.
We had the same type blood - type O.

1049
01:21:49,858 --> 01:21:52,777
But it was too late.

1050
01:21:52,902 --> 01:21:54,779
Talk about sad.

1051
01:21:54,863 --> 01:21:56,948
Ever since then,

1052
01:21:57,073 --> 01:22:00,618
numb, no feelings, like my heart
was shot full of Novocain.

1053
01:22:00,827 --> 01:22:03,121
You poor, poor boy.

1054
01:22:03,204 --> 01:22:06,124
Yes. All the money in the world,
and what good is it?

1055
01:22:06,249 --> 01:22:08,126
Mint sauce or cranberries?

1056
01:22:08,835 --> 01:22:11,963
How can you think about food
at a time like this?

1057
01:22:12,088 --> 01:22:14,174
What else is there for me?

1058
01:22:14,257 --> 01:22:17,927
- ls it that hopeless?
- My family did everyzhing they could.

1059
01:22:18,011 --> 01:22:20,722
Hired the most beautiful
French upstairs maids.

1060
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:24,059
Got a special tutor to read me
books that were banned in Boston.

1061
01:22:24,184 --> 01:22:26,353
lmported a troupe of Balinese dancers

1062
01:22:26,561 --> 01:22:29,814
with those bells on their ankles
and long fingernails.

1063
01:22:30,023 --> 01:22:32,317
What a waste of money.

1064
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,819
Have you ever tried American girls?

1065
01:22:34,903 --> 01:22:36,696
Why?

1066
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:44,496
Was that anyzhing?

1067
01:22:45,538 --> 01:22:47,624
Thanks just the same.

1068
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:50,669
You should see a doctor - a good doctor.

1069
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:55,465
l have. l spent six months in Vienna
with Professor Freud, flat on my back.

1070
01:22:56,591 --> 01:23:01,304
Then there were the Mayo brothers,
injections, hypnosis, mineral baths.

1071
01:23:01,388 --> 01:23:03,890
lf l wasn't such a coward, I'd kill myself.

1072
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:07,352
Don't say that.

1073
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:10,271
There must be some girl
someplace that could...

1074
01:23:10,355 --> 01:23:14,651
lf l ever found a girl that could,
I'd marry her just like that.

1075
01:23:15,568 --> 01:23:18,488
- Would you do me a favour?
- Certainly. What is it?

1076
01:23:18,613 --> 01:23:22,575
l may not be Dr Freud or a Mayo brother
or one of those French upstairs girls,

1077
01:23:22,701 --> 01:23:25,412
but could l take another crack at it?

1078
01:23:26,246 --> 01:23:28,748
All right, if you insist.

1079
01:23:41,678 --> 01:23:45,849
- Anyzhing this time?
- I'm afraid not.

1080
01:23:46,057 --> 01:23:49,394
- Terribly sorry.
- Would you like some more champagne?

1081
01:23:51,896 --> 01:23:55,650
Maybe if we had some music.
How do you dim these lights?

1082
01:23:56,818 --> 01:24:00,447
Look, it's terribly sweet of you
to want to help out, but it's no use.

1083
01:24:00,655 --> 01:24:02,866
l think the light switch is over there.

1084
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:10,665
That's the radio.

1085
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:14,336
It's like taking someone
to a concert when he's tone-deaf.

1086
01:24:50,497 --> 01:24:53,124
You're not giving yourself a chance.

1087
01:24:53,208 --> 01:24:56,044
Don't fight it.

1088
01:24:56,544 --> 01:24:58,630
Relax.

1089
01:25:11,976 --> 01:25:14,187
It's like smoking without inhaling.

1090
01:25:14,396 --> 01:25:16,356
So inhale.

1091
01:25:39,504 --> 01:25:40,880
Daphne,

1092
01:25:40,964 --> 01:25:43,383
- you're leading again.
- Sorry.

1093
01:25:57,647 --> 01:25:59,232
Well?

1094
01:26:00,775 --> 01:26:02,861
I'm not quite sure.

1095
01:26:02,986 --> 01:26:05,363
Would you try it again?

1096
01:26:15,582 --> 01:26:18,835
l got a funny sensation in my toes.

1097
01:26:19,753 --> 01:26:22,881
Like someone was barbecuing them
over a slow flame.

1098
01:26:24,341 --> 01:26:27,052
Let's throw another log on the fire.

1099
01:26:36,644 --> 01:26:39,314
l think you're on the right track.

1100
01:26:39,981 --> 01:26:43,568
l must be. Your glasses
are beginning to steam up.

1101
01:27:08,301 --> 01:27:10,804
l never knew it could be like this.

1102
01:27:12,263 --> 01:27:14,224
Thank you.

1103
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:17,560
They told me l was kaput,
finished, all washed up.

1104
01:27:17,686 --> 01:27:21,439
And here you are, making a chump
out of all those experts.

1105
01:27:24,025 --> 01:27:26,444
Mineral baths. Now, really.

1106
01:27:26,528 --> 01:27:29,989
Where did you learn to kiss like that?

1107
01:27:30,073 --> 01:27:33,410
l used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.

1108
01:27:43,211 --> 01:27:48,216
Tomorrow, remind me to send
a cheque for $100,000 to the Milk Fund.

1109
01:28:53,490 --> 01:28:54,949
Whoops.

1110
01:29:22,811 --> 01:29:25,814
- Good night.
- Good morning.

1111
01:29:25,939 --> 01:29:28,024
How much do l owe the Milk Fund so far?

1112
01:29:28,233 --> 01:29:30,735
$850,000.

1113
01:29:30,944 --> 01:29:33,530
Let's make it an even million.

1114
01:29:54,175 --> 01:29:56,928
l forgot to give you a receipt.

1115
01:30:38,219 --> 01:30:40,513
Hi, Jerry. Everyzhing under control?

1116
01:30:40,638 --> 01:30:43,350
Have l got things to tell you.

1117
01:30:43,433 --> 01:30:46,895
- What happened?
- I'm engaged.

1118
01:30:46,978 --> 01:30:50,440
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?

1119
01:30:50,523 --> 01:30:52,192
l am.

1120
01:30:56,488 --> 01:30:58,239
What?

1121
01:30:58,365 --> 01:31:01,701
Osgood proposed to me.
We're planning a June wedding.

1122
01:31:04,204 --> 01:31:07,207
What are you talking about?
You can't marry Osgood.

1123
01:31:08,375 --> 01:31:12,128
- Do you think he's too old for me?
- Jerry, you can't be serious.

1124
01:31:12,212 --> 01:31:14,923
Why not? He keeps
marryin' girls all the time.

1125
01:31:16,383 --> 01:31:18,593
But... you're not a girl. You're a guy.

1126
01:31:18,677 --> 01:31:20,679
And why would a guy
wanna marry a guy?

1127
01:31:20,887 --> 01:31:22,764
Security.

1128
01:31:23,890 --> 01:31:27,352
- Jerry, lie down. You're not well.
- Stop treatin' me like a child.

1129
01:31:27,435 --> 01:31:30,689
- I'm not stupid. l know there's a problem.
- I'll say there is.

1130
01:31:30,897 --> 01:31:35,485
His mother. We need her approval. But
I'm not worried because l don't smoke.

1131
01:31:38,405 --> 01:31:41,950
- Jerry, there's another problem.
- Like what?

1132
01:31:42,033 --> 01:31:45,995
- Like your honeymoon.
- We've been discussing that.

1133
01:31:46,204 --> 01:31:50,291
He wants to go to the Riviera,
but l kinda lean towards Niagara Falls.

1134
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,173
Jerry, you're outta your mind.
You can't get away with this.

1135
01:31:57,382 --> 01:32:01,219
l don't expect it to last.
I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.

1136
01:32:01,344 --> 01:32:04,055
- Like when?
- Like right after the ceremony.

1137
01:32:04,264 --> 01:32:07,600
Then we get a quick annulment,
he makes a nice settlement on me

1138
01:32:07,809 --> 01:32:10,937
and l keep gettin' those
alimony cheques every month.

1139
01:32:15,316 --> 01:32:17,402
Jerry, listen to me.

1140
01:32:17,485 --> 01:32:20,822
There are laws, conventions.
It's just not been done.

1141
01:32:21,573 --> 01:32:24,701
Joe, this may be my last chance
to marry a millionaire.

1142
01:32:24,784 --> 01:32:28,872
Jerry, will you take my advice?
Forget about the whole thing, will you?

1143
01:32:28,955 --> 01:32:32,834
Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.

1144
01:32:32,917 --> 01:32:36,171
- I'm a boy.
- That's the boy.

1145
01:32:36,254 --> 01:32:39,716
I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a...

1146
01:32:39,924 --> 01:32:43,678
l wish l were dead.
I'm a boy. Boy, oh boy, am l a boy.

1147
01:32:43,762 --> 01:32:46,181
What about my engagement present?

1148
01:32:46,264 --> 01:32:49,726
- What engagement present?
- Osgood gave me a bracelet.

1149
01:32:51,478 --> 01:32:53,146
Hey, these are real diamonds.

1150
01:32:53,271 --> 01:32:55,982
Of course they're real.
You think my fianc is a bum?

1151
01:32:56,066 --> 01:33:00,653
- l guess I'll have to give it back to him.
- Wait a minute, Jerry. Let's not be hasty.

1152
01:33:00,779 --> 01:33:04,324
After all, we don't wanna
hurt Osgood's feelings.

1153
01:33:07,327 --> 01:33:09,954
- Just a minute.
- It's me. Sugar.

1154
01:33:17,379 --> 01:33:18,213
Come in.

1155
01:33:19,464 --> 01:33:24,052
l thought l heard voices. l had to talk to
somebody. l don't feel like going to sleep.

1156
01:33:24,177 --> 01:33:28,014
- What you need is a slug of bourbon.
- Oh, no. I'm off that stuff for good.

1157
01:33:28,765 --> 01:33:32,310
- Did you have a nice time?
- Nice?

1158
01:33:32,394 --> 01:33:35,522
lt was suicidally beautiful.

1159
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:36,898
Did he get fresh?

1160
01:33:36,981 --> 01:33:40,443
Of course not. As a matter of fact,
it was just the other way around.

1161
01:33:40,652 --> 01:33:42,821
- You see, he needs help.
- What for?

1162
01:33:43,029 --> 01:33:45,740
Talk about elegant.
You should see the yacht.

1163
01:33:45,865 --> 01:33:49,411
Candlelight, mint sauce and cranberries.

1164
01:33:49,911 --> 01:33:52,205
Gee, l wish I'd been there.

1165
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:54,708
I'm going to see him again
tonight - and every night.

1166
01:33:54,916 --> 01:33:56,710
l think he's going to propose.

1167
01:33:56,793 --> 01:33:59,629
- As soon as he gets up his nerve.
- That's some nerve.

1168
01:33:59,713 --> 01:34:01,923
Daphne got a proposal tonight.

1169
01:34:02,841 --> 01:34:05,135
- Really?
- From a rich millionaire.

1170
01:34:05,343 --> 01:34:07,137
That's wonderful.

1171
01:34:07,345 --> 01:34:09,514
- Poor Josephine.
- Me?

1172
01:34:09,639 --> 01:34:11,391
Well, Daphne has a beau, l have a beau...

1173
01:34:11,599 --> 01:34:14,227
lf we could only find somebody for you.

1174
01:34:16,604 --> 01:34:18,606
Here l am, doll.

1175
01:34:44,966 --> 01:34:48,303
''Friends of ltalian Opera'' - that's us.

1176
01:34:48,428 --> 01:34:50,722
Register over there.

1177
01:34:59,481 --> 01:35:03,026
Spats Colombo. Delegate from Chicago.
South Side Chapter.

1178
01:35:04,069 --> 01:35:06,154
Thanks.

1179
01:35:06,237 --> 01:35:07,822
Hiya, Spats.

1180
01:35:07,906 --> 01:35:11,034
- We was layin' 8-1 you wouldn't show.
- Why wouldn't l?

1181
01:35:11,159 --> 01:35:14,287
We thought you was all broken up
about Toothpick Charlie.

1182
01:35:14,496 --> 01:35:18,750
- We all gotta go sometime.
- Yeah. You never know who's next.

1183
01:35:18,958 --> 01:35:21,252
OK, Spats. Report to the sergeant at arms.

1184
01:35:21,378 --> 01:35:25,131
- What for?
- Orders from Little Bonaparte.

1185
01:35:29,719 --> 01:35:32,639
- All right, Spats, get your hands up.
- What's the idea?

1186
01:35:32,847 --> 01:35:35,767
Little Bonaparte don't want
no hardware around.

1187
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:38,061
All right, you're clean.

1188
01:35:38,269 --> 01:35:40,355
You're not.

1189
01:35:50,448 --> 01:35:52,951
lt ain't loaded.

1190
01:36:00,875 --> 01:36:03,795
Next. What's in here?

1191
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:07,340
My golf clubs. Putter, niblick, No.3 iron.

1192
01:36:08,383 --> 01:36:10,802
- What's this?
- My mashie.

1193
01:36:15,807 --> 01:36:18,309
See you at the banquet, Spats.

1194
01:36:19,227 --> 01:36:22,480
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?

1195
01:36:22,689 --> 01:36:25,066
Come on, boys.

1196
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:28,153
Well. Spats Colombo, if l ever saw one.

1197
01:36:28,194 --> 01:36:30,530
Hello, copper.
What brings you to Florida?

1198
01:36:30,739 --> 01:36:32,741
l heard you opera-lovers were meetin'.

1199
01:36:32,949 --> 01:36:35,869
Thought I'd come in case
anybody decided to sing.

1200
01:36:35,952 --> 01:36:37,203
Big joke.

1201
01:36:37,328 --> 01:36:39,706
Where were you at 3pm
on St Valentine's Day?

1202
01:36:39,831 --> 01:36:42,834
- l was at Rigoletto.
- What's his first name and address?

1203
01:36:43,043 --> 01:36:45,045
It's an opera, you ignoramus.

1204
01:36:45,128 --> 01:36:48,465
- ln the garage on Clark Street?
- Clark Street? Never heard of it.

1205
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:52,135
Ever hear of Deluxe Cleaners
on Wabash Avenue?

1206
01:36:52,218 --> 01:36:55,472
The day after the shoot
you sent in spats with blood on 'em.

1207
01:36:55,555 --> 01:36:57,349
l cut myself while shaving.

1208
01:36:57,557 --> 01:37:00,268
- You shave with spats on?
- l sleep with my spats on.

1209
01:37:00,352 --> 01:37:03,813
Stop kidding. You vulcanised
Toothpick Charlie, and we know it.

1210
01:37:03,897 --> 01:37:05,148
You and who else?

1211
01:37:05,357 --> 01:37:09,235
Me and those two witnesses you
have been lookin' for all over Chicago.

1212
01:37:09,444 --> 01:37:12,238
Boys, know anyzhing about
any garage or witnesses?

1213
01:37:12,364 --> 01:37:15,075
Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.

1214
01:37:15,158 --> 01:37:17,452
Honest.

1215
01:37:18,912 --> 01:37:23,208
Don't worry, Spats. One of these days
we're gonna dig up those two guys.

1216
01:37:23,416 --> 01:37:25,794
That's what you'll have to do - dig 'em up.

1217
01:37:35,512 --> 01:37:39,891
l feel like such a tramp, taking jewellery
from a man under false pretences.

1218
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:43,728
Get it while you're young. Fix your lips
if you wanna look nice for Osgood.

1219
01:37:43,853 --> 01:37:46,439
lt'll break his heart when
he finds out l can't marry him.

1220
01:37:46,648 --> 01:37:49,901
lt'll break Sugar's heart when
she finds out I'm not a millionaire.

1221
01:37:49,984 --> 01:37:52,487
Can't make an omelette
without breakin' an egg.

1222
01:37:52,612 --> 01:37:54,906
- What's with the omelette?
- Nag, nag, nag.

1223
01:37:54,989 --> 01:37:59,786
We got a yacht, a bracelet, you've got
Osgood, I've got Sugar. We'll be cookin'.

1224
01:38:03,748 --> 01:38:05,834
- Joe!
- What?

1225
01:38:07,293 --> 01:38:10,964
Something tells me the omelette
is about to hit the fan.

1226
01:38:13,133 --> 01:38:15,218
Come on, Daphne.

1227
01:38:19,514 --> 01:38:21,474
- Going up.
- Hold it.

1228
01:38:29,524 --> 01:38:31,401
Three, please.

1229
01:38:42,662 --> 01:38:44,330
l don't mean to be forward,

1230
01:38:44,414 --> 01:38:47,542
but ain't l had the pleasure
of meetin' you two broads before?

1231
01:38:47,667 --> 01:38:50,253
- Oh, no.
- You must mean two other broads.

1232
01:38:50,462 --> 01:38:53,715
- You ever been in Chicago?
- Us?

1233
01:38:53,798 --> 01:38:56,217
We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.

1234
01:38:56,426 --> 01:38:57,677
Third floor.

1235
01:38:57,761 --> 01:39:00,889
- What floor are you on, sweetie?
- Never you mind.

1236
01:39:02,057 --> 01:39:04,017
Room 41 3. We'll be in touch.

1237
01:39:04,225 --> 01:39:06,936
Don't call us. We'll call you.

1238
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,242
l tell you, Joe, they're onto us.

1239
01:39:21,451 --> 01:39:24,788
They're gonna line us up
against the wall and...

1240
01:39:24,871 --> 01:39:28,124
The cops will find two dead dames
and take us to the morgue

1241
01:39:28,208 --> 01:39:30,418
and when they undress us,
I'll die of shame.

1242
01:39:30,627 --> 01:39:33,630
- Shut up and keep packing.
- Yeah. OK, Joe.

1243
01:39:33,755 --> 01:39:35,924
- Not that, you idiot.
- They're from Osgood.

1244
01:39:36,049 --> 01:39:38,218
He wanted me to wear 'em tonight.

1245
01:39:41,971 --> 01:39:45,016
l tell you, l will never find
another man who's so good to me.

1246
01:39:45,266 --> 01:39:49,854
Joe, if we get outta this hotel alive,
we'll sell this bracelet, take the money,

1247
01:39:49,938 --> 01:39:53,066
grab a boat to South America
and hide out in a banana republic.

1248
01:39:53,274 --> 01:39:57,153
l figured if we eat nothing but bananas,
we could live there for 50 years.

1249
01:39:57,237 --> 01:39:59,114
lf we get outta the hotel alive.

1250
01:39:59,239 --> 01:40:02,158
- Did we forget anyzhing?
- Yeah. The shaving stuff.

1251
01:40:02,242 --> 01:40:04,536
- And also Sugar.
- Sugar?

1252
01:40:04,744 --> 01:40:06,746
- Give me room 414.
- What are you doin'?

1253
01:40:06,830 --> 01:40:09,249
- Making a telephone call.
- Who has time?

1254
01:40:09,332 --> 01:40:11,543
We can't walk out on her
without a goodbye.

1255
01:40:11,751 --> 01:40:14,671
You usually walk out and leave 'em
with a kick in the teeth.

1256
01:40:14,754 --> 01:40:18,216
That's when l was a saxophone player.
Now I'm a millionaire.

1257
01:40:18,299 --> 01:40:21,761
Mail her a postcard.
Those gorillas may be here any minute.

1258
01:40:21,845 --> 01:40:24,556
Room 414?
This is the ship-to-shore operator.

1259
01:40:24,764 --> 01:40:26,349
Ship to shore?

1260
01:40:26,433 --> 01:40:28,852
Hey, Sugar, it's for you. From the yacht.

1261
01:40:33,857 --> 01:40:37,819
Hello, my dearest darling.
It's good to hear your voice.

1262
01:40:37,902 --> 01:40:40,321
l may throw up.

1263
01:40:41,865 --> 01:40:45,827
No, l didn't sleep too well, darling.
To tell the truth, l never closed an eye.

1264
01:40:46,036 --> 01:40:49,789
l never slept better.
l had the most wonderful dream.

1265
01:40:49,998 --> 01:40:52,292
l was still on the yacht
and the anchor broke loose.

1266
01:40:52,417 --> 01:40:55,128
We drifted for days and days.

1267
01:40:55,337 --> 01:40:57,088
You were the captain and l was the crew.

1268
01:40:57,213 --> 01:41:02,093
l kept a lookout for icebergs, l sorted
your shells and mixed your cocktails,

1269
01:41:02,218 --> 01:41:05,013
and l wiped the steam off your glasses.

1270
01:41:05,138 --> 01:41:09,100
And when l woke up, l wanted
to swim right back to you.

1271
01:41:09,934 --> 01:41:11,811
Yes...

1272
01:41:11,895 --> 01:41:14,189
Now, about our date for tonight...

1273
01:41:14,397 --> 01:41:17,233
I'll meet you on the pier again
right after the show.

1274
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:21,404
I'm afraid not. l can't make it tonight.

1275
01:41:23,156 --> 01:41:25,784
Not tomorrow either. l have to leave.

1276
01:41:25,867 --> 01:41:29,621
Something unexpected came up.
I'm sailing right away.

1277
01:41:29,829 --> 01:41:31,915
Where to?

1278
01:41:32,123 --> 01:41:34,751
South America?

1279
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:37,545
That is unexpected.

1280
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:41,216
You see, we have
these oil interests in Venezuela.

1281
01:41:41,299 --> 01:41:45,387
l just got a cable from Dad. The board
of directors have decided on a merger.

1282
01:41:45,595 --> 01:41:48,515
A merger? How long will you be gone?

1283
01:41:50,684 --> 01:41:52,560
Quite a while.

1284
01:41:52,769 --> 01:41:55,689
As a matter of fact,
I'm not coming back at all.

1285
01:41:55,814 --> 01:41:57,899
You're not?

1286
01:41:58,316 --> 01:42:01,653
Well, it's all rather complicated.
What we call high finance.

1287
01:42:01,736 --> 01:42:06,533
lt just so happens the president of the
Venezuelan oil syndicate has a daughter...

1288
01:42:06,658 --> 01:42:09,994
Oh. That kind of merger.

1289
01:42:10,078 --> 01:42:12,080
What is she like?

1290
01:42:12,163 --> 01:42:14,874
According to our tax adviser,
she's only so-so.

1291
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:16,876
But that's the way the oil gushes.

1292
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:20,630
A man in my position
has a responsibility to the stockholders.

1293
01:42:20,839 --> 01:42:24,384
All those little people
who have invested their life savings.

1294
01:42:24,467 --> 01:42:28,346
Of course. l understand.
At least, l think l do.

1295
01:42:28,430 --> 01:42:34,394
l knew you would. l only wish there
was something l could do for you.

1296
01:42:34,477 --> 01:42:38,023
But you have. You've given me
all that inside information.

1297
01:42:38,231 --> 01:42:40,108
Tomorrow I'm gonna call my broker

1298
01:42:40,233 --> 01:42:43,445
and have him buy me
50,000 shares of Venezuelan oil.

1299
01:42:43,653 --> 01:42:45,655
Smart move.

1300
01:42:45,864 --> 01:42:48,783
By the way, did you get my flowers?

1301
01:42:48,867 --> 01:42:51,286
You know, those orchids
from my greenhouse?

1302
01:42:51,494 --> 01:42:55,665
The fog finally lifted over Long lsland
and they flew them down this morning.

1303
01:42:55,749 --> 01:42:59,502
That's strange. l sent 'em to your room.

1304
01:43:01,338 --> 01:43:03,631
They should have been delivered by now.

1305
01:43:07,385 --> 01:43:10,930
Hey, Dolores, will you see
if there's any flowers outside?

1306
01:43:16,853 --> 01:43:19,689
Yes, they're here. White orchids.

1307
01:43:19,773 --> 01:43:22,817
l haven't had white orchids
since l was a debutante.

1308
01:43:24,778 --> 01:43:26,780
What's this?

1309
01:43:27,906 --> 01:43:29,366
What's what?

1310
01:43:29,574 --> 01:43:32,202
Oh, that. Just a little going-away present.

1311
01:43:33,036 --> 01:43:35,955
Real diamonds.

1312
01:43:36,039 --> 01:43:40,543
They must be worth their weight in gold.
Are you always this generous?

1313
01:43:42,003 --> 01:43:43,463
Not always.

1314
01:43:43,672 --> 01:43:46,591
l wanted you to know how grateful
l am for what you did for me.

1315
01:43:46,675 --> 01:43:50,011
l didn't do anyzhing. lt just happened.

1316
01:43:52,722 --> 01:43:55,558
The navigator just came in.
We're ready to cast off.

1317
01:43:55,767 --> 01:43:59,104
Well, anchors aweigh,
and have a bon voyage.

1318
01:43:59,187 --> 01:44:01,606
lf you need an orchestra
to play at your wedding,

1319
01:44:01,815 --> 01:44:03,775
we'll be through here
in a couple of weeks.

1320
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:06,403
Goodbye, my darling.

1321
01:44:06,486 --> 01:44:09,948
l don't know about the captain but
the navigator's gettin' his tail outta here.

1322
01:44:10,031 --> 01:44:13,284
- Yeah, let's shove off.
- Wait a minute. My bracelet.

1323
01:44:15,787 --> 01:44:17,539
What happened to my bracelet?

1324
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:21,710
- Your bracelet? It's ours.
- All right. What happened to our bracelet?

1325
01:44:21,918 --> 01:44:26,214
- We did the right thing with it.
- You're not pullin' one of your old tricks.

1326
01:44:26,297 --> 01:44:28,717
No tricks, no mirrors,
nothing up my sleeve.

1327
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,428
It's on the level this time.

1328
01:44:37,475 --> 01:44:39,561
Where's that bourbon?

1329
01:44:45,692 --> 01:44:50,280
- What's the matter, Sugar?
- l don't know. All of a sudden I'm thirsty.

1330
01:44:51,448 --> 01:44:53,324
How did you get that bracelet?

1331
01:44:53,408 --> 01:44:55,285
- You like it?
- l always did.

1332
01:44:55,493 --> 01:45:00,290
Junior gave it to me. He's gone
to South America to marry another girl.

1333
01:45:00,415 --> 01:45:03,543
- That's what you call high finance.
- That's what l call a louse.

1334
01:45:03,752 --> 01:45:07,297
lf l were you, I'd take that bracelet
and throw it back in his face.

1335
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:12,177
He's the first nice guy I've met in my life.
The only one that ever gave me anyzhing.

1336
01:45:12,302 --> 01:45:14,804
You'll forget him, Sugar.

1337
01:45:15,638 --> 01:45:20,643
How can l? No matter where l go, there'll
always be a Shell station on every corner.

1338
01:45:20,727 --> 01:45:24,064
I'll bring this back when it's empty.

1339
01:45:26,149 --> 01:45:29,486
Are you crazy? The place
is crawlin' with mobsters.

1340
01:45:29,694 --> 01:45:32,822
And you're makin' like
Diamond Jim Brady.

1341
01:45:33,031 --> 01:45:35,116
How are we gonna get outta here?
How are we gonna eat?

1342
01:45:35,241 --> 01:45:39,287
- We'll walk. lf we have to, we'll starve.
- There's that ''we'' again.

1343
01:45:39,412 --> 01:45:42,749
Not that way. We don't wanna
run into Spats and his chums.

1344
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,677
Your hands clean?

1345
01:45:53,802 --> 01:45:55,261
Over.

1346
01:45:55,345 --> 01:45:57,347
OK, button my spats.

1347
01:46:00,266 --> 01:46:02,352
You sure dress nice, boss.

1348
01:46:02,435 --> 01:46:05,563
Say, boss. I've been talking
with the other delegates.

1349
01:46:05,689 --> 01:46:10,068
The word is, Little Bonaparte is real sore
over what happened to Toothpick Charlie.

1350
01:46:10,151 --> 01:46:14,030
- Him and Charlie was choirboys together.
- Stop or I'll bust out cryin'.

1351
01:46:14,114 --> 01:46:17,826
He even got Charlie's last toothpick
from the garage. Had it gold-plated.

1352
01:46:18,034 --> 01:46:19,994
Like l was tellin' you fellas.

1353
01:46:20,203 --> 01:46:23,456
Little Bonaparte's gettin' soft.
Hasn't got it here any more.

1354
01:46:23,665 --> 01:46:25,959
Used to be like a rock.

1355
01:46:26,042 --> 01:46:30,839
- It's too bad. l think it's time he retired.
- Second the motion.

1356
01:46:30,964 --> 01:46:32,841
How are we gonna retire him?

1357
01:46:32,924 --> 01:46:35,010
Oh, we'll think of somethin' cute.

1358
01:46:35,218 --> 01:46:39,305
Little Bonaparte and Toothpick Charlie
will be singin' in the same choir again.

1359
01:46:42,517 --> 01:46:46,062
But this time we'll make sure
there are no witnesses.

1360
01:46:48,565 --> 01:46:52,444
Look. The two broads from the elevator.

1361
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:57,657
Hey. Join us.

1362
01:46:58,283 --> 01:47:01,202
What's the matter with those dames?

1363
01:47:01,286 --> 01:47:03,580
Maybe those dames ain't dames.

1364
01:47:06,291 --> 01:47:09,002
Same faces, same instruments.

1365
01:47:12,756 --> 01:47:16,301
- Here's your Valentine's card.
- The two musicians from the garage.

1366
01:47:16,426 --> 01:47:21,306
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago,
so we'll finish the job here. Come on.

1367
01:47:39,783 --> 01:47:44,371
- All right, so what do we do now?
- First we gotta get out of these clothes.

1368
01:49:23,219 --> 01:49:24,262
What happened?

1369
01:49:24,471 --> 01:49:27,807
Me and Tiny had them cornered,
but we lost them in the shuffle.

1370
01:49:28,016 --> 01:49:31,227
- Where were you guys?
- We was with you, at Rigoletto's.

1371
01:49:31,353 --> 01:49:35,023
- Why, you stupid idiot.
- Boss, we'll get 'em after the banquet.

1372
01:49:35,148 --> 01:49:37,650
They can't be too far away.

1373
01:49:56,711 --> 01:49:58,797
Thank you.

1374
01:49:58,922 --> 01:50:01,216
Thank you, fellow opera-lovers.

1375
01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:06,638
It's been ten years since l elected myself
president of this organisation,

1376
01:50:06,721 --> 01:50:10,809
and, if l say so myself,
you made the right choice.

1377
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:16,314
Let's look at the record.
ln the last fiscal year,

1378
01:50:16,439 --> 01:50:20,610
we made $1 1 2 million before taxes.

1379
01:50:20,694 --> 01:50:23,738
Only we ain't payin' no taxes.

1380
01:50:24,864 --> 01:50:29,244
Of course, like in every business,
we had our little misunderstandings.

1381
01:50:31,121 --> 01:50:33,331
Let us now observe one minute of silence

1382
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:37,919
in memory of seven of our members
from Chicago, North Side Chapter,

1383
01:50:38,003 --> 01:50:42,716
who are unable to be with us tonight
on account of bein' rubbed out.

1384
01:50:47,178 --> 01:50:49,264
You too, Spats.

1385
01:50:49,472 --> 01:50:51,474
Up.

1386
01:51:01,067 --> 01:51:02,736
Easy, now.

1387
01:51:02,944 --> 01:51:06,156
- You know when you come out?
- Yeah. Second time they sing:

1388
01:51:06,364 --> 01:51:10,452
For he's a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny.

1389
01:51:10,535 --> 01:51:12,537
OK.

1390
01:51:16,499 --> 01:51:20,670
And don't mess up the cake. l promised
to bring back a piece to my kids.

1391
01:51:28,178 --> 01:51:30,472
Now, fellow delegates,

1392
01:51:30,555 --> 01:51:34,225
there comes a time in the life
of every business executive

1393
01:51:34,309 --> 01:51:37,145
when he starts thinkin' about retirement.

1394
01:51:37,228 --> 01:51:39,230
No!

1395
01:51:41,608 --> 01:51:44,944
I'm lookin' around
for somebody to fill my shoes.

1396
01:51:45,070 --> 01:51:48,198
I've been considerin' several candidates.

1397
01:51:48,406 --> 01:51:51,618
For instance, there's
a certain party from Chicago,

1398
01:51:51,826 --> 01:51:53,912
South Side Chapter.

1399
01:51:56,206 --> 01:52:01,753
Now, some people say
he's gotten a little too big for his spats.

1400
01:52:01,836 --> 01:52:05,590
But l say he's a man who'll go far.

1401
01:52:05,715 --> 01:52:09,886
Some people say he's gone too far.

1402
01:52:09,969 --> 01:52:13,640
But l say,
you can't keep a good man down.

1403
01:52:14,766 --> 01:52:16,976
Of course, he's still got a lot to learn.

1404
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:19,688
The big noise he made
on St Valentine's Day,

1405
01:52:19,771 --> 01:52:23,108
that wasn't very good for public relations.

1406
01:52:23,233 --> 01:52:29,072
And lettin' them two witnesses get away.
That sure was careless.

1407
01:52:29,155 --> 01:52:32,200
Don't worry about those two.
They're as good as dead.

1408
01:52:32,283 --> 01:52:34,494
l almost caught up with them today.

1409
01:52:34,577 --> 01:52:38,665
You mean you let 'em get away twice?

1410
01:52:38,748 --> 01:52:42,002
Some people would say
that's real sloppy.

1411
01:52:42,085 --> 01:52:46,256
But l say: to err is human,
to forgive divine.

1412
01:52:46,464 --> 01:52:48,758
And just to show you
what l think of you, Spats,

1413
01:52:49,009 --> 01:52:51,428
the boys told me
you was gonna have a birthday.

1414
01:52:51,511 --> 01:52:53,596
So we baked you a little cake.

1415
01:52:54,431 --> 01:52:56,307
My birthday?

1416
01:52:56,516 --> 01:52:58,935
Why, it ain't for another four months.

1417
01:52:59,019 --> 01:53:02,897
So we're a little early.
What's a few months between friends?

1418
01:53:02,981 --> 01:53:05,400
All right, boys. Now all together.

1419
01:53:05,608 --> 01:53:07,902
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1420
01:53:08,194 --> 01:53:10,405
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1421
01:53:10,613 --> 01:53:14,367
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1422
01:53:14,451 --> 01:53:16,953
Which nobody can deny.

1423
01:53:17,162 --> 01:53:19,039
Which nobody can deny.

1424
01:53:19,247 --> 01:53:21,875
Which nobody can deny.

1425
01:53:22,083 --> 01:53:24,461
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1426
01:53:24,586 --> 01:53:26,671
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1427
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:30,091
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1428
01:53:30,717 --> 01:53:33,845
Which nobody can deny.

1429
01:53:49,194 --> 01:53:51,279
Big joke.

1430
01:53:58,244 --> 01:54:00,246
Let's get outta here.

1431
01:54:03,166 --> 01:54:05,669
Get those two guys.

1432
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:14,302
What happened here?

1433
01:54:14,427 --> 01:54:18,682
There was somethin' in that cake
that didn't agree with 'em.

1434
01:54:19,933 --> 01:54:24,312
My compliments to the chef. Nobody
leaves this room till l get the recipe.

1435
01:54:24,521 --> 01:54:27,023
You wanna make a federal case of it?

1436
01:54:31,528 --> 01:54:33,405
Yeah.

1437
01:55:00,724 --> 01:55:02,600
They slipped through our hands.

1438
01:55:02,684 --> 01:55:06,771
We're watchin' the train station, roads
and airport. They can't get away.

1439
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:09,899
- Did you hear that?
- But they're not watching yachts.

1440
01:55:09,983 --> 01:55:13,028
- You're gonna call Osgood.
- What'll l tell him?

1441
01:55:13,111 --> 01:55:15,822
Tell him you're gonna elope with him.

1442
01:55:15,947 --> 01:55:18,450
Elope? But there are laws, conventions.

1443
01:55:18,533 --> 01:55:22,412
There's a convention, all right.
There's also the ladies' morgue.

1444
01:57:24,659 --> 01:57:26,202
Josephine.

1445
01:57:27,662 --> 01:57:30,373
Bienstock!

1446
01:57:31,332 --> 01:57:33,293
Hey. That's no dame.

1447
01:57:33,835 --> 01:57:36,004
None of that, Sugar.

1448
01:57:36,129 --> 01:57:38,214
No guy is worth it.

1449
01:57:41,426 --> 01:57:43,428
Grab her.

1450
01:57:47,182 --> 01:57:49,142
Josephine?

1451
01:57:54,481 --> 01:57:58,026
- Osgood's meeting us at the pier.
- We're not on the pier yet.

1452
01:58:48,785 --> 01:58:50,161
Hi.

1453
01:58:50,245 --> 01:58:52,872
My friend Josephine,
gonna be a bridesmaid.

1454
01:58:52,956 --> 01:58:55,041
- Pleased to meet you.
- Come on.

1455
01:58:55,166 --> 01:58:57,043
She's so eager.

1456
01:59:11,099 --> 01:59:13,101
Wait for Sugar!

1457
01:59:18,523 --> 01:59:20,859
- Another bridesmaid?
- Flower girl.

1458
01:59:21,026 --> 01:59:24,279
- Sugar, what are you doing?
- l told you, I'm not very bright.

1459
01:59:24,404 --> 01:59:26,489
Let's go.

1460
01:59:29,492 --> 01:59:31,077
You don't want me, Sugar.

1461
01:59:31,286 --> 01:59:33,788
I'm a liar and a phoney.
A saxophone player.

1462
01:59:33,872 --> 01:59:36,291
One of those no-goodniks
you keep running away from.

1463
01:59:36,374 --> 01:59:37,834
l know. Every time.

1464
01:59:38,043 --> 01:59:41,087
Sugar, do yourself a favour.
Go back to the millionaires.

1465
01:59:41,296 --> 01:59:42,839
The sweet end of the lollipop,

1466
01:59:42,964 --> 01:59:46,926
not the coleslaw in the face
and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.

1467
01:59:47,010 --> 01:59:50,138
That's right, pour it on. Talk me out of it.

1468
01:59:54,726 --> 01:59:57,145
l called Mama.
She was so happy, she cried.

1469
01:59:57,354 --> 02:00:00,357
She wants you to have
her wedding gown. It's white lace.

1470
02:00:00,565 --> 02:00:03,610
Osgood, l can't get married
in your mother's dress.

1471
02:00:04,861 --> 02:00:08,198
She and l, we are not built the same way.

1472
02:00:08,406 --> 02:00:10,992
- We can have it altered.
- Oh no, you don't.

1473
02:00:12,035 --> 02:00:15,497
Osgood, I'm gonna level with you.
We can't get married at all.

1474
02:00:15,705 --> 02:00:17,040
Why not?

1475
02:00:17,248 --> 02:00:18,625
Well...

1476
02:00:18,833 --> 02:00:21,336
ln the first place, I'm not a natural blonde.

1477
02:00:21,419 --> 02:00:23,088
Doesn't matter.

1478
02:00:23,213 --> 02:00:25,590
l smoke. l smoke all the time.

1479
02:00:25,799 --> 02:00:27,384
l don't care.

1480
02:00:27,467 --> 02:00:31,763
l have a terrible past. For three years
I've been living with a saxophone player.

1481
02:00:31,846 --> 02:00:33,848
l forgive you.

1482
02:00:35,392 --> 02:00:38,228
l can never have children.

1483
02:00:38,311 --> 02:00:41,773
- We can adopt some.
- You don't understand, Osgood.

1484
02:00:43,858 --> 02:00:46,027
- I'm a man.
- Well,

1485
02:00:46,236 --> 02:00:48,655
nobody's perfect.
