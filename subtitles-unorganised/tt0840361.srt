1
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,111
Driver's name is Arthur Shea.

2
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:54,986
former Medford police officer,
57 years old.

3
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,452
Soon as his partner leaves with
the coal bag...

4
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,991
...Artie cracks The Herald,
and he don't look up till the guy gets back.

5
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,995
Marty MacGuire,
Cummins Armored courier.

6
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,900
5'10", 220, 52 years old.

7
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:13,069
Picks up every Wednesday and Friday
at exactly 8:12.

8
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,907
Makes $110 a day. Carries a SIG 9.

9
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,342
And he's about to get robbed.

10
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:24,214
We're fucked if we see a helicopter,
we're fucked if we see SWAT.

11
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,916
We see a cruiser, stop, take out
the engine blocks, keep moving.

12
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,317
No one needs to get hurt.

13
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,452
Now, these guards
like to test you, though.

14
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,557
They want to get hurt for $10 an hour,
don't get in the way.

15
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:37,959
Let's go.

16
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,183
Move!

17
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,218
All right, now get away
from the counter!

18
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,221
Go! Go! Go! Everybody away!

19
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,654
Back against the wall.

20
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,526
You! Away from the computer!

21
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,595
Give me the fucking key!
Back up! Back! Go! Go!

22
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,132
Get up! Get up!
Get the fucking door!

23
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,331
DEl:
Get on the ground!

24
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,302
- Get down on the ground.
Get your fucking ass on the ground!

25
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,968
DEl:
Move! Go, go, go, go!

26
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,242
On the floor!
I need everybody's BlackBerrys.

27
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,811
- Everybody on the floor.
DEl: Slide your BlackBerrys up.

28
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,412
Take off your fucking shoes!

29
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,850
BlackBerrys to the front!
Slide your fucking phones up.

30
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,285
DEl: The fuck you looking at?
Take your shoes off.

31
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,488
Get the cash drawers. Let's go.

32
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,492
DEl: Take off your fucking shoes!
Take off your shoes.

33
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,559
Bank manager, let's go.
Get up. Let's go.

34
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,528
Get up, come on, get up. Let's go.

35
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:51,034
Not you. You. Get up. Let's go.
Come on.

36
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,735
You trying to be a hero?
Jesus Christ!

37
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,039
When's the time lock set for?
-9:00.

38
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,906
Don't lie to us, it's 8:15.

39
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:02,212
Listen, it's not your money.
You understand? Don't lie to us again.

40
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,714
Hey, sweetheart, in the corner.
Get in the corner. You too, brother-man.

41
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,527
Go. Go.

42
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,135
No distress call. Open it clean.

43
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,473
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't stall.

44
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,109
This guy a fucking friend of yours?

45
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,847
Let's go!

46
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,551
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

47
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,055
Take your time, okay?

48
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,723
Breathe. Go.

49
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,841
Okay, get back. Get out of the way.

50
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,674
Front door.

51
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,645
Hello.
Front door.

52
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,547
Hey, you guys open?

53
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,632
We gotta go.

54
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,204
Let's go. Let's bleach it up.

55
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,941
Go, go, go.
Let's bleach it up.

56
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:16,547
Come on, let's go. We gotta go.
DEl: Hold it. Silent alarm, this address.

57
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,648
Who did it?
- Look, nobody did anything.

58
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:23,319
What? Huh? What'd you say?
Nobody did anything.

59
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,719
You pull the alarm?
- No. No.

60
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,655
Did you?
I didn't pull any alarm.

61
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,192
We were leaving,
you motherfucker! You fuck!

62
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,895
Easy, easy. That's enough.

63
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,166
- All right? Easy.
You fuck!

64
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,804
You fucker. We were out the door,
you fuck.

65
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,237
Let's go.

66
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,082
Where's your purse?

67
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,292
What the fuck is this?

68
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,962
The cops get us walled in,
we're gonna need her.

69
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,030
Sit down. Go.

70
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,109
Head for the boulevard.

71
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,586
You're gonna be okay.

72
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,222
All right? No one's gonna hurt you.

73
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,016
What's up?

74
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:07,791
Boosted a city work van.
Which still hasn't been reported stolen.

75
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,791
Probably too busy working.

76
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,160
Used the van to screen the door.

77
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,430
Bleached the entire place for DNA.

78
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,065
Kills all the clothing fiber,
so we can't get a match.

79
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,702
Silent bell
came from cage number two.

80
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,869
Assistant manager's at Beth Israel.

81
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,706
Our guys waited for the time lock
to expire...

82
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,376
...then they had the manager
open sesame.

83
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,811
Under duress?

84
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,845
I don't know.

85
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:33,880
Ten foot steel safe.

86
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,586
Only as strong
as the guy with the key.

87
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,655
Found the dye packs and the tracers.

88
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,629
Found the van. Torched.

89
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,131
- Where is it?
- Where do you think?

90
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,922
DEl:
Is that where we are now?

91
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,392
Where's Jem?

92
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,895
Stopped on the way
to light a couple house fires...

93
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,664
...stick up a liquor store, maybe,
I don't know.

94
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,000
- Are we taking hostages now?
- No, we're not taking hostages now.

95
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,337
- You gonna talk to this fucking asshole?
- For one thing

96
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:31,639
Hey.

97
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,507
Speak of the fucking devil.

98
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,076
You made it.

99
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,046
- Take the scenic route?
- We got a problem.

100
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,248
- What?
- Well, look.

101
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,150
So what?

102
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,054
DEl: What's the matter?
Let me see that.

103
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,055
Fuck.
Oh, shit.

104
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,792
DEl: See the address on that?
- Bitch lives four blocks away.

105
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,194
Yeah, I know
where we are, Gloans. Fuck.

106
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,564
We gonna see this bitch
on the street every day?

107
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:56,930
She didn't see anything.

108
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,499
DEl:
Jesus, are you sure?

109
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,768
- Taking her for a ride didn't help.
- Yeah.

110
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,638
Oh, fuck.
All right. I'm gonna handle it.

111
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,105
How you gonna handle this?

112
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,909
I'm gonna stalk her
like a fucking A car, we'll find out.

113
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,077
- Find out what?
- If she needs to get scared.

114
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,947
- She's already scared.
- Well, maybe not scared enough.

115
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,954
Thanks, Kathy.

116
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:25,762
Ms. Keesey. Special Agent Adam Frawley,
Violent Crimes and Robbery.

117
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,964
Derek here is gonna take some
elimination prints.

118
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,833
I see you've given
a preliminary statement.

119
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,102
I want to talk to you
about your abduction.

120
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,401
Okay.

121
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:39,240
- I understand they threatened you.
- Mm-hm.

122
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,009
One of them took my license.

123
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,645
And did you try to escape
at any point?

124
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,681
No.

125
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,386
Is there anything you can identify
about the men? Anything you'd testify to?

126
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,022
I didn't try to escape
because they had guns.

127
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,756
I understand.

128
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,427
Then they just let you go?

129
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,130
- Yeah. They just let me go.
Thanks.

130
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,701
Should I have a lawyer here?

131
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:11,909
This isn't a very civil libertarian thing of me
to say, but anyone who lawyers up is guilty.

132
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,175
- I think you're all right.
- Okay.

133
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,248
When someone endures
an experience like this...

134
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,185
...there are very often
residual effects.

135
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,653
It's gonna be okay.

136
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,355
Did they say anything?

137
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:33,030
"If you talk to the FBI, we'll come
to your house and fuck you and kill you. "

138
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,795
Are you gonna take care of it?

139
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:38,033
- I'll do it.
- Why are you gonna do it?

140
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,200
You're the reason
we're having conversation.

141
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,004
- I'm gonna get it done.
- What are you gonna get done? Huh?

142
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,439
You get picked up
for intimidating a witness.

143
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,142
You walk within 100 feet of her,
that's 10 years. Okay?

144
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:52,348
You got two strikes against you already.
They're gonna bury you under the jail.

145
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,616
How much money's in the sack?

146
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,584
All right, we got 90 a pop.

147
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,020
Minus what I had to shave off
for the Florist.

148
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,658
Hey, Jem, what happened
with the assistant manager?

149
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,662
Yeah. Well, next time Skeletor comes
in the bank with an AK...

150
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:10,032
...I think he's gonna think twice
about hitting that alarm, isn't he?

151
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,266
He's lucky he just got tuned up.

152
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,509
- Hey, Rusty. How you doing?
- Hey, Jem. What's up? How are you?

153
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,344
Fergie. Kid's here.

154
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,214
Hey, Fergie.

155
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,550
- Here you go.
- How's it going, son?

156
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:34,090
All right. You run that under the sink,
all right?

157
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,355
Trust me.

158
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,231
All right. Good to see you.

159
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,634
Take it easy, man. Good to see you.

160
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,940
Where are they?
What are they doing right now?

161
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:56,479
They got the money,
now they have to clean it. Casinos. Tracks.

162
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,214
Maybe they make a big drug buy,
flip it across town.

163
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,914
They want to go celebrate, right?

164
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,921
B.P.D., DEA, I want tips,
names, witnesses, anything.

165
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,123
We're gonna knock on some doors,
see who wants to help us out.

166
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,326
Any questions? No? Great. Let's go.

167
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,899
What's going on, pal?

168
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,166
What up?

169
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,668
Hey, there he is.

170
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,036
Boom.
Sober Jackson.

171
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,172
What's up?
- Hey, hey. Krista's here.

172
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,875
Go on, tell the story.

173
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,479
Dougy, sit down. I'm trying to tell
these motherfuckers about your father.

174
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,483
The feds will never understand
the guy who's facing 40 years.

175
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,154
Gonna give him the opportunity
to walk scot-free if he gives up his friends.

176
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,387
He tells them,
"Suck a dick. Give me the 40."

177
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,655
"Fucking suck a dick. "

178
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,859
Yeah, well, here's to Big Mac.

179
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,027
Doing his time like a man.

180
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,165
That's right.
Last crew in Charlestown.

181
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,799
I'm gonna get a tonic, I guess.

182
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,934
All right.
Get me an umbrella for my beer.

183
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,572
Let me get a Shirley Temple
with an extra cherry, please.

184
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,909
Poor fucking sober bastard.

185
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,848
- Thanks.
No problem.

186
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,386
Juice?

187
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,790
Yeah. Juice.

188
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,259
Do you want some snappers
to go with that?

189
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,062
- What are you doing?
- I was just playing.

190
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,997
Fuck.

191
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,000
My drink.

192
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,373
Heard you got in a fight, Kris.

193
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,209
Do I look like I got in a fight?

194
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:39,480
I don't know. Let me see.
They pull your hoop out?

195
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,680
That's right.

196
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,953
Fucking Somalian started talking shit
when I was with my daughter.

197
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,821
- You were with Shyne?
- All they see are yuppies down here.

198
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,958
They think there's no more serious
white people in Charlestown.

199
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,292
So they can fucking talk shit?

200
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,128
No.

201
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,865
Well, do you miss it?

202
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,701
Fucking coke and Oxy
and all that shit? Yeah, I miss it.

203
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,573
We smoked it to the filter, right?

204
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,210
You know what I miss?

205
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,987
There you go.

206
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,788
There you go.

207
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,391
That's what you want, right?

208
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,629
- Yeah.
- Is that what you want?

209
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,833
- Say you love it.
- Oh, fuck.

210
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,674
Good night.

211
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,699
I'm grateful to be here today.

212
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:10,639
Growing up in Charlestown in,
you know, a small-knit community...

213
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,908
...we took care of each other,
were protected.

214
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,975
My friends were really
like my family.

215
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,577
I'm ashamed of the things I done
when I'm out there.

216
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,679
I don't know
where I learned these things.

217
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,985
Seven years went by,
and I'd watch Christmas, birthdays

218
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,918
I didn't know what my son looked like.

219
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,087
Make a fast buck if we had to...

220
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:31,593
...that progressed
into getting arrested, and...

221
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:35,464
The struggle that you have within yourself,
the loss, you know what I mean?

222
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:39,701
The disappointment in yourself. The anger
that turns into disappointment. The despair.

223
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,704
It's like the guy sitting in the bar,
and a priest walks in.

224
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,404
The guy says, "Hey, wait a minute.

225
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,778
I hate to tell you this, don't waste your
time, but I happen to know there's no God. "

226
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,611
The priest says, "Yeah, how's that?"

227
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,116
The guy says,
"I was an explorer in the North Pole.

228
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,718
I got caught in a blinding storm once.
Freezing. I was blinded.

229
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:01,490
Freezing to death. And I prayed,
'If there's a God, save me now. '

230
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,156
Now, God didn't come. "

231
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:07,029
And the priest says, you know, "How's
that? You're alive. He must've saved you. "

232
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,694
He says, "God never showed up.

233
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,902
An Eskimo came along.
Took me back to his camp and saved me. "

234
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:16,104
That's Janice. She's my wife
and she's sitting right there.

235
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,173
She's my Eskimo.

236
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,421
- How you doing?
Hey.

237
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,323
Excuse me?

238
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:46,727
Are you doing laundry?

239
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,362
Huh?

240
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,333
I just wondered if you had any change.
The machine is out.

241
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,270
- Can't help you. Sorry.
- Okay.

242
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,174
I can just hang them up
when I get home.

243
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,771
You all right?

244
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,608
I'm fine. I'm just

245
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,409
Are you sure?

246
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:41,847
You okay?

247
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,920
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, thank you.
I'm fine, yeah.

248
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,821
Well, this is embarrassing.

249
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,458
No, you got nothing
to be embarrassed for.

250
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,260
Do you need help?

251
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,930
I'm just having a bad week.

252
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,867
I understand.

253
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,438
I like to have a good cry
at the nail salon.

254
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:11,114
Just open right up to the ladies.
They're very understanding.

255
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,415
But, you know,
you like the Laundromat, so that's fine.

256
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,860
Hey, why don't you let me
buy you a drink.

257
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,495
Make up for letting you down
with the quarters.

258
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,264
You know, see if we can turn
your week around.

259
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,065
What's the worst that could happen?

260
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,535
FBI! Open the door!

261
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,134
Open the door!

262
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,072
Fuck.

263
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,413
Fuck.

264
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,582
Fucking cocksucker. Get off him.

265
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,298
Jesus Christ, Henry.

266
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,167
Oxy, guns?

267
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,569
It's like townie Christmas.

268
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:16,176
Minimum federal sentencing,
10 years.

269
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,213
You're gonna need a friend.

270
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,151
And she ain't it.

271
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:28,790
Great girl, though.
She really loves you, I can tell.

272
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,927
Good news for you is you have an alibi
for the Cambridge job.

273
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:36,865
The good news for me
is I bet you know something about it.

274
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,334
Everyone does trucks.

275
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,237
These guys beat the alarm
for the vault.

276
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,438
- Yeah?
It's what I heard.

277
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:49,345
A kid, he gets into the junction box.

278
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,120
There she is.
- Hey.

279
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,790
All set?
- Yes.

280
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,794
I should have come
get your door for you, huh?

281
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,898
What kind of a guy lets you open
your own door like that?

282
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,467
What?

283
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,304
I have to get something out there...

284
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,942
...otherwise I'll be pretending
to listen to you all night...

285
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,611
...when really I'm thinking about
something else.

286
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,045
Okay.

287
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,251
A few days ago my bank was robbed.

288
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,955
Four men took it over
and opened the safe.

289
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:38,394
They took me as a hostage.

290
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,830
They blindfolded me
and drove me around.

291
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,136
And then they stopped and let me out
over at the beach and...

292
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,807
And one of the guys told me...

293
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,779
...to walk until I felt the water
on my toes.

294
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:02,050
It was the longest walk of my life.
I kept thinking I'd step off a cliff.

295
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,689
And then I felt the water.

296
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,426
I'm sorry.

297
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,363
It's not your fault.

298
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:22,472
Anyway, the FBI guy told me
it would feel like I was in mourning.

299
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,740
FBI? You're working with the FBI?

300
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,340
Mm-hm.

301
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,010
What does that mean?

302
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,948
Guy comes by, checks in on you,
gives you a call? That kind of thing?

303
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,682
Pretty much.

304
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:40,055
They don't have any suspects?
Any clues? Any leads? Anything like that?

305
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,822
I don't know.
Not that they've told me.

306
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,793
He intimated that they were
scouring Charlestown...

307
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,466
...but they were wearing masks, so...

308
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,468
- Shit.
- Mm.

309
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:58,272
I'm sure I'd recognize their voices
if I heard them again.

310
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,644
I don't know,
might be harder than you think.

311
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,147
So, what do you do for work?

312
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,383
Boston Sand and Gravel.

313
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,554
I break rocks.
Punch a ticket at the end of the day...

314
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,590
...slide down the back of a brontosaurus
like Fred Flintstone.

315
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,857
Call it a night.

316
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,094
- Can I ask you something?
- You sure can.

317
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,731
I volunteer at the Boys & Girls Club
in Charlestown

318
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,063
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

319
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,171
As a kickball pitcher since they haven't
been able to afford any ice for the rink.

320
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:32,006
Embarrassing. City won't put
any money into that place.

321
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,977
Yeah, I know. Yeah, well, some of the kids
were calling me a toonie.

322
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:40,147
It just means a yuppie. Someone who's
not from Charlestown, that's all.

323
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,619
- Of course it does.
- They're just being punks.

324
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:52,361
Hey, Jem. How's it going?
Hey, B. Can I have a beer? Thanks.

325
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:53,626
Oh, shit.
- What up?

326
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,231
- How you doing?
- All right. Sox got rocked.

327
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,468
What's going on?

328
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,007
You, uh, check on that thing?

329
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,274
What?

330
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:10,578
The license.

331
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:14,582
- Yeah.
- And?

332
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,785
Nothing. It's a dead end. We're all set.

333
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,220
So no need to remove her
from the equation?

334
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,792
- What?
- You heard me.

335
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:28,028
What are you, a triggerman now?

336
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,329
Just loose ends, kid.

337
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:35,504
You're gonna get the fucking electric
chair brought back over to Charlestown.

338
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,004
Don't be so goddamned panicked,
all right, Dig Dug?

339
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,341
Just, you know, I don't wanna get
backdoored, that's all.

340
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:44,378
- We're fine. All right?
- All right. We're fine.

341
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,848
- Okay.
- We're fine.

342
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,418
They obviously know
how to work the box.

343
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:55,624
But I like the way they zapped the BPT
to the D-5 station.

344
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,924
How does one learn how to do that?

345
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,127
Get a job at Vericom.

346
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,931
- Okay.
- Thank you.

347
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,802
All right, let's subpoena work logs,
employee records.

348
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,969
Start with everybody
who lives in the town.

349
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,571
Got it.

350
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,338
I lied to the FBI.

351
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,174
What?

352
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,044
When the guy attacked David...

353
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,781
...I could see the back of his neck
and he had a tattoo.

354
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,316
Of what?

355
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,921
It was one of those
Fighting Irish tattoos.

356
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,624
I'm afraid if I report it
they'll make me testify.

357
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,160
What do you think I should do?

358
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,831
Tell the FBI.

359
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:43,138
If the guy's got a record,
and I'm sure he does...

360
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,939
...they'll have his tattoos on file.

361
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:48,407
They'll ring him up the next day.

362
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:51,579
Robbery, weapons. He'll get 30 years.

363
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:55,282
Course, they'll worry someone's
gonna come looking for the witness.

364
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:59,321
The FBI will probably want to put you in
WITSEC, you know, Witness Security.

365
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:03,558
You know, they'll probably put you
somewhere, like, you know, in Cleveland...

366
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,926
...or Arizona, you know,
somewhere safe.

367
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,596
Or...

368
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,731
...you could wait.

369
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,668
You have a card.

370
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,872
There's nothing says you gotta play it
right away.

371
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:22,143
You're the one who's vulnerable
in this situation right now.

372
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:25,145
The FBI are just people
like anyone else.

373
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,315
They wanna find the bad guy so they
can go home and nuke their supper.

374
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,552
You have to look out
for yourself, Claire.

375
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,154
Quite an expert.

376
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,725
Not really.

377
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,560
Just watch a lot of TV.

378
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,430
I watch a lot of CSI.

379
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,601
So I'm a really big expert
on all this. I know.

380
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:51,172
And Miami CSI and New York CSI.

381
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,206
All of them, I watch.

382
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,707
You'll be well-prepared.

383
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,275
And Bones.

384
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:05,455
Do we know each other well enough for
me to say that this truck is a little much?

385
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:06,753
It's my work truck.

386
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,090
If you have problems with your Prius
I can throw it in the back.

387
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,258
How did you know I had a Prius?

388
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,265
Took a guess.
I mean, it just seemed like a toonie car.

389
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,267
- Why, do you really have a Prius?
- Yeah.

390
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,804
- Really?
- I had a Prius.

391
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,972
- It got vandalized, of course.
- What happened?

392
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:29,510
Doesn't matter. Now I'm forced to walk
a mile through the projects.

393
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:33,048
- There were these guys and they started...
- What?

394
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,083
I'm not sure if it was the same guys
who trashed my car, but

395
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:39,754
They started getting, you know
It started with yelling when I walked by...

396
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,155
...and then it got
really aggressive and...

397
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,522
What were they doing?

398
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,859
Once glass bottles
started getting thrown...

399
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:49,965
...I started coming to terms with not being
cool enough to walk through the projects.

400
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,931
They threw bottles at you?

401
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,704
I'm fine. I just have to, you know,
go the long way.

402
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,038
That's all. It doesn't matter.

403
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,741
No. You just have to live with it,
I guess.

404
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:03,844
You remember what they look like?

405
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,484
I need your help.
I can't tell you what it is...

406
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:15,189
...you can never ask me about it later,
and we're gonna hurt some people.

407
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,225
Whose car are we gonna take?

408
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,668
Townie credit card.

409
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,995
Who is it?
Open up.

410
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,067
What the?

411
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:12,747
Oh, shit, that hurts, huh?
Is that your throwing hand?

412
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,317
If you're still here in a week,
we're coming back.

413
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,319
Let's go, we're done.

414
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,488
Hey.

415
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,725
- What'd you do?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

416
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,860
That's my brother.
What'd you do to him?

417
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,863
I don't know what you're talking about.

418
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,265
You don't know? How about now?
No.

419
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,700
Hey, chill, chill, chill, man. Chill.
Chill, man.

420
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,235
Don't tell me to chill.

421
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,037
Enough. Let's go.
What'd you do?

422
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,106
- I don't know what you're talking about.
No?

423
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,376
There goes college soccer.
Hey, look at me.

424
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,778
See my face?

425
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,148
Go tell the cops, all right?

426
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:52,353
But just remember, I seen yours too.

427
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,354
Fuck.

428
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,702
I can't be up there
killing people, man.

429
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,337
Hey, you brought me.

430
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:22,814
Desmond Elden?

431
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,886
Yeah, works for Vericom.
Never seen the inside of a jail cell.

432
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,721
Most of these guys got no-show jobs.
Take down a truck...

433
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:32,427
...foreman goes, "Yeah, guy was here
yesterday. " He shows us a forged timecard.

434
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,495
Can't play them games at Vericom
because it's a public company.

435
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,663
You don't show up,
it's a recorded sick day.

436
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,467
And Dezzy here,
he's got some interesting sick days.

437
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:46,744
BankBoston, Cummins Armored,
Arlington Brinks, Cambridge Merchants.

438
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,214
Jesus Christ.

439
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,321
So do your parents
still live in Charlestown?

440
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:05,861
No, my father finally
made it out to the suburbs.

441
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,927
What about your mother?

442
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,298
I couldn't tell you.
She left when I was 6.

443
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,035
What happened?

444
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,972
She left.

445
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,912
Okay.

446
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,593
This sound woke me up.

447
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,166
At first I didn't know what it was.

448
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,336
Sounded like an animal
that got trapped.

449
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,574
I never heard a man cry before.

450
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,346
I came downstairs in my underwear.

451
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:03,116
I see my father in the kitchen.

452
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,851
First thing I remember was the ashtray.

453
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,488
Must have been a hundred cigarettes
in there.

454
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,158
Ash like a little mountain.

455
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,561
He stopped crying...

456
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:18,333
...was just sitting there watching TV
on a little black-and-white.

457
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,166
No sound.

458
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,172
I think he just didn't know
what else to do.

459
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:31,779
He looked at me standing there
in the doorway in my Underoos.

460
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:38,486
He said, "Your mother left.
She's not coming back. "

461
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,955
Just like that.

462
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:48,929
Smoking cigarettes and eating
a TV dinner at 6 in the morning.

463
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:55,502
We lost our dog the year before...

464
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,741
...and I wanted to make these posters...

465
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,611
...in case my mother was lost...

466
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,613
...someone could call us...

467
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,450
...like the guy who found our dog.

468
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:15,590
To this day my father will tell you he helped
me make them posters, but he didn't.

469
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:19,627
Sat in the kitchen, drank a case of beer
while I went out on School Street...

470
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,530
...asking people
if they'd seen my mother.

471
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:24,831
Her name was Doris.

472
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:30,173
My grandmother had a place
that's a restaurant in Tangerine, Florida.

473
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,239
So I used to imagine
maybe that's where she went.

474
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:40,184
Then I came to terms with the fact
that doesn't really matter, you know?

475
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:44,953
Wherever she went,
she had a good reason to leave here.

476
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,923
She didn't wanna be
my mother anymore...

477
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,594
...and she wasn't coming back.

478
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,533
And now you know a little bit
about my family...

479
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,436
...but I'm still not showing you
my apartment.

480
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:06,373
How bad can it be?

481
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,152
Oh, yeah.

482
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,634
Desmond Elden.

483
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,507
Systems tech at Vericom,
22 years old.

484
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,445
Albert Magloan. Only in Boston
is a guy named Albert Magloan.

485
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:46,914
Mr. Magloan never met a car
he couldn't boost.

486
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,947
The kind of talented individual...

487
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:52,854
...that can start your Cherokee for you
while you're still looking for your keys.

488
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:57,158
James Coughlin. Father was killed
in prison, mother died of HIV.

489
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,827
Shot 8rendan Leahey by the cemetery
behind Mishawum when he was 18.

490
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,999
Pled it out. When the judge asked him why
he did it, he said, "I didn't like the kid. "

491
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,234
Served nine years for manslaughter.

492
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:11,104
These guys plan and execute
with sophistication and discipline.

493
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,806
And that is not our boy Coughlin.

494
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:18,447
We think the architect is this guy,
Coughlin's best friend, Doug MacRay.

495
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,946
Lives in the same house,
dated Coughlin's sister...

496
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:25,688
...who most likely mules for the Florist,
who used to employ MacRay's father.

497
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,222
You need a fucking Venn diagram
for these people.

498
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:33,829
Mac Sr. got life for the Nashua job,
which most of you should remember.

499
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,061
Hijacked a bread truck
up to New Hampshire...

500
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,531
...one of the guards saw his face...

501
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,368
...so they executed both of them
with their own weapons.

502
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,038
Big Mac's legacy is now no A car driver
is allowed to leave the cab...

503
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,374
...even if there's a gun
to his partner's head.

504
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,644
MacRay did eight months
for going over the counter at a BayBank...

505
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,811
...with a nail gun
after he washed out from pro hockey.

506
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,649
- Pro hockey?
Yeah, he was a big deal for a minute.

507
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,318
Got drafted, went to camp,
and here's the shocker:

508
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,552
Started making trouble,
fighting with guys.

509
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,024
- Don't they pay you to fight in hockey?
- No, not the guys on your own team.

510
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,760
MacRay came home,
got into the family business.

511
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,528
Same song, got into OxyContin.

512
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,832
Hockey ship sailed with the narcotics.

513
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,469
Now, we are a long way away
from a grand jury here.

514
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,536
We'll never get 24-hour surveillance...

515
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,274
...unless one of these idiots converts
to Islam.

516
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,275
So we build the case.

517
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,944
All right, let's get to work.

518
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,647
So I've been telling all my friends
about you.

519
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,850
- Oh, yeah? All good, I hope.
- Yeah.

520
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,352
Eh.

521
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:37,691
Oh, yeah.
They say they're overcome with jealousy.

522
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,259
They can't believe your luck.

523
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:45,065
You moved to Charlestown,
hooked up with a rock-breaking townie.

524
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,099
No.

525
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:52,204
They just think it's a rebound.

526
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,239
A rebound from what, the robbery?

527
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,874
I don't know.

528
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,079
I feel estranged from them somehow.

529
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:04,017
What? Why do you look like that?

530
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:09,624
- My brother died on a day like this.
- When was this?

531
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,361
He was little. He had lymphoma.

532
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:19,133
So now on really sunny days
I always think of someone dying.

533
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,503
That's wrong, isn't it?

534
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,104
No.

535
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:29,241
I'm sure he'd be glad
you're thinking about him.

536
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,679
This is a good day.

537
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,914
I'm having a good time.

538
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,583
Good.

539
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,687
Then you'll miss me while I'm gone.

540
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,036
Money, bitch.

541
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,673
Pop.

542
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,845
What the fuck you doing here? Huh?

543
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,613
Nothing.
- Nothing? What's this?

544
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,414
- Who're you here with, huh?
- No one.

545
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,217
- Let's get out of here.
You're telling me this is yours?

546
00:39:12,382 --> 00:39:14,052
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Fucking Hawaiian pizza?

547
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:15,821
- Sit down.
- Let's hit the road.

548
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,390
- I gotta go.
- Sit the fuck down. Just sit down.

549
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,804
- Hi.
- Hi.

550
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,007
- Hey.
- Claire.

551
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,307
- I'm Jem.
- Jim?

552
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:37,976
Jem. Jem. It's just Jem, yeah.

553
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,979
I'm friend of this loser right here.

554
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,618
- Nice to meet you.
- Sit down, sit down, relax. All right?

555
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:55,463
So I saw your fucking Avalanche
parked around the corner, so...

556
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:56,761
The Avalanche?

557
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,666
- A truck.
- Fucking truck. His work truck right there.

558
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:03,670
- Dougy's quite the worker.
- Yeah.

559
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,038
Have you two known each other
a long time or...?

560
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:09,877
Since we were 6.
We're like brothers. Right?

561
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,845
But he's never mentioned a word
about you.

562
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,682
The secrets with this one, you know, huh?

563
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,522
Did you say your name was Jim
or Jem?

564
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,992
It's Ji - Je
Well, it's both, actually.

565
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,762
Teachers, when we were growing up,
used to always say:

566
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,397
"Hey, you can have this one.
He's a real gem. "

567
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,899
So I guess it kind of stuck.

568
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,737
Whatever. I don't know.

569
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,006
So, what do you do
for yourself there, Claire?

570
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,041
Oh, I work at a bank.
I'm a bank manager.

571
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,811
You're a bank manager?
Sounds fun. What bank?

572
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,113
Cambridge Merchants. Just over there.

573
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,786
Cambridge Merchants. Wait, that's the one
that just got robbed, isn't it?

574
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,686
It got robbed, yeah. It did, yeah.

575
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:57,290
I read about that. It's crazy.

576
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,457
So then how is it that you two met?

577
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,725
Um...

578
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,662
We met at a Laundromat.

579
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,963
Okay.

580
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,633
Love among the bleach, right?

581
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,568
Hey, it happens more than you think.

582
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:18,679
Hey, Claire, don't get too used
to your life of leisure here.

583
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,982
Dougy here, he's a real workaholic,
you know.

584
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,618
He's always taking his work home
with him.

585
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,251
Aren't you?

586
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,589
- All right.
All right, brother.

587
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,325
Take care of yourself, all right?
Be good.

588
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,629
I'll see you at home.
It was nice to meet you.

589
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,128
You too.

590
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:46,774
Well, I guess you haven't been telling
all your friends about me.

591
00:41:53,543 --> 00:41:56,248
Who you following, Jem?
Me or her?

592
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,584
I told you, I made the Avalanche.

593
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,321
Nothing to worry about.
It's all under control.

594
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,356
Oh, so you're trying to get us
jammed up?

595
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,793
- Is that it?
- I'm trying to get you jammed up.

596
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:10,095
Tell me you got a move here, Dougy.

597
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:14,035
Because the only way I see it is you
got sprung like a goddamn bear trap...

598
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,406
...on some toonie pussy who happens
to be the one goddamn person - Fuck!

599
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:21,708
The one person that can give us
to the fucking feds.

600
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:27,848
Calm down, all right?

601
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:30,382
Don't you think we need to be smart
right now?

602
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,585
- Smart?
- Yeah.

603
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,288
Let's start fucking all the witnesses.
All right?

604
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:40,662
Yeah, I'm blowing the assistant manager.
Am I smart now? Huh?

605
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:45,098
And no, I didn't tell the other guys,
only because they'd flip the fuck out.

606
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,733
And I want them fucking ready
for the next thing.

607
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,035
I told you, the next fucking thing's
not ready.

608
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,368
Then make it ready.

609
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:55,276
I don't like the guards
on the next thing, all right?

610
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,744
One kid is like fucking G.I. Joe.

611
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:02,182
He wears the vest on the outside, tucks
his pants into his fucking combat boots.

612
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,049
The truck's fucking waist-high.

613
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:07,053
We'll find another truck
with a driver...

614
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:10,022
...who's a fucking fat kid
with his fucking shit untucked...

615
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:13,293
- ... who don't think he's Special Forces.
- Yeah?

616
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:16,362
All right, look, I know you're
happy in Fuck City over there...

617
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,299
...but I waited nine years in Walpole
for you, motherfucker.

618
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,668
Just nine years, that's all.

619
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,970
I'm done waiting.

620
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:29,709
This is the last one.
We're hitting pause after this.

621
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,114
We get pinched,
remember whose idea this was, okay?

622
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,249
Be ready on Friday.

623
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,734
Visitors, straight ahead.

624
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,667
- Who you seeing?
- Stephen MacRay.

625
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,918
Twelve.

626
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:48,754
- Right down there.
- Thanks, Lenny.

627
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:13,214
You all right? Every time I come up
here now it's the red pajamas.

628
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,414
You still getting in trouble, Dad?

629
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:19,653
Hey, you know how it is.
I can't take no shit.

630
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,521
You're getting a little old
for that bullshit, aren't you?

631
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:25,291
Fucking Southie kids.
They wanna run everything.

632
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:28,963
Listen, you put a year together of
good behavior and get your points down...

633
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,363
...you get classed out
over to Norfolk, Dad.

634
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,533
No one's gonna bother you there.
Nobody fights, you know?

635
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:37,470
They got fucking Ben & Jerry's
ice cream and shit.

636
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:41,876
Well, some things you gotta deal with
yourself, you know?

637
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:47,913
All right.

638
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:58,926
I'm thinking about taking a trip.

639
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,262
- Going dark for a minute.
- Taking heat?

640
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,464
Nah, just making a change.

641
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,332
Yeah, don't tell me.

642
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:08,868
"Making a change. "

643
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,636
Either you got heat or you don't.

644
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,740
I heard a bread truck got dropped.

645
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,377
Oh, yeah? I didn't hear about it.

646
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,513
Okay.

647
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:24,551
You got five minutes. Five minutes.

648
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,219
Let me ask you something.

649
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,387
In case I don't see you again.

650
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:35,093
How come you never...?

651
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,230
How come you never looked for her?

652
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,935
Uh...

653
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,002
Looked for who?

654
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,872
For Ma.

655
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:51,477
For my mother.
How come you never looked for her?

656
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,915
How come you never tried to call nobody
or look for her, or ask around?

657
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,282
Look, when your mother left...

658
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:02,756
...you cried so hard you were throwing up.
All over the parlor.

659
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:07,160
So I told you if you looked around
you might find her.

660
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,461
Just to give you an activity.

661
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,865
I didn't think you'd carry it
like a fucking disease.

662
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,571
What, you wanna think
she was an angel?

663
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,637
Go ahead.

664
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,674
But look out your front door.

665
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,545
How many 22-year-old girls
are out there...

666
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:30,151
...they're fucking around
with kids they don't want...

667
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:34,588
...and, you know,
no sense in their heads.

668
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,591
And your mother wasn't no different.

669
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,859
That's the hard truth.

670
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,333
I made my peace with it.
You make yours.

671
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:50,471
I didn't look for her
because there was nothing to find.

672
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:03,484
Look, I gotta die five times
before I get out of here...

673
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:07,187
...but I'll see you again.

674
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,222
This side or the other.

675
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:45,757
So I saw your picture yesterday.

676
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:51,530
- Are you sure it was me?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

677
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,601
- Oh, the Boys & Girls Club?
- Yeah.

678
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,836
It was under a "local heroes" banner.

679
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,407
Yeah. They got a real low standard
for who qualifies on that.

680
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,408
Apparently you were drafted.

681
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:09,251
Yeah. I was slow.
And I couldn't skate backwards.

682
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,552
You're supposed to be able to skate
backwards in pro hockey.

683
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:17,225
But I could shoot, you know?
I could hit anything with a hockey puck.

684
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:22,963
But I got drafted and I just didn't do
what it took to make the team.

685
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:27,767
And when I got a second chance,
I blew that too.

686
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,538
They sent me home and that was it.

687
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:35,141
I look at that picture
and I see a 20-year-old kid...

688
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,043
...who thinks he's, you know,
got it all figured out.

689
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:42,982
Right before he's about
to throw it all away.

690
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:56,928
Hey, I don't wanna rush anything,
but can we go into your room?

691
00:49:57,093 --> 00:49:59,898
Because my uncle the bus driver
lives right across the way...

692
00:50:00,062 --> 00:50:02,867
...and he can see
right into this apartment.

693
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,705
- Yes.
- Okay.

694
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,211
MAN They win the game
in overtime. Then you flip it over.

695
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,977
Then you go back to fenway Park.

696
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:49,882
Then you get another great ending
to another...

697
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,536
MAN
19, we walked through.

698
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:47,105
Nothing appears disturbed.

699
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,475
In this apartment anyway.

700
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,310
Where the fuck's the truck?

701
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:55,348
MAN
We shut and locked the door, but...

702
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:58,016
- What happened to 8:45?
- Late is what happened.

703
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,750
Fucking douche bag.

704
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:25,777
Say your prayers. Here we go.

705
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:30,781
Here we go.

706
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,435
Gun!

707
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:53,471
Don't move!

708
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,412
Go! Go!
Get back! Get back!

709
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,614
Get out of the way!

710
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:14,959
WOMAN
Any units in the area, 10-61 in progress.

711
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,428
The call went out!

712
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,029
Fuck.

713
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,933
Get out here, asshole,
I got your friend.

714
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,238
Calm down. Put your gun away,
all right? You're gonna get hurt.

715
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,939
Put that fucking gun down now.
I got you, motherfucker.

716
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,874
Jesus!

717
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,846
You should have stayed in the truck, cunt.

718
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:36,480
Let's go!

719
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,917
What the fuck just happened?

720
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:43,557
Goddamn it, I fucking told you.
Fucking shut the fuck up, all right?

721
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,255
Fucking knew it.
Goddamn it!

722
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:50,364
All right, drive. Just take it easy, all
right? Take it easy. Drive slow. Drive normal.

723
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:55,131
- Shit.
Ah, fuck.

724
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,769
They must have been around the corner.

725
00:54:39,408 --> 00:54:42,247
Driver, turn your engine off.

726
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:45,082
Hands where I can see them.

727
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,318
Fuck.

728
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:50,690
Shut the engine off now.
Put your hands in the a

729
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,866
Hit the engine block!

730
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,502
Go, go, go, go, go!

731
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,328
Go to the fucking switch!

732
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,203
Fuck!

733
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,814
How do you like that, motherfucker?

734
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,994
Let's go, let's go!

735
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,763
It's Dez.
Let's go, let's go!

736
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,231
Drop it!

737
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,745
Let's go!

738
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,063
Dino.

739
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,532
What?

740
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:43,200
Close the bridge.

741
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:47,406
- What?
- Close the fucking bridge.

742
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:08,193
WOMAN
Alpha 101, Alpha 412, Alpha 407...

743
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:10,528
...en route to the north end
of the bridge.

744
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:12,830
They're going for the bridge.

745
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:54,873
Now, that's how you drive
a fucking car.

746
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,324
DEl:
All the DNA in Charlestown.

747
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,858
You print the inside of the van?

748
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,227
frawl, the inside of the van
is a volcano.

749
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:53,066
Just find something and make it look
like something that looks like a print.

750
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,234
We don't have enough
for a conviction. Fine.

751
00:58:56,632 --> 00:58:58,402
But I need to get them in a room.

752
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,940
Right now, they are burning the money
bands at some bullshit safe house.

753
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:04,944
All their alibis were paid for
a week in advance.

754
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:08,313
We're not gonna pull any DNA
off of this or off the switch car.

755
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:11,818
And that, as they say, is that.

756
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:16,389
This is the "not fucking around" crew.
Find me something that looks like a print...

757
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,325
...so I can grab one of these assholes
and shake their tree.

758
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:22,127
This "not fucking around" thing
is about to go both ways.

759
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,017
Turn around for me, will you?

760
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:00,165
Go ahead,
just read what's on that paper.

761
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:06,873
"Come here, get on the ground,
before I pop your fucking teeth out!"

762
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:11,810
Come on, read it. Read it all.
There's about five things there.

763
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,412
Uh...

764
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,015
What is it with you guys
in Charlestown?

765
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:20,219
Don't they teach you how to read?
There's things here. Read them.

766
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,653
I don't wanna read that.
This doesn't sound right.

767
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:25,991
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.
Read the pages, please.

768
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,325
I'm trying to make this
sound authenticious.

769
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:30,795
- You got it all fucked up.
- Authen-what?

770
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:35,066
Thanks.

771
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:38,036
- Hey, Dougy. How are you?
Oh.

772
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,504
How you doing?

773
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:43,607
Local crime fighter.

774
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,508
What's happening, Dino?

775
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,146
I know your father.

776
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:52,616
Yeah. Me too.

777
01:00:52,781 --> 01:00:54,886
Got a few years left on his bid.

778
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:57,555
Yeah, one or two.

779
01:00:58,754 --> 01:01:01,092
I hear they got to the old guy.

780
01:01:01,723 --> 01:01:03,393
Split him up the back.

781
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:04,827
Fucking animals.

782
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:07,732
You'd think they'd go after
a younger kid.

783
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:11,036
I don't know.
Making a statement, I guess.

784
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,772
Townie crews ain't
what they used to be.

785
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:16,706
Dorchester...

786
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,141
...Southie...

787
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,710
...looking to make a move.

788
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:23,981
Maybe you can change all that
when you get up there.

789
01:01:26,145 --> 01:01:28,917
Let me ask you a question.
What do you call a guy...

790
01:01:29,082 --> 01:01:32,321
...who grows up with a group of people,
gets to know their secrets...

791
01:01:32,485 --> 01:01:34,555
...because they trust him,
and then turns around...

792
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:38,493
...and use those secrets against them,
put those people in prison?

793
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:42,097
You'd call him a rat, right?
You know what I call him?

794
01:01:42,261 --> 01:01:43,931
Dino the dago.

795
01:01:44,097 --> 01:01:46,936
Those people made you
a part of that community.

796
01:01:47,133 --> 01:01:48,936
What did they get for it?

797
01:01:49,402 --> 01:01:51,672
Inside of the fucking can.

798
01:01:53,503 --> 01:01:57,077
You know we lifted a print
off the van? Right?

799
01:02:05,381 --> 01:02:07,518
Special Agent Frawley...

800
01:02:07,817 --> 01:02:08,852
...Douglas MacRay.

801
01:02:11,721 --> 01:02:13,391
You and your boys didn't just...

802
01:02:14,224 --> 01:02:18,298
...roll a Star Market
over in Malden for a box of quarters.

803
01:02:18,661 --> 01:02:20,664
No, you decided to bang it out...

804
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:24,170
...in the North End at 9:00 in the morning.
With assault rifles.

805
01:02:25,134 --> 01:02:28,473
You fucking dummies shot a guard.

806
01:02:29,772 --> 01:02:33,579
Now you're like a half-off sale
at Big and Tall. Every cop is in line.

807
01:02:33,743 --> 01:02:35,580
Fortunately, though, for you...

808
01:02:35,745 --> 01:02:38,517
...this guard,
who is two-thirds to a retard...

809
01:02:38,681 --> 01:02:40,284
...has miraculously clung to life.

810
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:42,086
Now, if it were up to me...

811
01:02:42,252 --> 01:02:44,990
...and they gave me two minutes
and a wet towel...

812
01:02:45,355 --> 01:02:47,659
...I would personally asphyxiate
this half-wit...

813
01:02:47,824 --> 01:02:50,028
...so we could string you up
on a federal M1...

814
01:02:50,193 --> 01:02:52,397
...and end this story
with a bag on your head...

815
01:02:52,562 --> 01:02:55,401
...and a paralyzing agent
running through your veins.

816
01:02:56,599 --> 01:02:59,938
This isn't fucking townie hopscotch
anymore, Doug.

817
01:03:01,538 --> 01:03:03,808
But I did want to say one thing.

818
01:03:05,308 --> 01:03:07,645
You're here today
so I could personally tell you...

819
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:10,782
...that you are going to die
in federal prison.

820
01:03:11,648 --> 01:03:13,818
And so are all your friends.

821
01:03:14,183 --> 01:03:15,752
No deal.

822
01:03:16,152 --> 01:03:17,354
No compromise.

823
01:03:18,655 --> 01:03:20,625
And when that day comes...

824
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:23,695
...when you start trying to be
my hero collaborator so hard...

825
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:26,832
...that I have to slap you to shut up
And it will come...

826
01:03:26,996 --> 01:03:32,874
...despite your pitiable,
misguided, Irish omerta.

827
01:03:33,036 --> 01:03:36,543
- when your code of silence
finally gives way...

828
01:03:36,706 --> 01:03:41,782
...to fear of trafficking in cigarettes
to prevent sexual enslavement...

829
01:03:43,112 --> 01:03:47,954
...I just want you to know that it's gonna
be me who tells you to go fuck yourself.

830
01:03:52,722 --> 01:03:57,097
Hey, next time you guys
wanna take pictures of me, just call ahead.

831
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:59,397
You know, we can do better
than a barbeque.

832
01:03:59,562 --> 01:04:01,799
A calendar shoot. You know?

833
01:04:01,965 --> 01:04:03,668
Maybe topless, lubed up.

834
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:05,736
Whatever you guys are into.

835
01:04:06,669 --> 01:04:09,207
FBI car antennas
are half-inch matte black...

836
01:04:09,372 --> 01:04:12,110
...about three-quarters the way down
the rear windshield.

837
01:04:12,275 --> 01:04:13,510
Statie are pigtailed...

838
01:04:13,676 --> 01:04:15,446
...B.P.D., half and half.

839
01:04:15,845 --> 01:04:19,886
Every peewee in the town knows
what an FBI rear antenna looks like.

840
01:04:20,049 --> 01:04:23,689
So, in the future, if you guys
are gonna try to be slick...

841
01:04:24,387 --> 01:04:26,457
...be slicker than a 6-year-old.

842
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:28,926
I gotta get back to work.

843
01:04:29,258 --> 01:04:30,860
Can I go?

844
01:04:34,464 --> 01:04:36,301
Good luck with that print.

845
01:05:06,829 --> 01:05:08,399
Good morning, Cambridge Savings.

846
01:05:08,564 --> 01:05:11,269
Claire Keesey, please.
She's the manager.

847
01:05:11,434 --> 01:05:14,273
Oh, she's no longer working here.

848
01:05:14,437 --> 01:05:15,939
- Since when?
- Friday.

849
01:05:16,105 --> 01:05:20,012
Just get the warrant. Land, cell, e-mail,
fax, Skype. The whole fucking thing.

850
01:05:24,981 --> 01:05:27,151
Why didn't you tell me
you quit your job?

851
01:05:27,316 --> 01:05:28,351
I don't know.

852
01:05:28,518 --> 01:05:30,521
Why don't you tell me
what's in the box?

853
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,190
- What, this?
- Mm-hm.

854
01:05:32,588 --> 01:05:38,533
Anybody call you or say anything to you
or anything like that? After?

855
01:05:38,695 --> 01:05:39,763
Mm. Nope.

856
01:05:39,929 --> 01:05:41,966
No? Well, what are you gonna do?

857
01:05:42,131 --> 01:05:43,467
You know what? I don't know.

858
01:05:43,633 --> 01:05:48,209
I can teach, volunteer full-time.

859
01:05:48,371 --> 01:05:49,806
I have a little saved.

860
01:05:49,972 --> 01:05:51,408
So...

861
01:05:52,942 --> 01:05:55,347
What if I told you
I was gonna quit my job too?

862
01:05:56,412 --> 01:05:58,148
Well, then I guess I'd have company.

863
01:05:59,048 --> 01:06:01,686
We'd do it together. Here.

864
01:06:02,118 --> 01:06:04,389
It's just a necklace, that's all.

865
01:06:06,489 --> 01:06:08,626
Why don't we go away together.

866
01:06:08,791 --> 01:06:11,363
Take a trip for a minute, you know?
Something like that.

867
01:06:11,527 --> 01:06:13,697
You know, just fun.

868
01:06:14,263 --> 01:06:15,298
Doug.

869
01:06:15,465 --> 01:06:17,735
Is it right?
Took me forever trying to pick it.

870
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,172
- Arguing with the lady, and
- It's beautiful, but it

871
01:06:21,337 --> 01:06:23,874
Well, as long as you didn't,
you know, sell your truck.

872
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,278
Someone took over the payments.

873
01:06:28,177 --> 01:06:30,348
You know, people get up every day...

874
01:06:30,513 --> 01:06:32,917
...tell themselves
they're gonna change their lives.

875
01:06:33,082 --> 01:06:34,819
They never do.

876
01:06:35,852 --> 01:06:37,855
I'm gonna change mine.

877
01:06:38,387 --> 01:06:40,324
Why don't you do it with me.

878
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:45,197
Okay, well, where would we go?

879
01:06:45,361 --> 01:06:48,132
Come with me, I don't care.
We could go wherever you want.

880
01:06:48,531 --> 01:06:51,937
I mean, you know, there's things...

881
01:06:52,602 --> 01:06:55,374
There's a few things
you still don't know about me.

882
01:06:57,173 --> 01:06:58,676
What do you mean?

883
01:06:59,542 --> 01:07:03,616
Nothing. I just understand if you have
some reservations, you know?

884
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:08,489
Between the kind of things people say
about me and the things I'm not proud of...

885
01:07:08,651 --> 01:07:10,153
...don't leave a lot of room.

886
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,621
I know who you are.

887
01:07:11,788 --> 01:07:12,823
You do?

888
01:07:12,989 --> 01:07:16,061
Yeah, I do. Yeah.

889
01:07:16,425 --> 01:07:18,629
Does that mean you want to go with me?

890
01:07:19,896 --> 01:07:21,198
Yeah.

891
01:07:22,398 --> 01:07:24,167
Let's start now.

892
01:07:25,334 --> 01:07:26,803
Okay.

893
01:07:28,938 --> 01:07:30,408
Frawl.

894
01:07:32,675 --> 01:07:34,077
What is it?

895
01:07:34,243 --> 01:07:37,950
Phone conversation between Claire Keesey
and a burner cell about an hour ago.

896
01:07:38,114 --> 01:07:40,686
See if you can recognize the voice.

897
01:07:41,784 --> 01:07:44,088
Hey, can I come over?
I want to talk to you.

898
01:07:44,253 --> 01:07:46,123
Yeah. Where have you been?

899
01:07:46,522 --> 01:07:47,924
Sory, I got held up.

900
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:49,927
I'm coming over from my place.

901
01:07:50,092 --> 01:07:52,062
Will you come down the back
and let me in?

902
01:07:54,897 --> 01:07:57,134
Hadn't realized you'd left
your job at the bank.

903
01:07:58,134 --> 01:08:01,841
Uh... Oh, yeah. Yeah. Last week.

904
01:08:03,739 --> 01:08:06,076
I'm sorry,
was I supposed to notify someone?

905
01:08:10,813 --> 01:08:12,449
Fancy.

906
01:08:12,682 --> 01:08:14,251
Yeah. It was a gift.

907
01:08:20,756 --> 01:08:22,826
We have our suspects.

908
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,832
I came by to share this with you.

909
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:32,169
James Coughlin.

910
01:08:32,401 --> 01:08:34,371
Albert Magloan.

911
01:08:35,705 --> 01:08:37,240
Desmond Elden.

912
01:08:37,406 --> 01:08:40,344
Part of a crew that we tied
into the bank job at North End...

913
01:08:40,509 --> 01:08:44,583
...and at least three other
armored car robberies.

914
01:08:49,051 --> 01:08:50,587
Look familiar?

915
01:08:53,256 --> 01:08:55,794
You opened the safe for him.

916
01:08:56,559 --> 01:08:58,963
He left you unharmed...

917
01:08:59,128 --> 01:09:04,204
...and now the two of you are carrying on a
relationship about which you lied to the FBI.

918
01:09:04,367 --> 01:09:05,436
I was wrong.

919
01:09:06,435 --> 01:09:08,505
You do need a lawyer.

920
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:17,915
Something wrong with the apartment?

921
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,317
No. Florist.

922
01:09:21,217 --> 01:09:22,386
Florist? What?

923
01:09:22,551 --> 01:09:24,053
Came through.

924
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,792
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- It's large, Dougy.

925
01:09:27,957 --> 01:09:30,127
- It's large.
- We're smoked. Punt it.

926
01:09:30,526 --> 01:09:34,700
Look, pick up an extra guy. All right?
Or go with three guys.

927
01:09:34,864 --> 01:09:37,101
Or fucking be smart and boot it.

928
01:09:37,266 --> 01:09:39,236
Oh, so you're not going?

929
01:09:40,404 --> 01:09:41,672
No.

930
01:09:43,472 --> 01:09:44,874
And why's that?

931
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:47,378
Because we got a ton of heat on us,
for one thing.

932
01:09:47,543 --> 01:09:49,980
We'll put a move on.
We've done it a hundred times.

933
01:09:50,146 --> 01:09:53,185
You know what? Forget it.
Do what you want to do. I'm done.

934
01:09:53,349 --> 01:09:54,985
- What? What?
- I'm done.

935
01:09:55,151 --> 01:09:57,456
- You're done?
- What does it sound like?

936
01:09:57,620 --> 01:10:00,324
- I don't know. What's that mean?
- What you think it means?

937
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:02,926
What does that mean?
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit.

938
01:10:03,092 --> 01:10:06,966
Let me put it to you this way: I'm putting
this whole fucking town in my rear-view.

939
01:10:09,433 --> 01:10:11,804
There's people I can't let you
walk away from.

940
01:10:11,968 --> 01:10:13,203
What?

941
01:10:13,903 --> 01:10:15,305
Who?

942
01:10:16,906 --> 01:10:18,341
Come on.

943
01:10:21,143 --> 01:10:23,247
Are you serious, Jimmy?

944
01:10:23,946 --> 01:10:25,449
She's not my kid.

945
01:10:27,283 --> 01:10:29,420
Did she tell you it was?

946
01:10:30,454 --> 01:10:32,691
I mean, come the f - Cut it out.

947
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:34,925
All you give a fuck about
is coke and Xbox...

948
01:10:35,091 --> 01:10:37,963
...now you're trying to play it off
like you care about Shyne?

949
01:10:38,127 --> 01:10:41,032
Know what your problem is?
You think you're better than people.

950
01:10:41,197 --> 01:10:43,869
Mr. Fucking-Clean.
Mr. Fucking-Goddamn-High-and-Mighty.

951
01:10:44,033 --> 01:10:46,772
I'm better than all these people.
I'm better than everybody.

952
01:10:46,936 --> 01:10:49,206
But you grew up right here.

953
01:10:49,772 --> 01:10:51,074
Same rules that I did.

954
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,077
Who the fuck you think you are?

955
01:10:53,242 --> 01:10:55,947
You aren't letting me
or not letting me do shit, all right?

956
01:10:56,112 --> 01:10:57,782
Here's a little cheat sheet for you.

957
01:10:57,947 --> 01:11:01,019
It's never gonna be me and you
and your sister and Shyne...

958
01:11:01,183 --> 01:11:02,786
...fucking playing house up there.

959
01:11:02,952 --> 01:11:06,258
All right? You got it?
Get that in your fucking head!

960
01:11:06,422 --> 01:11:09,427
I'm tired of your one-way
fucking bullshit.

961
01:11:09,592 --> 01:11:13,733
If you wanna see me again,
come down and visit me in Florida.

962
01:11:19,602 --> 01:11:20,637
Cunt.

963
01:11:48,898 --> 01:11:50,835
In the 302...

964
01:11:51,634 --> 01:11:54,305
...feds have me dropping Brendan
right here.

965
01:11:55,871 --> 01:11:58,175
I got him back on Tibbetts.

966
01:12:00,376 --> 01:12:03,348
Fucking guy ran 100 yards
with a bullet in his heart, Dougy.

967
01:12:03,512 --> 01:12:07,654
I mean, the fucking guy should've ran track.
You know what I'm saying?

968
01:12:11,754 --> 01:12:13,123
I didn't ask you to do that.

969
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:15,426
Yeah, well, you didn't have to, Dougy.
Come on.

970
01:12:16,058 --> 01:12:19,999
They told me Brendan was coming down
here to roll up on you with a Glock 21.

971
01:12:20,162 --> 01:12:23,134
So I came over here,
and I put him in the fucking ground.

972
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,703
Did nine years for it.

973
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,440
Now, you don't gotta thank me...

974
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,910
...but you're not walking away.

975
01:12:35,077 --> 01:12:37,949
I'm grateful for everything you done
for me.

976
01:12:39,215 --> 01:12:42,187
Your family took me in
when my father went away.

977
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,857
You're like a brother to me.

978
01:12:48,592 --> 01:12:50,294
But I'm leaving.

979
01:12:53,095 --> 01:12:54,731
Gonna shoot me?

980
01:12:55,965 --> 01:12:57,467
Go ahead.

981
01:12:58,734 --> 01:13:01,171
But you're gonna have to shoot me
in the back.

982
01:13:13,382 --> 01:13:15,319
- Don't get up.
- All right.

983
01:13:15,484 --> 01:13:17,254
How you doing, Fergie?

984
01:13:17,419 --> 01:13:21,226
Listen, just wanted to stop by
and tell you myself...

985
01:13:21,991 --> 01:13:24,730
...whatever this thing is you got
going on...

986
01:13:24,894 --> 01:13:27,966
...I think my guys can handle it
without me. You know what I mean?

987
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:30,133
I wouldn't hire them without you.

988
01:13:30,299 --> 01:13:32,236
And I wouldn't hire you without them.

989
01:13:32,401 --> 01:13:33,637
You're a unit.

990
01:13:33,802 --> 01:13:37,609
Look, with all due respect,
I didn't come here for a debate.

991
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,810
I'm not doing it.

992
01:13:40,075 --> 01:13:43,949
So, you know, work it out
however you can. I...

993
01:13:44,113 --> 01:13:46,918
Calm down. Okay?

994
01:13:47,082 --> 01:13:49,987
It goes against
my better judgment...

995
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,825
...but just out of respect,
smooth things over...

996
01:13:54,323 --> 01:13:56,628
...just take this for it, all right?

997
01:13:57,226 --> 01:13:58,294
Not gonna cut it.

998
01:13:59,028 --> 01:14:02,033
Do you think I'm gonna put
Joe Flipperhead on this?

999
01:14:02,531 --> 01:14:04,468
You're gonna do what I ask.

1000
01:14:04,634 --> 01:14:05,836
Not gonna cut it, huh?

1001
01:14:08,437 --> 01:14:09,673
Okay.

1002
01:14:09,838 --> 01:14:12,944
Let me ask you something.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1003
01:14:13,342 --> 01:14:15,446
The only guy in Charlestown
with a gun?

1004
01:14:15,844 --> 01:14:17,781
You guys run numbers and pump dope.

1005
01:14:17,947 --> 01:14:21,019
You're an old guy who don't know
his glory years are behind him.

1006
01:14:21,183 --> 01:14:24,222
I ain't fucking working for you.
Got it?

1007
01:14:24,853 --> 01:14:29,294
You got a problem with that, I live at
551 Bunker Hill Street. Stop by anytime.

1008
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:31,161
You know where to find me.

1009
01:14:31,794 --> 01:14:33,831
You're gonna do this for me...

1010
01:14:33,996 --> 01:14:36,400
...or I'm gonna clip your nuts...

1011
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,169
...like I clipped your daddy's.

1012
01:14:38,801 --> 01:14:40,336
Don't talk about my father.

1013
01:14:40,502 --> 01:14:43,040
Son, I knew your daddy.

1014
01:14:43,205 --> 01:14:46,144
He worked for me for years. Years.

1015
01:14:46,676 --> 01:14:48,780
Then he wanted his own thing.

1016
01:14:51,513 --> 01:14:52,581
You play the horses?

1017
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:59,126
You know, they either geld a horse
with a knife...

1018
01:14:59,288 --> 01:15:01,225
...or with the chemicals.

1019
01:15:01,725 --> 01:15:03,829
When your daddy said no to me...

1020
01:15:04,293 --> 01:15:06,230
...I did him the chemical way.

1021
01:15:06,829 --> 01:15:08,565
Gave your mother a taste.

1022
01:15:08,732 --> 01:15:10,367
Put the hook into her.

1023
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:13,104
She doped up good and proper.

1024
01:15:13,869 --> 01:15:16,673
Hung herself with a wire
on Melnea Cass.

1025
01:15:17,306 --> 01:15:20,211
And you? Running around
the neighborhood, looking for her.

1026
01:15:21,076 --> 01:15:23,413
Your daddy didn't have the heart
to tell his son...

1027
01:15:23,579 --> 01:15:26,786
...that he was looking for a suicide doper
who was never coming home.

1028
01:15:28,183 --> 01:15:31,556
If there's a heaven, son,
she ain't in it.

1029
01:15:36,892 --> 01:15:37,960
Oh.

1030
01:15:40,095 --> 01:15:42,532
I hear you got a nice,
sweet new girlfriend.

1031
01:15:42,698 --> 01:15:44,234
Lives on the park.

1032
01:15:45,034 --> 01:15:48,106
I don't want to send her
funeral arrangement to your house...

1033
01:15:49,004 --> 01:15:50,841
...but I will if I have to.

1034
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,877
Now I know where to find you.

1035
01:15:55,678 --> 01:15:57,114
Claire.

1036
01:15:58,113 --> 01:15:59,749
Claire?

1037
01:16:11,427 --> 01:16:12,629
- Hey.
- Get out.

1038
01:16:12,796 --> 01:16:13,998
You okay?

1039
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:17,168
- Get out.
- Hold on one second.

1040
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:18,836
I have this on 911.

1041
01:16:19,001 --> 01:16:22,173
All right, you need to give me a chance
to explain myself first. Okay?

1042
01:16:22,338 --> 01:16:23,406
No. You had a chance.

1043
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,276
Who talked to you?

1044
01:16:27,743 --> 01:16:30,014
The FBI, Doug.

1045
01:16:32,247 --> 01:16:34,150
You have to listen to me.

1046
01:16:34,316 --> 01:16:36,854
You have to let me explain this.
You understand?

1047
01:16:37,019 --> 01:16:40,225
- There's a lot going on here, Claire
- No, you go to fucking hell!

1048
01:16:40,956 --> 01:16:42,826
- Fucking hell.
- All right, all right.

1049
01:16:42,991 --> 01:16:44,493
All right. All right.

1050
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,296
Easy, now.

1051
01:16:47,529 --> 01:16:49,432
Why did you do this to me?

1052
01:16:49,598 --> 01:16:52,403
Claire, I'm sorry. Okay?

1053
01:16:52,568 --> 01:16:55,440
I was gonna tell you.
I came over here that night to tell you.

1054
01:16:55,604 --> 01:16:59,278
What, the night you fucked me?
Is that your thing?

1055
01:16:59,441 --> 01:17:03,983
It's not enough to terrorize someone,
you have to fuck them too?

1056
01:17:04,146 --> 01:17:08,989
- Listen to me. Calm down, okay?
- No. No. Get out. Get out!

1057
01:17:10,486 --> 01:17:15,395
You don't ever let me see you again.
Never, never.

1058
01:18:16,953 --> 01:18:18,388
All right.

1059
01:18:19,856 --> 01:18:21,091
I'm in.

1060
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:24,528
But if anything happens to her...

1061
01:18:24,693 --> 01:18:26,931
...if I think anything
might happen to her...

1062
01:18:27,763 --> 01:18:28,966
...I'm coming back here.

1063
01:18:29,998 --> 01:18:33,037
And I'm gonna kill both of you
in your own shop.

1064
01:18:49,284 --> 01:18:51,021
Hey, Claire?

1065
01:18:52,621 --> 01:18:56,095
I just wanna talk to you,
just for two minutes. Okay?

1066
01:18:56,825 --> 01:18:58,395
Come on.

1067
01:18:59,862 --> 01:19:01,332
Claire, I would never hurt you.

1068
01:19:01,497 --> 01:19:03,935
I don't know what you would
Don't fucking touch me.

1069
01:19:04,099 --> 01:19:05,267
All right.

1070
01:19:05,667 --> 01:19:07,003
I'm sorry.

1071
01:19:07,503 --> 01:19:09,975
Just listen to me for a second,
all right?

1072
01:19:10,138 --> 01:19:11,640
I will never lie to you again.

1073
01:19:11,807 --> 01:19:13,978
- Really?
- Yes, I promise you.

1074
01:19:14,476 --> 01:19:16,813
Ask me anything you want.
I'll tell you the truth.

1075
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,882
- Why? I won't believe you.
- Yes, you will.

1076
01:19:19,047 --> 01:19:20,082
Why?

1077
01:19:20,249 --> 01:19:22,519
Because you'll fucking hate
the answers.

1078
01:19:27,222 --> 01:19:29,893
- You knew I was the manager in the bank?
- Yup.

1079
01:19:30,058 --> 01:19:32,429
- Were you following me?
- Yes.

1080
01:19:32,794 --> 01:19:34,364
How many banks have you robbed?

1081
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:36,765
Six trucks, two banks.

1082
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:38,768
Have you ever killed anyone?

1083
01:19:38,935 --> 01:19:40,470
No.

1084
01:19:41,603 --> 01:19:42,905
Think about it.

1085
01:19:43,605 --> 01:19:44,941
All right?

1086
01:19:45,107 --> 01:19:47,544
I will never lie to you,
I will never hurt you...

1087
01:19:47,709 --> 01:19:52,986
...and if I lose you, I will
regret that for the rest of my life.

1088
01:19:55,884 --> 01:19:58,789
Just wait for me.

1089
01:20:10,799 --> 01:20:14,239
You know, it's funny.
I can see your daddies' faces in you.

1090
01:20:14,403 --> 01:20:15,471
All of youse.

1091
01:20:15,637 --> 01:20:17,374
Reminds me I'm still in the ring.

1092
01:20:17,739 --> 01:20:21,981
Still taking the punches.
Still ahead on points.

1093
01:20:22,344 --> 01:20:25,116
Now, I have a fellow
on the inside there.

1094
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,054
He likes to play the ponies.
Has a gambling sickness.

1095
01:20:29,217 --> 01:20:31,854
He couldn't pick a horse
to save his fucking life.

1096
01:20:32,421 --> 01:20:34,691
But courtesy of this sick man...

1097
01:20:35,657 --> 01:20:38,362
...I have this. Hm?

1098
01:20:40,228 --> 01:20:43,033
Well, the gang's all here.

1099
01:20:45,334 --> 01:20:47,104
There's always a weak spot.

1100
01:20:47,269 --> 01:20:49,239
We just need to find it.

1101
01:20:52,808 --> 01:20:56,782
The cash is brought out and stacked
15 minutes before the van does the pickup.

1102
01:20:58,047 --> 01:21:00,151
That is when you hit.

1103
01:21:00,549 --> 01:21:03,321
And Monday morning,
after a four-game stand with New York...

1104
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:08,394
...60,000 beers, food, merchandise,
total haul:

1105
01:21:08,557 --> 01:21:10,060
Three and a half million.

1106
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:18,438
Taking down the cathedral of Boston.

1107
01:21:18,667 --> 01:21:19,802
Priceless.

1108
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:37,822
How long you think it's gonna take Rusty
to dump the inside man...

1109
01:21:37,986 --> 01:21:39,189
...when this thing's over?

1110
01:21:39,354 --> 01:21:41,991
Well, he should have picked
better horses.

1111
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,099
This is gonna be a motherfucker.
You know that, right?

1112
01:21:49,132 --> 01:21:53,173
Well, if they were easy, kid,
everybody would do them.

1113
01:21:57,673 --> 01:22:01,047
Lined into right field.
A base hit. Youkilis is headed for third base.

1114
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:03,947
Hey, Bobby. Yeah, three Buds.

1115
01:22:12,254 --> 01:22:15,226
Seem to be having a bit
of a staring contest over there.

1116
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:16,558
What can I say?

1117
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,729
Boys like me.

1118
01:22:20,196 --> 01:22:21,531
I bet they do.

1119
01:22:23,365 --> 01:22:25,268
What are you doing down here?

1120
01:22:25,901 --> 01:22:27,137
Slumming?

1121
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:30,540
I work for the FBI.

1122
01:22:31,506 --> 01:22:33,243
Me too.

1123
01:22:34,609 --> 01:22:36,079
Well, you must be new.

1124
01:22:39,381 --> 01:22:40,883
You're all right.

1125
01:22:41,783 --> 01:22:44,221
It doesn't mean
you're getting fucked, though.

1126
01:22:44,753 --> 01:22:48,227
You gotta chase the rabbit
if you want the tail.

1127
01:22:49,858 --> 01:22:51,161
My mom taught me that.

1128
01:22:55,831 --> 01:22:58,536
You used to hang around
with Doug MacRay a little bit, huh?

1129
01:22:59,701 --> 01:23:01,070
How do you know Dougy?

1130
01:23:01,237 --> 01:23:02,973
We sort of work together.

1131
01:23:03,371 --> 01:23:04,673
Sand and Gravel?

1132
01:23:05,307 --> 01:23:07,043
No. No, no.

1133
01:23:14,382 --> 01:23:16,753
You a pretty decent judge of size?

1134
01:23:17,319 --> 01:23:18,587
Depends.

1135
01:23:19,287 --> 01:23:20,756
Size of what?

1136
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:23,626
How big would you say that is?

1137
01:23:24,493 --> 01:23:25,695
Six inches?

1138
01:23:26,294 --> 01:23:27,763
Over or under?

1139
01:23:28,131 --> 01:23:29,166
Under.

1140
01:23:29,331 --> 01:23:30,499
Wrong.

1141
01:23:31,066 --> 01:23:33,304
6.14 inches exactly.

1142
01:23:34,936 --> 01:23:37,073
I know everything there is to know
about money.

1143
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:40,144
Thickness:.0043 inches.

1144
01:23:40,942 --> 01:23:44,883
Weight: about one gram.

1145
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:47,517
Which is interesting...

1146
01:23:47,682 --> 01:23:51,489
...because that means that this $20 bill
isn't even worth its own weight...

1147
01:23:51,653 --> 01:23:53,590
...in Oxy.

1148
01:23:59,327 --> 01:24:00,796
So how does it work?

1149
01:24:01,997 --> 01:24:03,800
Bartender gets a call...

1150
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:07,905
...you pick up a package at point A,
deliver it to point B...

1151
01:24:08,069 --> 01:24:10,607
...the Florist gives you C?

1152
01:24:14,409 --> 01:24:16,246
You're thinking of running out on me.

1153
01:24:17,946 --> 01:24:21,018
It's not that simple.
Because, you see...

1154
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:23,920
...I start waving this around
in here...

1155
01:24:28,657 --> 01:24:30,026
...bad for you.

1156
01:24:34,396 --> 01:24:35,998
I want a lawyer.

1157
01:24:36,332 --> 01:24:38,269
Good. Get one.

1158
01:24:39,202 --> 01:24:41,773
I mean, it's all about protecting
yourself, right?

1159
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:45,343
Not even yourself. Your daughter.

1160
01:24:45,507 --> 01:24:48,044
Don't talk about my daughter.

1161
01:24:50,313 --> 01:24:52,684
How long were you with MacRay?

1162
01:24:53,782 --> 01:24:55,084
All my life.

1163
01:24:56,384 --> 01:24:58,955
In all those years
that you were together...

1164
01:25:00,856 --> 01:25:04,095
...how many diamond necklaces
did he give you?

1165
01:25:06,928 --> 01:25:08,698
All right, the tools are set.

1166
01:25:08,864 --> 01:25:11,034
Got our body armor.

1167
01:25:14,436 --> 01:25:16,273
You know, this thing goes right...

1168
01:25:16,671 --> 01:25:19,075
...could be your turn
to step away too.

1169
01:25:19,242 --> 01:25:22,214
Yeah. Sure.

1170
01:25:22,444 --> 01:25:24,013
What am I gonna do, Dougy, huh?

1171
01:25:24,179 --> 01:25:28,688
Go down to Margaritaville, drink me
half a yard and fall off fucking bar stools?

1172
01:25:29,218 --> 01:25:30,753
Do me a favor.

1173
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,122
The weight of this thing...

1174
01:25:33,755 --> 01:25:35,859
...pack a parachute at least.

1175
01:25:36,325 --> 01:25:39,029
You know the funniest thing
about being in prison?

1176
01:25:41,062 --> 01:25:43,367
Guys pretending
that they wanna get out.

1177
01:25:45,368 --> 01:25:47,572
I can't do any more time, Dougy.

1178
01:25:50,339 --> 01:25:51,974
So if we get jammed up...

1179
01:25:52,607 --> 01:25:54,544
...we're holding court on the street.

1180
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,764
Fuck are you doing here, Kris?

1181
01:26:15,398 --> 01:26:16,666
I need to talk to you.

1182
01:26:16,831 --> 01:26:18,467
Not a great time, hon.

1183
01:26:18,633 --> 01:26:19,835
- I know.
- You know?

1184
01:26:20,001 --> 01:26:21,971
Okay. Well, what do you want?

1185
01:26:22,137 --> 01:26:23,440
Here you go.

1186
01:26:23,905 --> 01:26:25,675
Dez told me you were here.

1187
01:26:27,509 --> 01:26:28,911
I wanna see you before you go.

1188
01:26:29,077 --> 01:26:32,417
Kris, you could do 30 years
for walking in the door.

1189
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:34,717
Okay? Do you understand that?
For being here.

1190
01:26:34,883 --> 01:26:37,955
You can't be bringing your kid
in here, you got it? You can't stay.

1191
01:26:38,119 --> 01:26:40,691
I don't wanna stay,
I wanna go with you.

1192
01:26:41,122 --> 01:26:42,959
- I wanna change too, Dougy.
- Christ.

1193
01:26:43,124 --> 01:26:46,029
Why the fuck can't I change?
I could be a different person.

1194
01:26:46,194 --> 01:26:47,530
Jesus Christ.

1195
01:26:47,696 --> 01:26:50,968
You tell me what you want me to do.
I'll be whoever you want me to be.

1196
01:26:52,335 --> 01:26:54,338
I'm leaving with somebody else.

1197
01:26:58,506 --> 01:26:59,808
Oh, yeah?

1198
01:27:00,409 --> 01:27:01,644
Yeah.

1199
01:27:03,511 --> 01:27:05,414
Why isn't she here then?

1200
01:27:06,648 --> 01:27:08,518
Come on.
What do you want me to tell you?

1201
01:27:08,683 --> 01:27:11,254
She's going away with you,
why isn't she here?

1202
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:13,357
Where is she? She's not here.

1203
01:27:14,923 --> 01:27:17,160
- Such a trashy little fuck pad.
- Take it easy.

1204
01:27:17,326 --> 01:27:20,465
After a Tiffany necklace,
I thought a room at the Ritz.

1205
01:27:20,862 --> 01:27:22,398
Huh?

1206
01:27:23,565 --> 01:27:24,934
What'd you say?

1207
01:27:26,134 --> 01:27:28,939
Where did you hear that?
Where'd you hear about a necklace?

1208
01:27:29,372 --> 01:27:30,941
A little bird.

1209
01:27:33,308 --> 01:27:36,147
Fucking smartass. Who told you that?
Who told you about a necklace?

1210
01:27:37,612 --> 01:27:40,684
I know you'd rather see a rope
around my neck!

1211
01:27:42,351 --> 01:27:44,588
You're getting the fuck out of here.
Let's go.

1212
01:27:44,753 --> 01:27:47,758
Come here, honey.
I know, it's gonna be okay. It's all right.

1213
01:27:47,922 --> 01:27:50,326
We're coming with you.
- You're getting out of here.

1214
01:27:50,493 --> 01:27:52,329
Dougy, we're fucking coming with you.

1215
01:27:52,495 --> 01:27:55,701
It's time to go. Okay? Here we go.

1216
01:27:55,864 --> 01:27:59,136
Time to go, sweetheart. Okay?

1217
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:00,803
- I'm not leaving here.
- Let's go.

1218
01:28:00,969 --> 01:28:03,073
- I'm not fucking leaving.
- Take the kid home.

1219
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:04,908
Get the fuck off me!

1220
01:28:05,073 --> 01:28:06,976
I can walk myself.

1221
01:28:07,476 --> 01:28:09,580
Don't you say no to me!

1222
01:28:12,847 --> 01:28:14,249
Take this.

1223
01:28:21,689 --> 01:28:22,857
Hey.

1224
01:28:23,459 --> 01:28:26,798
Will you quit fucking doing that?
You're making me nervous.

1225
01:28:41,377 --> 01:28:44,683
Yeah, we got a DWI over here, one car.

1226
01:28:44,846 --> 01:28:48,285
Coughlin, Kristina.
She had a kid with her.

1227
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:51,522
The mother's at Mass General.
She wanted me to call you.

1228
01:28:51,686 --> 01:28:54,323
All right, yeah. I'll be right there.

1229
01:29:22,618 --> 01:29:23,820
Officer.

1230
01:29:24,819 --> 01:29:26,354
Yeah. Let's go.

1231
01:29:33,661 --> 01:29:34,996
Down here.

1232
01:30:28,383 --> 01:30:30,053
There's the door.

1233
01:30:30,619 --> 01:30:33,256
And remember,
you never fucking saw me.

1234
01:30:33,522 --> 01:30:34,690
Okay.

1235
01:30:49,638 --> 01:30:52,376
Dr. forrest, dial 112, please.

1236
01:30:52,541 --> 01:30:55,513
Dr. forrest, please dial 112.

1237
01:30:59,648 --> 01:31:03,354
Here he is, Mr. Six-Inches.

1238
01:31:05,186 --> 01:31:06,221
What happened?

1239
01:31:06,387 --> 01:31:09,794
You're a crimestopper,
figure it the fuck out.

1240
01:31:11,859 --> 01:31:13,094
Sweetheart.

1241
01:31:14,162 --> 01:31:17,736
I know you have oxycodone,
cocaine and alcohol in your system.

1242
01:31:18,933 --> 01:31:21,504
I know that you have five cars
registered in your name.

1243
01:31:21,670 --> 01:31:25,176
And I know right now, your daughter
is sitting in the back of a state van...

1244
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:27,611
...driven to
the Department of Social Services.

1245
01:31:27,775 --> 01:31:29,377
So how long you wanna do this?

1246
01:31:29,545 --> 01:31:30,713
I'm a person, you know?

1247
01:31:30,878 --> 01:31:33,048
A person
who's gonna need a plea agreement...

1248
01:31:33,214 --> 01:31:35,351
...if you ever want to see your kid again.

1249
01:31:38,987 --> 01:31:41,992
Why is it always I'm the one
who's getting used?

1250
01:31:42,924 --> 01:31:44,259
What do you have?

1251
01:31:50,298 --> 01:31:51,968
Knowing just that...

1252
01:31:53,401 --> 01:31:55,138
...Dougy's going away after.

1253
01:31:56,304 --> 01:31:59,143
Wait, what after? After what?

1254
01:32:01,342 --> 01:32:04,882
Krista, I need you to be smart here.

1255
01:32:05,313 --> 01:32:08,787
This could be a big moment for Shyne.

1256
01:32:09,984 --> 01:32:11,987
Make a huge difference in her life.

1257
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:21,297
We can help you, sweetheart.

1258
01:33:15,950 --> 01:33:17,352
You there?
DEl I'm here.

1259
01:33:17,518 --> 01:33:20,290
- All set.
Okay. Go ahead.

1260
01:33:21,022 --> 01:33:22,324
All set.

1261
01:33:30,699 --> 01:33:31,801
Who called 911?

1262
01:33:33,434 --> 01:33:35,037
You the guys who called 911?

1263
01:33:35,203 --> 01:33:36,706
No one from here called.

1264
01:33:36,872 --> 01:33:38,541
Nah, we didn't - It wasn't us.

1265
01:33:38,707 --> 01:33:39,909
We got a 911 call.

1266
01:33:40,074 --> 01:33:41,509
Robbery, guys. Come on.

1267
01:33:41,677 --> 01:33:43,212
You said a robbery?
Yeah.

1268
01:33:43,378 --> 01:33:45,081
A call saying you're being held up.

1269
01:33:45,246 --> 01:33:46,916
- Let me call Mike.
We just walked past Mike.

1270
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:48,082
He let us in.

1271
01:33:48,249 --> 01:33:51,154
Hey, look, guys. We got a distress call.
All right?

1272
01:33:51,319 --> 01:33:53,757
- So who made the call?
- Nobody called from here.

1273
01:33:54,622 --> 01:33:57,260
No one called? What are we doing here?

1274
01:33:57,425 --> 01:34:00,597
- Hold on. Where's Mike?
- I just told you where Mike was.

1275
01:34:00,763 --> 01:34:01,865
You boys see all right?

1276
01:34:02,029 --> 01:34:04,266
- Huh? You fucking smartass.
- Listen. Listen.

1277
01:34:04,432 --> 01:34:07,471
For our safety, for everyone's safety,
we need to see your IDs.

1278
01:34:07,635 --> 01:34:10,207
Guys, hold up.
We been here all morning. Take it easy.

1279
01:34:10,371 --> 01:34:13,343
My partner asked for your ID.
All right? We don't know you.

1280
01:34:13,508 --> 01:34:17,015
Till we identify all the parties involved here,
we're gonna need some IDs...

1281
01:34:17,178 --> 01:34:19,315
...we need to see
everyone on the ground. Right now.

1282
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:20,716
Whoa, whoa.

1283
01:34:20,883 --> 01:34:23,120
- Get your hand off your weapon.
Hey, relax.

1284
01:34:29,624 --> 01:34:32,429
Get on the ground!
Get on the fucking ground.

1285
01:34:32,795 --> 01:34:34,097
Hands behind your back.

1286
01:34:34,262 --> 01:34:35,430
Face down.

1287
01:34:35,596 --> 01:34:38,001
Behind your back. Come on.

1288
01:34:44,773 --> 01:34:47,845
Get your hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back. Let's go.

1289
01:34:48,009 --> 01:34:49,478
Take it easy.
- Fuck.

1290
01:34:57,084 --> 01:34:58,319
In the cash room.

1291
01:34:58,486 --> 01:35:02,060
Arnold Washton.
You live at 311 Hazer Street in Quincy...

1292
01:35:02,223 --> 01:35:05,429
...with a wife named Linda
and three small dogs.

1293
01:35:05,593 --> 01:35:07,965
Do not make a distress call.

1294
01:35:08,129 --> 01:35:10,199
Also in the cash room:

1295
01:35:10,364 --> 01:35:15,540
Morton Previtt.
You live at 27 Counting Lane, Randolph.

1296
01:35:15,703 --> 01:35:18,008
Wife, also Linda.

1297
01:35:18,172 --> 01:35:22,213
Morton, the Lindas
want you to open this door.

1298
01:35:22,410 --> 01:35:25,048
We have men outside your homes.

1299
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:31,989
Back up. Back up.

1300
01:35:53,008 --> 01:35:54,945
You think you're gonna get out of here?

1301
01:35:55,276 --> 01:35:58,582
I got friends that are guards at Walpole.
They'll make your lives hell.

1302
01:35:58,747 --> 01:36:01,051
Well, don't you worry about it,
old-timer.

1303
01:36:01,215 --> 01:36:02,952
No one's going to prison.

1304
01:36:20,903 --> 01:36:22,372
Ten more.

1305
01:36:22,537 --> 01:36:23,773
Right away.

1306
01:36:37,552 --> 01:36:38,788
Picking up.

1307
01:37:10,852 --> 01:37:13,456
MAN -least from the fan base
when the Red Sox win.

1308
01:37:13,621 --> 01:37:17,662
When the Red Sox win in extra innings
and eveybody can go home happy...

1309
01:37:17,826 --> 01:37:20,463
...and they're singing "Dirty Water"

1310
01:37:23,331 --> 01:37:25,301
How you doing?
Fucking beautiful.

1311
01:37:27,768 --> 01:37:29,104
Come on.

1312
01:37:37,812 --> 01:37:41,653
Last motherfucker who robbed
the Red Sox like this was Jack Clark.

1313
01:38:31,133 --> 01:38:34,405
Looked around the block.
There's no cars, no vans around. Nothing.

1314
01:38:34,602 --> 01:38:36,739
Maybe we're too early. Or too late.

1315
01:38:36,905 --> 01:38:41,013
Let's go. I want this street clear. Come on,
get these people out of here. Let's go.

1316
01:38:41,176 --> 01:38:46,286
We've been trying to hail security for the
cash room. We're not getting a response.

1317
01:38:48,516 --> 01:38:50,553
Okay, let's go.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1318
01:38:50,718 --> 01:38:52,154
Come on.

1319
01:38:56,257 --> 01:38:57,525
Come on.

1320
01:39:01,829 --> 01:39:03,032
Shit.

1321
01:39:23,484 --> 01:39:26,489
- Fuck!
DEl: Let's get the fuck out of here!

1322
01:39:31,892 --> 01:39:33,829
That's us inside.

1323
01:39:35,964 --> 01:39:37,166
Go! Go!

1324
01:39:41,502 --> 01:39:43,906
Fuckers!

1325
01:39:59,087 --> 01:40:01,157
Gloans! Gloans. Fuck.

1326
01:40:03,624 --> 01:40:07,264
- He all right?
He's all right. They just got the vest.

1327
01:40:16,403 --> 01:40:17,973
Yo, Dez, get the plunger!

1328
01:40:37,358 --> 01:40:39,195
Shut it!

1329
01:41:00,347 --> 01:41:02,217
Dez?

1330
01:41:03,818 --> 01:41:05,321
Come on, come on.

1331
01:41:07,555 --> 01:41:09,058
They look like EMTs.

1332
01:41:09,224 --> 01:41:11,962
I count four. Maybe one down.

1333
01:41:12,127 --> 01:41:13,729
Go.

1334
01:41:16,231 --> 01:41:17,833
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1335
01:41:18,266 --> 01:41:20,536
There's a million fucking cops
out there.

1336
01:41:24,438 --> 01:41:25,740
Cover your ears!

1337
01:41:50,365 --> 01:41:51,433
No!

1338
01:41:58,539 --> 01:42:00,809
All right, go, go, go.
All right, move it out.

1339
01:42:17,992 --> 01:42:19,195
Fuck you!

1340
01:42:25,599 --> 01:42:27,736
Move down.
Get them the fuck out of here.

1341
01:42:27,902 --> 01:42:29,772
Meet me at the fucking switch!

1342
01:42:33,841 --> 01:42:36,179
They ain't looking for fucking cops.

1343
01:42:36,543 --> 01:42:38,380
I'm gonna roll out the front...

1344
01:42:38,545 --> 01:42:42,419
...the two of youse beat it out
the side in the fucking cop uniforms.

1345
01:42:43,318 --> 01:42:45,321
The whole fucking force
is out there, kid.

1346
01:42:45,486 --> 01:42:47,723
You know I can take a pinch.

1347
01:42:48,055 --> 01:42:51,328
Don't worry about it.
I'll only give them your first name.

1348
01:43:22,523 --> 01:43:24,092
Clear.

1349
01:43:28,896 --> 01:43:30,599
Okay, go.

1350
01:43:31,433 --> 01:43:32,935
Move, move.

1351
01:43:39,274 --> 01:43:41,444
Hey, don't move. Don't move.

1352
01:43:42,444 --> 01:43:45,216
- Put your weapons down.
Fuck you. Boston P.D.

1353
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:48,419
Look out, coming through.
Stand down. Stand down.

1354
01:43:48,582 --> 01:43:49,884
See you in Florida, kid.

1355
01:43:50,485 --> 01:43:52,555
See you when you get back.

1356
01:43:52,886 --> 01:43:54,389
All right. Go.

1357
01:43:54,555 --> 01:43:58,195
All right, guys, let's back up.
Feds got this.

1358
01:44:01,061 --> 01:44:02,564
Hey. Hey.

1359
01:44:02,730 --> 01:44:04,467
You B.P.D. need to fuck off.

1360
01:44:04,631 --> 01:44:06,935
What are you doing?
It's an FBI crime scene.

1361
01:44:07,101 --> 01:44:08,704
Don't put your hand up to me. Go.

1362
01:44:08,869 --> 01:44:10,572
Jurisdiction, guys. Walk away.

1363
01:44:10,738 --> 01:44:11,906
That's my kill.

1364
01:44:25,652 --> 01:44:27,756
I don't know if we're dealing with...

1365
01:44:27,921 --> 01:44:30,326
...some high level of genius here
with security...

1366
01:44:30,657 --> 01:44:33,529
...but security's saying
they got hit by cops.

1367
01:44:34,028 --> 01:44:35,264
Cops?

1368
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:38,435
Yeah. Two cops, they said.

1369
01:44:52,746 --> 01:44:54,014
Hold up.

1370
01:44:54,315 --> 01:44:55,383
Where you going?

1371
01:44:56,418 --> 01:44:57,453
Pull up here.

1372
01:45:10,697 --> 01:45:12,801
Officer, can you hold up a minute?

1373
01:45:22,343 --> 01:45:25,882
Visual on Coughlin,
heading south toward Boylston.

1374
01:45:26,046 --> 01:45:27,949
Hotel parking lot on Van Ness.

1375
01:45:28,115 --> 01:45:29,918
He's dressed as B.P.D.

1376
01:45:30,351 --> 01:45:31,486
MAN
Copy.

1377
01:45:31,652 --> 01:45:33,187
Officer.

1378
01:45:35,055 --> 01:45:36,591
Coughlin.

1379
01:46:15,363 --> 01:46:17,032
Drop your weapon!

1380
01:46:18,866 --> 01:46:20,469
No!

1381
01:46:22,537 --> 01:46:24,206
Move! Move!

1382
01:46:48,996 --> 01:46:51,534
Coughlin, throw down your weapon.

1383
01:46:53,767 --> 01:46:55,570
Fuck you.

1384
01:46:56,069 --> 01:46:57,672
Let me see those hands, right now.

1385
01:46:57,838 --> 01:46:59,408
Fuck you!

1386
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:08,517
Move, move.

1387
01:47:09,716 --> 01:47:11,419
You got 30 seconds, asshole.

1388
01:47:40,147 --> 01:47:41,550
Okay.

1389
01:47:41,716 --> 01:47:43,453
I surrender.

1390
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:45,219
I surrender.

1391
01:48:46,947 --> 01:48:49,552
Rusty, something went wrong.

1392
01:48:49,717 --> 01:48:50,885
Come here.

1393
01:49:02,029 --> 01:49:03,398
Fergie.

1394
01:49:04,432 --> 01:49:05,467
Prick.

1395
01:49:32,959 --> 01:49:34,529
Fergie...

1396
01:49:35,228 --> 01:49:37,566
...remember who clipped your nuts
ror you.

1397
01:49:38,899 --> 01:49:42,940
I came in hot, saw the suspect run
across the street with a Tec-9.

1398
01:49:43,103 --> 01:49:47,779
I lit up the tires, I jumped out of the cruiser,
engaged the suspect in gunfire.

1399
01:49:48,810 --> 01:49:49,811
So that's when...

1400
01:49:49,976 --> 01:49:51,746
- ... you get out of your cruiser.
Yeah.

1401
01:49:51,912 --> 01:49:55,519
At that point, I fired, struck the suspect
at least once or twice.

1402
01:49:55,683 --> 01:49:56,818
Hey.

1403
01:49:57,084 --> 01:49:58,687
WOMAN
Multiple victims down.

1404
01:49:58,853 --> 01:50:00,656
Location, 529 Main Street, Charlestown.

1405
01:50:00,822 --> 01:50:03,293
- Uniformed officers on the scene.
- That's the Florist.

1406
01:50:03,457 --> 01:50:04,993
Hey, Bobby, Bobby, what happened?

1407
01:50:05,158 --> 01:50:06,761
Somebody got Fergie.

1408
01:50:08,496 --> 01:50:10,533
- Jesus Christ, that's gotta be MacRay.
- Fuck.

1409
01:50:17,404 --> 01:50:19,809
Claire, it's me.

1410
01:50:20,073 --> 01:50:21,108
Are you okay?

1411
01:50:22,109 --> 01:50:23,144
I'll be fine. I know.

1412
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:25,748
But I'm okay. I'm all right.

1413
01:50:25,912 --> 01:50:27,682
Claire, I wanna meet you.

1414
01:50:29,282 --> 01:50:32,622
It's gotta be soon.
I don't have a lot of time.

1415
01:50:34,154 --> 01:50:35,624
Can you meet me?

1416
01:50:36,624 --> 01:50:37,826
Claire, please.

1417
01:50:38,626 --> 01:50:41,063
I need to know. I gotta go.

1418
01:50:42,095 --> 01:50:43,798
Can you come here?

1419
01:50:49,837 --> 01:50:51,874
You want me
to come where you are now?

1420
01:50:52,205 --> 01:50:53,407
Mm-hm.

1421
01:50:57,344 --> 01:50:59,816
I don't think
that's a good idea for me.

1422
01:51:03,618 --> 01:51:04,853
Why?

1423
01:51:10,157 --> 01:51:11,960
What if there are police there?

1424
01:51:14,027 --> 01:51:15,597
There's no one here.

1425
01:51:21,334 --> 01:51:24,273
All right, well, if you think I should
probably come by there...

1426
01:51:24,438 --> 01:51:26,843
...then I guess that's what I'll do. Yeah.

1427
01:51:28,375 --> 01:51:29,544
Okay.

1428
01:51:31,011 --> 01:51:33,816
Claire, listen, I'm
Listen. Listen to me.

1429
01:51:35,982 --> 01:51:37,484
I'm sorry, okay?

1430
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:41,124
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

1431
01:51:42,522 --> 01:51:43,858
Remember that.

1432
01:51:44,592 --> 01:51:47,530
Come down in the back
and let me in in about an hour.

1433
01:51:50,397 --> 01:51:51,833
All right?

1434
01:51:53,734 --> 01:51:55,336
I'll see you.

1435
01:51:56,771 --> 01:51:58,540
Wait, Doug? Doug?

1436
01:51:59,674 --> 01:52:01,143
- Yeah.
- I want you to come.

1437
01:52:01,308 --> 01:52:04,213
I really wanna see you.

1438
01:52:08,950 --> 01:52:11,922
It'll be just like one of my sunny days.

1439
01:52:24,197 --> 01:52:25,399
Well...

1440
01:52:27,602 --> 01:52:29,271
...I'm on my way then.

1441
01:52:32,072 --> 01:52:33,107
Bye.

1442
01:52:36,777 --> 01:52:38,680
Goodbye, Claire.

1443
01:52:44,819 --> 01:52:47,023
All right,
I'd say we've done our part here.

1444
01:52:47,187 --> 01:52:49,825
You know what? Not now.

1445
01:52:55,796 --> 01:52:58,600
He says he's coming, I want people
at Logan, South Station...

1446
01:52:58,766 --> 01:53:01,170
...downtown, Greyhound,
subway, everything. Now.

1447
01:53:01,334 --> 01:53:03,571
The city's covered.
Good.

1448
01:53:26,359 --> 01:53:29,098
We're secure, and everythings ready.

1449
01:53:35,368 --> 01:53:39,309
- Sir, we need you to stay off the street.
- Just going to work. No problem.

1450
01:53:55,522 --> 01:53:57,259
- How long?
- Forty minutes.

1451
01:53:57,758 --> 01:53:59,627
- Alleyway clear?
- Yes, sir.

1452
01:54:27,487 --> 01:54:30,593
MAN We got nothing.
Still no movement in the alley. Over.

1453
01:54:50,243 --> 01:54:51,813
"My sunny days. "

1454
01:54:59,419 --> 01:55:02,191
You know, Claire,
we are a national organization.

1455
01:55:10,263 --> 01:55:13,335
All right, boys, let's pack it up.
He ain't coming.

1456
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:15,972
Let's get the description out.
Let's go.

1457
01:55:16,236 --> 01:55:18,039
We know what he looks like.

1458
01:55:19,106 --> 01:55:20,441
Let's go find him.

1459
01:55:24,078 --> 01:55:25,180
All right. You good?

1460
01:55:25,345 --> 01:55:27,148
Hey, best possible outcome, you know.

1461
01:55:27,313 --> 01:55:29,250
Well done, well done.

1462
01:55:41,929 --> 01:55:46,270
All aboard.
Amtrak number 93. All points south.

1463
01:56:07,154 --> 01:56:08,623
It's for you.

1464
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:17,260
Claire, take this.

1465
01:57:17,557 --> 01:57:20,195
You'll do better with it than I can.

1466
01:57:20,794 --> 01:57:23,399
8y the time you read this,
I'll be long gone.

1467
01:57:23,563 --> 01:57:24,831
Not the way I planned it...

1468
01:57:25,331 --> 01:57:29,405
...but for the first time in my life,
I'm leaving this city.

1469
01:57:41,982 --> 01:57:43,017
Maybe if I go...

1470
01:57:44,118 --> 01:57:45,753
...I can stop looking.

1471
01:58:07,774 --> 01:58:09,477
No matter how much you change...

1472
01:58:09,642 --> 01:58:12,547
...you still have to pay the price
for the things you've done.

1473
01:58:15,748 --> 01:58:17,585
So I got a long road.

1474
01:58:23,224 --> 01:58:25,561
But I know I'll see you again.

1475
01:58:31,397 --> 01:58:33,400
This side or the other.
