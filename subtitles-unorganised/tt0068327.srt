but who isn't these days?

Now there's Fraulein Mayr,
who is a masseuse...for ladies only.

90
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,141
And there's Fraulein Kost,
who's a terribly sweet streetwalker.

Fraulein Kost, Fraulein Mayr.

Well, what else do you need in a bedroom
besides a bed?

98
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:01,024
Pupils. l've got to give English lessons
to pay the rent.

99

Well, look, you can use my room for that.

100
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,339
See? Practically a suite. Come on in.

101
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:10,173
You'll adore these.

102

Prairie oysters, darling.

103
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:15,850
lt's an egg with Worcestershire sauce,
all sort of whooshed up together.

104
00:09:17,284 --> 00:09:20,524
Fifty marks with breakfast,
even when l'm behind on the rent.

105
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:21,922
Divine, isn't it?

106
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,679
-Of course, l'm hardly ever in.
-Why not?

107
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,836
Well, l dash all day
and l work late at the Cabaret.

108
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,791
Now...these work instantly,
even on the most sinister hangovers.

109
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:36,589
Of course, l may bring a boyfriend home
occasionally, but only occasionally...

110
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,985
...because l do think that one ought
to go to the man's room if one can.

111
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,541
l mean, it doesn't look so much
as if one expected it, does it?

112
00:09:46,313 --> 00:09:47,274
Exactly.

113
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:51,993
l see you've acquired a lot
of worldly wisdom.

114

Oh, not wisdom, darling, instincts.
l have ancient instincts.

115
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:58,465
l have this strange, mystical...

116
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,899
...thatish feeling about you.

117
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:04,899
So you're moving right in, okay?

Mein Herr.

163
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:41,418
''Bye-bye, Mein Lieber Herr....''

164
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:16,322
You know, you're really very good.

165
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,078
l know, darling, isn't it fabulous?

166
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,000
Listen, l want you to meet Fritz Wendel,
absolutely my oldest friend in Berlin.

167
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:22,953
Brian Roberts.

168
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:25,592
He's a divine playboy,
hurtling from party to party...

169
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:27,030
...seducing everyone in all directions.

170
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:29,827
You mustn't believe from Sally.
l'm a most serious man of business.

171
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:32,025
Making import-export with machineries.

172
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:35,462
Listen, Fritz is crazy
to improve his English...

173
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:37,461
...so he can dazzle fat American divorcees.

174
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:40,297
And l said you might deign
to give him lessons.

175
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,890
Darling, give me one of those cigarettes.

176
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:48,408
One moment.

177
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:51,849
Oh, you've got to try one of these.
They're absolutely devastating.

178
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:54,043
l'm sure they're filled with opium,
or some such thing.

179
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,159
They make me feel wildly sensual.

180
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,520
Till later.

181
00:16:06,988 --> 00:16:08,268
She's hot stuff, yes?

182
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:10,866
No, thank you.

183
00:16:18,136 --> 00:16:20,937
Oh, you're not mistaking me.
We do not sleep on each other.

184
00:16:22,394 --> 00:16:23,913
That is correct? ''On?''

185
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,070
''With.''

186
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,230
''With.''

187
00:16:30,544 --> 00:16:32,465
Linken Lieselotte...

188
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:35,341
...72 kilos.

189
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:40,738
Her father, you know,
is a big ambassador from Washington.

190
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:42,174
An ambassador?

191
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,412
Oh, yes, dear chap.

192
00:16:44,051 --> 00:16:48,010
And soon, with her, l think,
l am entering the high diplomatic circles.

193
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:51,046
Strict rules will be obeyed.

194
00:16:52,522 --> 00:16:55,642
Sally tells me, sir, that you're
from Oxford University.

195
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,200
A professor of language.

196
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:59,557
Well, it's, it's Cambridge,
actually, and l'm...

197
00:16:59,634 --> 00:17:01,634
...l'm still working for
my doctor of philosophy.

198
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:03,313
That's why l'm here.

199
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:06,592
But, if you really want lessons,
l'd be pleased to help.

200
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,626
Excellent.

201
00:17:07,749 --> 00:17:08,909
Start!

202
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:11,265
For the sport!

203
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,820
lf it's not...if it's not too expensive.
You know, business is...

204
00:17:16,897 --> 00:17:17,857
...business is terrible.

205
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,737
The inflation, the Communists...

206
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:23,813
...the Nazis.

207
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,089
Soon l am with a tin cup, too...

208
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:29,768
...or l make a rich marriage.

209
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:33,163
That at least is sensible.

210
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:50,404
l suppose you're wondering
what l'm doing...

211
00:18:50,481 --> 00:18:52,201
...working in a place like the Kit Kat Klub?

212
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,441
lt is a rather unusual place.

213
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,279
That's me, darling...
unusual places, unusual love affairs.

214
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,115
l am a most strange
and extraordinary person.

215
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:09,186
Now, tell me all about you.
l want to hear everything.

216
00:19:09,903 --> 00:19:11,104
Everything?

217
00:19:11,824 --> 00:19:13,423
Absolutely everything.

218
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,057
Well, there's nothing very dramatic to tell.

219
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:21,932
Well, since l've been down
from Cambridge, l--

220
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:24,771
Lya de Putti.
Absolutely my favorite screen siren.

221
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:27,006
Well, when l left Cambridge, l--

222
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:29,085
l'm going to be a great film star.

223
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:32,844
That is, if booze and sex
don't get me first.

224
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:35,919
Do l shock you, darling?

225
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:37,037
Not a bit.

226
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:38,276
l don't?

227
00:19:40,873 --> 00:19:42,673
Since mother died we're even closer.

228
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,470
He's an ambassador, l understand.

229
00:19:44,547 --> 00:19:45,626
Who told you that?

230
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:46,707
Fritz Wendel.

231
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:48,267
Oh, Fritz.

232
00:19:47,825 --> 00:19:49,664
He's practically an ambassador.

233
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,099
Where is he now?

234
00:19:52,178 --> 00:19:55,057
Oh, who knows?
Timbuctoo, outer Mongolia.

235
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:58,934
He dashes all over the globe
on momentous affairs of state.

236
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:03,210
Then, you don't see much of him.

237
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,446
Darling, what are you talking about?
Of course l do.

238
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:08,404
He can't bear us being apart.

239
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:12,481
He's always swooping down
and carrying me off for divine vacations.

240
00:20:13,118 --> 00:20:14,999
The Riviera, Capri.

241
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,154
Have you ever slept with a dwarf?

242
00:20:18,472 --> 00:20:20,952
Once, but it wasn't a lasting relationship.

243
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:27,507
Oh, l know l can sing,
but what l really want to be is an actress.

244
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:29,701
Like...who is it?

245
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,859
Lya de Putti?

246
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:35,417
Oh, darling, come on.
l could act her right off the screen.

247
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:40,374
l thought you said she was your favorite.

248
00:20:40,611 --> 00:20:42,371
She makes too many faces.

249
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:43,487
No, please....

250
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:44,967
We made an agreement.

251
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:47,723
Thank you.

252
00:20:48,563 --> 00:20:49,843
Just you wait.

253
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,759
One of these days Max Reinhardt
is gonna drift into the club.

254
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:56,355
Well, you never know.

255
00:20:56,434 --> 00:20:57,954
That's right, you never know.

256
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:00,554
lt has happened before.

257
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:04,349
What, just last week,
a man who's a very good friend...

258
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:07,905
...of the head of casting for UFA
asked me to sit at his table, and he's....

259
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:12,780
Come on. Come on.

260
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:14,700
Run, run!

261
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,734
Where?

262
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:44,988
Excuse me, miss....

263
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:47,306
Didn't you just scream?

264
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,339
Does my company upset you that much?

265
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,297
You know, sometimes l come down here
and just wait.

266
00:21:55,377 --> 00:21:56,978
l mean, just especially.

267
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,813
You should try it sometime.

268
00:21:58,892 --> 00:21:59,811
Me?

269
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,527
Yes.

270
00:22:03,727 --> 00:22:04,727
Me?

271
00:22:06,045 --> 00:22:07,325
-You.
-No.

272
00:22:07,682 --> 00:22:08,842
Yes, you.

273
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,881
Go on.

274
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,400
l couldn't possibly.

275
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:13,957
Don't be so British.

276
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:18,113
You'll feel terrific afterwards.

277
00:22:19,431 --> 00:22:20,631
You know you want to.

278
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:21,830
No, l don't.

279
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:26,346
Here comes one now.

280
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:30,182
-Will you do it?
-All right.

281
00:22:33,136 --> 00:22:34,376
No, not yet.

282
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,851
Okay, you ready?

283
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,810
Now.

284
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:42,748
l can't promise you anything,
but we can give it a try.

285
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:44,907
Darling, l want you to meet Herr Ludwig.

286
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:46,305
He's just back from Hamburg.

287
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,702
He lives in the room off the kitchen,
and he's a marvelous publisher.

288
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,259
Now look, he's got this book,
and it's got to be translated.

289
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:54,217
And l told him
what a famous writer you are...

290
00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:56,296
...and it's 50 marks. Right?

291
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,290
Fabulous.

292
00:23:58,368 --> 00:23:59,449
lt's all settled.

293
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:01,849
lt will be an honor for me
to associate with...

294
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:05,247
...so talented a young man of letters
as Miss Bowles tells me.

295
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:08,124
This book, l assure you,
is most artistic...

296
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,200
...most artistic and color--

297
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:12,160
Twenty-five marks in advance. Right?

298
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:16,194
l think, Herr Roberts,
you will find the style--

299
00:24:16,314 --> 00:24:17,794
ls there any hot water left?

300
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:19,630
-Hot water?
-Yes, a little.

301
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,027
l think you will find the style admirable...

302
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:28,023
...and the subject matter,
l feel, is universal.

303
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:31,699
-Cigar?
-No, thank you.

304
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:33,855
No, you must. lt's the finest Havana.

305
00:24:35,093 --> 00:24:36,172
lt's a deal?

306
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:40,852
Herr Ludwig, l'm afraid that Sally's
rather overestimated my powers of....

307
00:24:45,523 --> 00:24:46,523
lt's a deal.

308
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:03,345
That's it.

309
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:06,981
Fifty marks. Not bad, huh?

310
00:25:08,338 --> 00:25:11,219
Do you know what this artistic
and colorful book's about?

311
00:25:11,296 --> 00:25:12,536
No. Tell, tell.

312
00:25:13,573 --> 00:25:14,652
lt's pure pornography.

313
00:25:14,732 --> 00:25:18,373
But of course it is, darling.
All of Herr Ludwig's books are dirty books.

314
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:20,968
What's this one called?

315
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:26,603
''Cleo, the Whip Lady.''

316
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,115
You lied about the hot water.

317
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:34,952
l'm freezing.

318
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:36,751
l'm freezing to death.

319
00:25:37,391 --> 00:25:38,470
Hug me?

320
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:42,507
Tighter.

321
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,456
Don't be so literal.

322
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,552
Doesn't my body
drive you wild with desire?

323
00:26:57,229 --> 00:26:58,509
Doesn't it?

324
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:02,344
lt's a very nice body.

325
00:27:03,264 --> 00:27:04,984
Do you really think so, darling?

326
00:27:05,861 --> 00:27:07,780
lt does have a certain kind of style.

327
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:10,576
l mean, look, it's very flat here...

328
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:13,172
...not much hips, and...

329
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,610
...here....

330
00:27:20,165 --> 00:27:22,885
lt's a little early in the day
for this sort of thing, isn't it?

331
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:30,078
Maybe you just don't sleep with girls.

332
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,150
You don't.

333
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:45,024
Well, listen, we're practically
living together, so if you only like boys...

334
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:47,338
...l mean, l wouldn't dream
of pestering you.

335
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:51,095
Well, do you sleep with girls, or don't you?

336
00:27:51,694 --> 00:27:53,455
You don't ask questions like that.

337
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:54,813
l do.

338
00:27:58,646 --> 00:27:59,727
All right.

339
00:28:00,604 --> 00:28:01,805
lf you insist.

340
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:04,363
l do not sleep with girls.

341
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:07,758
Let me be absolutely accurate.

342
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:11,237
l've gone through the motions
of sleeping with girls exactly...

343
00:28:11,716 --> 00:28:12,676
...three times.

344
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:15,472
All of them disastrous.

345
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,786
The word for my sex life now is...

346
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:22,784
...''nil,'' or...

347
00:28:23,342 --> 00:28:24,782
...as you Americans would say...

348
00:28:24,861 --> 00:28:26,101
...''plenty of nuttin'''!

349
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:31,894
All right?

350
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:43,223
Why didn't you tell me in the first place?

351
00:28:45,377 --> 00:28:46,617
Look, Brian.

352
00:28:47,496 --> 00:28:49,455
You're absolutely my best friend.

353
00:28:50,093 --> 00:28:52,492
And friends are much harder to find
than lovers.

354
00:28:52,571 --> 00:28:56,051
Besides, sex always screws up
a friendship, anyway, if you let it.

355
00:28:57,805 --> 00:28:59,285
So we won't let it.

356
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:05,320
Okay, Sally.

357
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:25,579
''You would have been,
he would have been....''

358
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:29,734
Pluperfect tense.

359
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:31,531
''l have been....''

360
00:29:35,086 --> 00:29:38,207
lf you did a little homework,
instead of gadding about all over town....

361
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:41,923
Fraulein Schneider,
there's a new pupil coming at 3:00.

362
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:44,281
-Would you show her up, please?
-Certainly.

363
00:29:45,277 --> 00:29:47,317
''You had have been, l had have been....''

364
00:29:47,434 --> 00:29:48,674
Future perfect.

365
00:29:49,314 --> 00:29:51,273
''l shall have....''

366
00:29:51,352 --> 00:29:53,632
''l shall have been.'' This English.

367
00:29:54,028 --> 00:29:56,147
l go now to try to pull a deal.

368
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,224
Or l make business soon...

369
00:29:59,624 --> 00:30:01,183
...or l go as a gigolo.

370
00:30:01,423 --> 00:30:02,383
''Either, or.''

371
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:04,780
''Either, or,'' l go as a gigolo.

372
00:30:05,297 --> 00:30:07,936
Anyway, who is the new pupil?

373
00:30:08,413 --> 00:30:09,732
Natalia Landauer.

374
00:30:10,613 --> 00:30:11,613
Landauer?

375
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,450
Of the big department store?

376
00:30:18,243 --> 00:30:19,364
A Landauer?

377
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
How did you meet a Landauer?

378
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:27,436
l had a letter of introduction
from England.

379
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:29,194
They invited me for coffee.

380
00:30:29,353 --> 00:30:30,873
lnvited you for coffee?

381
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:36,548
Landauers are enormous rich Jews.

382
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:39,185
Stinking rich, it seems.

383
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:50,491
Good.

384
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:52,810
l shall make a pass after her.

385
00:30:54,008 --> 00:30:56,008
What if she's...fat and hideous?

386
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:06,439
Perhaps the father will take
a liking from me and give me a job.

387
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:09,513
lf l marry her, a partnership perhaps.

388
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:13,189
l'm not prejudiced.

389
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,384
Hello.

390
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:19,584
You said you wouldn't be back until 4:00.

391
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:21,661
l must have a drink this instant.

392
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:26,058
The new pupil's due at any moment.
Can't the drink wait?

393
00:31:26,253 --> 00:31:27,614
Oh, God, only gin.

394
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:29,575
Sally, please!

395
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:32,570
Three marks an hour. l need it.

396
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:35,327
-We need it.
-All l need is a drink!

397
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:37,507
She's young and very strictly brought up.

398
00:31:37,584 --> 00:31:39,624
Look, l may have my tiny faults...

399
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:43,580
...but l'm really not planning
to white slave her to Latin America.

400
00:31:44,214 --> 00:31:45,654
Whose room is this, anyhow?

401
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:48,253
Sally, in all fairness--

402
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:50,412
Fairness? Who cares about fairness?

403
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:58,482
Honestly.

404
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:08,553
Thank you.

405
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:11,271
You're welcome.

406
00:32:14,424 --> 00:32:15,865
-Excuse me.
-How fat?

407
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,500
How fat?

408
00:32:18,582 --> 00:32:21,541
l think the weather will be fine,
isn't it true, Miss Landauer?

409
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:27,775
Fraulein Landauer.

410
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,530
Come in.

411
00:32:30,887 --> 00:32:32,768
-Good afternoon, Fraulein Landauer.
-Good afternoon.

412
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:35,926
-How nice to see you again.
-lt's nice to see you again.

413
00:32:36,482 --> 00:32:38,323
lt is good, you have others.

414
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:41,401
So, we shall make a party
for speaking English, yes?

415
00:32:42,557 --> 00:32:45,038
Well, actually, my friends
were just leaving.

416
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:48,073
No, l'm delighted to stay, Brian.

417
00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:53,709
Sally, you have this appointment,
don't you?

418
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:55,746
l'll cancel it. l love parties.

419
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,584
Good, this is splendid for the practicing.

420
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,740
You will introduce me, please.

421
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:02,739
Yes, of course.

422
00:33:03,218 --> 00:33:05,097
Herr Wendel, Fraulein Landauer.

423
00:33:05,413 --> 00:33:08,933
-lt is a pleasure, miss.
-No, no, English conversation.

424
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,569
l am so charmed, dearest miss.

425
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:13,926
And...and this...

426
00:33:14,804 --> 00:33:17,203
...this is Miss Sally Bowles.

427
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,961
How do you do?

428
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:23,598
Bobby, a Landauer in my house.

429
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,869
Last summer when l....

430
00:33:50,646 --> 00:33:52,207
You are all healthy, l hope.

431
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,602
l have had a cold, but it is better now.

432
00:34:01,438 --> 00:34:02,238
Good.

433
00:34:02,317 --> 00:34:03,277
How sad.

434
00:34:04,114 --> 00:34:07,034
A cold from the nose is most aggravating.

435
00:34:07,352 --> 00:34:10,512
This was a cold of the bosom,
not of the nose.

436
00:34:11,387 --> 00:34:13,148
All the plegm vas here.

437
00:34:13,864 --> 00:34:14,864
All the what?

438
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:18,262
Ze plegm...zat comes in the tubes.

439
00:34:19,298 --> 00:34:20,978
l think l'm gonna be sick.

440
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:25,297
Phlegm. ''Ph'' is always pronounced
as ''f'', and...

441
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,012
...you don't sound...the ''g.''

442
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:30,128
Then why are they putting the ''g'',
please?

443
00:34:31,606 --> 00:34:33,527
That's a very good question, but...

444
00:34:34,222 --> 00:34:35,902
...it's rather difficult to explain.

445
00:34:35,983 --> 00:34:37,222
Try, Brian.

446
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,452
lt's just there.

447
00:34:45,813 --> 00:34:48,773
So, Mr. Professor, you do not know?

448
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:49,768
No.

449
00:34:50,445 --> 00:34:53,126
Then l'm sorry, l cannot help you.

450
00:34:56,402 --> 00:34:58,322
lt's most amusing.

451
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:01,277
Very amusing.

452
00:35:01,876 --> 00:35:02,876
Come in.

453
00:35:06,393 --> 00:35:08,434
How thoughtful of you,
Fraulein Schneider.

454
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:09,869
Thank you very much.

455
00:35:10,028 --> 00:35:12,068
You're most welcome, Herr Roberts.

456
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,340
Please.

457
00:35:22,014 --> 00:35:24,574
Please, you must take a cake,
dearest miss.

458
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:26,572
l'm not eating between meals.

459
00:35:27,052 --> 00:35:28,813
You're not eating between meals.

460
00:35:29,648 --> 00:35:31,288
l am eating between meals.

461
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:36,961
Thank you.

462
00:35:37,242 --> 00:35:38,242
So much.

463
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:39,358
You're welcome.

464
00:35:43,112 --> 00:35:44,713
Brian, Liebling, did l tell you?

465
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:47,032
l saw a film the other day about syphilis.

466
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:49,389
lt was too awful.

467
00:35:49,865 --> 00:35:51,626
l couldn't let a man touch me for a week.

468
00:35:52,465 --> 00:35:53,465
Coffee?

469
00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:56,902
ls it true you can get it from kissing?

470
00:35:57,181 --> 00:35:58,141
Oh, yes.

471
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,300
And your king, Henry Vlll...

472
00:36:00,456 --> 00:36:03,297
...caught it from letting Cardinal Wolsey
whisper in his ear.

473
00:36:03,532 --> 00:36:06,132
That is not, l think, founded in fact.

474
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,769
But from kissing, most decidedly.

475
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:12,806
And from towels...and from cups.

476
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:18,400
And, of course, screwing.

477
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:24,235
''Screwing,'' please?

478
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,510
Fornication.

479
00:36:30,425 --> 00:36:31,626
Fornication?

480
00:36:32,585 --> 00:36:34,465
Brian, darling, what is the German word?

481
00:36:34,543 --> 00:36:35,623
l don't remember.

482
00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:40,498
-Oh, yes....
-Oh, no.

483
00:36:41,456 --> 00:36:42,416
Bumsen.

484
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,130
lt would be the one German word
you pronounce perfectly.

485
00:36:51,365 --> 00:36:54,206
Well, l ought to.
l spent the entire afternoon bumsening...

486
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:56,523
...like mad with
some ghastly old producer...

487
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:58,478
...who promised to give me a contract.

488
00:37:00,876 --> 00:37:02,197
Gin, Miss Landauer?

489
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,992
Fritz is overdoing it a bit, isn't he?

490
00:37:07,148 --> 00:37:09,548
Natalia's very rich. Fritz is very broke.

491
00:37:10,425 --> 00:37:12,744
That old heel-clicking,
hand-kissing routine of his...

492
00:37:12,824 --> 00:37:14,585
...isn't going to get him
anywhere with her.

493
00:37:14,702 --> 00:37:17,782
The only thing to do with virgins
is to make a ferocious pounce.

494
00:37:18,617 --> 00:37:21,016
l can't imagine anyone
pouncing on Natalia.

495
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:23,295
That's why it would be
so effective, darling.

496
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:27,411
You are a woman
of many sexual experiences, l think.

497
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:31,248
l'll say, darling. Ever since l was so high,
men have found me irresistible.

498
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:33,443
-Daddy was always worrying that....
-Yes?

499
00:37:33,681 --> 00:37:34,681
You know.

500
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,201
How's the gigolo campaign going?

501
00:37:37,998 --> 00:37:38,998
Terrible.

502
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:42,436
This week, already l'm giving up
three dinner invitations...

503
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:44,034
...to spend 32 marks on her.

504
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:46,309
That's quite a sacrifice.

505
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,989
And here is the craziness.

506
00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:49,306
l like it.

507
00:37:50,744 --> 00:37:51,784
Goddammit!

508
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:53,264
What?

509
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:55,862
l think l'm falling in love with her.

510
00:37:55,978 --> 00:37:57,099
l'm so sorry.

511
00:37:57,257 --> 00:37:58,257
So am l.

512
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:22,038
You assure me the English reader
will find this...

513
00:38:22,914 --> 00:38:25,434
...arousing...stimulating?

514
00:38:26,467 --> 00:38:27,507
Well, l....

515
00:38:29,903 --> 00:38:31,784
Yes, l...l should think so.

516
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,699
Look, everybody.

517
00:38:35,101 --> 00:38:37,501
Positively a nun's hands, aren't they?

518
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:41,576
-You look lovely, Sally.
-Just lovely.

519
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:46,849
Thank you. Well, l'm off to the Adlon...

520
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:48,766
...to see my sexy...

521
00:38:49,485 --> 00:38:52,005
...marvelous, devastating father.

522
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:56,481
-Auf wiedersehen, my darlings.
-Auf wiedersehen.

523
00:38:57,398 --> 00:38:58,398
Good luck.

524
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,510
l'm terribly sorry, but l couldn't
possibly find any more of them.

525
00:39:08,706 --> 00:39:11,985
Good night, and thank you so much
for a delightful evening.

526
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:14,021
You're most welcome, Herr Roberts.

527
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,380
-Good night.
-Good night.

528
00:39:18,697 --> 00:39:20,456
lt really has been...sublime.

529
00:39:22,253 --> 00:39:23,213
Thank you.

530
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:24,971
Dearest miss.

531
00:39:43,072 --> 00:39:44,512
You see how she is with me?

532
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:47,509
You see that kiss? You see that kiss?

533
00:39:47,784 --> 00:39:49,864
No, l...l was too discreet to look back.

534
00:39:50,063 --> 00:39:52,543
l think l go...
l go crazy with the frustration.

535
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,101
You know, l...l kiss and inside me
comes the explosion. But her?

536
00:39:58,893 --> 00:40:01,172
Brian, l tell you a simple fact...

537
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,690
-...and l'm not boosting.
-''Boasting.''

538
00:40:04,929 --> 00:40:08,128
The French women, the Swedish women,
even the English...

539
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,523
...they go wild for my kisses, but...

540
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,798
...this one....

541
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,840
Nothing?

542
00:40:16,197 --> 00:40:17,157
Nothing.

543
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:22,793
And l'm a crazy, love-sick fool.

544
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:26,949
Sally says you ought to pounce.

545
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,346
Pounce?

546
00:40:29,422 --> 00:40:31,143
Throw her on a couch or something.

547
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,139
To attack Natalia?

548
00:40:34,697 --> 00:40:35,856
lmpossible.

549
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:39,974
Well, Sally is rather knowledgeable
in these areas.

550
00:40:41,612 --> 00:40:45,172
You do what Sally says and you end up,
l think, in the prison cell.

551
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:54,043
-Pounce, huh?
-Pounce.

552
00:41:15,737 --> 00:41:16,817
How'd it go?

553
00:41:19,092 --> 00:41:20,092
Bad?

554
00:41:22,251 --> 00:41:23,532
Sally, what is it?

555
00:41:38,273 --> 00:41:40,153
l waited at the Adlon till 10:00.

556
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,871
When l got back, there was this.

557
00:41:46,344 --> 00:41:47,625
''Dear Sally:

558
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:50,782
''Sorry, schedule revised at last minute.

559
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,061
''Writing. Love.''

560
00:41:55,177 --> 00:41:57,217
Well, these...these things do happen.

561
00:41:58,652 --> 00:42:00,253
l'm sure he had a good reason.

562
00:42:01,971 --> 00:42:04,411
Ten words. Exactly.

563
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:07,847
After ten it's extra.

564
00:42:09,123 --> 00:42:11,324
You see, Daddy thinks of these things.

565
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,400
lf l had leprosy, there'd be a cable.

566
00:42:16,514 --> 00:42:18,474
''Gee, kid, tough.

567
00:42:19,713 --> 00:42:23,432
''Sincerely hope...nose doesn't fall off.

568
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,585
''Love.''

569
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:32,619
Bastard!

570
00:42:33,137 --> 00:42:34,617
l'll show him!

571
00:42:34,856 --> 00:42:37,135
l'll become a big film star.

572
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:48,487
The poor man, he tries to love me.

573
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:51,561
Perhaps he even thinks he does...

574
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:54,797
...but the real truth...

575
00:42:56,235 --> 00:42:59,155
...is that he just doesn't care.

576
00:43:01,188 --> 00:43:03,547
Maybe he's right.
Maybe l'm not worth caring about.

577
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,661
Maybe l am...just nothing. Nothing.

578
00:43:27,722 --> 00:43:29,802
You're a perfectly marvelous girl.

579
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:32,958
-And beautiful.
-No.

580
00:43:33,556 --> 00:43:35,516
-And talented.
-No, l'm not.

581
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:38,032
Yes, you are.

582
00:43:46,505 --> 00:43:48,065
Do you really think so?

583
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,181
l mean really?

584
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,780
Yes, l do.

585
00:43:55,954 --> 00:43:56,914
Thank you.

586
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:51,541
''Maybe this time, l'll be lucky

587
00:44:52,896 --> 00:44:56,697
''Maybe this time, he'll stay.''

588
00:45:05,443 --> 00:45:08,083
Obviously those three girls...

589
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:10,518
...were just the wrong three girls.

590
00:45:15,034 --> 00:45:19,474
''Maybe this time, for the first time

591
00:45:20,746 --> 00:45:23,947
''Love won't hurry away.''

592
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:29,664
Doesn't my body
drive you wild with desire?

593
00:45:35,092 --> 00:45:38,612
''He will hold me fast

594
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:44,487
''l'll be home at last

595
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,161
''Not a loser anymore

00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:56,996
''Like the last time
And the time before.

00:46:29,878 --> 00:46:33,079

Hey, what's going on?

615
00:48:42,143 --> 00:48:44,623
Tell him your lover
is a gangster from Chicago.

616
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:07,121
-You told him?
-l did better than that.

617
00:49:07,556 --> 00:49:10,556
l just told him that l had
the teeniest touch of syphilis.

618
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:18,710
Wait till he gets a load
of what little old Elke's got.

619
00:49:24,382 --> 00:49:25,782
-Landauer?
-Ja.

620
00:49:32,213 --> 00:49:34,733
l am grateful to you
that you came to me from my call.

621
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:36,489
Don't be silly. l'm all agog.

622
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:39,246
Thank you.

623
00:49:42,963 --> 00:49:45,684
-You will eat food, please?
-Thank you.

624
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:56,710
-You see, Fraulein....
-Sally.

625
00:49:59,784 --> 00:50:03,184
Our acquaintance is not long,
but l am choosing you...

626
00:50:04,021 --> 00:50:05,501
...because l know
no other young woman...

627
00:50:05,577 --> 00:50:07,577
...who is giving her body
frequently to men.

628
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:11,335
My English.

629
00:50:11,731 --> 00:50:13,411
l am rending you an embarrassment?

630
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:15,369
No, no, l'm fascinated.

631
00:50:18,487 --> 00:50:20,166
Fritz Wendel has declared love for me.

632
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,081
At first l not taking this seriously.

633
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:26,199
He is so...

634
00:50:28,036 --> 00:50:31,476
...so formal. And also l think so much...

635
00:50:31,713 --> 00:50:34,592
...the gigolo who hunts for the fortune.

636
00:50:36,465 --> 00:50:37,706
ls that what you say?

637
00:50:38,146 --> 00:50:39,706
That's what we say, all right.

638
00:50:40,626 --> 00:50:41,626
Then...

639
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:44,101
...the night before yesterday...

640
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:47,298
...my parents are from the house...

641
00:50:48,016 --> 00:50:49,617
...und we are seated here...

642
00:50:50,452 --> 00:50:52,172
...upon my father's library sofa.

643
00:50:53,771 --> 00:50:54,851
Suddenly...

644
00:50:55,528 --> 00:50:57,329
...he throws aside the formalities...

645
00:50:57,927 --> 00:51:00,088
-...there is fire, there is passion.
-Oh, my God...

646
00:51:01,481 --> 00:51:03,161
-...he pounced!
-Please?

647
00:51:06,835 --> 00:51:08,076
He made love to you.

648
00:51:08,355 --> 00:51:10,074
On my father's library sofa.

649
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:13,190
Und even for that
he is showing no respect.

650
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:16,670
l am fighting,
l'm calling out harsh words...

651
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:18,507
...but then....

652
00:51:20,385 --> 00:51:21,585
May we not be frank?

653
00:51:23,378 --> 00:51:24,418
Suddenly...

654
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:28,297
...all is...equal fire...

655
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:31,612
...equal passion in me.

656
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,889
And since then, l think only of him.

657
00:51:37,567 --> 00:51:39,646
Now, is this love...

658
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:42,601
...or mere fatuation of the body?

659
00:51:44,557 --> 00:51:46,797
You with so many, as you call,
''screwings''...

660
00:51:47,556 --> 00:51:49,597
...shall please tell me the truth of it.

661
00:51:58,862 --> 00:51:59,902
Please.

662
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:04,501
Does it really matter,
as long as you're having fun?

663
00:52:04,976 --> 00:52:06,336
How can you speak of ''fun''?

664
00:52:07,135 --> 00:52:08,534
He has asked me to marry him.

665
00:52:08,974 --> 00:52:11,173
Well, that's wonderful. Why don't you?

666
00:52:11,851 --> 00:52:16,132
And say to my father that l am marrying
a man who is perhaps a fortune hunter?

667
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:18,965
And a Christian, too.

668
00:52:20,722 --> 00:52:23,001
Oh, this l think is...breaking his heart.

669
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:27,759
Well, in that case then, l guess
you better just forget the whole thing.

670
00:52:29,032 --> 00:52:29,992
Forget Fritz?

671
00:52:31,309 --> 00:52:32,789
How am l ever forgetting Fritz?

672
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:34,989
Look, l really have to be running along.

673
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:39,822
Don't cry.

674
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,581
Oh, please, don't cry.

675
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:46,498
l'm no good at all if anybody cries.

676
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,893
Natalia, about Fritz pouncing...

677
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,130
...you see, l thought....

678
00:52:58,682 --> 00:52:59,842
l didn't think....

679
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:04,318
How shall so grave a problem
resolve itself?

680
00:53:06,675 --> 00:53:07,635
Poor thing.

681
00:53:08,474 --> 00:53:10,954
You can't marry him.
You can't give him up.

682
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:16,548
l don't suppose you'd ever consider
seeing him on the sly, every now....

683
00:53:17,304 --> 00:53:18,824
No, l didn't think so.

684
00:53:20,782 --> 00:53:24,782
My God, it's enough
to drive a girl into a convent.

685
00:53:27,293 --> 00:53:28,534
Do they have Jewish nuns?

686
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:44,001
-Good day.
-Good day.

687
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:48,954
Please...can you wash...?

688
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:51,231
-Excuse me, miss, l think you lost this.
-What?

689
00:53:52,547 --> 00:53:56,027
-l think you dropped this.
-Yes, thank you.

690
00:53:56,824 --> 00:53:59,503
Can you wash my clothes...

691
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,181
...Monday, Tuesday?

692
00:54:02,858 --> 00:54:04,217
l'm sorry, l don't understand you.

693
00:54:04,297 --> 00:54:05,737
Excuse me, may l help you?

694
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,576
l want my laundry back by Tuesday.

695
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:12,690
The young lady would like
her laundry back by Tuesday.

696
00:54:13,007 --> 00:54:14,126
l understand.

697
00:54:14,206 --> 00:54:15,206

Divine decadence.

705
00:54:38,222 --> 00:54:40,621
May l drop you somewhere?
l have my car outside.

706

01:02:26,304 --> 01:02:30,224
The Nazis are just a gang of stupid
hooligans, but they do serve a purpose.

807
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:34,101
Let them get rid of the Communists.
Later we'll be able to control them.

808
01:02:34,737 --> 01:02:37,418
-But who exactly is ''we''?
-Germany, of course.

809
01:02:39,612 --> 01:02:41,733
Hey, Max, can we go to the Bristol Bar?

810
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:43,570
-Why not?
-Oh, wonderful.

811
01:02:43,648 --> 01:02:45,208
l'm dying to show off my new coat.

812
01:02:45,407 --> 01:02:46,887
l think l could do with a drink, too.

813
01:02:46,965 --> 01:02:49,724
Good. We'll make a night of it.
Or, why not a weekend?

814
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,280
Berlin makes strange bedfellows
these days.

815
01:02:56,954 --> 01:02:58,713
Some people have one people...

816
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:00,954
...some have two.

817
01:03:01,269 --> 01:03:02,429

-He's asking about his asthma.

851

Miss Bowles, in mother's room, l thought.

852
01:05:57,952 --> 01:06:00,112
-Mr. Roberts, in the blue room.
-Yes, Mr. Baron.

853
01:06:01,706 --> 01:06:04,106
The master says in case you have
nothing to change into...

...he asked me to bring you these.

856
01:06:49,019 --> 01:06:50,019
Come in.

857
01:06:51,695 --> 01:06:53,175
No, no, help yourself. Please.

858

l'm not quite sure,
but l think they're mine.

This used to be my room
before l was married.

860
01:07:04,403 --> 01:07:05,643
Looks familiar.

861
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,641
You can at least get out of that shirt.

862
01:07:09,038 --> 01:07:11,237
Try this one. Blue should be your color.

863
01:07:15,313 --> 01:07:16,913
Brian, not even a sweater?

864
01:07:21,224 --> 01:07:22,585
Are you still married?

865
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:26,442
Very much so.

866
01:07:33,914 --> 01:07:35,994
-Where is your wife, now?
-ln Cologne.

867
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:40,108
For the culture.

868
01:07:40,666 --> 01:07:42,827
She lends her support to the arts.

869
01:07:43,384 --> 01:07:45,023
She in her way, l in mine.

870
01:07:49,657 --> 01:07:51,297
We have quite a special understanding.

871
01:07:52,217 --> 01:07:53,617
That must be useful at times.

872
01:07:55,612 --> 01:07:56,972
What about these?

873
01:08:00,885 --> 01:08:03,126
l was right. Blue is your color.

874
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:18,671
We thought you deserted us
permanently, Max.

875
01:08:18,747 --> 01:08:20,868
My dear Stephanie,
l would never desert you.

876
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:22,744
l find it very interesting.

877
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:26,422
Your father must be
a very important man, Miss Bowles.

878
01:08:26,742 --> 01:08:29,421
Oh, l'll say, darling.
He's practically an ambassador.

879
01:08:30,055 --> 01:08:33,095
We have the most
marvelous relationship....

880
01:08:33,413 --> 01:08:36,734
lnstant he can tear himself away,
he dashes to wherever l am.

881
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:41,926
Oh, it's excellent, excellent.
But the food here is always good.

882
01:08:42,443 --> 01:08:45,722
Excuse me, but didn't we meet
with Emil Jannings at UFA last winter?

883
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:46,801
l don't--

884
01:08:46,841 --> 01:08:48,400
You do know Emil, don't you?

885
01:08:48,476 --> 01:08:50,516
l find him trs amusant.

886
01:08:59,626 --> 01:09:00,746
Money.

887
01:09:01,786 --> 01:09:02,865
Be careful!

888
01:09:04,502 --> 01:09:05,502
Clara Bow.

889
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,501
-That's not Clara Bow.
-lt's early Clara Bow.

890
01:09:10,895 --> 01:09:12,694
Wait, l got one. l got one.

891
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:16,930
Late Sally Bowles.

892
01:09:17,527 --> 01:09:18,606
Yes, it is.

893
01:09:19,365 --> 01:09:20,886
You two are marvelous.

894
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,404
Have you ever been to Africa?

895
01:09:24,162 --> 01:09:26,002
-Where, mein Schatz?
-Africa.

896
01:09:26,837 --> 01:09:29,278
Let's go, the three of us.
Smile Brian.

897
01:09:37,149 --> 01:09:39,509
-Sally, you're really talented.
-What?

898
01:09:40,585 --> 01:09:41,904
You're talented.

899
01:09:46,256 --> 01:09:48,056
He wants to take us to Africa.

900
01:09:52,412 --> 01:09:53,853
He must be insane.

901
01:09:56,088 --> 01:09:59,408
More! Come on, please. More!
More, more, more! Please!

902
01:09:59,565 --> 01:10:00,565
-That's all.
-More!

903
01:10:00,644 --> 01:10:01,724
More, please!

904
01:10:01,805 --> 01:10:02,925
More!

905
01:10:08,957 --> 01:10:10,676
-Come on, Max.
-No, no. No.

906
01:10:11,114 --> 01:10:12,314
Oh, please?

907
01:10:13,152 --> 01:10:15,311
Oh, bravo, bravo.

908
01:10:42,881 --> 01:10:44,402
The king of the jungle.

909
01:12:05,757 --> 01:12:07,518
What's the matter? You all right?

910
01:12:14,069 --> 01:12:15,149
You okay?

911
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:05,780
Mombasa's quite wonderful, really.

912
01:13:05,935 --> 01:13:08,256
l mean, the way ports are
all over the world.

913
01:13:08,693 --> 01:13:10,132
Sounds absolutely exotic.

914
01:13:11,091 --> 01:13:13,171
All the way through Tanganyika.

915
01:13:13,688 --> 01:13:14,728
Sure?

916
01:13:15,606 --> 01:13:16,886
Sally, champagne?

917
01:13:23,158 --> 01:13:26,038
Every now and then the train stops
in the middle of nowhere...

918
01:13:26,117 --> 01:13:29,396
...and right there is a family of giraffes,
nibbling the trees...

919
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:32,511
...or a herd of zebra,
galloping off in a cloud of dust.

920
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:36,270
And when the flamingos come in,
thousands and thousands of them...

921
01:13:36,623 --> 01:13:38,503
...turning the whole sky pink....

922
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:40,302
You'll be amazed when you see it.

923
01:13:42,417 --> 01:13:43,978
Hey! Hey, Sally.

924
01:13:45,297 --> 01:13:46,978
Are you quite comfortable?

925
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:52,011
Come on.

926
01:14:15,663 --> 01:14:17,224
Sally is an endearing child.

927
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:20,743
But l must admit l find it peaceful
when she's taking her nap.

928
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:51,073

929

969
01:18:59,037 --> 01:19:01,078
ls it your parents? lsn't it?

970
01:19:01,515 --> 01:19:03,835
lt's not my parents. lt is me.

971
01:19:04,074 --> 01:19:05,194
lt is you, too.

972
01:19:09,707 --> 01:19:11,146
Fritz, be careful!

973
01:19:12,904 --> 01:19:14,344
What am l doing?

974
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:18,143
l've never jumped
on a running board before.

975
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:19,579
Are you all right?

976
01:19:23,055 --> 01:19:24,176
Why won't you marry me?

977
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:29,451
Don't you see what is happening
in Germany today?

978
01:19:30,045 --> 01:19:31,284
l'm a Jew.

979
01:19:31,845 --> 01:19:32,925
You are not.

980
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:37,560
Goodbye, dear Fritz.

981
01:20:30,385 --> 01:20:31,465
You, drive.

982
01:20:31,585 --> 01:20:33,024
There is somebody in the way, sir.

983
01:20:33,104 --> 01:20:34,583
Just drive on, idiot!

984
01:20:39,614 --> 01:20:43,015
l told Schneider we'd be gone
for at least two months, maybe more.

985
01:20:43,252 --> 01:20:45,613
She cried and cried
and said she'd miss us.

986
01:20:46,051 --> 01:20:48,252
l think the only reason she was crying,
though, was because she knew...

987
01:20:48,287 --> 01:20:50,448
...she can't get 50 marks a month
from anybody else...

988
01:20:50,684 --> 01:20:52,003
...for this pitiful little room.

989
01:20:52,082 --> 01:20:54,483
You know:
''Money makes the world go around.''

990
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:58,720
Where've you been?
l've been packing for hours.

991
01:20:59,954 --> 01:21:02,795
Have some champagne, darling.
Compliments of Max.

992
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:06,871
Oh, your laundry came back.
lt's there on the bed.

993
01:21:08,627 --> 01:21:11,028
You know Bri, it occurred to me....

994
01:21:11,903 --> 01:21:14,182
l know l've handled Max brilliantly....

995
01:21:14,621 --> 01:21:16,661
Enough of the African moon.

996
01:21:17,179 --> 01:21:19,338
l mean, it would be funny, wouldn't it,
if he asked me to become...

997
01:21:19,414 --> 01:21:21,975
...the next Baroness von Heune
und Regensburg?

998
01:21:24,011 --> 01:21:27,770
l've been looking for that for months.
l mean, stranger things have happened.

999
01:21:30,565 --> 01:21:32,886
l wouldn't dream of accepting him,
of course.

1000
01:21:33,561 --> 01:21:36,721
For God's sake,
l wish you could hear yourself sometimes.

1001
01:21:37,238 --> 01:21:39,078
l mean, really hear yourself!

1002
01:21:40,434 --> 01:21:41,394
Christ!

1003
01:21:45,948 --> 01:21:48,668
Aren't you ever gonna stop
deluding yourself?

1004
01:21:49,385 --> 01:21:50,625
''Handling Max!''

1005
01:21:51,344 --> 01:21:54,984
Behaving like some ludicrous, little,
underage femme fatale!

1006
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:58,560
You're about as ''fatale''
as an after-dinner mint.

1007
01:22:07,787 --> 01:22:09,306
Darling, we all know...

1008
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:12,664
...about your vast experiences
with les femmes...

1009
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:14,500
...fatales, or otherwise.

1010
01:22:17,537 --> 01:22:19,417
Why don't you just come out with it?

1011
01:22:20,012 --> 01:22:24,012
You can't stand Maximilian
because he's everything you're not!

1012
01:22:25,609 --> 01:22:29,009
He doesn't have to give English lessons
for three marks an hour.

1013
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:30,204
He's rich!

1014
01:22:30,483 --> 01:22:33,603
And he knows about life.
He doesn't read about it in books!

1015
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:35,800
He's suave...

1016
01:22:36,516 --> 01:22:38,396
...and he's divinely sexy...

1017
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:42,594
...and he really appreciates a woman.

1018
01:22:42,912 --> 01:22:45,072
Oh, screw Maximilian!

1019
01:22:46,547 --> 01:22:47,507
l do.

1020
01:22:57,855 --> 01:22:58,775
So do l.

1021
01:23:17,594 --> 01:23:19,713
You two bastards!

1022
01:23:22,951 --> 01:23:23,911
Two?

1023
01:23:25,028 --> 01:23:26,068
Two?!

1024
01:23:26,865 --> 01:23:28,586
Shouldn't that be three?

1025
01:23:44,247 --> 01:23:45,768
Help us with our order....

1026
01:23:46,127 --> 01:23:49,247
l think your paper and your party
are pure crap, sir!

1027
01:23:49,805 --> 01:23:50,765
What did you say?

1028
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:53,439
l said: That's a lot of crap!

1029
01:23:53,957 --> 01:23:55,237
And so are you!

1030
01:23:55,676 --> 01:23:57,476
He's a foreigner.

1031
01:24:14,657 --> 01:24:17,697
l hear you took on
the entire Nazi party single-handed.

1032
01:24:20,532 --> 01:24:21,532
Only two?

1033
01:24:27,287 --> 01:24:28,926
Sounds like...cigarette?

1034
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:35,717
Feel up to a little surprise?

1035
01:24:45,984 --> 01:24:47,545
Poor thing, you're blind.

1036
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:53,140
''Dear Sally and Bri....''
ln that order, please note.

1037
01:24:56,295 --> 01:24:59,614
''l know you will forgive me,
but family affairs make it imperative...

1038
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:01,610
''...for me to leave
for Argentina, immediately.

1039
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:03,409
''lt was fun, wasn't it?''

1040
01:25:04,805 --> 01:25:06,324
Signed: ''Maximilian.''

1041
01:25:07,283 --> 01:25:08,724
Argentina, my ass.

1042
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:11,840
He also sent this.

1043
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:13,878
Three hundred marks.

1044
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:15,518
For the two of us.

1045
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:18,753
A hundred and fifty each.

1046
01:25:22,587 --> 01:25:24,868
Let's see, on an hour-to-hour basis...

1047
01:25:25,025 --> 01:25:27,546
...that puts us on a par with Fraulein Kost.

1048
01:25:30,819 --> 01:25:32,340
Some gold diggers, aren't we?

1049
01:25:38,372 --> 01:25:39,932
Oh, Brian, l'm so sorry.

1050
01:27:25,585 --> 01:27:28,024
Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.

1051
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:30,461
Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.

1052
01:28:31,195 --> 01:28:32,595
Anything the matter?

1053
01:28:37,030 --> 01:28:38,830
What is it? What's happened?

1054
01:28:39,789 --> 01:28:42,709
Goddammit, l'm gonna have a baby!

1055
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:48,221
Well, aren't you gonna ask?

1056
01:28:48,538 --> 01:28:49,619
All right.

1057
01:28:50,257 --> 01:28:51,937
-Whose is it?
-l don't know.

1058
01:28:54,774 --> 01:28:56,213
l really don't know.

1059
01:28:56,891 --> 01:28:59,492
-What are you going to do?
-Obviously, l can't have it.

1060
01:29:01,007 --> 01:29:02,767
The doctor l went to said he'll do it.

1061
01:29:04,163 --> 01:29:06,123
But it's expensive. He has to...

1062
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,721
...bribe somebody or other
for some kind of...

1063
01:29:08,797 --> 01:29:11,318
...a certificate or something.
Oh, l don't know.

1064
01:29:12,593 --> 01:29:13,833
Well...

1065
01:29:13,913 --> 01:29:15,432
...there goes my fur coat.

1066
01:30:00,867 --> 01:30:02,507
l would like to marry you.

1067
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:10,300
-Okay, a touch of toothpaste.
-Naturally.

1068
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:11,815
A lot of gin.

1069
01:30:12,772 --> 01:30:14,613
All whooshed up together.

1070
01:30:16,289 --> 01:30:19,570
With this spiked prairie oyster,
l thee wed.

1071
01:30:20,207 --> 01:30:21,486
To the future.

1072
01:30:23,601 --> 01:30:25,802
With any luck,
l'll get a fellowship at King's.

1073
01:30:25,881 --> 01:30:27,520
Oh, dear, what's that?

1074
01:30:27,918 --> 01:30:29,519
My college at Cambridge.

1075
01:30:29,874 --> 01:30:32,595
-You'll absolutely love it there.
-l know l will.

1076
01:30:36,548 --> 01:30:38,388
-lt's crazy.
-Who?

1077
01:30:39,947 --> 01:30:42,787
Me. Wanting to be an actress.

1078
01:30:49,457 --> 01:30:52,138
l guess babies love you automatically,
don't they?

1079
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:57,170
They don't have much of a choice.

1080
01:31:02,763 --> 01:31:05,282
-To you and the baby.
-To me and the baby.

1081
01:31:11,194 --> 01:31:12,595
Probably is yours.

1082
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:16,269
But l don't suppose
we'll ever know for sure.

1083
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:20,185
So what?

1084
01:31:23,461 --> 01:31:25,142
You sure you don't mind?

1085
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:27,858
Honestly?

1086
01:31:28,654 --> 01:31:29,614
Honestly.

1087
01:31:33,812 --> 01:31:34,931
Oh, Bri....

1088
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:38,769
-To me and the baby.
-To you and the baby.

1089
01:31:43,362 --> 01:31:44,721
To you. You.

1090
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,161
Me? To me.

1091
01:31:47,558 --> 01:31:48,957
And the baby.

1092
01:31:53,792 --> 01:31:56,273
-Oh, where are you going?
-l'll be right back.

1093
01:31:59,987 --> 01:32:03,867
You are a most strange
and extraordinary person.

1094
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:05,180
l know, l know.

1095
01:32:12,853 --> 01:32:14,132
The proud father.

1096
01:33:09,434 --> 01:33:12,993
Good lord, Fritz.
You're on time. l can't believe it.

1097
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:15,870
How's Natalia?

1098
01:33:16,028 --> 01:33:18,308
Please, l do not speak of Natalia.

1099
01:33:19,304 --> 01:33:20,344
As bad as that?

1100
01:33:20,702 --> 01:33:21,622
Bad.

1101
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:24,221
Perhaps l cut myself at the throat.

1102
01:33:24,419 --> 01:33:26,459
Prepositions, Fritz, prepositions.

1103
01:33:26,817 --> 01:33:28,096
''ln the throat?''

1104
01:33:28,255 --> 01:33:29,894
No, just ''cut my throat.''

1105
01:33:30,973 --> 01:33:32,172
l assure you...

1106
01:33:33,569 --> 01:33:36,050
...they're all in it together.

1107
01:33:36,648 --> 01:33:40,929
lf all the Jews are bankers,
then how can they be Communists, too?

1108
01:33:41,763 --> 01:33:42,843
Subtle...

1109
01:33:42,882 --> 01:33:44,643
...very subtle, Fraulein Kost.

1110
01:33:45,318 --> 01:33:47,638
lf they can't destroy us one way...

1111
01:33:50,273 --> 01:33:51,832
...they try the other.

1112
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:55,269
You don't really believe that, do you?

1113
01:33:55,425 --> 01:33:58,305
But you read it every day
in the Volkischer Beobachter.

1114
01:33:59,585 --> 01:34:01,825
That ridiculous Nazi tripe!

1115
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:04,979
lt is an established fact, Herr Roberts...

1116
01:34:05,736 --> 01:34:10,095
...that there exists a well-organized
international conspiracy...

1117
01:34:10,492 --> 01:34:13,732
...of Jewish bankers and Communists.

1118
01:34:15,568 --> 01:34:18,129
lt's also an established fact,
that there exists...

1119
01:34:18,206 --> 01:34:21,685
...another well-organized group,
of which you're obviously a member.

1120
01:34:21,961 --> 01:34:24,920
The lnternational Conspiracy
of Horses' Asses.

1121
01:34:29,551 --> 01:34:31,272
l wish the Kaiser was back.

1122
01:34:32,108 --> 01:34:33,828
ln those days we had order.

1123
01:34:34,987 --> 01:34:38,428
l expect Schneider will raise my rent
after that little exhibition.

1124
01:34:39,261 --> 01:34:40,862
Oh, well, what the hell.

1125
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:43,940
Let's get on with these prepositions.

1126
01:34:44,016 --> 01:34:46,417
What a black day l'm meeting that girl!

1127
01:34:48,494 --> 01:34:50,173
l...l thought you loved her.

1128
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:52,970
Love, love,
who's needing verdammtes love?

1129
01:34:55,086 --> 01:34:57,006
You want to hear the big joke on me?

1130
01:34:57,205 --> 01:34:58,645
You want to hear it?

1131
01:35:00,842 --> 01:35:02,242
l am a Jew.

1132
01:35:03,517 --> 01:35:04,517
So?

1133
01:35:04,917 --> 01:35:06,556
To be a Jew in Germany?

1134
01:35:07,593 --> 01:35:09,394
Only a fool is this, l think.

1135
01:35:10,031 --> 01:35:10,952
So...

1136
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:13,751
...l come to Berlin and l'm not a Jew.

1137
01:35:15,185 --> 01:35:16,385
How did you manage that?

1138
01:35:17,105 --> 01:35:19,466
Where it says on my papers ''religion''...

1139
01:35:20,061 --> 01:35:22,622
...l am writing...''Protestant.''

1140
01:35:23,338 --> 01:35:25,258
So, the work comes.

1141
01:35:26,373 --> 01:35:27,654
The friends come.

1142
01:35:28,574 --> 01:35:29,854
The parties come.

1143
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:31,810
Parties.

1144
01:35:34,128 --> 01:35:37,288
Whoever dreams
that l shall fall in love with a Jewish girl?

1145
01:35:37,684 --> 01:35:39,803
But surely that solves your problem.

1146
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,320
-All you've got to do is tell her--
-Do you understand nothing?

1147
01:35:43,399 --> 01:35:44,399
This girl!

1148
01:35:47,352 --> 01:35:49,833
Do you know what she has done to me?

1149
01:35:50,629 --> 01:35:51,789
lt's terrible!

1150
01:35:54,226 --> 01:35:56,825
She has turned me into an honest man.

1151
01:35:58,263 --> 01:35:59,984
''Oh, you're good,'' she says.

1152
01:36:00,141 --> 01:36:03,101
''A man of integrity,
who will never lie to me.''

1153
01:36:07,654 --> 01:36:09,934
What does she do if l tell her now?

1154
01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:13,409
l tell you what she does,
if l tell her now.

1155
01:36:13,488 --> 01:36:15,448
She kicks me out into the streets.

1156
01:36:16,723 --> 01:36:19,564
Don't be silly! She'd understand.

1157
01:36:21,638 --> 01:36:23,279
Anyway, what have you got to lose?

1158
01:36:23,517 --> 01:36:26,998
What do l lose?
She kicks me out into the streets.

1159
01:36:27,234 --> 01:36:30,434
All my friends hear l'm a Jew,
they kick me out into the streets.

1160
01:36:30,510 --> 01:36:34,510
And then, l think, comes a big Nazi
with a club and bangs me on the head.

1161
01:36:38,221 --> 01:36:40,740
Fritz, l really think
you're underestimating Natalia.

1162
01:36:45,534 --> 01:36:46,814
What am l doing?

1163
01:36:47,931 --> 01:36:49,370
l don't like whiskey.

1164
01:36:50,332 --> 01:36:51,731
Look, just tell her.

1165
01:36:52,288 --> 01:36:54,047
No, l can't, l can't.

1166
01:36:55,524 --> 01:36:57,244
What a coward am l.

1167
01:37:12,906 --> 01:37:14,627
''l know what you're thinking.

1168
01:37:15,544 --> 01:37:17,544
''You wonder why l chose her

1169
01:37:18,181 --> 01:37:21,382
''Out of all the ladies in the world.

''lf you knew her like l do

1173

''l guarantee you would fall like l did.

1178

1182

''How can l speak of her virtues

Meine Damen und Herren,
mesdames et messieurs...

1193
01:39:52,944 --> 01:39:54,583
...ladies und gentlemen...

1194
01:39:55,022 --> 01:39:56,222
...l ask you...

1195
01:39:56,298 --> 01:39:58,659
...is it a crime to fall in love?

1196
01:39:59,856 --> 01:40:03,497
Can one ever choose
where the heart leads us?

1197
01:40:04,853 --> 01:40:07,853
All we ask is that you understand.

1198
01:40:08,969 --> 01:40:10,488
A little understanding.

1199
01:40:10,728 --> 01:40:14,568
Why can't the world live and let live?

1200
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:18,961
Live und let live.

1201
01:40:20,115 --> 01:40:23,355
''Oh, l understand your objection

1202

1207
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:27,270
Brian, anything wrong?

1208
01:42:30,105 --> 01:42:31,466
Lazy that's all.

1209
01:42:32,024 --> 01:42:33,264
That's all?

1210
01:42:34,103 --> 01:42:35,182
That's all.

1211
01:42:50,805 --> 01:42:52,125
Look what l found.

1212
01:42:54,081 --> 01:42:55,041
See?

1213
01:42:56,278 --> 01:42:57,557
We must be lucky.

1214
01:43:09,145 --> 01:43:11,904
Will you still love me
when l'm blown up like a balloon?

1215
01:43:11,984 --> 01:43:14,224
Will my body drive you
wild with desire?

1216
01:43:21,252 --> 01:43:22,653
Sure. Why not?

1217
01:43:28,207 --> 01:43:31,487
Oh, Bri, it's fantastic, isn't it?
Just think:

1218
01:43:31,802 --> 01:43:33,643
Your life and my life...

1219
01:43:34,599 --> 01:43:37,279
...solved in one fell swoop.
And all by the baby!

1220
01:43:39,314 --> 01:43:43,314
l guess it's just about the most significant
baby the world has ever known...

1221
01:43:44,248 --> 01:43:45,689
...since Jesus.

1222
01:43:49,064 --> 01:43:52,223
lt'll be a most strange
and extraordinary baby, won't it?

1223
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:28,720
Good morning, darling.

1224
01:45:35,227 --> 01:45:38,227
Darling, would you mind seeing
if there's a bit of brandy left?

1225
01:45:38,855 --> 01:45:41,055
Put an egg in it,
and we'll call it breakfast.

1226
01:45:44,471 --> 01:45:46,912
l suppose you wonder
what on earth happened to me?

1227
01:45:48,054 --> 01:45:50,373
l'm afraid we made a night of it.

1228
01:46:08,115 --> 01:46:09,595
Where's your fur coat?

1229
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,921
You did it, didn't you?

1230
01:46:17,395 --> 01:46:18,676
Did what, darling?

1231
01:46:19,604 --> 01:46:20,764
The abortion.

1232
01:46:27,467 --> 01:46:28,748
ln God's name...

1233
01:46:31,049 --> 01:46:32,009
...why?

1234
01:46:36,461 --> 01:46:37,742
One of my whims?

1235
01:46:42,370 --> 01:46:44,130
ls that all you can say?

1236
01:46:45,118 --> 01:46:46,477
''One of my whims?''

1237
01:46:46,742 --> 01:46:47,782
What right...?

1238
01:46:47,863 --> 01:46:50,943
lf you wanna hit me,
why don't you just hit me?

1239
01:46:59,103 --> 01:47:00,383
But you wanted it.

1240
01:47:03,098 --> 01:47:04,178
Didn't you?

1241
01:47:11,463 --> 01:47:12,743
Me and the baby.

1242
01:47:15,669 --> 01:47:18,748
l suppose Max Reinhardt
did show up at the club.

1243
01:47:18,958 --> 01:47:21,638
Or was it a friend of a friend
of a friend of...

1244
01:47:21,871 --> 01:47:26,031
...an assistant director who said he'd
try to squeeze you into the chorus line?

1245
01:47:26,241 --> 01:47:28,201
That is, of course, if you...

1246
01:47:29,528 --> 01:47:30,847
...if you went to bed with him.

1247
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,241
-You think that?
-Yes.

1248
01:47:39,727 --> 01:47:41,487
Well then, it's just as well, isn't it?

1249
01:47:41,851 --> 01:47:43,651
For you, for everyone.

1250
01:47:45,763 --> 01:47:49,362
And, darling, would you be an angel
and just let me get some sleep?

1251
01:48:00,869 --> 01:48:02,390
Tell me why you did it.

1252
01:48:06,782 --> 01:48:09,462
What is there to say?
You've said it all in one way or another.

1253
01:48:10,570 --> 01:48:11,770
Sally, please.

1254
01:48:13,775 --> 01:48:14,974
l have to know.

1255
01:48:17,145 --> 01:48:18,105
Okay.

1256
01:48:22,432 --> 01:48:24,791
l'm self-centered, inconsiderate...

1257
01:48:27,633 --> 01:48:29,354
...and what was the third adjective?

1258
01:48:29,674 --> 01:48:30,674
Oh, yes.

1259
01:48:30,964 --> 01:48:33,564
And l have this infantile fantasy...

1260
01:48:34,086 --> 01:48:37,406
...that one day l'll amount
to something as an actress.

1261
01:48:42,702 --> 01:48:45,141
A dinky little cottage in Cambridge?

1262
01:48:45,907 --> 01:48:49,107
A playpen in the bedroom,
diapers on the towel rack....

1263
01:48:51,401 --> 01:48:54,842
How soon would it be
before we started hating each other?

1264
01:48:56,523 --> 01:48:59,643
How soon would it be before
l started dashing out...

1265
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:03,013
...disgracing myself at some nearest pub?

1266
01:49:03,096 --> 01:49:05,136
And how soon would it be before...?

1267
01:49:10,131 --> 01:49:11,171
Before?

1268
01:49:14,293 --> 01:49:15,493
Say it.

1269
01:49:16,669 --> 01:49:17,669
Go on!

1270
01:49:18,622 --> 01:49:20,342
You might as well, now.

1271
01:49:20,830 --> 01:49:21,990
Forget it.

1272
01:49:22,951 --> 01:49:24,151
Just forget it.

1273
01:49:26,862 --> 01:49:27,902
l see.

1274
01:49:38,350 --> 01:49:40,071
l really do love you.

1275
01:49:41,598 --> 01:49:43,518
Yes. Yes, l think...

1276
01:49:46,301 --> 01:49:48,021
...l think you do love me.

1277
01:49:55,501 --> 01:49:56,940
You...you all right?

1278
01:50:01,367 --> 01:50:03,048
ls there anything l can...

1279
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:06,479
...do for you?

1280
01:50:10,650 --> 01:50:13,130
l just think l should sleep a little while.

1281
01:50:33,251 --> 01:50:34,810
Oh, shit!

1282
01:50:37,831 --> 01:50:38,791
Magazines?

1283
01:50:39,786 --> 01:50:40,587
No.

1284
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:42,200
lt's a long trip.

1285
01:50:46,945 --> 01:50:47,945
Chocolate?

1286
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:50,240
No.
