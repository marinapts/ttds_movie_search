<i>On December 26th, 2004,
the deadliest tsunami</i>

4
00:01:01,606 --> 00:01:04,655
<i>on record hit the South
East Coast of Asia.</i>

5
00:01:05,557 --> 00:01:10,713
<i>The lives of countless families all
over the world changed forever.</i>

6
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:21,316
<i>This is the true story of
one of those families.</i>

7
00:02:13,076 --> 00:02:14,281
Oh God!

8
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:21,235
- ...Did you set the alarm before we left?
- Yes, that was the last thing I did.

9
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:28,734
No, I was the last one to leave.

10
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:31,425
I was the last one to leave
and I'm sure I didn't set it.

11
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,065
No darling, I was the last one out.

12
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:36,038
and I did, I promise.

13
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:38,000
Are you sure?

14
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:39,805
- Yeah.
- Okay.

15
00:02:43,586 --> 00:02:46,241
No no, I was the last one
'cause I went back in.

16
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:48,286
And that means the alarm is not set.

17
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:49,606
Cause I didn't set it.

18
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:51,427
Well, I guess that means
that we be coming home

19
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:53,119
to a large bunch of hippies...

20
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,517
...sleeping in our bed.

21
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,157
Well, just like your old college days.

22
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:01,500
It's alright, it's fine.
It's just turbulence Maria.

23
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,300
<i>Please Turn Off Electronic Devices.</i>

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,848
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we are about
to begin our descent to the airport.</i>

25
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:10,592
<i>The local time is 1:30 in the afternoon...</i>

26
00:03:10,593 --> 00:03:13,005
What are you doing? It's time to set down,
we are about to lend darling.

27
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,494
Lucas won't talk to me.

28
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,345
<i>Please fasten your seatbelts...</i>

29
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:18,350
<i>...and return your seat to
the upright position.</i>

30
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:19,708
Take my seat.

31
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:22,979
What did I do? I didn't do anything.

32
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:25,171
It's all right, just sit down
and stop worrying.

33
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:26,661
Buckle up!

34
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,911
Sit down please ma'am.

35
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,741
Lucas.

36
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,067
- Lucas.
- What?!

37
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:42,728
You know you could try being a bit nicer
to your brother, he's just scared.

38
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:45,545
What else is new, everything scares him.

39
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:51,157
I wonder who it takes off that.

40
00:04:08,412 --> 00:04:15,565
<i>KHAOLAK, THAILAND CHRISTMAS EVE</i>

41
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,268
Take your stuff, don't forget any bags.

42
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:22,903
Have you been to Khaolak before?

43
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:24,632
No, it's our first time.

44
00:04:24,777 --> 00:04:26,886
This is the best holiday season ever.

45
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:30,468
From dawn to dusk (?),
this area is very quiet.

46
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:31,674
Great for families.

47
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:35,043
The archipel (?) is brand new,
which just opened a week ago.

48
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:36,200
- You'll love it here.
- All right.

49
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:41,107
I'm sorry, but we made a booking
on the third floor, the sea view (?).

50
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:43,307
I know. We are sorry, that was a mistake.

51
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:47,166
But we feel that you
might love this better.

52
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:50,736
- Where do you come?
- Japan.

53
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:52,718
You don't look Japanese.

54
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:56,519
I work for a big company there,
and we moved around a lot, you know.

55
00:04:56,904 --> 00:04:58,844
And you, you don't work?

56
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:00,545
I'm a doctor.

57
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:03,791
Not practising right now.
Just taking care of the kids.

58
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:06,372
I see, you got promoted.

59
00:05:10,588 --> 00:05:11,834
<i>That's nice!</i>

60
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,414
- Mom!
- Yes.

61
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,137
Can I have one of these, please?

62
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:16,815
Lucas, if you are
thirsty, would you just...

63
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,834
- Drink water.
- Exactly.

64
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:23,685
- Boys, come and see this.
- Come on.

65
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:24,621
Look.

66
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:30,683
Isn't it great?

67
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:34,086
- Dad, can we swim there?
- Yeah, we could go swimming, yeah.

68
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:18,623
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

69
00:06:18,648 --> 00:06:22,663
<i>...eight, seven, six...</i>

70
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:25,954
<i>...five, four, three...</i>

71
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:28,406
<i>...two, one!</i>

72
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:50,807
Look, mine is coming up.

73
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:53,106
- Is it?
- Is it? It is going up.

74
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:56,576
It's going a different
way than the others.

75
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:04,142
- It's catching up.
- Yeah, it's catching up.

76
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:17,690
Good morning. Good morning.

77
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:22,331
- Wake up!
- What are you doing?

78
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:24,170
It's Christmas!

79
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:27,682
It's Christmas morning.

80
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,329
- I want to go outside!
- No, no, no.

81
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:37,400
- Here I go!
- Wait, one at a time!

82
00:08:39,271 --> 00:08:40,642
What is it?

83
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:44,374
Wow, a telescope. It's a
complete novastar that you

84
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,259
can stick on the ceiling,
the all moving way. (?)

85
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:51,393
Oh look, a scarf! I love it!

86
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:56,629
Thank you darling.
I mean Santa Claus.

87
00:08:56,762 --> 00:08:58,423
What about you man? A ball?

88
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:09,133
Goal, yes!

89
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:08,437
I can't get sleep.

90
00:10:15,803 --> 00:10:19,885
- ???
- Yeah. Sure.

91
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:25,990
Can we go outside and watch the stars?

92
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:29,371
Maybe tomorrow.

93
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:36,305
<i>Close your eyes and
think of something nice.</i>

94
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:02,152
Mom, come play ball with me!

95
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:03,851
In a minute, dear, play with Lucas.

96
00:11:14,109 --> 00:11:17,466
- I can't believe you. (?)
- What?

97
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,982
I hide that thing and I forget
where I put it.

98
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:23,728
I was just checking to see, uh,
the home (???) over in Japan.

99
00:11:23,853 --> 00:11:25,499
Liar.

100
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,594
I got a text saying that O'Neil

101
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:37,167
she's been given an two-year extension
on this contract.

102
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:39,298
Which means that the two of us are
doing the same job.

103
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,552
- That can only mean one thing.
- They can't fire you.

104
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:45,763
That would be too expensive. Don't worry.

105
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:49,844
Well I do worry. Because we can't
afford to lose this job, can we?

106
00:11:57,743 --> 00:12:00,270
I can go back to work.

107
00:12:00,614 --> 00:12:03,585
- Maybe it's time.
- In Japan?

108
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:04,741
No.

109
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:07,440
Oh, you want to go home?

110
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:10,082
It's not the worst idea, is it?

111
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:19,235
Well, you should think about it. But I'm
going to play with the boys now so...

112
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:35,619
- This is awful!
- Awful, I'll give you awful.

113
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:44,601
Catch it!

114
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,572
Oh no, go get it Lucas!

115
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:54,524
Henry, the boys!

116
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,863
- Lucas!
- Dad!

117
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,887
Lucas!

118
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:36,771
Mom!

119
00:15:42,884 --> 00:15:44,780
Lucas!

120
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:57,361
- Lucas!
- Mom, help me!

121
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:05,421
Get me out of here!

122
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:18,517
Mom!

123
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:21,120
Lucas, stay there.

124
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:26,588
Stop!

125
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:32,319
Give me your hand!

126
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:39,431
Hold on to that!

127
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:43,656
Lucas!

128
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,408
Mom!

129
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:57,636
- I wanted to help!
- Get my hand!

130
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:13,422
Come on.

131
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,833
Lucas!

132
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:45,839
Lucas!

133
00:19:04,504 --> 00:19:07,316
Mom! Dad!

134
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:20,764
Mom, Mom.

135
00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:34,862
Mom!

136
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:42,647
Please.

137
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:46,977
Never do that to me again mom.

138
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:52,319
- Never do that to me again mom.
- I'm here.

139
00:19:57,274 --> 00:19:59,331
All right. I'm here.

140
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:07,967
- Hung up that tree, that tree over there.
- Yes, yes.

141
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:10,941
That is perfect. That is perfect.

142
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,319
Be careful, Lucas.
No, don't move.

143
00:20:20,992 --> 00:20:23,577
Stay very still.

144
00:20:26,663 --> 00:20:30,853
I was a brave kid mom but I was scared.

145
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,375
I'm scared too.

146
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:57,187
Where is everybody?

147
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:08,705
I don't know.
I don't know.

148
00:22:01,402 --> 00:22:03,287
Mom.

149
00:22:07,643 --> 00:22:09,521
What?

150
00:22:09,638 --> 00:22:14,745
- You're bleeding mom.
- Oh my God!

151
00:22:38,948 --> 00:22:40,377
It's okay.

152
00:22:40,378 --> 00:22:47,320
- I can't see you like this.
- It's okay. - I'm sorry.

153
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,320
You go first.

154
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,966
The tree there, the big one.

155
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:36,878
Do you think we can climb it?

156
00:24:06,765 --> 00:24:09,160
Okay, let's go.

157
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,400
<i>Dad</i>

158
00:24:27,307 --> 00:24:28,473
<i>Dad</i>

159
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:32,292
Wait. Did you hear that?

160
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:35,216
- Mom, there's nothing we can do.
- Wait.

161
00:24:35,217 --> 00:24:37,362
We are almost there.
We have to get to safety.

162
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:38,987
No, we have to help the child.

163
00:24:38,988 --> 00:24:41,658
Mom, if another wave catches us
down here, we will die.

164
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:44,146
We have to climb that tree right now.

165
00:24:44,362 --> 00:24:45,918
Come on.

166
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:50,690
- Where are you?
- Mom, look at you, we need help!

167
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:53,782
We cannot risk it.

168
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:57,914
We can't risk it mom. Come on.

169
00:24:58,547 --> 00:24:59,390
Listen.

170
00:25:01,194 --> 00:25:04,934
What if that boy was Simon or Thomas?

171
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:07,141
What if they needed help?

172
00:25:07,142 --> 00:25:08,989
You'll want someone to
help them, wouldn't we?

173
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,836
Simon and Thomas are dead!

174
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:32,353
Even if it's the last thing we do.

175
00:25:37,781 --> 00:25:39,979
Where are you?

176
00:25:42,994 --> 00:25:44,100
<i>Dad</i>

177
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:53,175
Look there, Mom, I see.

178
00:26:05,368 --> 00:26:06,180
Are you okay?

179
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:12,039
Okay, okay.

180
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,092
What's your name?

181
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,216
I'm Lucas, what's your name?

182
00:26:22,217 --> 00:26:24,420
- Daniel.
- Okay, Daniel.

183
00:26:24,421 --> 00:26:26,872
You'll be okay, we gonna
get you out, okay?

184
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:28,620
Lift him.

185
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:32,442
It's all right. It's all right.

186
00:26:34,274 --> 00:26:35,380
Are you okay?

187
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:11,842
All right.

188
00:27:13,138 --> 00:27:14,219
Are you okay?

189
00:27:16,128 --> 00:27:20,174
Its okay. Don't worry.
Okay, okay.

190
00:27:21,155 --> 00:27:23,507
Don't move. I'll be back.

191
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,932
Mom, I'm coming down,
just give me a second.

192
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:34,739
No, I can do it.

193
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,782
- Mom, I'm coming down.
- I can do it, Lucas!

194
00:27:38,228 --> 00:27:40,824
Just stay there, please.

195
00:27:56,993 --> 00:27:59,100
Mom. Mom.

196
00:29:34,664 --> 00:29:36,659
Thank you.

197
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:08,467
Did you hear that?

198
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:19,885
Moma, look. They are coming for us.

199
00:33:19,886 --> 00:33:22,601
Hey, over here!

200
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:26,172
Hey!

201
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:29,157
Climb down, Lucas.

202
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,883
No, no, no!

203
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:26,802
- Lucas?
- Mom, I'm here.

204
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:57,862
Thank you.

205
00:36:06,023 --> 00:36:09,957
Thank you. Thank you.

206
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:15,937
Thank you. Thank you so much.

207
00:36:21,718 --> 00:36:26,887
My boys. I can no longer see them.
My boys.

208
00:36:33,572 --> 00:36:35,258
My boys.

209
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:08,763
Do not let them take me
anywhere without you.

210
00:37:08,764 --> 00:37:11,843
Don't worry Mom.
I will not leave you alone. I promise.

211
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,273
All right, come on.

212
00:37:20,453 --> 00:37:23,043
Where is Daniel? What about Daniel?

213
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:23,453
Daniel?

214
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:25,438
Lucas, where is Daniel?

215
00:37:27,263 --> 00:37:28,411
I don't know.

216
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:45,074
Thank you.

217
00:40:00,724 --> 00:40:04,579
- It's very cold in here.
- It's not cold, Mom.

218
00:40:09,837 --> 00:40:11,321
Mom.

219
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:14,654
Mom, what's wrong?

220
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,825
I need some antibiotics.
Look in the cupboard.

221
00:40:23,643 --> 00:40:26,511
I can't read the labels.
They are in Thai.

222
00:40:26,828 --> 00:40:29,721
It got to be in English
and look at the side.

223
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:30,877
Look carefully.

224
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,817
Oh, thank God.

225
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,279
See that boy?

226
00:40:41,294 --> 00:40:44,064
I'm all he's got in the world.
Do you understand?

227
00:40:44,438 --> 00:40:48,417
I'm a doctor too.
I'm bleeding. You've got to stop it.

228
00:40:48,418 --> 00:40:51,036
Please, I need some antibiotics.

229
00:40:51,037 --> 00:40:52,192
Please help.

230
00:41:18,132 --> 00:41:22,347
- Are you okay?
- I lost my husband and two children.

231
00:41:25,629 --> 00:41:27,256
If something happens to me...

232
00:41:59,762 --> 00:42:01,299
What color is it?

233
00:42:01,529 --> 00:42:04,480
- What?
- My leg?

234
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,532
- Is it still red?
- Yes, it's still red.

235
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:14,581
- What does it mean?
- It's good.

236
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:17,593
As long as it doesn't turn black.

237
00:42:22,338 --> 00:42:26,464
You need to eat something. Eat it.

238
00:42:33,165 --> 00:42:38,273
- So bossy.
- I wonder who I take after.

239
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:52,431
Hello.

240
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,679
What's your name?

241
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:04,838
My name is Maria. And this is my
son Lucas. What's your name?

242
00:43:11,187 --> 00:43:15,090
Hey, give her some tangerine.

243
00:43:16,156 --> 00:43:18,414
She must be starving.

244
00:43:28,568 --> 00:43:29,812
Be careful.

245
00:43:34,137 --> 00:43:36,596
Turn your head to the side please.
You'll choke if you don't.

246
00:43:38,317 --> 00:43:40,702
Please, please she needs help.

247
00:43:40,703 --> 00:43:43,243
- Turn her head.
- Help her, Lucas, help her.

248
00:43:51,058 --> 00:43:52,818
Mom, are you okay?

249
00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:55,909
Mom, Mom are you okay?

250
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,180
What are you doing?

251
00:43:58,305 --> 00:43:59,583
Mom, are you okay?

252
00:44:04,003 --> 00:44:05,926
Stop it, Mom, that's enough!

253
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:08,439
Mom, stop it! Mom!

254
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:12,791
Mom, Stop it!

255
00:44:54,488 --> 00:44:57,845
Francesca! Francesca!

256
00:45:15,567 --> 00:45:22,133
Lucas, look at this place.
They're so busy in here.

257
00:45:23,143 --> 00:45:25,569
You got to go and do something.

258
00:45:26,855 --> 00:45:29,601
Go help people.
You're good at it.

259
00:45:30,257 --> 00:45:35,894
- What do you want me to do?
- Just one thing. Anything.

260
00:45:38,662 --> 00:45:39,674
Will you be alright?

261
00:45:39,815 --> 00:45:44,768
Come on, Lucas!
I'm not going anywhere.

262
00:45:46,823 --> 00:45:49,119
- I promise.
- Okay.

263
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:23,541
It's your family?

264
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,680
- Are you looking for your family?
- Have you seen them?

265
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:32,471
Okay, calm down!
I will help you. Okay?

266
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,855

Wow, no, you have to stay here,

00:55:30,321 --> 00:55:31,427
Fuck.

329
00:55:32,688 --> 00:55:34,249
Lucas!

330
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:40,062
Maria!

331
00:57:09,765 --> 00:57:11,696
Hey man! Are you all right?

332
00:57:11,697 --> 00:57:14,115
I just need a minute.

333
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,502
I'll be up in a second.

334
00:57:17,503 --> 00:57:20,959
Don't even bother, they are sending
trucks to the mountains.

335
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,097
Just hold on tight, okay?
They'll be here soon.

336
00:57:22,098 --> 00:57:23,234
Yes, I know.

337
00:57:24,305 --> 00:57:27,964
- Can you tell them I'm back?
- Yeah, sure. Hold on.

338
00:57:33,723 --> 00:57:36,733
<i>Hey boys, your dad is back!</i>

339
00:57:36,734 --> 00:57:39,661
<i> - Dad! Dad!
- Dad! </i>

340
00:57:39,662 --> 00:57:41,987
- Dad!
- Dad!

341
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:43,566
Hey!

342
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:46,096
A lot of (?)
helicopters just flew by.

343
00:57:46,523 --> 00:57:47,723
- Did they?
- Yeah!

344
00:57:47,724 --> 00:57:49,416
Mom and Lucas...

345
00:57:51,482 --> 00:57:53,678
Why don't you come
down a minute, Thomas?

346
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:54,703
What about me?

347
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:57,663
You stay and see if you can see
any more helicopters, that's okay?

348
00:57:57,664 --> 00:57:59,378
- Okay.
- Good boy.

349
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:03,986
You're almost there, buddy.

350
00:58:05,067 --> 00:58:06,242
Got it?

351
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:13,470
Oh, my God!

352
00:58:16,044 --> 00:58:18,087
I still haven't find them.

353
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:21,221
Did you see a lot of dead people?

354
00:58:24,427 --> 00:58:26,678
I'm just very serious, Thomas.

355
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:30,445
- Not mom and Lucas, right?
- No, I didn't see them.

356
00:58:32,381 --> 00:58:36,549
I bumped my feet on the
reef, that was really hot.

357
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,711
Everyone was leaving.

358
00:58:38,712 --> 00:58:39,867
Can we leave yet?

359
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,025
I need you to...

360
00:58:46,762 --> 00:58:48,547
I need you to do me a favor, Thomas.

361
00:58:49,907 --> 00:58:53,297
Everyone going to the mountains,
shelter, to be safe.

362
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,100
but I can't go with you.

363
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:01,831
You can't leave us alone again, Dad.

364
00:59:01,832 --> 00:59:04,010
I have to keep looking for them, you see?

365
00:59:04,011 --> 00:59:05,859
- You have to look after Simon.
- No!

366
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:09,560
No, stay with us, I can't look...

367
00:59:09,561 --> 00:59:12,116
I have never looked after someone before.

368
00:59:12,117 --> 00:59:14,331
- I'm scared.
- I know, I know.

369
00:59:15,478 --> 00:59:17,056
I'm scared too.

370
00:59:19,388 --> 00:59:23,057
But you know, you know, the most
scary bit for me...

371
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:27,202
- When the water hit.
- No.

372
00:59:28,109 --> 00:59:31,525
After that, when I
came up, I was on my own.

373
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,496
That was the scariest part.

374
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,246
And then I saw the two of
you climbing to the tree.

375
00:59:38,286 --> 00:59:41,410
I didn't feel so scared anymore.
I knew I wasn't on my own. You see?

376
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:46,438
What if Mommy and Lucas
are on their own right now...

377
00:59:47,521 --> 00:59:49,075
Imagine how scared they'll be.

378
00:59:49,076 --> 00:59:51,289
- We'll look for them-
- No!

379
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:54,848
Thomas, you have to look after Simon.

380
00:59:55,399 --> 00:59:57,501
And I'm going to keep looking for them.

381
00:59:58,987 --> 01:00:00,498
Okay?

382
01:00:02,921 --> 01:00:04,250
Okay?

383
01:00:06,262 --> 01:00:08,309
Now (do ?) you understand?

384
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:37,508
Hello.

385
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:39,567
Yeah, I hear you.

386
01:00:41,858 --> 01:00:43,573
Are you alright? Have you lost someone?

387
01:00:43,597 --> 01:00:45,774
We're fine. We just want
to get out of here.

388
01:00:49,273 --> 01:00:51,876
Excuse me. I've been trying
to place a call back home.

389
01:00:51,877 --> 01:00:53,777
I wonder if I could use
your phone? It will be very quick.

390
01:00:53,778 --> 01:00:57,144
Look around you man, everybody's
needing something right now.

391
01:00:57,145 --> 01:00:59,310
Our battery is almost dead,
and we need the phone.

392
01:01:16,178 --> 01:01:18,279
I'll see you in the morning. Okay?

393
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,998
- You're not you coming?
- No, I'm not coming.

394
01:01:21,486 --> 01:01:23,541
Thomas will take care of you, all right?

395
01:01:24,327 --> 01:01:27,445
Listen to me, you can
behave yourselves, okay?

396
01:01:27,446 --> 01:01:30,562
You need to stay with this group.

397
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:33,377
And I'm going to be with you just
as soon as I can. Okay?

398
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,562
You gonna behave yourselves. Okay?

399
01:01:38,347 --> 01:01:39,475
I love you.

400
01:01:43,464 --> 01:01:45,599
Will you look out for my
boys for me? Please.

401
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,399
Come with us.

402
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,718
You know it's useless.

403
01:01:50,188 --> 01:01:51,423
I can't stop looking.

404
01:01:56,114 --> 01:01:58,918
I love you. I'll see you
tomorrow, I promise.

405
01:01:59,513 --> 01:02:00,659
I love you.

406
01:02:20,839 --> 01:02:22,937
<i>Maria</i>

407
01:02:25,354 --> 01:02:27,337
<i>Lucas </i>

408
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:38,466
<i>Maria</i>

409
01:03:01,295 --> 01:03:02,231
Oh no!

410
01:03:18,984 --> 01:03:21,131
Hey man, are you okay?

411
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,385
Get in the car. We will drive
you somewhere safer.

412
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,000
My wife didn't want to come
to Thailand for Christmas holidays.

413
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,600
Because of my leg.

414
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,650
I insisted, my little girl Gina.

415
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,001
She's just two.

416
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,800
The noise woke me up.

417
01:03:55,236 --> 01:03:56,657
I was alone in the room.

418
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:02,407
I went out to the terrace and saw the
sea coming in land.

419
01:04:05,406 --> 01:04:09,079
It took me five seconds to reach the
stairs, but the water was already there.

420
01:04:09,793 --> 01:04:12,578
It was not more than five seconds.

421
01:04:12,906 --> 01:04:19,599
On the bed, I found a note from my
wife saying they were at the beach.

422
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:28,085
- You were at the hotel, right?
- Yeah.

423
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:35,730
My whole family was around the
swimming-pool when the water hit.

424
01:04:39,093 --> 01:04:42,530
I found my middle son first, Thomas, he
was on top of this really tall tree.

425
01:04:44,478 --> 01:04:45,936
It took me forever to
convince him to come down.

426
01:04:45,937 --> 01:04:47,550
Because he was so scared, you know.

427
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:53,689
And I found my little one, Simon,
he was holding on top of a palmtree.

428
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:55,953
He's only five.

429
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,417
I sent them to the mountains.

430
01:05:04,453 --> 01:05:08,508
You know. So I can keep looking
for my wife and my oldest son.

431
01:05:12,573 --> 01:05:15,001
Toughest decision I ever made.

432
01:05:15,337 --> 01:05:18,593
- Have you called home yet?
- I can't find a phone.

433
01:05:25,617 --> 01:05:29,404
I'm saving my battery,
just in case, my family calls.

434
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:31,674
Please.

435
01:05:32,712 --> 01:05:35,783
Thank you. It will be
very quick, I promise.

436
01:05:46,685 --> 01:05:48,557
<i> - Yes?
- Bry? </i>

437
01:05:48,558 --> 01:05:51,498
<i>Yes Henry, thank God, how are you?</i>

438
01:05:52,461 --> 01:05:55,369
<i>- Did you hear from anyone yet?
- No Henry, you're the first call. </i>

439
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:59,551
<i>Is everyone all right?...
Henry?</i>

440
01:05:59,552 --> 01:06:01,199
Maria and Lucas are not here.

441
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,003
<i>What do you mean, not there?</i>

442
01:06:04,504 --> 01:06:06,682
The wave came and swept everyone away.

443
01:06:08,283 --> 01:06:11,836
I found Thomas and Simon,
but not Maria and Lucas! ...

444
01:06:15,419 --> 01:06:19,065
I don't know what to do or where to look!

445
01:06:20,293 --> 01:06:23,293
<i>Henry. Calm down!</i>

446
01:06:23,294 --> 01:06:26,652
I have to go. Many people
need this phone, okay?

447
01:06:27,538 --> 01:06:29,446
<i>- I'll call you later.
- Henry? </i>

448
01:06:45,856 --> 01:06:47,985
Sorry, sorry.

449
01:06:49,689 --> 01:06:50,511
Thank you.

450
01:07:04,673 --> 01:07:08,033
- What do you want me to do?
- You can't leave it like that.

451
01:07:08,549 --> 01:07:12,236
<i>- Go on, come on.
- Go on!</i>

452
01:07:14,694 --> 01:07:17,460
<i>Come on man, come on.</i>

453
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,284
I should call him back.

454
01:07:29,548 --> 01:07:31,746
<i> - Yes, Henry?
- Bry, it's me again. Look... </i>

455
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:34,939
I promise I won't stop
looking until I find them.

456
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:35,777
<i> - Okay?
- Okay. </i>

457
01:07:35,778 --> 01:07:37,900
I don't know what to do,
because it's nighttime.

458
01:07:38,693 --> 01:07:41,693
I'll look in all hospitals,
I'll look in all shelters.

459
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,375
I will find them, I promise you that.

460
01:07:44,376 --> 01:07:45,764
<i>- I'll call you when I do.
- Okay.</i>

461
01:07:45,765 --> 01:07:47,585
<i>- Okay. All right.
- Okay.</i>

462
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:51,885
Thanks.

463
01:07:56,586 --> 01:07:58,171
Can I go with you?

464
01:08:13,912 --> 01:08:16,357
I'm afraid.

465
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:18,801
Close of you eyes,
think of something nice.

466
01:08:29,616 --> 01:08:31,438
May I sit with you?

467
01:08:48,656 --> 01:08:49,988
How old are you?

468
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:56,280
Almost seventy-four. And you?

469
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,002
Seven and a half.

470
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:02,795
Can you cover me?

471
01:09:03,278 --> 01:09:06,408
- Is he alright?
- Yeah, he just have trouble sleeping.

472
01:09:06,781 --> 01:09:09,673
With a blanket on him, he's alright.

473
01:09:15,853 --> 01:09:17,559
You like looking at stars, don't you?

474
01:09:18,694 --> 01:09:21,977
I do, (?)
constellations.

475
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:25,378
Here, the sky is different.

476
01:09:28,236 --> 01:09:33,845
Some of those stars have been
burned out for a long, long time.

477
01:09:35,449 --> 01:09:36,399
Did you know that?

478
01:09:38,744 --> 01:09:39,821
They're dead, aren't they?

479
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:48,709
They're dead, but once
they were so bright...

480
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:52,589
That their light is still
travelling through space.

481
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:55,348
And we can still see them.

482
01:09:56,433 --> 01:09:59,216
How can you know which one
is dead and which is not?

483
01:09:59,676 --> 01:10:01,932
You can't, it's impossible.

484
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:09,900
It's a beautiful mystery, isn't it?

485
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,031
Lucas Bennett, can you come with me?

486
01:10:47,072 --> 01:10:48,847
Sit here.

487
01:11:05,892 --> 01:11:08,334
Your name is Lucas Bennett, is that right?

488
01:11:09,872 --> 01:11:13,122
- Yeah.
- And your mother's name is Maria Bennett?

489
01:11:13,123 --> 01:11:14,772
Is that correct?

490
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:18,697
We would like you to look
look at those things

491
01:11:18,698 --> 01:11:21,084
please and see if you
recognize any of them?

492
01:11:22,196 --> 01:11:23,330
Have a good look.

493
01:11:26,337 --> 01:11:28,209
Take your time.

494
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:48,987
- Anything look familiar?
- I don't know.

495
01:11:50,202 --> 01:11:51,979
You don't know?

496
01:12:00,485 --> 01:12:04,323
- Do you recognize anything?
- I don't think so.

497
01:12:04,426 --> 01:12:06,312
You don't think so?

498
01:12:10,102 --> 01:12:11,298
Lucas?

499
01:12:15,078 --> 01:12:17,235
Could you please come with us?

500
01:12:34,268 --> 01:12:35,467
Mom.

501
01:12:42,045 --> 01:12:45,933
- Where have you been you?
- Where the hell I have been?

502
01:12:47,249 --> 01:12:51,902
Where the hell were you? You promised
me you weren't going anywhere.

503
01:12:57,059 --> 01:12:58,436
I thought you were dead, Mom.

504
01:13:01,553 --> 01:13:05,801
- Sorry.
- I thought you were dead.

505
01:13:13,384 --> 01:13:15,436
We're so sorry.

506
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:21,613
Someone must have changed
her (?) during surgery.

507
01:13:22,096 --> 01:13:23,600
How is she?

508
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:32,402
He had surgery in her
chest, but she lost a lot of blood.

509
01:13:32,882 --> 01:13:35,855
He was too weak
to have her leg operated on.

510
01:13:36,528 --> 01:13:39,810
She has to go back to
surgery when she recovers.

511
01:13:40,102 --> 01:13:42,586
But she'll be okay, right?

512
01:14:52,222 --> 01:14:54,688
Nothing. What next?

513
01:14:55,896 --> 01:14:59,416
We should try to get a ride
and go to this hospital.

514
01:15:23,823 --> 01:15:25,891
- Where are my kids?
- They took them away.

515
01:15:25,892 --> 01:15:28,118
- They didn't let me go with them. Sorry.
- Where?

516
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:29,273
I don't know.

517
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:52,826
- I need to pee.
- You have to wait, Simon.

518
01:17:26,429 --> 01:17:29,285
Mom... Mom. Wake up.

519
01:17:30,473 --> 01:17:32,767
Mom, guess who I saw out there outside.

520
01:17:33,209 --> 01:17:36,365
My leg. How is my leg?

521
01:17:50,228 --> 01:17:51,337
Still red.

522
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:16,586
Please, my mom.
Her wound are looking very bad.

523
01:18:19,414 --> 01:18:21,623
We're doing the best we can.

524
01:18:21,648 --> 01:18:25,005
We are taking your mom to
surgery right away.

525
01:18:43,887 --> 01:18:46,988
No, no, five minutes.
Give me five minutes, please.

526
01:18:48,564 --> 01:18:51,167
I don't want you to slow down.

527
01:18:53,149 --> 01:18:56,475
These are the names of my little
girl Ginna and Katie, my wife.

528
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:57,920
She's American. Will you
check the list for me?

529
01:18:57,921 --> 01:18:59,350
Of course.

530
01:18:59,351 --> 01:19:02,245
Please, they told us her
daughter could still be at ???

531
01:19:02,246 --> 01:19:05,138
We already been to this hospital.

532
01:19:05,433 --> 01:19:09,520
We have checked all
hospitals. But this one, please.

533
01:19:09,521 --> 01:19:11,960
Five minutes. Please
just wait five minutes.

534
01:19:13,379 --> 01:19:15,896
I won't be long, I'll be right back.

535
01:19:31,866 --> 01:19:39,866
Lucas... Lucas... Is there
anything left in the can?

536
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:50,149
Don't worry, I'll get you something.

537
01:22:53,832 --> 01:22:56,399
- I need to pee.
- Can you hold it?

538
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,590
No.

539
01:23:01,212 --> 01:23:03,330
Simon, what are you doing?

540
01:23:12,661 --> 01:23:15,420
Hurry up, they're going to leave us here.
What are you doing?

541
01:23:39,859 --> 01:23:43,305
- No luck.
- Sorry.

542
01:23:46,876 --> 01:23:49,889
Sorry, and thanks for waiting.

543
01:23:50,849 --> 01:23:52,492
We go now.

544
01:24:35,323 --> 01:24:37,395
Dad!

545
01:24:38,242 --> 01:24:40,062
It's Lucas!

546
01:24:41,251 --> 01:24:49,251
- Lucas! Lucas!
- Lucas! Lucas!

547
01:24:50,456 --> 01:24:52,629
- Lucas!
- Lucas!

548
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:57,762
- Simon! Thomas!
- Lucas! Lucas!

549
01:25:35,051 --> 01:25:36,342
Are you okay?

550
01:25:46,939 --> 01:25:48,171
Lucas!

551
01:25:51,405 --> 01:25:52,703
- Dad!
- Lucas!

552
01:26:23,405 --> 01:26:26,826
Let's go, no need to wait.

553
01:26:42,264 --> 01:26:43,944
- Mom is here.
- What?

554
01:26:45,581 --> 01:26:48,944
She's very weak. She says
some weird stuff sometimes.

555
01:26:49,962 --> 01:26:53,325
The nurse is going to operate
her as soon as they can.

556
01:26:55,415 --> 01:27:00,383
Mom, look who's here.

557
01:27:08,155 --> 01:27:12,830
Hey. Hey, my darling.

558
01:27:21,883 --> 01:27:22,805
Mom.

559
01:27:25,811 --> 01:27:28,953
- Is everyone okay?
- We are all okay.

560
01:27:37,958 --> 01:27:41,318
- I'm gonna die.
- No, no.

561
01:27:47,598 --> 01:27:49,154
Is it okay to take this off?

562
01:28:09,394 --> 01:28:11,823
- You're back?
- Yeah.

563
01:28:15,634 --> 01:28:17,435
I can rest now.

564
01:28:24,073 --> 01:28:28,785
Maria, what?
What, what darling?

565
01:28:30,325 --> 01:28:33,414
- I'm dying.
- No. No.

566
01:28:34,462 --> 01:28:40,653
- You're gonna be fine.
- Take care of my babies.

567
01:28:40,654 --> 01:28:43,045
Hey, that's not why I came here for.

568
01:28:43,566 --> 01:28:45,618
You're gonna be fine. They're
going to take good care of you. Okay?

569
01:28:46,713 --> 01:28:48,278
I promise you we are going to be fine.

570
01:28:49,544 --> 01:28:53,252
- Henry. I'm scared.
- We're gonna fine.

571
01:28:55,801 --> 01:28:57,490
I promise we're going to be okay.

572
01:28:58,677 --> 01:29:02,518
We're taking her for surgery.
We need to take her now.

573
01:29:02,695 --> 01:29:04,313
Okay.

574
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:12,799
I love you. You're gonna be okay.

575
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:17,285
I love you so much.
I love you.

576
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:27,123
I'm sorry, I'm going to let
go of your hand... (???)

577
01:30:16,417 --> 01:30:20,611
Lucas, thanks for taking care of mom.

578
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:24,633
We took care of each other.

579
01:30:31,834 --> 01:30:34,923
- Dad?
- Yeah.

580
01:30:35,573 --> 01:30:37,292
There is something I didn't tell Mom,

581
01:30:37,375 --> 01:30:41,077
and really need her to know.

582
01:31:07,694 --> 01:31:09,260
I have a family too.

583
01:31:13,523 --> 01:31:15,787
I've been saving my strength...

584
01:31:16,063 --> 01:31:20,827
Because I want to see them...
One more time.

585
01:32:10,347 --> 01:32:13,822
<i>No, no.</i>

586
01:32:14,852 --> 01:32:16,367
Oh do you have to?

587
01:32:17,852 --> 01:32:22,000
- We don't want you to feel any pain.
- I'm afraid to go to sleep.

588
01:32:22,491 --> 01:32:24,450
You're in good hands.

589
01:32:26,288 --> 01:32:27,600
Close your eyes and think
of something nice.

590
01:32:27,601 --> 01:32:28,912
Think of somehing nice.

591
01:36:00,324 --> 01:36:02,855
Mom is okay, Lucas.

592
01:36:05,148 --> 01:36:06,475
We're going home.

593
01:36:22,378 --> 01:36:23,796
Mr. Bennett, I'm one of the.. (???)

594
01:36:23,797 --> 01:36:25,363
... U.S. health insurance (???)

595
01:36:25,364 --> 01:36:28,361
We are here to care of your family.
They have nothing to worry about now.

596
01:36:29,484 --> 01:36:31,703
In a few hours, we will be
at Singapore General Hospital.

597
01:36:31,739 --> 01:36:34,072
Where your wife will receive
the best treatment in your living.

598
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:38,094
They will take you to the
plane. See you there.

599
01:36:38,133 --> 01:36:39,582
Have a safe flight.

600
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:24,944
Where are we going?

601
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:31,372
They take us to Singapore.
We'll be safe. Okay?

602
01:37:35,883 --> 01:37:38,404
Please take your seat.
We will be taking off shortly.

603
01:37:38,665 --> 01:37:39,549
Okay.

604
01:38:00,489 --> 01:38:02,901
- Can I just...
- Yeah, okay. One minute.

605
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,743
How are you?

606
01:38:21,941 --> 01:38:23,965
Here, with you.

607
01:38:28,844 --> 01:38:33,353
Mom, this morning...

608
01:38:36,096 --> 01:38:37,980
I saw Daniel again...

609
01:38:41,302 --> 01:38:42,573
He was so happy.

610
01:38:46,619 --> 01:38:47,896
He was in somebody's arms.

611
01:38:51,693 --> 01:38:52,690
I bet it was his dad, Mom.

612
01:39:01,289 --> 01:39:03,096
I'm proud of you.

613
01:39:07,927 --> 01:39:10,911
I love you so much.

614
01:39:18,999 --> 01:39:22,208
Thank you. Thank you.

615
01:39:24,747 --> 01:39:26,972
Sorry, but you have to get back
to your seat now.

616
01:39:34,084 --> 01:39:38,788
Fasten your seatbelts, please.

617
01:39:40,564 --> 01:39:43,247
I don't want to.

618
01:39:43,248 --> 01:39:45,930
No? You have to fasten
your seatbelts in the plane.

619
01:40:21,504 --> 01:40:25,032
<i>WE ARE AT THE BEACH</i>

620
01:40:39,913 --> 01:40:42,224
