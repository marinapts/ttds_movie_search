MR. TUSHMAN: And then in the
spring, we have a science fair.

71
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:19,884
And from what your home school teacher
tells me, you'll get first prize.

72
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,853
You hear that, Auggie?

73
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,822
Then right before graduation,
whole class takes a trip

74
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,224
to a nature reserve
in Pennsylvania.

Other kids now?

83
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,719
MR. TUSHMAN: They were
in the elementary school

84
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,791
so they know their way around and
they'll give you a nice tour.

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,261
It will be fine.

00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:12,437

<i>Everyone makes

<i>But kids aren't as good
at hiding it.</i>

93
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,658
<i>So I usually look down.</i>

00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,937
<i>Uh-oh, crazy kid.</i>

98
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,005
I act in TV commercials.

99
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,173
Really?

100
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,612
Yeah. Tide.

101
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,111
MR. TUSHMAN:
Why don't you guys

102
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,613
take Auggie 'round
the school a bit, huh?

103
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,485
Just be back here in, uh,
a half hour?

104

CHARLOTTE: <i>I started
when I was two.</i>

105
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,432
Local spots mostly.

106
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,534
Then when I was three I booked
my first national. Nestlé Quik.

107
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:20,070
It was hard, because
I'm lactose intolerant.

108
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,372
Anyway, have you ever heard
of a spit bucket?

109
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:25,646
So this is our homeroom.
We have Mr. Browne.

110
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:29,279
My mom says
he's a little weird.

111
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,382
CHARLOTTE:
Then I was in the chorus of

112
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:35,586
the Radio City Music Hall
Christmas Spectacular.

113
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,654
I auditioned
for Annie on Broadway.

114
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:41,425
I got two callbacks for Molly, but I guess
they went in a different direction.

115
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,495
Hey, Charlotte!

116
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,332
Don't you ever stop talking?

117
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,733
So this is the cafeteria.

118
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,202
The food here is okay
for school food.

119
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:55,541
Or do you eat special food?

120
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:11,221
Wow! This reminds me of my
guess spot on <i>Law & Order.</i>

121
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:14,425
So the science elective
is supposably really hard.

122
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,526
So you probably won't be
spending much time here.

123
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:19,497
No offense, but if you've never
been in a real school before...

124
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,432
Dude, he's been home schooled.

125
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,233
Okay, I'm just saying.

126
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:25,635
Science is supposably
really hard.

127
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:27,771
But you're taking it,
too, right?

128
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,707
(CHUCKLES) Hey,
maybe you could fail together.

129
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:33,346
Why don't you get out of the
way, so he can check it out?

130
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:35,949
Okay.

131
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,351
I mean, there's nothing much
to see. Desks. Chairs.

132
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:43,388
The incubator. Bunsen burners.

133
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,592
Those are some
really gross science posters.

134
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,394
Oh! And this is an eraser.

135
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,328
CHARLOTTE: He knows
what an eraser is.

136
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,096
How am I supposed to know
what he knows?

137
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:54,332
He doesn't say anything.

138
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,337
You know
what an eraser is, right?

139
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,507
(WHISPERS) Dude,
you have to say something.

140
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,743
Yeah, I know
what an eraser is.

141
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:10,414
Is... Is your name Jack
or Jackwill?

142
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,616
(GIGGLES) You thought his name
was Jackwill?

143
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:16,189
Yeah, a lotta people call me
by my first and last name.

144
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,456
I don't know why.

145
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,689
Got any other questions?

146
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:23,226
Actually, I've got
a question for Auggie.

147
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:24,495
What's the deal
with your face?

148
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,495
Dude!

149
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:27,097
I mean were you
in a car crash or something?

150
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,332
Julian!

151
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,735
What? Tushman said we could
ask questions if we wanted to.

152
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,735
Not rude questions.

153
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,471
Besides, he was born
like that, Mr. Tushman said.

154
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,241
Yeah, I know. I just thought maybe
he was, like, in a fire, too.

155
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:40,110
Hey, Julian, shut up.

156
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,178
You shut up!

157
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,248
Why don't we all shut up?

158
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,519
No, I wasn't in a fire.

159
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,189
And the word's "supposedly."

160
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,490
What?

161
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:57,562
You said that science
is supposably really hard.

162
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,596
Twice.

163
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:02,468
The word's "supposedly."
With a "D."

164
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,407
Maybe my mom
can home school you, too.

165

how you felt about the tour?

166

Today?

167
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,725
Mr. Tushman
went out of his way

168
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,527
to tell me how sweet
those kids were

169
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,665
and that Julian
is apparently quite the dream.

170

(SIGHS) No.

171

ISABEL: Not a dream?

172
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:39,336
Is he one of those kids that acts
one way in front of grownups

173
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,538
and then another way
in front of kids?

174
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,240
Yeah, I guess.

175
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,744
Well I know it's hard, but
you have to understand that

176
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,647
he probably feels badly
about himself.

177
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,650
And when someone acts small, you just
have to be the bigger person, all right?

178
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:55,788
Right.

179
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,392
Via, I'll get the pizza.

181
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,894
That kid sounds like
a real jerk.

182
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,297
If someone pushes you,
push back.

183
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,798
Don't be afraid of anyone.

184
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,332
(WHISPERS)
Why are we whispering?

185
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:10,771
Because I'm afraid of Mom.

186
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,770
You just gotta be
a bigger person

187
00:11:13,772 --> 00:11:17,641
and rise above it.
It's that easy.

188
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:21,913
Auggie, I do believe that this is the
best year for you to start school

because everybody
is going to be new.

don't wanna go...

00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:48,945
Okay, that's a start. Uh...

632
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,579
I'm a good listener
so tell me something.

633
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:53,581
Who are you gonna
audition for?

634
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:57,253
Um, I'm not really
the Our Town type.

635
00:40:57,255 --> 00:41:00,623
Oh come on. Don't be
the "run lights girl."

636
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,994
Should be Emily.

637
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:03,726
The lead?

638
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:06,231
Look, your family can't cheer
for you in a booth.

639
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,496
Oh, they're pretty busy.

640
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:10,632
I don't think they would
cheer for me anyway.

641
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,534
Come on,
there's not one person

642
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,473
in your family
who would applaud you?

643
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:17,408
My grandmother.

644
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,944
There you go. Bring her.

645
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:22,380
I can't.

646
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,953
Well, then I'll applaud you.

647
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,387
Why are you being
so nice to me?

648
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:36,060
Because you're an only child.
We have to stick together.

649
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,132
Think about it. Okay?

650
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:46,338
And your grandmother's
still cheerin' you on.

651
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,214
GRANDMOTHER: <i>I know you.</i>

652
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:03,021
And I love you more than
anything in the world.

653
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,590
What about Auggie?

654
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,261
I love your brother.

655
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,532
But he has a lot of angels
looking out for him.

656
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,969
And you have me.

657
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,240
Yeah.

658
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,444
You are everywhere.

659
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,047
And...

660
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,650
...you are my favorite.

661
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,588
You're my favorite,
too, Grams.

Mom, Daisy ruined
my Boba Fett costume!

663
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:08,717
What? Where have you been?
It's very late.

664
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,485
- I'm sorry.
- She threw up all over it.

665
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,686
Okay, well,
you'll just have to wear

666
00:43:11,688 --> 00:43:14,090
- your costume from last year.
- But I told Jack

667
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,324
I was going as Boba Fett,
not Ghostface.

668
00:43:16,326 --> 00:43:19,527
Well, tomorrow is Halloween.
And all the shops are closed.

669
00:43:19,529 --> 00:43:21,697
And my artistic hands are busy
making meatloaf.

670
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,231
So you do the math.

671
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,235
Fine!

672
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,269
Do you need some help, Mom?

673
00:43:28,271 --> 00:43:29,538
What?

674
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,706
Some help.

675
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,809
Oh, uh, yes, thank you.

676
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,579
Er, mince that rosemary,
please.

677

Where did you say you were?

678
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,491
I, uh...
I went to Coney Island.

679
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,434
How about you stay home
from school tomorrow? Hmm?

680
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:02,371
It's Halloween. We can
make it a 3-day weekend.

681
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,742
Spend some time together.

682
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,677
Yeah. Yeah,
that would be really nice.

683
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:09,213
Yeah?

684
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,382
Okay, good.

685
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:15,251

who I was. It's so cool.</i>

don't like to touch me</i>

- AMOS: Yeah.

of, like, the shrunken head, you know?

- AMOS: Or an orc.
- JULIAN: Yeah.

703
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:22,885
If I looked like him,
I'd swear

704
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,052
I'd put a hood over my face
every day.

I think I'd kill myself.

so much, Jack?

She won't even talk to me.

almost immediately...

you could have all my candy,

Mom, enough with the guilt.

wanna be friends with Auggie.</i>

talking about, Auggie.

friends with me.

Er, no. It's a fiddle.

You should tell people
it's a machine gun.

That's a great idea,
you're right.

(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

941

It's a gene.
Well, it's sort of two genes,

but two genes
that are identical.

that both of my parents

carry the gene

01:39:41,541 --> 01:39:44,780
I love that helmet.
I wish I knew where it was.

1564
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:49,948
It's in my office.

1565
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:53,752
What? Dad! That was a gift.
You had no right to hide it!

1566
01:39:53,754 --> 01:39:55,653
Auggie, Auggie,
please, don't be mad.

1567
01:39:55,655 --> 01:39:59,058
You gotta understand, you
were wearing it all the time.

1568
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:00,859
I never got
to see you anymore.

1569
01:40:00,861 --> 01:40:03,095
I missed your face.

1570
01:40:03,097 --> 01:40:05,898
I know you don't always
like it, but I love it.

1571
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:07,936
It's my son's face.

1572
01:40:10,937 --> 01:40:12,673
I wanna see it.

1573
01:40:15,642 --> 01:40:16,942
Do you forgive me?

1574
01:40:16,944 --> 01:40:17,946
No.

1575
01:40:20,947 --> 01:40:21,950
Yes.

1576
01:40:24,218 --> 01:40:25,618
Does Mom know?

1577
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:28,520
(WHISPERS) No.
God, no, she'd kill me.

1578
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:31,789
But I can maybe find it,
if you need it back.

1579
01:40:31,791 --> 01:40:33,061
That's okay.

1580
01:40:43,803 --> 01:40:45,639
(CHOIR SINGING)

1581
01:40:59,853 --> 01:41:01,854
- (WHISPERS) Mom.
- (WHISPERS) Yes?

1582
01:41:01,856 --> 01:41:02,991
Thank you.

1583
01:41:04,724 --> 01:41:05,823
For what?

1584
01:41:05,825 --> 01:41:07,628
Making me go to school.

1585
01:41:10,897 --> 01:41:13,097
I was so mad at you sometimes.

1586
01:41:13,099 --> 01:41:15,136
But I'm really happy
to be here.

1587
01:41:17,271 --> 01:41:19,773
You really are a wonder,
Auggie.

1588
01:41:21,041 --> 01:41:22,710
You are a wonder.

1589
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:29,718
(CHOIR CONTINUES SINGING)

1590
01:41:43,263 --> 01:41:45,363
Whoo. (CHUCKLES)

1591
01:41:45,365 --> 01:41:49,169
Thank you, choir.
That was beautiful.

1592
01:41:50,737 --> 01:41:56,578
Ladies, gentlemen,
boys and girls, graduates.

1593
01:41:58,044 --> 01:42:03,215
Final award this morning is
the Henry Ward Beecher medal

1594
01:42:03,217 --> 01:42:08,988
to honor students who have
been notable or exemplary.

1595
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:14,993
Usually, it's a "good works,"
a service award.

1596
01:42:14,995 --> 01:42:18,329
But I came upon a passage
that he wrote,

1597
01:42:18,331 --> 01:42:24,739
which made me realize that
good works come in many forms.

1598
01:42:26,374 --> 01:42:32,112
"Greatness," he wrote,
"lies not in being strong

1599
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:37,018
"but in the right using
of strength.

1600
01:42:38,052 --> 01:42:42,421
<i>"He or she is the greatest</i>

1601
01:42:42,423 --> 01:42:46,958
<i>"whose strength carries up
the most hearts</i>

1602
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,164
<i>"by the attraction
of his own."</i>

1603
01:42:53,867 --> 01:43:00,305
Without further ado,
this year, I am very proud

1604
01:43:00,307 --> 01:43:04,943
to award the Henry Ward
Beecher medal

1605
01:43:04,945 --> 01:43:09,681
to the student
whose quiet strength

1606
01:43:09,683 --> 01:43:12,020
has carried up
the most hearts.

1607
01:43:12,953 --> 01:43:14,819
So,

1608
01:43:14,821 --> 01:43:18,756
will August Pullman please come
up here to receive this award?

1609
01:43:18,758 --> 01:43:20,761
(ALL CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

1610
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:26,333
Whoo!

1611
01:43:52,992 --> 01:43:55,196
You're the best, dude!

1612
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:03,836
AUGGIE: <i>Walking up towards that
stage, I felt like I was floating.</i>

1613
01:44:03,838 --> 01:44:06,438
<i>My heart was beating so fast.</i>

1614
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:09,774
<i>I didn't really understand
why I was getting a medal.</i>

1615
01:44:09,776 --> 01:44:13,145
<i>It's not like I blew up
the Death Star.</i>

1616
01:44:13,147 --> 01:44:17,349
<i>All I did was get through fifth
grade, just like everyone else here.</i>

1617
01:44:17,351 --> 01:44:18,420
Congratulations.

1618
01:44:20,521 --> 01:44:22,954
Here you go. That's for you.

1619
01:44:22,956 --> 01:44:25,360
AUGGIE: <i>Then again, maybe
that's kind of the point.</i>

1620
01:44:27,227 --> 01:44:30,764
<i>Maybe the truth is,
I'm really not so ordinary.</i>

1621
01:44:32,165 --> 01:44:34,966
<i>Maybe if we knew what other
people were thinking</i>

1622
01:44:34,968 --> 01:44:37,435
<i>we'd know that
no one's ordinary.</i>

1623
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:42,209
<i>And we all deserve a standing
ovation at least once in our lives.</i>

1624
01:44:43,511 --> 01:44:45,045
<i>My friends do.</i>

1625
01:44:49,517 --> 01:44:51,119
<i>My teachers do.</i>

1626
01:44:52,352 --> 01:44:56,188
<i>My sister does
for always being there for me.</i>

1627
01:44:56,190 --> 01:44:59,094
<i>My dad does
for always making us laugh.</i>

1628
01:45:00,194 --> 01:45:02,261
<i>And my mom does the most.</i>

1629
01:45:02,263 --> 01:45:05,197
<i>For never giving up.
On anything.</i>

1630
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:06,433
<i>Especially, me.</i>

1631
01:45:08,201 --> 01:45:12,337
<i>It's like that last precept
Mr. Browne gave us.</i>

1632
01:45:12,339 --> 01:45:16,809
<i>Be kind, for everyone
is fighting a hard battle.</i>

1633
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:19,114
<i>And if you really wanna see
what people are,</i>

1634
01:45:20,347 --> 01:45:24,451
<i>all you have to do... is look.</i>
