1
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,660
Grandma.

2
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,180
Your eggs.

3
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,740
It's Billy.

4
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,060
Come on.

5
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,140
Fuck!

6
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,980
You been playin' my records,
you little twat!
I never played naught.

7
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,300
Ow!
Knob head!

8
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,020
If Dad knew you smoked
that stuff, he'd go mental.

9
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:20,521
Fuck off, will ya?

10
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,620
Twat.

11
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,620
Here we go, Dad!
Come on, man.

12
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,620
Dad!

13
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,740
Hurry up, Dad.
We'll be late.

14
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,700
The whole friggin' world's
gonna be on that picket line
this mornin'.

15
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,180
Oi! You tidy our room.
Dad!

16
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,420
There's not much
of this coal left.

17
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,380
It's fine. We'll be digging
it up again next month.

18
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,620
Don't kid yourself.

19
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,380
I'm not waitin' for youse.

20
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,580
Tony. Tony!

21
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,660
See you down
the picket line, Dad.

22
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,380
Leave it, Billy.

23
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,300
Mam would've let us.

24
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,020
Your 50 pence
is on the fridge.

25
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,740
Scab! Scab! Scab!
Scab! Scab! Scab!

26
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,180
Scab! Scab! Scab!

27
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,020
Are you sure
you're not going to come?

28
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,740
Am I fuck.
It's a load of bollocks.

29
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,380
No, it's not.
It's a load of shite,
kickin' people in.

30
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,540
Anyway, l don't know
why you bother.

31
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,900
- I'm good at it.
-Are you shite? Them gloves--
They went out with the ark.

32
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,340
- They're me dad's, these.
- Exactly.

33
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,100
Right, lads.
Listen up here.

34
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,100
Hold it!
Oi, oi! Here!

35
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,900
Now, because
they're using downstairs...

36
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,860
as a soup kitchen
for the strikin' miners,

37
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,300
I'm going to let
Mrs. Wilkinson...

38
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,180
use the bottom end
of the boxin' hall
for her ballet lessons.

39
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,900
So no hanky-panky.
Understood?

40
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,340
Yes.
Elliot, you're late.

41
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,380
Get changed
and get in here.

42
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,580
All right then, lads.

43
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,980
Give it all you got!
Round one.

44
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,620
Well, don't just
stand there, Elliot!

45
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,980
Oh, no! Not again!

46
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,540
This is man-to-man-combat,
not a bloody tea dance.

47
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,220
What're you doin', man?
Hit him!

48
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,140
Greavesy, he's pissin' about.
Get stuck in and
give him a belt.

49
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,580
- He's like a fanny in a fit.
- Billy, hit him!

50
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,700
Jesus Christ,
Billy Elliot!

51
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,020
You're a disgrace
to them gloves, your father...

52
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,620
and the traditions
of this boxin' hall.

53
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,180
You owe us 50 pence.

54
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,460
Ho! Liberace,
will you give it a rest?

55
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Billy, punch bag.

56
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,420
You're not goin'
until you do it properly.

57
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,580
Give these to Mrs. Wilkinson
and her dance class
when you've finished.

58
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,020
I'll see you next week.
Okay, girls.

59
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,580
Left hand on the barre.

60
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,540
Thank you,
Mr. Braithwaite.
And--

61
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,820
Pretty arms.

62
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,820
Bottoms in.

63
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,420
Where are you lookin',
Susan?

64
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,660
Lift. Feel the music.
Feel it.

65
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,180
In time, Debbie, please.

66
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,020
And one, and two,
and three,

67
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,460
and four, and five,

68
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,940
six, seven, eight.

69
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,020
And one, and two,
and three,

70
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,660
and four, five--

71
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,060
And hold.

72
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,220
Hold it.

73
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,700
Support your selves!
Don't look at me. Look ahead!

74
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,180
Where's your confidence?
Come on.

75
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,740
And down.

76
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,860
Lovely.

77
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,860
Oh, God.

78
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,180
And, Debbie, eyes front.

79
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,860
And five, and six,
and seven, and stop.

80
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,820
For God's sake.
Thank you, Mr. Braithwaite.

81
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,460
Right into the center,
girls, please.

82
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,900
Miss?
Miss, the keys.

83
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,900
Not now.

84
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,900
Right, Mr. Braithwaite.
"The Sun Will Come Out
Tomorrow."

85
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,780
Fat chance.
Ready, and--

86
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,420
Port de bras forward.

87
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,260
And up.

88
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Port de bras forward.

89
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,420
And up.

90
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,300
Why don't you join in?
Port de bras forward.

91
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,740
And up.

92
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,380
Port de bras forward.

93
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,220
And up,
and hold.

94
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,540
And three, and four.

95
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,980
And, Debbie, straight leg.

96
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,980
Seven and eight.

97
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,140
And one, and two, and three,
and four, and five.

98
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,220
Boots off.
Seven and eight.

99
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,780
What size are you?
Miss, what about
the keys?

100
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,940
Into the center.

101
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,380
Go on. I dare ya.

102
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,260
Prepare.

103
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,900
And one, and two,
and three,

104
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,620
and four, and five,
and six, and--

105
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,740
And eight, and hold.

106
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,980
Hold it.

107
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,660
Hold it.

108
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,660
Hold it.

109
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,020
Ooh, what have we got
here, then?

110
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,700
Heel out.
Drop your hip.

111
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,180
Nice... straight leg.

112
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,660
Good arch.

113
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,700
Turn that leg out.

114
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,940
Right. Class dismissed.

115
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,700
Home time.
Debbie, get the 50P's.

116
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,220
You owe me 50 pence.
No, I don't!

117
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,500
- You do. Why don't you
bring it along next week?
- Can't. I'm goin' to boxin'.

118
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,220
- But you're crap at boxin'.
- No, I'm not!

119
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,020
Shut up.

120
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,020
Thought you enjoyed it.

121
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,940
Please yourself, darlin'.

122
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,300
I'm stepping out, my dear

123
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,900
To breathe an atmosphere
that simply wreaks with class

124
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,380
And l trust that
you'll excuse my dust

125
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,380
When l step on the gas

126
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,820
For Ill be there
putting down my top hat

127
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,500
Mussing up my white tie

128
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,580
Dancing in my tails

129
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,180
He was your mam's favorite,
was Fred Astaire.

130
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,820
We used to watch him
at the Palace Picture House...

131
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,420
and then dance round
the front room like lunatics.

132
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,420
Marvelous!

133
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,860
Mind, they used
to say...

134
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,580
I could've been
a professional.

135
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,020
Come on, Grandma.
Not now.
Ooh!

136
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,740
Grandma!

137
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,300
It's this one here!

138
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,660
Grandma!
It's over here!

139
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,460
Tony, do you ever
think about death?

140
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,460
Fuck off!

141
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,660
Night-night, then.

142
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,340
Plenty of boys
do ballet, you know.

143
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,940
Do they now?
What boys do ballet?

144
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,780
Nobody around here,
but plenty of men do.

145
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,020
Poofs.
Not necessarily poofs.

146
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,220
Who, like?
What about Wayne Sleep?
He's not a poof.

147
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,580
He's as fit as an athlete.
Bet he couldn't beat
Daley Thompson.

148
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,540
Maybe not in a race,
but in stamina.

149
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,180
Why don't you come tomorrow?
You can just watch.
I can't.

150
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,260
Gotta go to boxin',
haven't I?

151
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,620
Please yourself, then.

152
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,620
See you around.

153
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,020
Aye. See ya.
Ta-ra.

154
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,540
Right, lads. Look sharp.

155
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,660
Everybody, out!

156
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,460
Turn, turn and stop.

157
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,540
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

158
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,860
Arms are in fifth.

159
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,980
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

160
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,140
Turn, turn and stop.

161
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,420
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Where are those arms?

162
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,180
I don't know what to do.
Follow the orders.

163
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,620
Shut up, Debbie!
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

164
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,420
Nice pretty arms.
And stop.

165
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,860
See?
I told you it takes
loads of practice.

166
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,340
Debbie.
What, Mam?

167
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,140
What do you call me?
Miss.

168
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,100
Shove off.

169
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,180
So, do we get the pleasure
of your company next week?

170
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,300
It's just-- I feel
like a right sissy.

171
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,380
Well, don't act like one.
Fifty "P," please.

172
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,980
If you're not comin' again,
give us your shoes.

173
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,260
Nah. You're all right.

174
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,260
Right.

175
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,580
What're you doin', goin' round
here like creeping Jesus?
Naught.

176
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,940
We found your nana
in the Spar stores.
Where have you been?

177
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,940
Boxin'.
Where do you think?

178
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,940
What're you doin'?
I forgot me gloves.

179
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,940
They were
my dad's gloves.

180
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,660
You better take
better care of them, okay?

181
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,940
Copy that diagram.

182
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,460
We only have five minutes left.

183
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,300
Ow!

184
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,900
Hurry. This way.

185
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,500
You go to ballet every week?

186
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,180
Yeah, but don't
say aught.
Why do you take lessons?

187
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,100
Why do you think?
To get better, you diwy.

188
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,900
Do you get to wear
a tutu?
Fuck off!

189
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,300
They're only meant
for lasses.

190
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,300
I wear me shorts.

191
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,740
You won't ask
for a tutu?
What for?

192
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,220
To dance in.
I'd look
a right dickhead.

193
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,380
I think you'd look wicked.

194
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,700
 I don't know why
you're lookin' at that.

195
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,460
You can't take that out
on a junior ticket.

196
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,140
See you, then.

197
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,140
Take me

198
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,620
Okay, Billy Elliot,
into the center.

199
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,180
I want you to watch
carefully, girls.

200
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,660
First, arabesque.

201
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,060
Drop your shoulders.

202
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,300
Look forward,
beyond your finger tips.

203
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,940
There!

204
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,100
Spin it, Mr. Braithwaite.
Spin it!

205
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,740
Come on. Spin it!
Now, focus!

206
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,260
Look at yourselves!
Look in the mirror!

207
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,260
Ahh!

208
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,220
Christ Almighty,
what was that?

209
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,820
Oi!
What's goin' on?
Uh, nothin'.

210
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,660
Prepare, one and two.

211
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,020
Strong position.
Weight on both legs.

212
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,700
And... pirouette.

213
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,140
-And down.

214
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,860
Up you get.

215
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,300
Find a place
on that bloody wall...

216
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,380
and focus on that spot.

217
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,260
Then whip your head round
and come back to that spot.
Prepare.

218
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,340
One, and two, and--
Fuck it.

219
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,260
Have you got
the spot?

220
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,420
Prepare!

221
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,620
- Prepare.
Prepare.

222
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,420
Go!

223
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,220
Go! Go!

224
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,740
Go!
Go, Billy!

225
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,500
What have l told you
about that arm?

226
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,140
Right.
Back to the barre.

227
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,380
You look like
a right wanker
to me, son.

228
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,540
Listen, Jackie.

229
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,660
Listen, Jackie.

230
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,220
It was just 50 pence
a session, you know.

231
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,980
I can do without it.
I do not do it for the money.

232
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,300
What are you talkin' about?
The boxin', man.

233
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,980
I haven't seen hide nor hair
of your Billy for months.

234
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,020
I was gonna say something,
but I thought
it might be embarrassin'.

235
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,540
First I knew about it.
He's never got his gloves off.

236
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,860
Send him round to my house,
and I'll sharp knock some sense
into him.

237
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,300
Scab! Scab!

238
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,340
Step open and balance.

239
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,340
Balance, balance.

240
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,140
Scab! Scab! Scab!
Scab! Scab! Scab!

241
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,740
Right.
Let's do it again.

242
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,420
Open...
and lift your chest.
Let's do it again.

243
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,820
Thank you,
Mr. Braithwaite.

244
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,180
Step open.
Open your arms. Do it.

245
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,180
Pay attention.

246
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,820
Arms. Like this.
All right?

247
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,460
Thank you, Mr. Braithwaite.
Step really open!

248
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,060
Powerful! Proud!

249
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,060
You're not
concentratin'.
Yes, I am concentratin'.

250
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,180
You're not even tryin'.

251
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,820
- Can we have a go of it, Miss?
- Let's do it again.

252
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,300
Have you noticed
anything weird about
our Billy lately?

253
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,820
What, are you after
like a list?

254
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,020
Aye, aye.

255
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,940
Got enough food there,
scab?

256
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,940
What're you doin'?
Eh?

257
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,260
Scabs eat well, eh?
You're me best mate.

258
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,820
First rule of a union, Gary.
You never cross a picket line.

259
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,820
Fucking hell.

260
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,540
We're all fucked
if you forget that!

261
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,060
We're fucked anyway!

262
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,820
In a speech to
Tory M.P.'s yesterday,

263
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,820
Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher...

264
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,500
referred to members of
the striking National
Union of Mine Workers...

265
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,140
as "the enemy within. "

266
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,140
The speech comes following
several months
of violent clashes...

267
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,820
between police officers
and striking miners--

268
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,820
See you, then.
Wait! Y- Your breakfast--

269
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,540
What the hell's he up to?

270
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,420
One, two, three.
Pas de bourree.

271
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,300
And a one, two, three.
And a turn.

272
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,060
And a one, two, three.
Pas de bourree.

273
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,940
And a one, two, three.
Pas de bourree.

274
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,900
And a one, two, three.
Pas de bourree.

275
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,660
And a one, two, three.
Pas de bourree.

276
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,260
And a one, two, three.
Pas de bourree.

277
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,220
And a one, two, three.

278
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,260
Pas de bourree.

279
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,700
You, out! Now!

280
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,820
I beg your pardon?

281
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,940
Please, Miss,

282
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,140
don't.

283
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,060
All right, which way
are we facing?

284
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,420
Come on.

285
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,620
And a one, two, three.
Pas de bourree.

286
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,900
- Ballet.
- What's wrong with ballet?

287
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:38,300
- "What's wrong with ballet"?
- It's perfectly normal.

288
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,580
Perfectly normal?

289
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,580
I used to go to ballet.

290
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,580
See?

291
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,580
Aye, for your nana.

292
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,740
For girls.
Not for lads, Billy.

293
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,420
Lads do football or...

294
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,700
boxin' or...

295
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,780
wrestlin'!

296
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,420
Not friggin' ballet!

297
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,500
What lads do wrestlin'?

298
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,980
Don't start, Billy.

299
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,820
I don't see
what's wrong with it.

300
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,620
You know perfectly well
what's wrong with it.
No, I don't.

301
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,620
Yes, you do.
No, I don't!

302
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,140
Yes, you bloody well do!

303
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,820
Who do you think l am?

304
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,180
You know quite nicely!

305
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,580
What?

306
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,060
What are you tryin'
to say, Dad?

307
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,180
You're askin'
for a hidin', son.

308
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,180
No, I'm not. Honest.

309
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,020
You are, Billy.
Billy!
It's not just poofs, Dad.

310
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,220
Some ballet dancers
are as fit as athletes.

311
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,220
What about that Wayne Sleep?
He was a ballet dancer.

312
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,340
- Wayne Sleep?
- Aye.

313
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,900
Listen, son,

314
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,340
from now on you can forget
about the fucking ballet.

315
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,060
You can forget about
the fuckin' boxin' as well.

316
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,500
I'm bustin' my ass for those
50 pences, and you're-- No!

317
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,500
From now on you stay here
and look after your nana.
Got that?

318
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,940
Good.

319
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,420
They used to say
I could have been
a professional dancer...

320
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,340
if Id had the training.
Will you shut up?

321
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,380
I hate you!

322
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,380
You're a bastard!

323
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,020
Get off!

324
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,460
Billy! Billy!

325
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,860
Billy!

326
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,260
But you won't fool

327
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,060
The children
of the revolution

328
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,940
No, you won't fool

329
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,140
The children
of the revolution
No, no, no

330
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,380
Yeah

331
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,700
Aah!

332
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,420
You won't fool the children
of the revolution

333
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,980
No, you won't fool

334
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,740
The children
of the revolution

335
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,420
No, you won't fool

336
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,260
The children
of the revolution

337
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,820
No, you won't fool

338
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,140
The children
of the revolution

339
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,380
No way

340
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,580
No way

341
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,660
Oh, hello.

342
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,260
My dad'll kill me
if he knows I'm here.

343
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,780
He stopped you
comin' to classes.

344
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,420
It's not his fault, Miss.

345
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:11,100
- That's all right
with you, is it?
- I suppose so.

346
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,300
- You should stand up to him.
- You don't know what he's like.

347
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,140
Well, that blows it.

348
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,380
Blows what, Miss?

349
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,380
Debbie?

350
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,620
I've heard a lot
about you.

351
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,860
Durham's little
Gene Kelly, eh?

352
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,300
Your dad work
down the pit, then?
Yeah.

353
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,660
Must be hard for the family
being out on strike.

354
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,420
He is out on strike,
isn't he?
'Course.

355
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,780
I shouldn't worry.
It won't last long.

356
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,860
Tom, don't.
If they had a ballot,
they'd be back tomorrow.

357
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,060
It's just a few
bloody commies
stirrin' things up.

358
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,700
Let's face it.
They haven't got a leg
to stand on.

359
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,620
Who doesn't?

360
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,180
The miners.
It stands to reason,
doesn't it?

361
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,180
Some pits are just
uneconomical.

362
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,180
If it costs more money
to pay everybody...

363
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,300
to dig the coal out
than you get for the coal
when you sell it,

364
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,340
what does that
tell ya?
Don't know.

365
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:11,020
You wanna think about that,
don't you, son?
Tom.

366
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,740
If it was up to me, I'd shut
the lot of'em down tomorrow.
For God's sake.

367
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,500
What do you do,
Mr. Wilkinson?

368
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,780
He's been made redundant.

369
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,780
I thought he was gonna
hit me or somethin'.
Don't be silly.

370
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,660
He's just under
a lot of pressure.
That's what mam says.

371
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,980
I think it's because
he drinks too much.
Does he drink too much?

372
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:42,100
He's always pissed.
Once he pissed himself.
Your dad?

373
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,780
Because he's unhappy, because
they sleep in separate beds.

374
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,540
Why do they sleep
in separate beds?
So they can't have sex.

375
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,980
Do they not have sex?
Dad did it with
this woman from work,

376
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,500
but they don't think
I know.

377
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,460
Do you miss your mam,
then?

378
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,860
Don't really miss her
as such.

379
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,820
It's more like
just feelin' sad.

380
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,180
Especially when I remember her
all of a sudden.

381
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,500
When I forgot that
she was dead and that.

382
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,140
What about your mam?
Does she not have sex?

383
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,540
No, she's unfulfilled.
That's why she does dancin'.

384
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,020
She does dancin'
instead of sex?

385
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,660
Your family's weird.
No, they're not.

386
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,180
They are, though.
They're mental.

387
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,300
Ow! Get off!

388
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,980
Wow

389
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,380
See?
You're a nutter, you.

390
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,660
Debbie! It's time
for Billy to go home!

391
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,820
Come on, Billy.
I'll drop you off at the corner.
I'll see ya, Debbie.

392
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,980
Okay, then.

393
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,820
Miss,
what have I blown?

394
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,380
This'll sound strange, Billy,
but for some time now...

395
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,380
I've been thinkin' of
the Royal Ballet School.

396
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,380
Aren't you a bit old,
Miss?

397
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,340
Ooh, not me. You!

398
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,340
I'm the bloody teacher!

399
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,460
They hold auditions
in Newcastle.

400
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,860
I'd never be good enough.
I hardly know aught.

401
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,580
They're not interested
in how much ballet you know.

402
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,100
They'll teach you that.
That's why they're a ballet school.

403
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,100
It's how you move and how you
express yourself that's important.

404
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,580
Express what?

405
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,420
I think you're good enough
to go for it.

406
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,460
It would mean
an awful lot of hard work.

407
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,860
But I'm banned.

408
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,540
Then maybe I should have
a word with him.
No, Miss!

409
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,060
I could teach you
on your own, if you want.
We couldn't afford it.

410
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,340
I'm not doin' it
for the money, Billy.

411
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,860
But what about Dad?
He doesn't need to know.

412
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,940
What about me boxin'?
Oh, for fuck's sake, Billy!

413
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,940
If you want to piss about
with your little mates,
that's fine with me.

414
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,140
All right,
don't lose your blob.

415
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,060
"Blob"?

416
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,260
So we could do it
private-like?

417
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,260
Just you and me.

418
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,660
Miss, you don't fancy me,
do you?

419
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,660
No, Billy, funnily enough,
I don't. Now, piss off.

420
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,900
Piss off, yourself.

421
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,780
See you Monday, then.

422
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,940
- Are you comin' in or what?
- What are you doin'?

423
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,500
Nothin'.
Just dressin' up.

424
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,220
Whose dress is that?
Come on.

425
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,820
Whose dress is that?
It's me sister's.

426
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,300
Did she give you it?
She doesn't know.

427
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,620
Do you wanna try?
You can have one of me mam's.

428
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,220
Nah.
You're all right.

429
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,460
What're you doin'
that for?
I'm just tryin' it on.

430
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,740
Christ.

431
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,740
Come here.

432
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,580
Stay still.

433
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,180
There.
Won't we get
in trouble?

434
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,340
Don't be stupid.
Me dad does it all the time.

435
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,380
He dresses up
in your mam's clothes?

436
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,580
Only when he thinks
everybody's out.

437
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,660
Have you got
a tutu yet?

438
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,660
Do you think being
a ballet dancer...

439
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,780
would be better
than being a miner?
I dont know.

440
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,220
It's just, I've got
this audition in Newcastle
in a couple of weeks.

441
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,420
What for?
For to go
to ballet school.

442
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,540
- Ballet school?
Is that in Newcastle?
- London.

443
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,580
You'd have to move,
with your Tony and everybody?

444
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:24,100
No. By me self.
That's a bit steep.

445
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,980
- Can't you be
a ballet dancer here?
- Don't be stupid!

446
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,420
So, when you goin'
there, then?

447
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,620
I don't know.
I haven't even got in yet.

448
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,620
What does
your dad say?

449
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,180
He doesn't know.
Fuckin' hell!

450
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,420
- Are you not going
to tell him?
- Not yet, anyway.

451
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,260
He might be pleased about it.
He could rent your room out.

452
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,260
He couldn't.
What about our Tony?

453
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,500
What do you reckon?

454
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,980
I think
you shouldn't bother.
Why not?

455
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,980
I'd miss you.

456
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,100
Fuckin' hell.

457
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,940
Brought your things?

458
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,820
I don't know
if they're right, Miss.

459
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,380
If they're special to you,
they're right.

460
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,380
What are they for?

461
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,780
To give us some ideas
for a dance.

462
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,300
Come on, then.
Let's see' em.

463
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,860
What's that?

464
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,020
It's a letter.
I can see it's a letter.

465
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,180
It's me mam's.

466
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:35,460
She wrote it
for when I was 18,
but l opened it.

467
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,700
Here.

468
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,340
"To my son Billy.

469
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,940
"Dear Billy.

470
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,060
"l know l must seem
like a distant memory to you,

471
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,940
"which is probably
a good thing.

472
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,820
"It will have been
a long time,

473
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,380
"and I will have missed
seeing you grow.

474
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,540
"Missed you crying,
laughing,
"Laughing...

475
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,620
and shouting."
and shouting."

476
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,340
"l will have missed
telling you off.

477
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,260
"But please know
I was always there...

478
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,900
"...with you
through everything."

479
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,900
"with you
through everything,

480
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,940
"and I always will be.

481
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,260
"And I am proud
to have known you,

482
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,260
"and I am proud
that you were mine.

483
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,220
"Always be yourself.

484
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,300
I love you forever."

485
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,860
"Mam."

486
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,620
She must've been a very
special woman, your mother.

487
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,140
No, she was just me mam.

488
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,420
I brought tape and all.

489
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,020
What is it?

490
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,980
"l Love to Boogie."

491
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,140
It's one of our Tony's.

492
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:02,940
Spin it! Go on!

493
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,940
And tap. Go!

494
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,060
Grandma, tea time.

495
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,700
Where are you goin'?

496
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,980
Go back to sleep.

497
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,140
It's 4:00.

498
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,220
You weren't thinkin'
of taking it with you?

499
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,220
You just wanna stand around
getting the shit
kicked out you,

500
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,220
that's your funeral.

501
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,780
But some of us are ready
to fight back for once.
They're already after you.

502
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,260
- You're no good to us in jail.
- I don't plan
on getting caught.

503
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,100
- What's going on?
- You, get back to bed!

504
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,100
- Both of you!
- Fuck you.

505
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,100
Put it down.

506
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,140
You gonna stop me?
I'm warnin' you.

507
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,500
You haven't got it in you.
You're finished!

508
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,260
Since mam died, you're nothing
but a useless twat! What the
fuck you gonna do about it?

509
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,420
Stop it!

510
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,020
What the fuck
are you lookin' at?

511
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,100
You haven't been practicin'.

512
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,620
Prepare. One, two.
And one, and two--

513
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,900
Get up.

514
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,500
Miss, I can't do it.

515
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,220
That's because
you're not concentratin'.

516
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,620
I am concentratin'.

517
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,820
- You're not even tryin'!
- I am, Miss!

518
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,180
- Do it again.
- Can't.

519
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:58,060
You do it again.

520
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,700
No!

521
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,580
Shit!

522
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,780
I'm sorry.
It's all right
for you.

523
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,700
It's not you
who has to do it!
I know.

524
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,300
You don't know anything!
What do you know
in your posh house...

525
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,780
with your husband
that pisses his self?

526
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,140
You're the same as
everybody else. All you want
is to tell me what to do!

527
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:59,140
Now wait a minute!
Look, I don't wanna do
your stupid, fucking audition!

528
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,380
- You only want me to do it
for your own benefit!
- Look, Billy--

529
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:06,700
Because you're a failure!
Don't you dare talk to me
like that!

530
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,140
You don't even have
a proper dancing school!

531
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,180
You're stuck in
some crummy boxing hall.

532
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,940
Don't pick on me 'cause you
fucked up your own life!

533
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,660
Can I put a tape on, Miss?

534
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:04,340
All right,
if you must.

535
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,660
It's cush, isn't it?

536
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,340
So, is there a story,
then, Miss?

537
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,100
Of course.

538
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:59,940
It's about a woman
who's captured
by an evil magician.

539
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,500
Sounds crap.

540
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,580
And this woman--
this beautiful woman...

541
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,100
is forced to be a swan.

542
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,780
Except for a few hours
every night...

543
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,940
when she becomes alive.

544
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,500
She becomes real again.

545
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,860
And then one night...

546
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,340
she meets this young prince,

547
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:31,140
and he falls in love
with her.

548
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,780
And she realizes...

549
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,940
this is the one thing
that will allow her...

550
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,540
to become a real woman
once more.

551
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,100
So then what happens?

552
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:50,060
He promises to marry her
and then goes off with
someone else, of course.

553
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,380
- So she has to be
a swan for good?
- She dies.

554
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,460
Because the prince
didn't love her?

555
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:59,180
Come on.
It's time to go.

556
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,500
It's only
a ghost story.

557
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,260
Come on!

558
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,740
No! No, no.

559
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,740
It's me.

560
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,420
It's Billy.

561
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:47,100
Oh, little one.

562
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,300
Oi, little one.

563
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,620
What have I told you
about drinkin'
out of the bottle?

564
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,620
Sorry, Mam.

565
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,500
Well, put it back.

566
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,140
One.

567
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:55,540
Lift and reach.

568
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:59,220
Down, and one.

569
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,580
Breathe and stretch.

570
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:06,100
Stretch, and one.

571
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,620
Lift and stretch.

572
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,820
Back, and one.

573
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,820
Lift, and
lengthen that foot.

574
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,980
And it's one.

575
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,020
Extend.

576
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,780
Reach out.

577
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:31,060
Lift and breathe.

578
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,460
And one.

579
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,660
Lift out...

580
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,740
and close.

581
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,980
And one.

582
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,620
Lift.

583
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,820
When's the audition,
then?

584
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,820
Tomorrow mornin'.

585
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,260
I'll miss you
if you go away.

586
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:31,860
Who do you think's better?
Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers?

587
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,940
Billy, do you not
fancy us, like?

588
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,460
Don't know.
Never really thought
about it.

589
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,020
If you want,
I'll show you me fanny.

590
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,340
No. You're all right.

591
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:31,780
Get down!

592
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:53,460
Thanks, pet.

593
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,660
Shit!

594
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:34,540
Here they come!

595
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,060
Tony!

596
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,340
Tony, go back!

597
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:21,660
Go on. Get in there!
Off you go, mate!

598
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:39,340
Miss, I've got a problem
with the audition.

599
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,540
Hello?

600
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,580
Hello!

601
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:58,260
Listings for court four.
Tony Elliot, George Brunton.

602
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,340
Gary Cummings.
What's the time ?

603
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,220
Colin Woodward.
Ten past 10:00.

604
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:10,220
Oh, Billy!

605
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,940
Hello.

606
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:54,980
Can I help you ?

607
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,940
I was lookin' for--
They're out.

608
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,580
Sorry.

609
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,620
Billy.
Please, Miss.

610
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,660
Don't.

611
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,940
What's goin' on,
Billy ?

612
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,940
Who the fuck are you ?

613
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,660
I think we better
go inside.

614
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,180
I know this might be
difficult for you,

615
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:32,660
but today Billy missed
a very important audition.

616
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,420
Audition?

617
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,460
For the Royal Ballet School.

618
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:44,220
The Royal Ballet?

619
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,300
School. It's where
they teach the ballet.

620
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,540
You've got to be jokin'.

621
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:53,700
No, I'm perfectly serious.

622
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:02,180
Have you any idea
of what we're goin' through ?

623
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,100
I've been in
a fuckin' cell
all night,

624
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,460
and you come around here
talkin' shite!

625
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,740
And you!
Fuckin' ballet!

626
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:14,540
What are you trying to do,
make him a fuckin' skirt
for the rest of his life ?

627
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:18,060
Look at him!
He's only 11 , for fuck's sake!

628
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,580
- You've gotta start trainin'
from when you're young.
- Shut it!

629
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:25,540
I'm not havin' any brother
of mine running around like
a twat for your gratification.

630
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:29,820
Excuse me.
This is not for my gratification.

631
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,340
What good's it gonna do him ?
You're not takin' him away.

632
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,700
He's only a bairn. What about
givin' him a childhood ?

633
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,380
I don't want a childhood.
I want to be a ballet dancer.

634
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:40,980
What do you know about it ?
What qualifications
have you got ?

635
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:44,020
I haven't come here
to defend meself.

636
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:46,580
For all we know,
you could be some fuckin' nutter.

637
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,340
Get the fuckin' Social
on to you.

638
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:52,980
- You should calm
yourself down, son.
- You say he can dance.

639
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:56,460
Well, go on, then.

640
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,940
Let's see
this fuckin' dancin'.

641
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:02,740
- This is ridiculous.
- If you're a fuckin'
ballet dancer,

642
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:04,740
then let's be havin' you!

643
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,220
- Don't you dare!
- What sort of a teacher
are you, eh ?

644
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:11,460
He's got the chance to dance.
Now you're fuckin'
tellin' him not to.

645
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,100
Dance, you little twat!

646
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:19,540
No?
So piss off.

647
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,580
He's not doin' any more
fuckin' ballet,

648
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:25,220
and if you go near him again,
I'll smack you,
you middle-class cow!

649
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,740
You know nothing about me,
you sanctimonious little shit!

650
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:32,100
He won't grow up
to race whippets or grow leeks...

651
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:34,100
or piss his wages up the wall.

652
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:14,500
Billy! Billy!

653
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:34,260
Billy!
Billy, come on!

654
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,700
Hurry up.

655
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:52,020
Merry Christmas,
everybody!

656
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:58,980
Here we go, here we go
here we go

657
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:02,180
Here we go
here we go
here we go

658
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:05,260
Here we go
here we go
here we go

659
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,500
Here we go
Here we go

660
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:11,700
Here we go
here we go
here we go

661
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:15,020
Here we go, here we go
here we go

662
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,780
Do you think she'll mind ?

663
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,980
Shut up, boy.
She's dead.

664
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,700
Well,
merry Christmas,
everybody.

665
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:05,260
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

666
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,300
Merry
Christmas.

667
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:40,540
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

668
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,780
Oh, what fun--

669
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,100
Fuckin' great Christmas
this has been.

670
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:50,420
Go on.
Have some.
Where'd you get it ?

671
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,860
Me dad's got loads
in the kitchen.
Won't he notice ?

672
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:55,620
He never knows
how much is there.

673
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,820
Tastes like piss.

674
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,220
You get used to it.

675
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,260
Here.

676
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,460
Maybe you could
run away or something.

677
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,660
You know,
join a dancin' troupe.

678
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,020
Don't be
so stupid.

679
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,940
Well, maybe it's
all for the best.
What do you mean ?

680
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:16,540
You won't have to
go away or nothin'.

681
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:19,180
Me hands
are freezin'.

682
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:22,140
Give us'em here.

683
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:30,700
What are you doin' ?
Nothin'.

684
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,540
Just warmin'
your hands up.

685
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,860
You're not a poof
or aught ?

686
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:43,060
What gave you
that impression ?

687
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:47,380
Aren't your hands cold ?
I quite like it.

688
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,220
Just 'cause
I like ballet...

689
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,900
doesn't mean
I'm a poof, you know.

690
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,300
You-- You won't
tell anyone, will you ?

691
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:14,140
Come on.

692
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,220
It's fuckin' freezin'
in here.

693
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:33,020
Here.
What's this ?

694
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:36,460
Just put it on.
A tutu.

695
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,380
...and as he's walking
through the bush there,

696
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,460
George. George,
there's somebody
in the club.

697
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:48,140
this kangaroo,
he's walkin' away
over it, right ?

698
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:50,900
And he's called Norman.

699
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,180
And then round the corner
came this wallaby--

700
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,220
Plie, first.

701
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,380
What's a plie ?
It's French.

702
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:13,380
Why's it French ?
I don't know.

703
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:15,940
Second.
Like a princess.

704
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,300
Second, and down.

705
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,220
And first.
Carry on. Fifth.

706
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,740
Shoulders down,
long neck.

707
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:38,220
How do I look ?
Fuck off.
Shut up, you poof.

708
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:41,900
Second,
and down.

709
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,180
And first.

710
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,860
Fifth. Second.

711
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:51,980
Down.

712
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,780
First.
Fifth.

713
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,460
Jackie.

714
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,700
Jackie, man.
Here.

715
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,140
Give us your hand.

716
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,340
Dance!

717
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,980
Dad!

718
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,060
Go home, son.

719
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,500
It is a friend
of yours, then.

720
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:44,700
How much
is it gonna cost ?

721
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:47,500
And a happy Christmas
to you too.

722
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:52,180
Not as much
as you might think.
Maybe two grand.

723
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:55,180
But there's a good chance
the council's--
Two grand?

724
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,260
I was talkin'
about the auditions.

725
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:00,100
Look, if it's just
a matter of the trip
to London,

726
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:02,340
I'll give you
the money
for the fare.

727
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:04,700
I didn't come here
to be patronized.

728
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:08,580
Oh, no one's tryin'
to patronize you.
You're bein' ridiculous.

729
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,740
Am I ?
Yes!

730
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:17,140
Thanks for everything
you've done for Billy.

731
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,620
But he is my son,
isn't he ?

732
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,740
I'll handle this myself.

733
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:15,860
Hey, fellow.
Name. You.

734
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:17,940
Paul.
Surname.

735
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:20,740
Felton.
Felton.

736
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,820
Shorty. You.

737
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,140
What ? Thorpe.
Thorpe.

738
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,820
Smith.
Smith.
Glenton.

739
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,340
Glenton. Kerner.
Kerner.

740
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,460
Is that the lot, then ?

741
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:40,340
Fuckin' hell.
Never thought
I'd see you down here.

742
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,420
Things change, eh ?

743
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:45,780
Right,
you, name.

744
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:49,380
Jackie Elliot.

745
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:51,620
Well, glad to see
you've come
to your senses.

746
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:54,980
Who's a big man now, eh ?

747
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,220
Right. Okay, you lot.
Over here.

748
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:12,820
All aboard the sky lark.
Look lively.

749
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:19,980
Can't smoke on here, mate.
These are private buses.

750
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:30,900
Scab! Scab! Scab!
Scab! Scab! Scab!

751
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:36,340
Scab! Scab! Scab!
Scab! Scab! Scab!

752
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:00,220
Scab! Scab! Scab!
Fuckin' prats! Scab!

753
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:05,340
Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab!
Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab!

754
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:11,540
Scab! Scab! Scab!
Scab! Scab! Scab!
Scab! Scab--

755
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:22,860
Fuck off!

756
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:28,340
Dad! Dad!

757
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:59,340
Give us a hand.

758
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:21,060
Dad!

759
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,900
What the fuck
you doin' ?

760
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:33,900
Dad, you can't
go back! Not now!

761
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:36,620
Look at the state of us.
What we got to offer
the poor sod ?

762
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,620
You can't do this!
Not now!

763
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,980
Not after all this time!
Not after everything
we've been through!

764
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:44,660
It's for wee Billy!
He may be a fuckin' genius
for all we know!
Fuck!

765
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:47,220
For fuck's sake, Dad!
You can't do this!

766
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,260
Dad! Dad!

767
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:52,700
Tony!
He's only 11 ,
for fuck's sake!

768
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:56,300
He's a kid. He's just
a fuckin' little kid!

769
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:58,460
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

770
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:02,100
Please.
Please.

771
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:04,140
Please.

772
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,900
We're finished, son.

773
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:11,900
What choice
have we got, eh ?

774
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:15,620
Let's give the boy
a fuckin' chance!
Please.

775
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:18,700
Please, don't do this.
Dad, we'll find him
some money.

776
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:21,820
We'll find it
for him.

777
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:24,380
What the fuck
is he doin', Tony ?

778
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:26,980
It's okay.
He's gonna be okay.

779
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:29,060
Just get him
out of here, Tony.

780
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,340
Away. Leave it.
Go on.

781
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:34,260
Leave us.
Leave us.
Let's go home, Dad.

782
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:41,180
Dad's right,
you know.

783
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:46,140
Mam would've
let you.

784
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,940
All them 50 pences.

785
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:01,460
Here. It was a toss-up
between a new punch bag
or you.

786
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:03,660
It's not even enough
for the bed
and breakfast.

787
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,860
Forget about it.
You're dreamin'.
Look at youse.

788
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:08,900
Fuckin' scrabblin' round
for 50 pences.

789
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:11,020
You've got to do
better than that.
How ?

790
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,420
I'm gonna have
a raffle at the welfare.

791
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,860
And Im gonna organize
a concert.

792
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:17,860
Thanks, George.

793
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:24,300
Sheila's not got
that kind of money.

794
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:26,420
She can't even keep
her soup kitchen open.

795
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,420
George said we can have
another whip-round.

796
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,700
Billy, there's
no money left. Get that
through your head, man!

797
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:35,660
The lads
will always dip into
their buckets if we ask them.

798
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:38,500
George, you know
there's nothing left.

799
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,020
Stop putting ideas
in his head, man!

800
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,540
Come on, lads.
Dig deep for the miners.

801
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:23,300
Is that
absolutely necessary ?

802
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,380
Walk normal,
will ya ?

803
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:33,580
So what's it like,
like ?

804
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:38,660
What's what like ?

805
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:41,900
London.

806
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,660
I don't know, son.
I never made it
past Durham.

807
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,940
Have you
never been, like ?

808
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,940
Why would I want
to go to London ?

809
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,020
It's the capital city.

810
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:02,220
Well, there's no mines
in London.

811
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,300
Christ.

812
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:06,340
Is that all
you think about ?

813
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:36,780
Can I help you ?

814
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:39,340
Billy Elliot.
We've come for an audition.

815
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:42,580
Oh, you mean
William Elliot.

816
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,500
Yeah, William.

817
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,580
Can you
go upstairs, please ?

818
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:49,060
This way ?
Thanks.
Yes.

819
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:22,260
This your first time ?
Yeah.

820
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:24,420
I've been doing this
for two years now.

821
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:28,300
Hello.

822
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:30,380
Nerve-racking,
isn't it ?

823
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:34,100
Where are you from ?

824
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,700
Everington.
County Durham.

825
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:39,700
Durham ? Isn't there
an amazing cathedral ?

826
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:43,620
Don't know.
Never been.

827
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,100
Up on the box,
please.

828
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,860
All right,
bend over.
Right down.

829
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:58,100
And come up.
Come up.

830
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:00,180
Head down.

831
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:02,780
Tiny curvature here.
Head down!

832
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:05,500
How tiny ?
Might not be
a problem.

833
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:08,260
Come on.
Keep coming.

834
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,620
Relax. All right.
Jump up, William.

835
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,780
It's Billy.
Billy Elliot.

836
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:18,300
Two,

837
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,580
three and four.

838
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:25,100
Dad. Dad!

839
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:27,180
Dad,
for fuck's sake!

840
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:33,540
I changed me mind.
Get back in there!
Don't be so stupid!

841
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,380
And you are ?

842
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:54,260
Billy Elliot
from Everington.

843
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:57,420
l beg your pardon ?
Billy Elliot.

844
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,580
Ah, yes,
of course.

845
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:01,780
Come to the barre,
please, Billy.

846
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:13,300
Left arm
on the barre.
Feet first.

847
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:18,060
Arms second.

848
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:21,860
Demi-plie
and... hold.

849
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:53,580
Now, Billy,
we'd like to see you
move to some music.

850
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:55,580
Do you have
a piece prepared ?

851
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:23,220
Thank you.

852
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:36,660
You all right ?

853
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:39,340
What's the matter ?
It was a waste
of fuckin' time!

854
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:45,380
Don't be upset.
It's only
a stupid audition.

855
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:47,460
It's all right.
Fuck off!

856
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:54,620
There's always
next year.
Look. Fuck off,
will ya!

857
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:57,140
Oh--
You bent bastard!

858
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:04,940
What on earth's
going on here ?

859
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:14,020
How did it go ?

860
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:20,620
Shit!

861
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:24,820
Mr. Elliot, I'm afraid
that mutual respect...

862
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:29,820
and self-discipline
are absolute prerequisites
for any pupil in this school.

863
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:34,580
Such displays of violence
cannot be tolerated
under any circumstances.

864
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:36,700
Do you understand?

865
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:39,620
I realize we shall
have to consider this
very seriously...

866
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:43,620
and it will be
bound to affect
our final decision.

867
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,140
Yes, well,
just a few questions, then.

868
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:53,100
Billy, can you tell us...

869
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:56,180
why you first
became interested
in ballet ?

870
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:04,020
Don't know.

871
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:10,740
-Just was.
- Well, was there any...

872
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:13,740
particular aspect
of the ballet which...

873
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:16,020
caught your imagination ?

874
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:22,140
The dancin'.

875
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:25,900
He dances all the time.
Every night after school.

876
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:28,620
Yes. Well, we have
a very enthusiastic letter...

877
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:30,740
from Mrs. Wilkinson,

878
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:34,140
and, uh,
she has told us...

879
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:37,180
of your personal
circumstances.

880
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:41,620
Mr. Elliot, are you
a fan of the ballet ?

881
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:46,580
I wouldn't exactly say
I was an expert.

882
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:52,020
You do realize
that all pupils...

883
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,020
must attain
the highest standards,

884
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:58,180
not just in ballet
but in their ordinary
academic work.

885
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:03,060
No child can succeed
without the 100% support
of the family.

886
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:07,860
You are completely
behind Billy ?

887
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,860
Are you not ?

888
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:16,220
Yes.
Yes, of course.

889
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:21,100
Do you want to ask us
some questions ?

890
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,260
No, not--
Not really, no.

891
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:37,660
Well, in that case,

892
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:40,340
we shall let you know
in due course.

893
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:49,260
Just one last question.

894
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:52,900
Can l ask you, Billy,
what does it feel like...

895
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:55,420
when you're dancing ?

896
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:04,140
Don't know.

897
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:10,260
Sort of feels good.

898
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:16,620
It's sort of stiff and that,
but once I get goin',

899
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,980
then l, like,
forget everythin'.

900
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:22,700
And...

901
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,180
sort of disappear.

902
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:33,700
Sort of disappear.

903
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:35,860
Like I feel a change
in me whole body.

904
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,260
Like there's fire
in me body.

905
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:44,860
I'm just there, flyin'...

906
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,660
Like a bird.

907
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:52,740
Like electricity.

908
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:01,420
Yeah.

909
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:05,220
Like electricity.

910
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:09,260
Have a safe
journey home.

911
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:16,180
Mr. Elliot,

912
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:18,380
good luck
with the strike.

913
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:34,620
Toast!

914
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:37,220
I think you should
get yourself a trade, son.

915
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:42,500
Somethin' useful.

916
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,700
I could have been
a professional dancer.

917
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:55,220
What happened
to the dinosaurs, miss ?

918
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:58,020
They were crushed
as well,

919
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:03,020
and the pressure of all
of this caused the plants
and trees to change into coal.

920
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:05,140
Ow!
That's what must have
happened to her.

921
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:07,820
MichaeI Caffrey,
if you have got
something to say,

922
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:09,660
you can say it
to the class.

923
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:13,620
Sorry, miss.
So, gradually,

924
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:16,140
over hundreds
of thousands of years--

925
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:27,220
Post!

926
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:32,580
This is it.

927
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:36,780
Have you heard
anything yet ?
Not yet.

928
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:40,060
You'll have
no problem, man.
Fingers crossed, eh ?

929
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:38,220
I got in.

930
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:59,100
He did it!
He fuckin' did it!

931
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,940
Jackie,
have you not heard, man ?

932
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:07,180
We're goin' back.

933
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:10,220
Strike's over, Jackie.
The union caved in yesterday.

934
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:20,820
l think Im scared, Dad.

935
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:23,980
That's okay, son.
We're all scared.

936
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:30,700
If I don't like it,
can I still come back ?

937
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:37,220
You kiddin' ?

938
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:39,300
We've let out
your room.

939
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:57,020
Whoa!
Whoo!

940
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:15,540
...four, five, six,
seven, eight.

941
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:19,900
And one, two,
three, four,

942
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:23,540
five, six, seven--

943
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:26,060
Keep going,
girls!

944
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:29,060
Three, four, five--

945
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:40,900
Miss, I just came
to tell you.

946
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:43,820
It's all right, Billy.
I heard it from Debbie.

947
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:49,140
Look, it was just--

948
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:52,700
Well, you know,
after everything.

949
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:00,620
I'll miss you, Miss.
No, you won't.

950
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:03,380
I will. Honest.

951
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:07,060
This is when you go out
and find life...

952
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:09,100
and all
those other things.

953
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:14,580
The best of luck, Billy.

954
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:23,420
Right. Back to
the barre, girls.

955
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:26,420
And again.
Thank you.

956
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:30,700
One, two,
three, four--

957
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:33,740
Debbie, eyes front.
Seven and eight.

958
01:37:33,820 --> 01:37:37,300
And one, two,
three, four,

959
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:39,500
five, six, seven.

960
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:44,300
Was she there ?
Yeah.

961
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:46,300
You'll miss
the bus.
We're off.

962
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:48,380
I'll take it.

963
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:31,180
Give us the bag.
Okay, we're late.
We've no time for that.

964
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:35,340
I'll take it.

965
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:43,700
Good-bye, Billy.
See ya.

966
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:59,500
Oi, dancin' boy!

967
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:05,140
We'll miss the bus, Billy.
Will you stop being
an old fuckin' woman ?

968
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:22,980
See you, then.

969
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:30,620
- I'll miss you.
- What ? Can't hear you.

970
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:54,300
Dad. Come on, man.
We're gonna be late.

971
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:01,980
Dad!

972
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,580
Come on!

973
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:18,420
Show's just started.

974
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:23,260
Excuse me.

975
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:28,100
Can you tell Billy Elliot
that his family's here?

976
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:34,300
Sorry, mate.
It's all right,
Tony.

977
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:39,220
It's me, Michael. Remember?

978
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:50,420
It's Michael.

979
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:55,300
What the bloody hell
you doin' here?

980
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:57,460
I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

981
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:09,260
Standby, please.

982
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:39,300
Billy, your family
are here.
Thanks.
